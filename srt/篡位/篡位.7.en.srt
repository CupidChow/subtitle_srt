00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:53,846

Where's Hyewon?

18
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,582
Where is she?

19
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:09,546
We parted ways in the hotel parking lot.

20
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,302
The bride can't be here
on her wedding day.

21
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,262
[inhales sharply] In return...

22
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,683
This was waiting for you.

25
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,330
Say something.

26
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,500
You got nothing to say?

27
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,754
[chuckling softly]

28
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:57,594
You must have an excuse
for coveting your owner's girl.

29
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,516
I heard you and Inha
were friends at Hanguk University.

30
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,815
Inha was the ridiculous owner.

31
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:14,820
You were that ridiculous owner's dog.

32
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,822
A pup.

33
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,993
Why do you think I pretended not to know
even after I found out?

34
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,580
[chuckling]

35
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,043
Because I wanted something like this.

36
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,548
You pretended
not to be in on this together.

37
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,802
What was your ulterior motive
for getting involved with Kangoh?

38
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,638
[chuckles softly]

39
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,308
Did you just laugh?

40
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,606
I told you I always pay back
everything I receive.

41
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,150
Did you not hear?

42
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,693
You little punk...

43
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,653
Gold Trekking Tour in Southeast Asia.

44
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,156
And Nara Entertainment
is the investment company.

45
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,034
How's that? Do you get it now?

46
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,537
[scoffs softly] What's this nonsense?

47
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,540
Proof that you're the real owner
of Nara Entertainment.

48
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,462
Damn.

49
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,006
You're already surprised?

50
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,134
I'm just getting started.

51
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:21,720
What are you...

52
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:23,889
What are you up to?

53
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,559
I'm about to tell you what
Gold Trekking Tour's real business is.

54
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,605
Illicit funds obtained through
stock manipulation and accounting fraud.

55
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,107
You used your slush fund

56
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,278
towards a huge futures trading and failed.

57
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,198
After losing your investment,

58
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,993
you tried to fill the loss
with an Indonesian bauxite mine,

59
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,828
but you failed.

60
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,206
This is embezzlement.

61
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,832
Well...

62
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,294
You were pushed to the edge
with a ticking time bomb.

63
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,420
You were desperate.

64
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,549
I get that.

65
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,426
You get it?

66
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,679
Gold Trekking Tour's a distribution line.

67
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,266
A market called Chrom.

68
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,978
Aren't these conditions enough
to become a drug lord?

69
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,939
Perfect conditions to make bad decisions.

70
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,816
Was that it?

71
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,860
The real card up your sleeve?

72
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,945
My secret and your secret.

73
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,156
Which one will make the chairman angrier?

74
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,246
Choose.

75
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:34,835
Will you die
or survive and enjoy what you have?

76
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,382
His name's Mo Gijun.

77
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,635
He's the team leader of Security Team 3
in Kangoh Security.

78
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,182
But the thing is...

79
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,518
His position in Kangoh Security
only exists on paper.

80
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,354
In reality,
he works as Kang Inju's secretary.

81
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,690
So CEO Kang Inju was behind this.

82
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,900
Is that it?

83
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,027
How could I dare?

84
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,281
But I don't think a mere secretary
would act independently...

85
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,367
You didn't see or hear anything.

86
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,286
Since you didn't see or hear anything,

87
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,497
there's no need to run your mouth.

88
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,042
Yes, sir.

89
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,355
[chuckling]

90
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,734
Damn it!

91
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,528
[laughs]

92
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:45,906
Taeoh.

93
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,199
Han Taeoh!

94
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,787
No matter what you do,
I'm Kang Inju, the eldest of Kangoh Group!

95
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,622
What about you?

96
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,709
You're just Han Taeoh.
You're nothing but a dog.

97
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,671
Han Taeoh.

98
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,715
Ah.

99
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,718
There's one more person who's nothing.

100
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,762
Na Hyewon.

101
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,187
Damn.

102
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,193
You want me to make my move?

103
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,238
Do you want to see

104
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,448
how I'll bury your girl alive?

105
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,428
[chuckles softly]

106
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,347
Get on your knees.

107
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:54,892
Can't you hear me?

108
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,060
Get on your knees.

109
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,687
Is that all you wanted?

110
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,439
No way.

111
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,483
How much could your knees be worth?

112
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,906
From now on, you come when I call,

113
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,700
go where I want, and crawl when I say.

114
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,327
Got it?

115
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,122
[chuckles softly]

116
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,127
Choose.

117
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,381
Will you kill your girl

118
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,218
or survive

119
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,970
and make that dream come true?

120
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,743
[scoffing]

121
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,912
Wow!

Hey, you...

124
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,584
You must love her!

125
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,169
Hey, Taeoh!

126
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:05,838
Hey, Han Taeoh!

127
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,091
You're a real man!

128
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:12,511
Hey! I'm so impressed!

129
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,098
Hey! Bring some alcohol!

Hey! Hey...

133
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:06,607
Hey!

134
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,909
[Inju] Taeoh.

135
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,204
Do you want one?

136
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,496
Shall we go to paradise?

137
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,708

Wait at home.

I'll call you after I find out
what happened.

173
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,245
It's not true, right?

It's a misunderstanding, right?

00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,156
Now, shall we get started?

188
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,574
[laptop whirring]

189
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,910
[clicking]

190
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,995

- [Inha sighs]

191
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,547
[door opens and closes]

192
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:48,967
[Joongmo]<i> You must focus now.</i>

193
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,720
Kangoh has no official stance.

194
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:57,100
Block all media coverage
as quietly as possible.

195
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,645
Make sure this doesn't become
your last chance from me.

196
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:07,194
[officer] What time
did you leave the club?

197
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,362
I don't remember.

198
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:11,114
I asked you when you arrived at the hotel
a few times,

199
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,658
and you still don't remember.

200
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:14,952
No.

201
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,245
Look here, Mr. Han.

202
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,747
Your lack of memory won't solve this.

203
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,667
You're a suspect
in the murder of two people.

204
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,002
Are you sure I did it?

205
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:27,506
Only three people used
the private elevator for the Royal Suite

206
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,093
before and after the incident.
You and the two deceased.

207
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:33,178
Before and after the incident,

208
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,223
only three people entered
the Royal Suite room?

209
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,226
You were caught at the scene.

210
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:44,356
Signature Hotel's Royal Suite room can
only be used by Kangoh's owner and family.

211
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,024
To protect the owner's privacy,

212
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,944
there are no cameras in the elevator
or outside the door.

213
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,404
- That means...
- It's unfair?

214
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:53,782
Then try to remember.

215
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,326
- [knock on door]
- [door opens]

216
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:58,912

[officer sighs]

221
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,179
You had one hell of a party.

222
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,306
There were traces of snow in your blood.

223
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,141
Cocaine.

224
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,270

[Inju chuckles softly]

227
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:32,988
Drink it.

228
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:35,032
Did you forget already?

229
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,784
You have to make
your girl's dream come true.

230
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,661
Right? [laughing]

231
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:40,746
[woman chuckles]

232
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,128
- Wow!
- [woman laughing]

233
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,924
Taeoh! You're such a romanticist!

234
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:56,178
You're such a man! I love it! [laughs]

235
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,681
<i>Bona, isn't he great?</i>

236
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:00,849
Isn't it strange?

237
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,935
[Inju laughing]

238
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,774
Everything after that is just gone.

239
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,692
You're saying I killed someone,

240
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,737
but I don't remember anything
from that moment.

241
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,539
[officer] Even methamphetamine.

242
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,461
Of course, you don't remember.
You were high.

243
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:32,673
You took the drugs to claim
diminished mental capacity

244
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,175
due to drugs.

245
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,262
Don't worry.

246
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:41,515
We'll find your memory.
You just need to confess.

247
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,394
Now, shall we start over?

248
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:48,272

<i>The police in charge of the case

267
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:59,343

Yes, Father.

271
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:27,996
I was clear.

272
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,791
I told you to block media coverage.

00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,167
[Inha]<i> I'm sorry.</i>

274
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,503
<i>It was entirely unexpected.</i>

275
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,463
I...

276
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,550
should've been more attentive.

277
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,135
- I'll call the broadcasting...
- [Joongmo]<i> No.</i>

278
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:45,514
Will you say he never committed
embezzlement and to issue a correction?

279
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,850
Why? To argue? Wake up!

280
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,810
Don't you know what's happening?

281
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:50,894
Or did you lack...

282
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:54,356
any sense at all from the start?

283
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,484
[sighs] I'm sorry.

<i>When will you stop being sorry?</i>

286
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:04,950
Wait.

287
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:08,036
Do you think this ridiculous tip

288
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,373
came from the inside?

289
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:17,087
<i>If it happened
because of someone's foolish judgement,</i>

290
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,547
<i>then that someone...</i>

00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,217
<i>will have to pay the ultimate price.</i>

292
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:28,390
I like things done neatly.

293
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:31,852
I hope that someone knows
that he should clean up

294
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:36,607
after his mistakes
since he committed them.

295
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,691

[in Italian] You asked me to make it,
so I did. Are you really running away?

303
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:34,957
Run away?

304
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,626
I'm just avoiding it just in case

305
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:40,754
I get roped into it. It's a precaution.

306
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,967
That's what you call running away.

307
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,637
I'm not running away!

I saw the news.

312
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,838
It's not true.

313
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:27,634
- [exhales softly] Shall I cook something?
- Was it the chairman's decision?

314
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,681
You should've chosen another way.

315
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:35,767
Even if it's best for the company,
you should've stopped it!

316
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:37,936
Why should I?

317
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:41,565
- What?
- Han Taeoh killed Kang Inju.

318
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:45,110
I don't feel that affectionate towards
my brothers or family,

319
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,446
but he was my brother and family.

320
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,948
Are you asking me to take Taeoh's side?

321
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,576
Are you sure he's the murderer?

322
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:55,245
You said you don't believe it.

323
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:56,830
- He wouldn't do that!
- Wake up.

324
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:59,082
Snap out of it and listen to me.

325
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,084
You and I...

326
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,588
are part of the Kang family now.

No matter what happens,

329
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:11,970
it means Kangoh must always come first.

330
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,600
Are you the same Inha I knew?

331
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,103
You're so unfamiliar.

332
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,189
The truth is always unfamiliar.

333
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:26,485
From this moment on,
any traces you may have of Taeoh

334
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,111
need to be erased.

335
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,113
What do you mean by that?

336
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:31,281
[Inha sighs]

337
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,535
I'm saying it for you.

Don't make me angry.

342
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,381
Come out.

SEOUL EASTERN DISTRICT COURT

344
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,983
[Gijun] We left the club around 2:00 a.m.
and it took about 15 minutes.

345
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:34,530
I arrived at the EF Tower parking lot
and they got out.

346
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:37,824
The three of them entered
the basement entrance of the hotel.

347
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:39,076
I checked that myself.

348
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:44,206
A water company truck was blocking
the entrance.

349
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:47,000
So I parked a bit far away
from the entrance.

350
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:52,089
Mr. Kang said there was no need to get out
and told me to leave.

351
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,715
So I stayed in the car.

352
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:56,134
But you didn't leave right away.

353
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:58,512
Yes, everyone was very drunk.

354
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:00,973
I made sure they got inside.

355
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:03,100
I figured I should wait until then.

356
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:08,146
[prosecutor] Whose idea was it to have
another party at the hotel?

357
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,610
It was Mr. Han Taeoh.

358
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:22,202
He seemed to be in a very good mood
that night.

359
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,038
He has been to Chrom before,

360
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:26,623
but I've never...

361
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:29,126
seen him like that.

362
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:32,838
[prosecutor] Has the defendant ever had

363
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,632
an argument
with the late Kang Inju before?

364
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:41,305
No, not that I recall.

365
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:46,894
He has said something strange before.

366
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:49,188
[prosecutor] Something strange?

367
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:51,356
Yes.

368
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:53,483
Well...

369
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:58,238
[Taeoh]<i> Go and let Kang Inju know.</i>

370
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:01,950
Tell him I won't forget his warning.

371
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,952
I...

372
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:07,456
always repay what's owed.

373
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,210
[people murmuring indistinctly]

374
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:21,345
- [gavel banging]
- [judge] Silence in the court! Silence!

375
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:45,118
[knocking]

376
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:06,682
[door closes]

377
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:24,867
If you're going to apologize, don't.

378
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,496
"I'm sorry. I was wrong."
I didn't come to hear that.

379
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:33,750
[breath trembling]

380
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,295
[inhales sharply] You ruined everything.

381
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:39,089
Our plan. Our dream.

382
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:44,178
I'll do everything I can
to restore everything you ruined.

383
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,346
Even if you ruined everything,

384
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,766
I came to tell you
my position hasn't changed.

385
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:52,561
Because as always...

386
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:57,024
you'll be more worried about me than you.

387
00:30:58,609 --> 00:30:59,651
What if...

388
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:03,822
- I'm innocent?
- Do you think you are?

389
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,326
Or is that what you want to believe?

390
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:11,038
I don't know.

391
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:14,458
Regardless of what the truth is...

392
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:18,003
I have no right to ask you...

393
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:23,008
for forgiveness while I'm here.

394
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:24,301
[Inha] You don't.

395
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:25,886
You have no right.

396
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:30,140
So spend your remaining time blaming
and cursing yourself for it.

397
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:33,477
This is the farewell I prepared.

398
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:36,021
I hope you liked it.

399
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:43,987
[door opens and closes]

400
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:52,829
[Taeoh] <i>He didn't ask me.</i>

401
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:58,418
<i>He didn't ask me anything.</i>

402
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:02,005
<i>He didn't ask me why I did it.</i>

403
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,758
<i>He didn't ask me anything.</i>

404
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:31,827
Traces of narcotics were found
in the defendant's blood.

405
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:36,248
Were you aware of or did you witness
any drug use that night?

406
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:38,667
No, I had no idea.

407
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,338
When Mr. Kang goes to the club,
I have to prepare a lot of things.

408
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:47,467
I have to restrict access
to the VIP zone on the second floor.

409
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,053
There are a lot of people
who want to join the party.

410
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:51,305
More than you'd think.

411
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:53,473
So, are you saying the defendant's claims

412
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:57,936
of being forced to do drugs
under pressure of the late Kang Inju

413
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,438
could also be false?

414
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:00,582
[defense lawyer] Objection.

415
00:33:00,606 --> 00:33:03,233
He's leading the witness
based on speculation.

416
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:06,111
Sustained.

417
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,285
Then I'll change the question.

418
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:17,456
Is the defendant a habitual drug user?

419
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:20,500
[Gijun] I don't know.

420
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:24,379
We're not close enough
for me to know that about him.

421
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:37,017
[Joongmo]<i> Mo Gijun is the witness again?</i>

422
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:40,729
He saw and heard a lot of things
since he's close to Mr. Kang.

423
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:43,440
Shall I find out more about him?

424
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:47,110
I'm sorry.

425
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:49,029
- I shouldn't have...
- Do it.

426
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:50,656
Excuse me?

427
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:56,620
He tried to kill Han Taeoh
and now has accused Han Taeoh of murder.

428
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:59,706
A nobody involved in both cases?

429
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:05,045
I need to know
why Inju tried to kill Taeoh.

430
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:07,089
Why Taeoh...

431
00:34:10,843 --> 00:34:13,220
killed my son.
I must know the real reason.

432
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:15,848
Mo Gijun's the key.

433
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:20,185
Find out everything you can about him.

434
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:24,022
See if he has something.

435
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:26,400
And if he does, find out what it is.

436
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:28,777
Yes, sir.

437
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,864
[inmate grunts softly]

Inmate 423, move it!

442
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:21,246
Move!

443
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:32,883
[Taeoh breathing heavily]

444
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:43,894
<i>What is this?</i>

445
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:46,355
[breathing heavily]

446
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:52,528
[guard] Keep the space!

447
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:02,454
Inmate 423, get up!

448
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,831
Inmate 423!

449
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:09,127
Wake up!

450
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:11,088
Get up! Damn it!

451
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,387
[Taeoh]<i> There was one more person.</i>

452
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,763
[whistle blows]

453
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:20,931
[guard] To the infirmary!

454
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:22,254
- [man] Yes, sir!
- [guard] Hurry!

455
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:23,308
[Taeoh] <i>There was...</i>

456
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:25,769

[doctor] Are you up?

460
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:34,922
[door closes]

461
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,222
Will starving yourself
prove your innocence?

462
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:45,766
I'll give you vitamins.

463
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:49,228
You'll need to get regular fluids
for a while.

464
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:52,272
You can rest before you go.

465
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:54,900
It's fine. I'm okay.

466
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:58,654
Sure, okay.

[doctor] Mr. Han Taeoh.

470
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:29,768
You have to survive to have hope.

471
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:39,570
Can I ask you a favor?

472
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:47,953
[doctor] Don't be surprised.

473
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,956
You killed Kang Inju for me.

474
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:54,960
I can do this much for you.
That's what I think.

475
00:38:56,169 --> 00:38:58,005
The guard will be here for you soon.

476
00:38:58,589 --> 00:38:59,923
You don't have much time.

Did you really...

kill Kang Inju?

489
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:47,322
I'm going to find out.

490
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:49,908
If I really...

491
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,537
killed Kang Inju...

492
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:55,873
or not.

493
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:03,672
How can I help?

That's a good boy.

Hand.

504
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,738
It'll just be a huge headache

HANEUL BANK

But nothing in life is free.

508
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,163
That applies even harder here.

509
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:21,166
The price for my silence.

It's within a limit

No.

I haven't said anything yet.

532
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,876
I know. I don't want to do it even though
you didn't say anything.

Do you have anything to do

No.

He told me to tell you this
if you continue to refuse.

00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:10,127
The Han Taeoh I know wouldn't
speak empty threats.

545
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,545
No matter what,

546
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:13,797
he'll do what he says.

547
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:15,424
So go meet him?

548
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:17,217
He said he needed you.

549
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,887
He asked for your help.

550
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,013
[Wan scoffs softly]

551
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,932
[in Italian] Bullshit.

552
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:26,059
A favor?

553
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,103
My ass.

554
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:30,856
One more thing.
Don't use a regular meeting room.

555
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:33,400
All conversations are recorded there.

556
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:35,861
[in Korean] What am I supposed to do?

557
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:44,828
Sorry about that.

558
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:53,795
CHAIRMAN KANG'S HOSTILE PARTIES
PARK SAJIN

559
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:55,797
I will start the report on Park Sajin,

560
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:58,133
who's the central force
opposing the chairman.

561
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,970
So this is what Mr. Han Taeoh did.

562
00:46:02,054 --> 00:46:04,014
[man] This is who
Mr. Park met with recently.

563
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,808
Those two met and spoke.

564
00:46:06,892 --> 00:46:08,644
Do you know what they talked about?

565
00:46:09,102 --> 00:46:12,105
From what I could tell,
they were looking for a restaurant.

566
00:46:12,189 --> 00:46:13,607
A restaurant?

567
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:17,194
All of their meeting places
were at famous restaurants.

568
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:20,155
But these days,

569
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:23,033
one more person
has been attending their meetings.

570
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:30,582
[Inha] Chae Donguk.

571
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:34,419
He's the type to cut ties
as soon as there's nothing to gain.

572
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:38,549
Which means, he has a lot to gain

573
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:42,135
from Park Sajin and Im Jongyong right now.

574
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:45,222
Let's focus on those two.

575
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:47,641
Start with the basics.

576
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:50,602
- Track their accounts.
- [man] Yes, sir.

577
00:47:04,449 --> 00:47:08,579
FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE KANG INHA

578
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,584
[Hyewon]<i> I did what you said.</i>

579
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,628
<i>What will you do now?</i>

580
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:19,798
I need to keep going.

581
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:21,675
Once I go...

582
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:24,303
I'm sure I'll see a path.

583
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:27,097
I know you didn't do it.

584
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:30,559
That isn't like you.

585
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:42,738
Your time's up.

586
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:46,742
I have to go.

587
00:48:11,183 --> 00:48:13,310
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

588
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:17,898
You must be tired. Shower and rest.

589
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:25,906
[Inha sighs softly]

590
00:48:28,033 --> 00:48:29,952
Let's stay like this for five minutes.

591
00:48:30,953 --> 00:48:34,790
We haven't seen each other in a while.
You feel uncomfortable around me.

592
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:36,542
That's not true.

593
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:38,877
Even if it were, I won't be angry.

594
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:41,004
I get it.

595
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:44,174
[sighs]

596
00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:46,176
I'm exhausted. I'm so tired.

597
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:49,721
Comfort me.

598
00:48:50,722 --> 00:48:52,808
I need your comfort the most right now.

599
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:57,521
[sighs]

600
00:48:59,314 --> 00:49:01,984
I love you, Hyewon.

601
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:17,749
[Hyewon]<i> I know you didn't do it.</i>

602
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,294
<i>That isn't like you.</i>

603
00:49:39,479 --> 00:49:42,357

[keys jangling]

605
00:49:58,415 --> 00:49:59,416
Inmate 423.

606
00:50:01,585 --> 00:50:03,253
Your lawyer is here.

607
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,381
Go ahead.

608
00:50:16,517 --> 00:50:18,143
Why are you so surprised?

609
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:22,773
Is this your first time seeing
South Korean Attorney Ko Jeongwoo?

610
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:36,245
I took difficult steps in coming here.

611
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:39,915
I don't expect you to be overjoyed
or touched,

612
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:41,833
but shouldn't you at least thank me?

613
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:43,669
I had to threaten you to come.

614
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:44,795
Wow.

615
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:48,090
Is that how you greet me?

616
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:51,927
In any case, never call me again.

617
00:50:52,553 --> 00:50:54,972
Don't send anyone to me.

618
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:56,181
One more thing,

619
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:57,891
especially not her.

620
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,104
I get you were urgent,
but how could you think of sending her?

621
00:51:03,647 --> 00:51:07,192
Before she's your friend,

622
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:09,695
she's part of Kangoh's family now,
isn't she?

623
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,281
Anyway...

624
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:15,784
let's not see each other again.

625
00:51:16,451 --> 00:51:17,494
Would that be okay?

626
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:21,039
My threats aren't over yet.

627
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:28,964
Are you going to kill me?

628
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:32,176
Sit down.

629
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:45,939
What do you want to know?

630
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:48,150
Mo Gijun.

631
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:52,279
Other than myself,
he's the last person to see them.

632
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:54,865
He's the starting point.

633
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:59,661
I need to know what really happened
that night.

634
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,706
The starting point of the truth.

635
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,541
- [sighs softly]
- [Taeoh] Hurry.

636
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,044
I don't have much time.

637
00:52:13,884 --> 00:52:15,010
The visitation's over.

638
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:18,805
- [scoffs softly]
- [door closes]

639
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:20,933

[Inha] Yes.

COURT IN SESSION

650
00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:19,510
[judge] We have reached a verdict.

651
00:54:20,511 --> 00:54:27,142
In case number 2023-1013,
the court finds the defendant, Han Taeoh,

652
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:30,270
guilty and sentences him
to capital punishment.

653
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,402
[people speaking indistinctly]

654
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:44,159
I didn't do it.

655
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:49,706
It wasn't me!

656
