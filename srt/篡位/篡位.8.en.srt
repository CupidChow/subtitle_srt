You're such a man! I love it!

17
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,769
There's a villa employee
named Bae Yeongeun.

18
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,771
She died in a hit-and-run 22 years ago.

19
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,815
She was Mo Gijun's mother.

20
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,193
Was he living under my shadow?

21
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,362
- Mo Gijun?
- He went to school with Kang Inha.

22
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,949
As an adult, he joined
the company with Kang Inju's help

23
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,744
and become his attending secretary.
He got lucky.

24
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,705
I'm sure a hefty price followed that luck.

25
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,082
Like doing everything Inju asked.

26
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,500
Like Director Han...

27
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,837
I mean, Han Taeoh's assault?

28
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,590
What do you think?

29
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,050
Excuse me?

30
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:41,095
[Joongmo] Do you think a person can kill
to get revenge for being assaulted?

31
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,557
Tell me what you know.
What type of person is Taeoh?

32
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,646
If he chose revenge,

33
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,815
he would've made him a complete loser
instead of killing him,

34
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,859
so he could never rise again.

35
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,156
Something doesn't feel right.

36
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,075
There's something there.

37
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,956
Find out what the hidden truth is.
Do it as quickly as possible.

38
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,624
Yes, sir.

39
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:18,049

00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,786
[Wan] Mo Gijun's mom
was an employee of the villa.

49
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,580
His mom died in an accident.

50
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,750
- She died?
- It was a hit-and-run.

51
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,504
It happened
when Mo Gijun was 10 years old.

52
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,297
If he was 10...

53
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,176
It's when he moved into Kang Inha's villa.

54
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,764
After he graduated middle school
and before he came to Seoul,

55
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,268
he and Kang Inha spent seven years
living in that place.

I had my doubts,

00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,368
but I was right.

60
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,538
This means he used another burner phone...

61
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,874
Shall I try to track it?

62
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,254

It's my reward to you.

actually trust Kang Inha?

00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,160
If you have even the slightest bit
of trust left in him,

82
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,245
I'd get rid of it.

83

Erase it completely.

Boss, he's a red tag.

Since when did a red tag denote rank?

as variables.

With premeditated or intentional murder,

162
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,391
there is no better excuse
than alcohol and drugs.

163
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:56,896
In the second trial,
Han Taeoh might not get the death sentence

164
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,106
because he was mentally unstable?

165
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,357
Yes.

166
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,651
The chances of that are more than 80%.

I wish he gets the death sentence.

170
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,287
With your abilities and connections
as Kangoh's attorney,

171
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,705
wouldn't that be possible?

Why are you doing this?

00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:56,974
Stop it!

00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,434
Don't!

180
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,768
I said no!

181
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:04,982
No?

182
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,280
How dare you say no?

183
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,831
[Hyewon gasps]

184
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,458
[grunts softly]

185
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,252
[coughing]

186
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,173
Do you know why I chose you?

187
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,257
[grunts softly]

188
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,341
[coughs]

189
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,260
Because Taeoh wanted you.

190
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,682
When a dog starts to desire something,
they want to become human.

191
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,061
A dog should eat what it's given
and bark when told to.

192
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,521
They can't desire to become human.

193
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,232
That's why I chose you.

194
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:52,112
I want him to know that he can desire
all he wants, but he'll never have it.

195
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,950
I'm going to leash Han Taeoh where he is
to teach him not to covet...

196
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,621
his owner's seat.

197
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,958
Do you get it now?
Do you know your purpose?

198
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,336
So wake up.

199
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,548
You'll die if you don't.

200
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,136
[exhales]

201
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,265
[Hyewon breathing heavily]

202
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,563
Are you scared?

203
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,607
Don't be scared.

204
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,403
There won't be any problems
as long as you don't forget who you are.

205
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,471
[exhales sharply]

206
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,607

207
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,456
[car unlocks]

208
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,400
[guard] Inmate 3866!

209
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,569
You have a visitor.

210
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,396
How are you?

211
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,905
What a stupid question.
I already know how you're doing.

212
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,368
It's not as bad as you think.

213
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,287
How are you?

214
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,874
I'm enjoying the unemployed life
I never planned for.

215
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,171
Sometimes I think I should've accepted
the offer to go to work for fun.

216
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,466
I regret it without regretting it.

217
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,095
I'm sure it wasn't easy to get here.

218
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:09,518
I'm sorry.
You're going through this because of me...

219
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,478
Are you worried about me right now?

220
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,981
You're in no position
to worry about others.

221
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,858
[chuckles softly] You're right.

222
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,279
I should worry about myself.

223
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,491
I'll take care of myself.

224
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,785
I know.

225
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,707
I know who Na Hyewon is
and what she's capable of.

226
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,045
How's Inha?

227
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,922
How is he?

228
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:43,719
He's probably carrying out your plans
as well as he can.

229
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,972
Kang Inha, the owner of Kangoh...

230
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,268
He's running towards that goal.

231
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,855
- Why do you sound so distant?
- Do I?

232
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,984
Inha's fine.

233
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,528
He's doing your part too.

234
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,490
Good.

235
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,534
You should start...

236
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,872
working on what you really wanted.

237
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,291
What I really wanted?

238
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,876
Go to Chairman Kang.

239
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,838
Be confident, and tell him
that you want to work at the foundation.

240
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:24,593
If the center is Kangoh's future,
the slush fund factory art foundation

241
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,595
is Kangoh's present.

242
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:31,558
- There's no future without a present.
- If I get the present, what about you?

243
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,810
What do you get?

244
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,482
What I want right now...

245
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,862
isn't Kangoh.

246
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:49,701
I knew it. Laundry should be done
in a washing machine.

247
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,913
I'm trying to get something.

248
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:56,917
Who do I ask?

249
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,752
I don't really know.

250
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,087
Find out.

251
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,880
I'll pay you well.

252
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,592
[inmate stutters]

253
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,394
[elevator dings]

254
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,239
Jang Geumseok is absent.
You won't get another chance.

255
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,534
Make this your opportunity.

256
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,412
<i>The art foundation up until now</i>

257
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,873
<i>was a place for Director Jang</i>
<i>to make and handle her slush funds.</i>

258
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,750
Starting now, the art foundation

259
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:43,880
will be Chairman Kang Joongmo's place
to make and handle slush funds.

260
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,383
- If this offends you--
- [Joongmo] You remind me of him.

261
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,802
This is what I felt when I first met him.

262
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,889
It felt like he was trying to aggravate me
on purpose.

263
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:57,185
How dare you try to test me?

264
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,690
I can kick you out of my house right now.

265
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,233
Is that a warning?

266
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,401
What if it is?

267
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,863
It sounds to me that you think I'm useful.

268
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,824
- What?
- Instead of kicking me out,

269
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,826
you chose to warn me first.

270
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,417
Tell me what you want.

271
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,545
- [exclaims]
- [inmates cheer]

272
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,630
[laughs]

273
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,260
Goodness. [sighs]

274
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,599
Ah. Don't think.

275
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,809
You'll get hurt
if you think too much here.

276
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,563
- It's none of your business.
- Stop acting all tough.

277
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,025
You'll find out sooner or later
it's better not to think too much.

278
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,279
- You're looking for the prison leader?
- I don't need the leader.

279
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,740
I'm just looking to get something.

280
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,075
Only the prison leader can do that here.

281
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,161
Then tell me who it is, and get lost.

282
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,662
You little...

283
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,664
You rude punk...

284
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,503
Boy, stop messing around.
Just tell me what you need.

285
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,594
It's me! Get it?

286
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,137
It's not you.

287
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,556
Forget it.

288
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,728
I need a phone. As quickly as possible.

289

I'm going to rip his tongue
out of his cheeky mouth...

292
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,697
Okay, we're going!

293
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,548
[Mr. Tak] Here.

294
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,979
It'll be three big ones.

295
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,858
It's done on the outside,
so it's expensive.

296
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,152
But they get the job done.

297
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,278
[phone flips shut]

298
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,243
[Mr. Tak] You can deposit the money here.

299
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,912
Until then, they're not yours.

300
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,751
I'll give you four.

301
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:13,089
But only after I check
and make sure they can make calls.

302
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,216
[chuckling quietly]

303
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,720
One more thing.

304
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,890
Charger included.

305

[sighs] That smart little bastard.

306
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,028
Besides the fact that he's a murderer,
he's useful in every way.

307
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,156
Close it.

- [man] As of now.
- How's Park Sajin's daughter doing lately?

312
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,796
Has the drug problem persisted
since she left Kangoh Hospital?

313
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,006
It seems like she's trying to recover.

314
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,217
She's currently working
at Seongdong Penitentiary.

315

00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,521
<i>are different.</i>

358
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,107
<i>The person driving that night</i>

359
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,985
<i>wasn't Mo Gijun.</i>

360
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,306
Help me.

361
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:25,938
[Wan sighs]

362
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,657
[in Italian] I thought you forgot
about running away.

363
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,743
[in Italian] Shut up and just go.

364
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:45,374
It's best to have fun with girls
when you have idle thoughts.

365
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,212
Come to the club later.

366
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,465
[chuckles softly]

367
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,057
- [cell phone vibrating]
- [door opens]

368
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,311
- [shop bell ringing]
- [door closes]

369
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,360
[cell phone vibrating]

370
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,492
Hello?

371
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,743
That night...

372
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,996
Mo Gijun wasn't the one
who drove us to the hotel.

373
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,790
[in Korean] Mr. Han?

374
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,459
Find out who drove us to the hotel.

375
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,670
[Wan] <i>What's this? Did you remember?</i>

376
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,214
Mo Gijun didn't drive that night.
I'm sure of it.

377
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,717
If your memory is right...

378
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,970
Mo Gijun killed Kang Inju and Shin Bona.

379
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,097
The evidence
is the driver from that night.

380
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,599
So do whatever you can to find him.

381
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,520
[phone flips shut]

382
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,298
[Inha sighs softly]

383
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,930
We have to go to dinner. Father's orders.

384
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,059
You have to be ordered...

385
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,688
to have dinner with your family?

386
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,814
Don't mock me.

387
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,902
- It's always been like this.
- I'm not mocking you.

388
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,531
It's just sad for some reason.

389
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,413
Let's talk.

390
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,420
I have nothing to say.

391
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,594
Divorce isn't an option.

392
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,720
Divorce?

393
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,097
I'm not doing that.

394
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,779
[sighs]

395
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,334
[car unlocks]

396
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,840
That's just my luck. Is that bird crap?

397
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,553
[grunts]

398
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,806
[exhales on mirror]

399
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,900
Hi, Honggyu.

400
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,235
Who are you?

401
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,239
- [cheerful music playing]
- How would I know who's close with Mr. Mo?

402
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:06,492
I heard you were the captain of MDs.

403
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,037
Captain? Come on.

404
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,539
I was just a little popular.

405
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,876
That got screwed up when Chrom went down.

406
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,839
Anyway, what's up?

407
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,007
Are you a cop?

408
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,302
- Why would a cop want to see me?
- I'm not a cop.

409
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,263
[in English] Okay!

410
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,684
[in Korean] Anyway, I don't know anything.

411
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,478
I don't know. Even if I did, I don't know.

412
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,025
I don't want to get involved.

413
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,777
What can I tell you?
You're already involved.

414
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,412
[Honggyu chuckles softly]

415
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,457
Honggyu.

416
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,585
Is your brain working now?

417
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,212
Who was helping Mo Gijun at the club?

418
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,801
24 HOUR SEVEN AROMA

419
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,137
[Honggyu sighs] <i>Have you heard of Roy?</i>

420
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,181
<i>Anyway,</i>

421
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:15,061
<i>he's a kid that got caught</i>
<i>selling fake meth, and Mr. Mo saved him.</i>

422
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,316
<i>I think Mr. Mo paid them off</i>
<i>because he didn't want to ruin the club.</i>

423
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,487
<i>But Roy's been completely loyal</i>
<i>ever since.</i>

424
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,654
[tires screech]

425
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,038
[in English] All right,
let's catch this shithead!

426
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,294
Welcome.

427
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,962
Hey! Who are you?

428
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,422
- Hey!
- Who the hell are you?

429
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,257
- Piss off!
- [groans]

430
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,223
- What's this?
- Who are you?

431
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,893
Hey, who are you? Hey!

432
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:56,977
What's going on? No!

433
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,062
What's going on?

434
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,565
- What is this?
- [whispers indistinctly]

435
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,195
- Hey.
- [goon 1 in English] Hey, hey, hey!

436
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,155
[man 1] Who the hell are you?

437
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,242
- [goon 2 exclaims]
- [man 2] What the hell?

438
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,035
[Roy] Damn it!

439
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,204
[goon 3] Go, go, go!

440
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,426
[grunts]

441
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,725
[in English] Go around.

442
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,811
[goon 3] Stop, you bastard!

443
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,669
Where is he? Where?

444
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,337
- Let's go there.
- [in English] Find him!

445
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,885
[breathing heavily]

446
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,373
[sighing]

447
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,094
MO GIJUN

448
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,180
- [line ringing]
- [breathing heavily]

449
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,730
[cell phone vibrating]

450
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,653
FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE
DIVISION DIRECTOR KANG INHA

451
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,990
Hey, Gijun.

452
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,201
Release everyone.

453
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,955
If you can't catch him today,
you won't be able to find him.

454
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,261
Mr. Mo?

455
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,100
Mr. Mo?

456
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,440
MO GIJUN

457
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,526
[line ringing]

458
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,533
[Roy] Mr. Mo?

459
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,668
[gasps hoarsely]

460
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:09,837
[thuds]

461
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,131
[gasping hoarsely]

462
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,197
[water stops]

463
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,336
Hey.

464
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,383
It smells. I told you not to come.

465
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,469
You hate the smell of blood.

466
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,680
{\an8}POWER OFF

467
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:02,848
[Inha] Gijun.

468
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,729
Let's kill Han Taeoh.

469
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,365
{\an8}CORRECTION FOR A BETTER TOMORROW
DETENTION CENTER

470
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,408
Inha and I have to attend...

471
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,244
tonight's dinner under
the Chairman's orders.

472
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,082
Before I go,

473
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,542
I need to check something.

474
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,254
- Say it.
- I want

475
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,007
Kangoh's future as well as the present.

476
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,678
The owner of floor 151.

477
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,930
You want to own Kangoh?

478
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,436
Then don't hide...

479
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,648
anything.

480
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:10,958
Inha did it.

481
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,293
One more thing,

482
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,629
Inha knows everything

483
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,465
that happened between us.

484
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,010
You, me, and Inha.

485
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,596
We can never go back
to the way things were.

486
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,724
There was never a "we" to begin with.

487
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,184
There were three people
pretending to be "we."

488
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,228
There is no more pretending.

489
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,814
It's only us two now.

490
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,900
I still believe in your abilities.

491
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:41,155
Can you use your skills for me now?

492
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,949
If you're okay with me like this,

493
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,452
you'll become the next owner
of Kangoh, Hyewon.

494
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,289
I'll make sure that happens.

495
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,769
BISUNJAE

496
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,692
You can start work on Monday.

497
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,613
Hyewon will be the planning director
at the foundation.

498
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,656
Father.

499
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,033
[in English] Congratulations.

500
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,117
[Jiseon] This isn't right.

501
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,913
Mother is absent. How can you allow her
to take over that position?

502
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,498
She'll be the acting director.

503
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,541
[chuckles softly]

504
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,834
This is ridiculous.

505
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:40,088
What authority do you have
to say this is ridiculous or not?

506
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,466
My father

507
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,553
is still the current minister,
and he's in good health.

508
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,307
He's also a man with clear distinctions
between work and personal matters.

509
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,559
I think very highly of him on that.

510
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,686
[Jiseon] No, you're wrong.

511
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,649
If my father was clear on that,

512
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,570
you couldn't dream of having
your Royal Road.

513
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:09,076
The minister
taught you well on many matters,

514
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,080
- except on how to keep your mouth shut.
- Father!

515
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,749
Your sadness is an indulgence.

516
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,875
[tableware rattling]

517
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,169
It ends today.

518
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,298
Who made your father
the Minister of Justice?

519
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,592
Don't forget that.

520
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,514
Hyewon, remember the duties
of your position

521
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,308
come before the rights given by it.

522
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,977
Don't forget that.

523
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:36,854
I'll remember, Father.

524
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,021
[Jiseon scoffs]

525
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,065
I trust you.

526
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,044
[Seongju scoffs]

527
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,007
You.

528
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,885
I'll make you regret this.

529
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,180
[exhales]

530
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,688
[in Korean] Judging by the atmosphere,
I guess you didn't know either.

531
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,232
True.

532
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,194
As a result, it's not a bad thing for you.

533
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,698
Your wife on the back of Kang Joongmo.

534
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,791
- [door opens and closes]
- You said you didn't want it.

535
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:44,546
Being offered a seat at work
and having full power of the foundation.

536
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,261
- They're completely different.
- Was that Father's idea too?

537
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,346
No way.

538
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,433
I told Father
I'd work at the foundation first.

539
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,477
So to give me full power...

540
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,020
[Inha scoffs softly]

541
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:03,190
I need a reason
to stay in the Kang family too.

542
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,276
Something to convince myself.

543
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,736
[Inha sighs]

544
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,447
Is that all?

545
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:12,866
Should there be more?

546
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,204
That's right. What more could there be?

547
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,831
Enjoy it while you can.

548
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,001
As much as you want.

549
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,677
[exhales]

550
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,420
[guard] Ah.

551
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,340
Yes.

552
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,176
Yes, I understand.

553
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,848
WESTERN DETENTION CENTER'S CUCKOO

554
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,652
[gate opens]

555
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,456
Inmate 3866.

556
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:28,543
Inmate 3866!

557
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,299
You have a visitor.

558
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,250
Who...

559
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,596
It was you.

560
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,639
The rat.

561
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,260
