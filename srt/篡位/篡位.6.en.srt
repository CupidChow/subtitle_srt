TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,544
Even if the process is unsatisfactory,

4
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,796
it doesn't mean
the results will be disparaged.

5
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,381
Don't be upset.

6
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,217
You're right, Father.

7
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,636
I understand.

8
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,638
You deserve a reward.

9
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,515
Tell me what you want.

10
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:13,282
NA HYEWON

11
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,992
<i>There's a woman I want to marry.</i>

12
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,288
I need her.

13
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,545
I give you my consent.

14
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,383
- Thank you, Father.
- Congrats, son.

15
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,875
NA HYEWON

16
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,313
<i>I miss you.</i>

17
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,400
Don't go.

18
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,155
Don't go, Hyewon.

19
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,340
<i>I miss you.</i>

20
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,527
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

21
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,571
Sir? Sir, wake up!

22
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,030
- Sir?
- Wait!

23
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,407
- Sir!
- Wait!

24
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,491
Please, move!

25
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,008
Taeoh.

26
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,435
- Taeoh!
- See if operating room is open!

27
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,811
Room two is open.

28
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,730
- Get ready for surgery.
- Yes, doctor.

29
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,193
Ma'am, come this way.
You need to sign the consent papers.

30
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,633
Hyewon.

31
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,404
Don't go.

32
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,659
Don't go, Hyewon.

33
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,249
Don't go.

34
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:54,878
Don't go.

35
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,507
Don't go, Hyewon.

36
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,607
Let's hurry.

37
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,850
HYEWON

38
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,018
How about a dry wine?

39
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,188
Sounds good.

40
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,484
INHA

41
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:04,448
OPERATING ROOM

42
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,916
Fererel Conti.

43
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:18,545
It's a tasty dry wine
that isn't too sweet. It's very charming.

44
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:26,303
I think the quality of wine
depends on the time and place.

45
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:31,975
How it fits into the mood
and how well it goes with my emotions.

46
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,978
I like wine,
but I don't know much about it.

47
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:39,399
That's the most common thing people say
when asking for a wine recommendation.

48
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:44,071
But when you say that, it doesn't help
the person recommending it.

49
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,197
It's too vague.

50
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:50,118
You have to say keywords when you want
something from your opponent.

51
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,247
Like what I'm about to say to you.

52
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,969
If you want to continue being my son,

53
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,221
don't do anything.

54
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,014
From now on,

55
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,433
don't try to do anything.

56
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,604
You just have to do what I tell you...

57
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,858
when I tell you.

58
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,776
Easy, right?

59
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,576
Don't act on my own will.

60
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,494
As long as I abide,

61
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,248
you're saying
I can live as your third son?

62
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:40,252
There won't be problems
as long as you don't go over the line.

63
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,964
Take it.
It's been ringing for a while.

64
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,133
If you'll excuse me.

65
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,431
Hello?

66
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,476
The hospital?

67
00:07:58,604 --> 00:07:59,605
Okay.

68
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,111
- Han Taeoh was in an accident.
- An accident?

69
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,113
Someone hit him in the head.

70
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:14,745
Don't go.

71
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,415
Don't go, Hyewon.

72
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,251
Don't go.

73
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,022
<i>Mr. Han? Was he hurt badly?</i>

74
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:43,815
More importantly...

75
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,945
Don't you have connections
with the police?

76
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,446
<i>Stop them.</i>

77
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,534
<i>An investigation will cause a fuss,
and the media will join in.</i>

78
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:58,830
There can't be any mention
of Kangoh whatsoever.

79
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,959
Do you understand what I mean?

80
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,882
Hyewon!

81
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,302
What happened?

82
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,763
I don't know either.

83
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,975
The surgery is taking so long
it's making me anxious.

84
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,773
Calm down. Everything will be fine.

85
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,192
He lost so much blood.

86
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,613
If he had been discovered a little later,
it would've been bad.

87
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,492
It'll be okay.

88
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,537
Taeoh is stronger than anyone.

89
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,414
I know it.

90
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,337
I know how lucky he is too.

91
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,488
It's not an incident that happened
within Kangoh.

92
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,325
It clearly occurred externally.

93
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:19,745
So why are you trying to cover it?

94
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,832
I don't think Mr. Kang Inha's decision
is typical.

95
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,042
That's my conclusion.

96
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:29,004
Since when do you conclude things?

97
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:33,509
- You follow, you don't lead.
- I apologize.

98
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,845
It seems you don't trust Kang Inha yet.

99
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:41,642
- What if I feel the same way as him?
- I will obey.

100
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,062
How's Mr. Han?

101
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,773
He's in surgery right now.

102
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,067
Call Director In
and prepare a hospital room.

103
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:54,029
Move him after his surgery
as soon as he wakes up.

104
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,113
Yes, sir.

105
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,119
Put that by the bed.

106
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,830
Put that beside the air purifier.

107
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,290
The monitors will go there.

108
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,842
Han Taeoh was moved to the VVIP ward?

109
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:18,136
An order hasn't been made yet,
so I'm not sure.

110
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,764
But he's undergoing brain surgery.

111
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,474
<i>I think there was an accident.</i>

112
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,185
You don't know how serious it is?

113
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,521
<i>Shall I call the other hospital
and find out?</i>

114
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,274
No. I'm sure we'll know by tomorrow.

115
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,026
Okay, good job.

116
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,078
Will he live or die?

117
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:45,747
The great Han Taeoh.

118
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,839
What did you just say?

119
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,300
Han Taeoh is unconscious? Why?

120
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,522
What's with her?

121
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,442
She's like that because Taeoh might die.

122
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,194
Taeoh's going to die?

123
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,781
Ooh, Kang Huiju!

124
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,535
What was that?

125
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,871
Huiju likes Taeoh.

126
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,750
Didn't I tell you before?

127
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:34,463
- The answer's with her.
- Who could understand something like that?

128
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,590
Be precise. Tell me in detail.

129
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,303
Hey.

130
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,806
Did you know that Huiju liked Taeoh too?

131
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,850
Do I look that idle to you?

132
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,228
You psychopath.

133
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:50,521
Whatever.

134
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:59,363
By any chance... Was it you?
Did you do that to Taeoh?

135
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,075
It wasn't you?

136
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,786
- Hey!
- Seeing you get angry seems suspicious.

137
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:07,704
If you mess around,

138
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:10,999
I might kill you myself.

139
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,298
You're making me lose my appetite.

140
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,219
Try it.

141
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,305
You little punk!

142
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,224
Don't walk off like that, punk!

143
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,310
That's enough.
You always work yourself up like that.

144
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,899
Tell me what you were talking
about earlier.

145
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,235
Huiju and Taeoh. Can you support it?

146
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,362
It's a gut feeling.

147
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,324
Crap. You almost had me.

148
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:50,247
If she doesn't like him, how would you
explain her behavior just now?

149
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,416
That's true.

150
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,501
She has such low standards.

151
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,963
Why would she like a bum like that?

152
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,007
But...

153
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:01,967
it really wasn't you?

154
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:04,720
Hey!

155
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,222
Han Taeoh was assaulted?

156
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,641
Yes, but...

157
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,643
<i>Is something bothering you?</i>

158
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:13,604
I looked into it.

159
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,315
The police didn't even file a report.

160
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,567
What are you saying?

161
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,737
HAN TAEOH

162
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:42,799
Taeoh.

163
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,760
Are you up?

164
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:49,848
Can you hear me?

165
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,316
I'll get the doctor.

166
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,073
What do you think you're doing?

167
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,813
Why are you here?

168
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:49,449
If you're here because you're worried,
you should ask how he's doing first.

169
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,493
Answer my question first.

170
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,037
Why are you here?

171
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,959
She has a right to be.

172
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:00,836
How's Taeoh?

173
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,546
He's up.

174
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,299
I'll get the doctor.

175
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,605
Taeoh's... alive.

176
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,943
I won't have to worry anymore.

177
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,342
Sir, what's your name?

178
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:53,305
Han...

179
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:58,769
Han Taeoh...

180
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,779
HYEWON

181
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,199
<i>I got an urgent call from work.</i>

182
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,284
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

183
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,714
<i>The doctor said
he's out of the woods</i>

184
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:30,425
<i>so I don't think you need to worry.</i>

185
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,973
Also,

186
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:40,269
it could get a little rowdy
because of the situation.

187
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,521
- They could mention Kangoh and you...
<i>- I know.</i>

188
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,817
You told the police not to investigate
to avoid bringing up my name.

189
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,861
I feel the same.

190
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,029
You don't need to explain.

191
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,242
- Yes, Father.
- But Director Han could feel differently.

192
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,245
- Explain it so he can understand.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

193
00:17:58,328 --> 00:17:59,496
KANG INHA

194
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,923
ATTORNEY CHU HYEOKJIN

195
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,761
Mr. Chu.

196
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:20,017
There's something...
I need you to look into quietly.

197
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,302
<i>We need to wait
and see how the surgery went,</i>

198
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,971
<i>but for now, his pulse and breathing
are all stable.</i>

199
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,793
You should go now too.

200
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,421
I want to stay.

201
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,967
- Listen to me.
- Is there a reason I can't stay?

202
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,177
- Huiju.
- To be honest...

203
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,140
I don't like you because of Hyewon.

204
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,060
Huiju.

205
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,691
How much longer will you keep her
by your side?

206
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:52,484
I'm going to marry her.

207
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,820
Father gave his consent.

208
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:56,989
So respect her from now on.

209
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,202
Do you know why I hate her?

210
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,372
She doesn't love you.

211
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:08,542
- Watch your mouth.
- The only person she loves...

212
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:11,044
is herself.

213
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,048
Don't fall for her lies.
She doesn't love you.

214
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,467
Do I look like...

215
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,470
a fool to fall for those lies?

216
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,974
- That's not what I'm saying.
- You are.

217
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,605
- Inha.
- If you insult Hyewon,

218
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,523
you insult me.

219
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,986
I won't forgive that, even if it's you.

220
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,490
You'll regret ignoring my warning.

221
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:15,734
<i>Regret...</i>

222
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:19,071
<i>I don't do that, Taeoh.</i>

223
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:07,870
You haven't left work yet.

224
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,831
I had something to take care of.

225
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,593
Chairman Kang's right-hand man,
Director Han Taeoh,

226
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:25,095
got assaulted last night.

227
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,514
It seems like Kangoh hushed it.

228
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,642
No matter how much they hide it,
it will get out eventually.

229
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,565
I'm sure there's a reason they hid it.

230
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:38,358
Just ignore it.

231
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,027
I can't do that.

232
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:44,031
He's been a nuisance for the boss.

233
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:49,161
- Do you want to say something to me?
- No, it's not like that.

234
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,666
It's just strange.

235
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,711
What do you mean?

236
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,088
Anyone can see it was a random assault.

237
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:05,427
The police didn't file a report
under Kangoh Group's instructions.

238
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,806
See? Don't you think it's strange?

239
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:13,310
Why would Kangoh do that?

240
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,521
It'll be faster if you ask yourself.

241
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:18,148
The person who ordered it...

242
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,859
was Kang Inha.

243
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,759
Are you up?

244
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:47,678
Hey, Mr. Han.

245
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,569
Am I in hell right now?

246
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:07,656
Heaven.

247
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,827
Heaven...

248
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,328
I guess I'm not dead.

249
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,837
- Give me some water.
- Sure.

250
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:36,226
You'll be moved to
Kangoh Hospital tomorrow.

251
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,479
- There's no need.
- Father's orders.

252
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:43,192
The culprit?

253
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,071
Everyone has agreed
to forget about last night.

254
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:50,991
There will be no investigation.

255
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,035
In the future, this incident...

256
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:57,664
- won't be mentioned anywhere.
- This has to do with me.

257
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:00,751
Who decided...

258
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,588
- my personal affairs?
- Kangoh.

259
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:07,758
Father and I.

260
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:10,844
The chairman...

261
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:15,057
- and you?
- This is just in case.

262
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:21,188
Since you're the victim,
your name will be mentioned,

263
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:23,941
but Kangoh or my father's name
can't be mentioned with it.

264
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:26,777
So this incident...

265
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,447
isn't just a simple assault.

266
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:33,825
A simple assault case...

267
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,869
will mention Kangoh Group? Is that it?

268
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,581
- That's excessive.
- Don't think of it like that.

269
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,961
What's best for Kangoh
is what's best for us.

270
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,756
You should rest.

271
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:49,633
I'm off.

272
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:58,809
Ah.

273
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:04,523
My father gave me his consent
to marry Hyewon.

274
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,192
We're really getting married.

275
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:04,499
<i>Anyone can see
it was a random assault.</i>

276
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:09,546
<i>The police didn't file a report
under Kangoh Group's instructions.</i>

277
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,591
The person who ordered it...

278
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:15,302
was Kang Inha.

279
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:01,515
HYEWON

280
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,648
Yeah, are you done?

281
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:58,697
I want to know...

282
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:01,617
who did this to me.

283
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:05,787
I know it'll be going against your will.

284
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:08,832
I will find who did it.

285
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:12,502
I thought that Kangoh's position
was conveyed to you.

286
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:14,922
Kangoh's name won't come up
no matter what.

287
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:16,423
How can you guarantee that?

288
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,302
I'm Han Taeoh, Chairman.

289
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:25,182
Han Taeoh.

290
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:29,353
True, that name is more than enough.

291
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,529
Kangoh's name cannot be mentioned.

292
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:40,072
No matter what.

293
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:45,035
No one on the outside can know
the victim was close to Kang Joongmo.

294
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,954
As long as you can promise both...

295
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,666
I give you my consent.

296
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:52,918
I promise.

297
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:36,503
Hurry.

298
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:40,716
You must find out who's behind it first.

299
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,510
And Han Taeoh

300
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:46,471
can never find out about this before us.

301
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:52,686
Ah!

302
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:02,863
Damn it!

303
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:19,004
We're closed.

304
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:25,302
What's this?

305
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:42,194
Han Taeoh?

306
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:10,889
What are you doing here?
You barely survived.

307
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:13,600
Are you out of your mind?

308
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:16,895
This will have to do for now. Take it.

309
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:21,900
When Amico comes back,
I'll have him take you to the hospital.

310
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:51,638
You came here
while risking your life

311
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:54,600
which means you need something
that you desperately need.

312
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:56,977
What do you need?

313
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,479
The location is Han River.
Jamwon District.

314
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:02,441
The date is May 11th.

315
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:04,067
Around 11 p.m.

316
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,737
Find out...

317
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,241
who attacked me.

318
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:15,704
Why can't you answer me?

319
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,001
Did you really stop
the police investigation?

320
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:24,004
I came to tell you that
my father gave his consent.

321
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:25,839
Answer my question.

322
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:29,843
Yeah, that's right.

323
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:31,345
I stopped them.

324
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:34,056
He's not just Han Taeoh.

325
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:37,643
He's Kangoh Group's
Chairman Kang Joongmo's closest confidant.

326
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:41,063
What if my father's name is mentioned
in such a trivial matter?

327
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:43,690
It's horrible to even imagine.

328
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,320
Of course,
my father feels the same.

329
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:51,865
I forgot for a moment that

330
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,701
you're also Chairman Kang's son.

331
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:59,206
You should've had Chairman Kang
give the order.

332
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,125
The way you call his name.

333
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,253
It bothers me.

334
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:05,838
Taeoh could've died.

335
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:09,091
If he was found a little later,
he could've died in the streets!

336
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:13,512
But aren't you curious
as to who's behind...

337
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:16,807
this terrible deed?

338
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:19,852
- Taeoh understands.
- He almost died!

339
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:22,396
He didn't die. He's fine.

340
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:27,401
Even if a pet dog got hurt,
people wouldn't act like this.

341
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:29,278
He's not a pet dog.

342
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,409
- What?
- The pets my father keep

343
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:36,702
are all blood-related.

344
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:39,705
Taeoh is different from us.

345
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:42,249
He's just a mutt.

346
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,131
Then I must be a mutt too.
Since I'm not blood-related.

347
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:54,553
I understand where you're coming from
as a friend,

348
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,890
- but that's enough.
- You're his friend too.

349
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:01,268
Don't act like he's not important to you.

350
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:06,315
I have work in the morning. I'm off.

351
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,930
- Chanhyeon?
- Yes.

352
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:39,813
Did the Ministry of Environment
send anything?

353
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:40,891
Ah.

354
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,561
Here you go.

355
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:48,815
- What about the debate location?
- I found two places for now.

356
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:50,734
We're looking into the details.

357
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:51,944
That's good.

358
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:54,655
Give me the UN's environmental report
from last year.

359
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:55,739
Okay, on it.

360
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:31,024
Why would you change your number?

361
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:34,862
Do you know how much money
and time I spent trying to find you?

362
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:36,697
How much do you need?

363
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:39,575
Look at you.

364
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:43,078
It's been 10 years.
Is that all you have to say to your mom?

365
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:46,373
If you want affection,
I'll provide it.

366
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:50,294
But wasn't I just a slut to you?

367
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:53,044
50,000 won.

368
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:55,799
Your daughter?

369
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,092
What's your name?

370
00:36:57,176 --> 00:36:59,553
Slut.

371
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:10,647
Just send it here.

372
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:15,402
What about a loan? How much can you get?

373
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:18,947
What? Do you think I want pocket change?

374
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:22,451
Unbelievable.
If you want to play in the big leagues,

375
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:23,994
you need to be more generous.

376
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,540
My fingertips
have been getting dull with age.

377
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,756
There's a house available at a low price,
and I might buy it. What do you think?

378
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,424
Why would you ask me?

379
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:41,345
Because I'm buying it with your money.

380
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:42,846
Of course, I need to ask.

381
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,808
If you don't give it to me,
I'll keep coming back.

382
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:53,357
- Should I slit my wrist?
- You're insane!

383
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,108
I'll just cut and end it here.

384
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:57,528
Are you crazy?

385
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:59,321
Get out before I call the cops!

386
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:35,274
<i>That slut.</i>

387
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:43,282
Yeah, we just parted ways.

388
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:46,702
Of course.

389
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:48,871
My lips are sealed.

390
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:54,126
Call me whenever you need me.

391
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:58,130
Yes, okay. Goodbye.

392
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:07,973
DEPOSIT ACCOUNT
10,009,287 WON

393
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:09,766
Nice!

394
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:11,560
This is great!

395
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,271
This is amazing!

396
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:29,036
You're late.

397
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:38,921
What's wrong with your arm?

398
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:41,423
Did you get hurt?

399
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:02,319
I'm sorry.

400
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:04,863
I'm sorry, Hyewon. I was wrong.

401
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,283
I must've lost my mind for a second.

402
00:40:09,785 --> 00:40:10,786
I'm sorry.

403
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:17,167
I'm really sorry.

404
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:31,890
Enjoy your meal.

405
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:35,352
Welcome.

406
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:42,609
I can't get through this?

407
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:50,409
Then what about this?

408
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:02,087
SEOUL CCTV CONTROL CENTER

409
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:03,672
Yes!

410
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:09,761
Please, be here. Come on.

411
00:41:26,195 --> 00:41:27,196
There you are.

412
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:28,549
I finally got you!

413
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:04,251
I'll have to take care
of Kang Inju now.

414
00:43:05,294 --> 00:43:07,171
I'll make sure he has no place to go.

415
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:11,633
<i>Then you're going
to need a lot of information on Kang Inju.</i>

416
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:12,718
I am.

417
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:14,970
All of it.

418
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:17,764
Don't leave anything out.

419
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:36,408
Well? It's high, right?

420
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:40,120
Too high that not just anyone can reach.

421
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:46,335
Let's go.

422
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:08,565
Have you picked a date?

423
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:10,025
I'd like to discuss that.

424
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:12,694
Discuss it
with the secretary's office.

425
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:13,862
Yes, sir.

426
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:19,409
It's Na Hyewon.

427
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,415
That's my name.

428
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:31,088
You didn't ask, so I thought I'd tell you.

429
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:32,840
Na Hyewon.

430
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:36,134
You're one of Hanmi Party Leader
Jo Sundong's aides.

431
00:44:37,511 --> 00:44:40,472
I didn't ask because I already know.

432
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:44,977
You seem to say what's on your mind,
so let me do so as well.

433
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:47,187
The work you're doing now...

434
00:44:48,063 --> 00:44:49,064
When will you quit?

435
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:51,817
You work for Jo Sundong.

436
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,611
So I'm sure you know my background
with Congressman Jo.

437
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:57,698
Did you think I'd accept
one of his people?

438
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:00,617
- Father, we can talk...
- I'm speaking with Aide Na Hyewon.

439
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:06,790
If you want, I can get you a position
at the foundation.

440
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:09,710
You can have fun working there.

441
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:11,712
I don't want to have fun.

442
00:45:14,256 --> 00:45:16,758
I want to work, Father.

443
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:20,637
Bravo.

444
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:34,067
Judging by everyone's expression,
it seems I've done something wrong.

445
00:45:34,568 --> 00:45:37,070
Since I've already made a mistake,
I'll make one more.

446
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:42,701
If you're going to give me a position,
give me the one I want.

447
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:46,955
You want me to abandon my career.

448
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,958
It's the least you can do.

449
00:45:53,212 --> 00:45:54,213
How frank of you.

450
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:58,258
There's nothing bad about that.

451
00:45:58,342 --> 00:46:01,345
I like that your goals
are simple and clear.

452
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:06,391
However, when I allowed
a mere congressman's aide into Bisunjae,

453
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:10,103
I expected common sense
with the appropriate attitude.

454
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:13,357
But you don't have that.
How disappointing.

455
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,441
I'm sorry.

456
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:22,199
How could you be so thoughtless?

457
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:24,701
She's not being thoughtless.

458
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:28,247
She fully evaluated
the chairman's character.

459
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:30,791
She's not clever.

460
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:33,085
She's shrewd.

461
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:36,046
This is why I hate you.

462
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:40,300
We need to talk.

463
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:51,812
How could you say whatever's on your mind?

464
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,650
- He provoked me first.
- Do you want to be respected?

465
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,071
Sorry, but give it up.
He doesn't respect anyone but himself.

466
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:05,284
Do you feel the same?

467
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:09,538
- Should I go to work to have fun?
- You can't get everything you want.

468
00:47:11,206 --> 00:47:13,333
You have to make sacrifices
for what's real.

469
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:15,085
Why would you decide

470
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:17,379
- what's real for me?
- Because I know

471
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:19,840
what's real for you.

472
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:21,967
If you get what's real,

473
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:26,096
everything will follow in its place
without me having to do anything.

474
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:29,266
So wait.

475
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:35,355
Scissors.

476
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:40,105
Oh. Mr. Han, what are you doing here?

477
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:42,608
Did you come to visit?

478
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:49,406
You're too casual.

479
00:49:51,158 --> 00:49:52,993
You're not hesitant or flustered.

480
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:57,122
You didn't fail.

481
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:01,752
You weren't trying to kill me.

482
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,171
Excuse me?

483
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:08,008
- What are you saying?
- Was it a warning?

484
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,680
I heard you were hurt.

485
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:16,975
I'll take you wherever
you need to go if you need.

486
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:18,268
If so...

487
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:21,480
will you kill me next time?

488
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:26,777
You're saying
the strangest things.

489
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:28,320
Did your owner...

490
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:32,032
tell you why to do it?

491
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:36,203
I don't know what you're saying.

492
00:50:36,286 --> 00:50:37,287
The reason.

493
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:39,623
Did your owner tell you why?

494
00:50:40,499 --> 00:50:41,875
Owner?

495
00:50:41,959 --> 00:50:42,960
The reason.

496
00:50:44,169 --> 00:50:45,379
Did your owner tell you?

497
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:54,638
It's already done.

498
00:50:58,225 --> 00:50:59,268
Does the reason matter?

499
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:02,396
Yes.

500
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:04,356
"It's already done."

501
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:07,651
So the reason's not important.

502
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:08,902
In return...

503
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:12,614
go and let Kang Inju know.

504
00:51:14,032 --> 00:51:15,868
Tell him I won't forget his warning.

505
00:51:17,703 --> 00:51:19,830
I always repay what is owed.

506
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,845
Damn it.

507
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:50,027
There are so many hot girls tonight.

508
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:52,279
I got everything prepared upstairs.

509
00:51:58,118 --> 00:51:59,119
Just a moment.

510
00:52:59,513 --> 00:53:00,639
When did you get here?

511
00:53:08,146 --> 00:53:09,606
I'm glad you're okay.

512
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:13,777
Back then...

513
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:15,821
you were wrong.

514
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,038
We don't mean anything to one another.

515
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:27,833
Han Taeoh!

516
00:53:37,426 --> 00:53:39,178
KANG INHA

517
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:44,892
Hello?

518
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:47,269
I was a coward.

519
00:53:47,352 --> 00:53:49,313
If you're going to confess, forget it.

520
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:50,814
It's over.

521
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,274
It's not over yet.

522
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:55,319
At least not for me. I'm not done.

523
00:53:55,777 --> 00:53:57,112
No, I thought I was done. But...

524
00:53:59,781 --> 00:54:02,117
I thought I was going to die,
and you were there.

525
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:05,495
Everything disappeared but you.

526
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:07,206
I told you, it's over.

527
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:09,708
- I kept losing consciousness.
- Taeoh!

528
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:12,586
- My memories started to disappear.
- Stop it.

529
00:54:13,295 --> 00:54:16,215
My memories of you
didn't disappear. They only got clearer.

530
00:54:20,302 --> 00:54:22,638
You can mock me
saying it's childish self-pity.

531
00:54:26,183 --> 00:54:27,309
Jerk...

532
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:28,393
I know.

533
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:31,605
I'm selfish.

534
00:54:33,148 --> 00:54:34,149
I'm the worst.

535
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,946
I know I have no right to say this to you.

536
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,621
I'm sorry.

537
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,173
I went to you that night.

538
00:55:15,357 --> 00:55:16,358
You're right.

539
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,193
