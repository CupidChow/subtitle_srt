{\an8}Goodness. Thank you again
for attending, sir.

10
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,154
{\an8}The center has achieved
so much over the last five years.

11
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,740
{\an8}I had to come in person to compliment you.

12
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,242
{\an8}Mr. Chae.

13
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,578
{\an8}Do you like the chairman that much?

14
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,705
{\an8}Normally, this punk...

15
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,083
{\an8}I mean...
Weren't you Kang Seongju's person?

16
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,003
{\an8}No, I'm always the chairman's person.

17
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,922
{\an8}Oh.

[Donguk] This is the employee who
wrote the speech you'll be giving today.

20
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,106
Hello.

21
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,316
I work on the global leader training team.

22
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,443
My name is Han Taeoh.

23
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,989
It's so nice to see
a young man with a spirited writing style.

24
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,034
He placed at the top of his class.

25
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,869
What are you doing? Thank him.

26
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,830
Thank you.

28
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,129
Everything's ready, sir.

29
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,090
- Shall we go?
- Go ahead.

30
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,634
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

31
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,094
You too.

32
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,139
You stay, young man.

33
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,851
I'll see you at the ceremony.

34
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,770
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

35
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,831
Tell me.

36
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,042
From what you see and feel,
what type of owner am I?

37
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,922
I'm asking because the contents
of your speech have nothing to do with me.

38
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:57,260
By any chance, did you create an image
of what you hoped for in an owner?

39
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,181
- That's right.
- [Joongmo] In other words,

40
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,683
you don't think I'm the ideal owner.

41
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,562
Answer me. What type of owner am I?

42
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,107
If you don't like my answer...

43
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,903
will I be fired?

44
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,531
[chuckles softly]
If I fired you for being cheeky,

45
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,659
wouldn't I be taking a step back
from being an ideal owner?

46
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,789
You...

47
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,960
are fired.

48
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,218
You're going to need me in the future.

49
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,887
Because you first thought of this center?

50
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:45,642
That's why you confidently
asked Mr. Chae to set up this meeting.

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,729
The price for my report.

52
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,898
I'm here to collect.

53
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,193
[Joongmo] <i>Every small or big thing</i>
<i>that happens in Kangoh</i>

54
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,778
<i>is reported to me.</i>

55
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,113
For the past five years,

56
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,242
you didn't raise this center
to its worth of 30 trillion won.

57
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,534
It was my people.

58
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,121
Only...

59
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,000
Only 30 trillion won.

60
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,919
- What?
- [Taeoh] To be honest,

61
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,088
it doesn't matter if you need me or not.

62
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,048
As for me...

63
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,677
I can go somewhere else that needs me
and just create another Kangoh.

64
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,845
I know.

65
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,390
I know you're qualified.

66
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,519
Han Gilsu.

67
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,729
[Jisuk] <i>Don't come near!</i>

68
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,315
<i>Don't come near me!</i>
<i>Let go!</i>

69
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,734
Turning your innocent father
into a murderer.

70
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,194
Was that you?

71
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,198
The more a pebble stands out,

72
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,368
it's only natural to wonder
where they're from

73
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,161
or how they grew up.

74
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,544
Innocent person...

75
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,880
So...

76
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,385
So the devil has no sins?

77
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,440
It seems my efforts were futile.

78
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,651
I'll turn in
my letter of resignation today.

79
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,945
It was a short time, but--

80
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,573
[Joongmo] Nothing you can't do.
Nothing you won't do.

81
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,702
Don't feel at ease because you lost
your composure only briefly.

82
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:31,539
Because in that brief moment,
you showed me everything.

83
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,207
It's an inexcusable defeat.

84
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,211
Never let your inner thoughts show
from now on.

85
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,839
Even if you're up against me. Never.

86
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,133
If you want to work for me,

87
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,011
you need to learn to hide your real self.

88
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,769
I'll bear that in mind, Chairman.

89
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,064
Nothing you can't do.
Nothing you won't do.

90
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,733
That's the kind of person
I need most right now. Besides...

91
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,152
I have your weakness now.

92
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,821
It's the icing on the cake.

93
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,991

CO-PROSPERITY COOPERATION CENTER
5TH ANNIVERSARY

95
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,788
{\an8}In many situations in South Korea,

96
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,666
{\an8}the weak have been forced to make
sacrifices without prior agreement,

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,877

of happiness for the majority.

[microphone turns off]

100
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,692
[Joongmo] Someone told me

101
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,445
about the infinite possibilities
of this center.

102
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,614
Some people may say

103
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,910
that the center is a monster that deceives
and preys on the weak and poor.

104
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,121
Who cares if it's a monster?

105
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,541
Countless of startups emerge
and disappear every day.

106
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,585
We're giving them an opportunity.

107
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,713
Being a part of the center?
Take pride in it.

108
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,590
Monster?

109
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,552
Become a more brutal and thorough monster!

110
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,388
As long as you're a person of Kangoh...

111
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,598
As long as you're one of my people,

112
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,436
prove to everyone that it will soon
become a brand.

113
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,731
Only those who can prove it
can survive in Kangoh.

114
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,110
Instead of offering comfort
with "prosperity" and "cooperation,"

115
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,279
become a monster

116
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,073
and become passionate
about saving something!

117
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,658
That is the purpose

118
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,369
of establishing
the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center.

119
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,956
It's the goal and the reason
to move forward!

120
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,044
He's forcing loyalty and sacrifice.

121
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,713
Kangoh.

122
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,757
It's a place that's worth it.

123
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,885
To those who survived...

124
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,845
I make a promise.

125
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,430
Privileges of Kangoh!

126
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,390
- The pride...
- The pride...

127
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,726
- of being the best.
- [Joongmo] ...of being the best.

128
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:09,447
Center Director Chae Donguk
will be relieved of his position.

129
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,532
He's useless now, so he'll be discarded.

130
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,202
If he's lucky...

131
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,621
he could be recycled.

132
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,545
Will Kang Seongju
naturally succeed the position?

133
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,589
Kang Seongju wants Kangoh's control tower.

134
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,717
To Kang Seongju...

135
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,387
the center is just a shortcut there.

136
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,391
<i>Where all of Kangoh's capital and power</i>
<i>are located.</i>

137
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,062
<i>Where the subsidiaries</i>
<i>and affiliates are managed.</i>

<i>Kangoh Corporation.</i>

141
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,487
<i>That's where...</i>

142
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,240
<i>Kang Seongju wants to be.</i>

143
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,312
As of today, I'll be working beside you.

144
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,773
My name is Han Taeoh.

145
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,821
<i>The real game...</i>

146
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,990
<i>begins now.</i>

147
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,378
FIVE YEARS LATER

148
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,082
Father!

149
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:35,384
- I thought you collapsed.
- Are you disappointed I'm fine?

150
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,095
What happened?

151
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,431
As you can see, I'm eating.
Is there a problem?

152
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,196
But it's strange,

153
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,865
I get this pain in my neck
whenever I see Han Taeoh.

154
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,077
Rumors say that he could be
the youngest chief secretary soon.

155
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,703
So he'll become even cockier?

156
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,456
He's never caused problems
in the last five years.

157
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,625
Father seems satisfied with him.

158
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,251
That's the problem.

159
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,087
Father's too dependent on him.

160
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,171
They're too close.

161
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,299
What if he does something moronic?
It'll ruin us.

162
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,593
President Kang,
you should watch your mouth.

163
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,889
Someone might think you're hoping
for things to go wrong.

164
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,268
When assisting your husband,
don't just focus on the big picture.

165
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,896
Taking care of the small things
applies too.

166
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,482
He's the eldest son of Kangoh.

167
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,194
Make sure he acts like it.
He should watch his mouth and behavior.

168
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,154
Yes, Mother.

169
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,824
[laughing]

170
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,869
Excuse me, Mother?

171
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,459
Speak for yourself.

172
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,212
Before telling my wife
how to assist her husband,

173
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,589
examine how you assist yours.

174
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,508
What are you doing?

175
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,429
Learn some respect
before complaining about your treatment.

176
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,223
Do you think we're the same
just because I talk to you?

177
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,100
- Stay out of it, punk.

[knock on door]

181
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,044
You're ready to be discharged, sir.

182
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,089
Did you tell Director In what I told you?

183
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,008
Don't worry.

184
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,512
What did Kim Sangsu say?

185
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,055
Congressman Kim Sangsu says

186
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,476
there won't be any issues
getting the results you want.

187
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,061
After Kim Sangsu becomes the party leader,

188
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,605
we'll work on his presidency.

189
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:56,484
After that...
the Royal Road Project finally begins.

190
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,239
On the west coast,
I'm thinking of building a large city.

191
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,324
ONE YEAR AGO

192
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,619
A mega project which is
a hundred times bigger than Kangoh City.

193
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,624
I'm going to build a country
inside the country of Korea.

194
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,919
Do you think my dream...

195
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,546
is absurd as well?

196
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,465
At Kangoh,

197
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,135
we have the greatest resource,
the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center.

198
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,389
The center will make your dream come true.

199
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,061
[Joongmo] <i>Kangoh will become a country.</i>

200
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,816
The west coast site that'll make
my dream come true has been purchased.

201
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,401
We just have to break ground.

202
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,831
A paraplegic patient...

203
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,584
uses the HMD, a head mounted display,

204
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,712
on their head like this.

205
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:03,300
Through it, this paralyzed dad can go
to the playground with his kids.

206
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,179
A paralyzed high school student
can play basketball with friends,

207
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,347
play games,

208
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:13,269
and all of those things
can even feel real.

209
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,897
Also... What's more...

210
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,191
Did you steal it?

211
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,653
- Excuse me?
- How can someone forget the contents

212
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,863
of their development?

213
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,407
- Well, the thing is...
- [Inha slams table]

214
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,703
Doctor,

215
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,456
we're not helping you practice
your presentation because we're bored.

216
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,375
- Yes, but...
- You said that next year

217
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,128
Kangoh Electronics DMC will be merged
with the software center.

218
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,841
We're not just helping because
our team is pro-DMC.

219
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,386
We put our team's life and soul
into this project.

220
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,470
[bangs]

221
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,889
That's what I'm trying to say.

222
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,517
You worked so hard on your research.

223
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,686
Shouldn't it come to light?

224
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,772
Unless you want to kill
your precious baby,

225
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,399
you should try to keep it alive!

226
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,529
- I apologize.
- Again with that!

227
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,906
Stop saying you're sorry!

228
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,616
[cell phone vibrates]

229
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,742
Seriously.

230
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,202

233
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,962
Now.

234
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,505
I got too worked up.

235
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,759
Sorry. I want to apologize to everyone.
Let's do this!

236
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,260
- We can do it!
- We can do it!

237
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,345
We can do it!

238
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,221
We can do it.

239
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,141
[Hyewon] It's the last official event
before the party conference.

240
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,310
We have to pay attention to every detail.

241
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,772
And how about mentioning children
when talking about the fine dust?

242
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:44,068
Instead of "young people,"
call them "struggling job seekers."

243
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,279
Make it to be employees being laid off
for the minimum wage increase

244
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,323
and show pity to small business owners.

245
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,408
Good, much more appealing.

247
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,504

252
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,767
You flatter me.

- It's not easy.

00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,471
There's nothing like this
to relieve stress.

266
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,348
- [Seongju] Of course.
- [man] Not to mention,

267
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,017
it's fun shooting it.

268

KANGOH CO., LTD

278
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,692
In five days,
at the Hanmi Party Conference,

279
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,987
Jo Sundong will be appointed
against the chairman's intent,

280
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,409
which will open the doors to attacks
on the Royal Road Project as futile.

281
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,454
So Jo Sundong was picked
to be the one to carry the weight?

282
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,500
What's Kang Seongju voting
for with the center?

283
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,584
[cell phone vibrates]

284
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,672
That's what we need to figure out
while he's drunk with victory.

285
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,549
Must be nice.

286
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,136
His first victory against my father.
I bet it'll taste sweet.

287
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,679
[Hyewon] There's more.

288
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,890
Kang Seongju's the first guest
for the Blue House Talk Concert.

289
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:07,062
Oh Gyeongcheol texted me to pick a topic
and prepare the script.

290
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,858
A tribute for Kang Seongju
on behalf of Jo Sundong?

291
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,693
Kang Seongju could've requested it first.

292
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,279
In exchange for making him a party leader?

293
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,365
As the starting point for future costs.

294
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,491
What if...

295
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,871
the chairman finds out
about their secret deals?

296
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,832
How much and to what extent
will Mr. Kang's punishment be?

297
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,168
I'm looking forward to it.

298
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,503
Kang Seongju won't just accept
the punishment.

299
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,465
He'll do whatever he can to try and break
the absolute and universal law

300
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,926
that Kangoh is Kang Joongmo.

They'll attack as if they were waiting.
Jo Sundong, that bastard!

331
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:31,123
He'll instigate and fuel the madness
and try to tear Kangoh apart.

332
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,292
How long has he been planning

333
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,211
in the shadows after I abandoned him?

334
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,548
I should've taken care of him back then!

00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,095
[Hyewon] What face do you think
Chairman Kang will make

353
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,598
when he finds out Congressman Jo
was nominated,

354
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,434
and the fact that you already knew?

355
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,437
It wasn't just me.
We already knew together.

356
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,275
Leave me out of there.

357
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,486
I don't exist to Chairman Kang yet.

358
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,113
Aren't you considering marrying Inha?

359
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,160
[chuckles softly]

360
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,579
Did I get ahead of myself?

361
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,331
I told him I wasn't ready yet.

362
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,916
Not yet.

363
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,543
"Not yet"?

364
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,007
"Not yet" it is.

365
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,485
[Hyewon sighs]

366
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,987
I know now is more important than ever.

367
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,073
I just want us to be careful.

368
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,699
It is important.

369
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,495
As important as it is,
it'll only get harder for us

370
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,415
if we don't catch Kang Seongju now.

371
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,918
Chairman Kang bought the site
for Royal Road.

372
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,796
Kangoh Group poured in funds from within.

373
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,257
There are no problems if you win,

374
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,428
but if you lose,
it's breach of trust and embezzlement.

375
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,848
You'll find something
if you dig into Oh Gyeongcheol.

376
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,975
Being the guest on the talk show

377
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,644
was Oh Gyeongcheol's idea,
not Congressman Jo's.

378
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,606
Two days.

379
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,567
Bring me concrete facts...

380
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,820
in two days.

381
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,952
A RELIABLE WORKER WHO WORKS
WITH THE PEOPLE, JO SUNDONG

382
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,509
[clears throat]

383
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,808
[both chuckle softly]

384
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,394
[man inhales sharply and exhales]

385
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,277
[inhales sharply]

386
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,113
Do you have something to say to me?

387
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,657
- Yes.
- What is it?

388
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,535
I know you're not pleased with me.

389
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,786
Oh.

390
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,206
[in English] And?

391
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,000
I don't know what the general manager
said to you,

392
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,212
- but it's probably true.
- [in Korean] Is that so?

393
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,631
- If you don't like me because of that...
- [snaps]

394
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,886
You were a great reporter in Gwanghwamun.
The district office is different, right?

395
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,223
Being a social affairs reporter
is close to manual labor.

396
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:20,185
- I'm well-trained in most things.
- Of course. Sure.

397
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,980
Secretary Na, the reason I don't like you

398
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,233
isn't because of Mr. Yu.

399
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,612
So there's another reason
you're displeased with me?

400
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,281
I've been through a lot of hardships
in politics,

401
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,450
and I've studied many people.

402
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,036
I can conclude from my research...

403
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,623
that no matter how hard you try
to hide yourself,

404
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,585
most people have a gap
they don't know about.

405
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,712
[snaps] Through that,

406
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,423
others can see inside.

407
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,471
But it's strange. I can't see through you.

408
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,059
I don't trust people I can't see through.

409
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,524
Mmm. There's another person
who's like that. Do you know who?

410
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:12,070
[chuckles softly] Congressman Jo Sundong?

411
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,739
[man chuckles]

412
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,325
[laughing]

413
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,371
Wow, I may not trust you,
but you'd make a great drinking buddy.

414
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,872
- [chuckles]
- [chuckles softly]

415
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,917
Ah. Some of the aides
are getting together later

416
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,336
to celebrate the conference
at an afterparty.

417
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,046
Would you like to come?

418
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,466
- I'm sorry. I have plans today.
- [man] Really?

419
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,261
- [chuckles] I'm off.
- Okay.

420
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,350
[door closes]

421
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,145
Are you out of your mind?

422
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,439
Who? Ko Huichan?

423
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,566
Huiju, calm down.

424
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,650
Are you insane?

425
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,571
I'm not deaf. Take it easy.

426
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,823
Does it look like I can right now?

427
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,700
Ko Huichan? Are you kidding me?

428
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,868
Miss!

429
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,663
- Are you going to argue with your mother?
- Stay out of it!

430
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,911
[sighs]

431
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,245
I'll be outside.

432
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:06,184
- Why do I have to hear about Ko Huichan?
- Chairman Ko of Daejong adores you.

433
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,895
Let's go ahead
with the engagement first...

434
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,314
- Mom.
- He wants to hold the wedding next year.

435
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,942
[chuckles] I know. So why?

436
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,070
I like Huichan. He's gentle and funny.

437
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,030
You really don't know what he's like?

438
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,283
Everyone knows about the trouble he caused
in the States!

439
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,412
Everyone gets a little lost
when they're young.

440
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,790
- The present is what's important.
- Whatever. I don't care.

441
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,876
Judging from the rumors I heard,
he's still just a child.

442
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,795
[clicks tongue]

443
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,004
Watch your mouth.

444
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,424
A forced marriage.

445
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,759
I won't do it.

446
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,680
Is there anyone in our family
who wasn't forced into marriage?

447
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,306
That's why everyone's miserable.

448
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,642
Do you want me to live miserably like you?

449
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,687
- Kang Huiju.
- I don't want that for me.

450
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,773
If you force this...

451
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,527
I'll die.

452
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,739
And I mean it.

453
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,872
- [sighs]
- [door opens and closes]

454
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,876
[line connects]

455
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,129
Is Ko Huichan back from the States?
Find out where he hangs out.

456
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,090
- [sighs]
- [line disconnects]

457
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,010
I'd never agree to an arranged marriage.
I'm not crazy.

458
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,732
CONTACTS

459
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,275
TAEOH

460
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,573
[sighs]

461
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:56,836
Did you come alone?

462
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,715
Impressive. [chuckles]

463
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,051
This way.

464
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,846
[man 1] <i>It's for real, starting now.</i>

465
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,351
Management rights will go to Kang Seongju,
Chairman Kang will be ousted before that,

466
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,355
and all of that will be achieved by us.

467
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,106
- Okay?
- And the old man,

468
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,194
wants to know
how much he can trust Kang Seongju.

469
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,363
Either way, he's Chairman Kang's son.

470
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,907
When the time comes,
won't he take his dad's side?

471
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,576
When that time comes...

472
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,162
there's a saying that goes...

473
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,458
"Once you're in too deep,
it's hard to pull out."

474
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:40,255
Those types of people
are scared of the word "losing" the most.

475
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,632
- Aren't I right? Especially...
- [men chuckle]

476
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,552
...when it comes to money.

477
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,264
[knocking on door]

478
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,892
- Gentlemen, your dish is ready.
- [man 3] Come on in.

479
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,812
[man 1] Now, let's have a drink.

480
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,730
Let's drink something strong.

481
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,566
- [chuckles]
- [faint beeping]

482
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,484
[man 4] It's going
to go down smooth tonight.

483
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,844
[cell phone vibrates]

484
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,268
[Hyewon] <i>Come to Inha's place.</i>

485
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,858
Kang Seongju will put Jo Sundong
at the forefront

486
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,652
and try to control
the National Assembly's MOEL and MOLIT.

487
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,323
They'll use their power to advance
the Royal Road Project

488
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,951
despite Kangoh's financial collapse
and the resulting economic crisis.

489
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,163
Furthermore, they'll try to brand them
as an evil dictatorship.

490
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,625
After they destroy the Royal Road Project,

491
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,920
they'll name Chairman Kang
for embezzlement and negligence.

492
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,090
<i>We've already anticipated that much.</i>

493
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,719
<i>But the real deal starts now.</i>

494
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,889
<i>After they successfully oust</i>
<i>Chairman Kang,</i>

495
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:16,559
<i>the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center</i>
<i>will be separated from Kangoh</i>

496
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,478
<i>which is the start of Kang Seongju's plan.</i>

497
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:22,106
- Wait, what?
- The center's separation and independence.

498
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,025
But that's not all.

499
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,570
Energy chemistry, communications,
and logistic services.

500
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,655
Also, electronics.

501
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,742
That's the portfolio of the subsidiaries
that'll be formed with the center,

502
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,203
wrapped to look like a good cause

503
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,830
for increased autonomy
and responsible management.

504
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,291
Transition to a holding company...

505
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,252
That was Kang Seongju's goal.

506
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,630
He'll try to steal the core of Kangoh.

507
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,716
The center's the main part,
not Kangoh Holdings.

508
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,636
But he's going to accelerate it.

509
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,848
He'll make Jo Sundong the owner
with the Blue House on his back.

510
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:57,934
This is just...

511
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,978
- [glasses clink]
- [Seongju chuckles]

512
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,813
[Inha] <i>We can't compete with that.</i>

513
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,482
- [Hyewon] <i>You're right.</i>
- [Seongju exhales]

514
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,902
[Hyewon] <i>They have almost a 100% chance</i>
<i>of their plan succeeding first.</i>

515
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,946
I understand. Thank you.

516
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,739
Do you really think...

517
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,618
- Kang Seongju will beat us?
- That's what the results show.

518
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,786
There are other ways.

519
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,332
We can persuade Chairman Kang
to secede the center first.

520
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,919
- Well?
- Chairman Kang won't give up the center.

521
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,297
We don't have the justification or power

522
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,175
- to change his mind yet.
- [Inha] So what?

523
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,553
- Do we just sit back and watch?
- Why would we do that?

524
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,764
In the end, we'll complete our goal.

525
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,100
Congressman Jo won't get into
the Blue House.

526
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:43,021
He's bait to provoke Chairman Kang
to get rid of Kang Seongju.

527
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,357
That's the role I've decided
for Jo Sundong.

528
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,818
So trust me.

529
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,446
Jo Sundong and Kang Seongju...

530
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:56,034
won't be able to take anything they want.

531
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,036
- [clinks]
- [both laugh]

532
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:00,997
As long as I'm here.

533
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,000
[reading] Save Africa.

534
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,670
It's an African refugee relief
organization run by Jang Noik Foundation.

535
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,005
Jang Noik Foundation.

536
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,049
I know it well.

537
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,843
Anyway, these foundations are the problem.

538
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,555
But if it weren't
a problematic foundation,

539
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,933
we wouldn't have been able to meet at all.

540
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,017
On that note...

541
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,271
should we be thanking
the Kangoh Art Foundation?

542
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,443
[slurps]

543
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,161
I should've come to the hospital,

544
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,455
but there are eyes watching me.

545
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:28,584
I thought it'd be a hassle for you,
so I asked you to come here.

546
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,670
As I've said before,

547
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:35,133
there are no issues with the chairman
aside from his blood pressure.

548
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,551
I know that.

549
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,178
I'm sure you will do well.

550
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,101
Drink it.

551
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,603
[grunts softly]

552
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,773
I'm very busy right now...

553
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:55,695
I need to prepare for the 10th-anniversary
symposium for the Heart Transplant Center.

554
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,071
It's concerning to me.

555
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,490
[Geumseok] I hear your son

556
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:04,078
was admitted into rehab
for drug addiction.

557
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,212
It's been a while since he was fired
from Johns Hopkins.

558
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,882
Yet you've already decided to have him

559
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,468
as the next head of surgery
at Kangoh Hospital?

560
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,930
What do you intend to do?

561
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,401
[Taeoh] I have confirmed that a villa
was purchased

562
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,653
under Congressman Jo's daughter's name

563
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,988
in San Sebastian, Spain.

564
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:43,367
I also confirmed a cash deposit
of $5 million

565
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,287
to his daughter's Swiss bank account
two days after that.

566
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,959
Did you track it?

567
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,337
- Yes.
- Who is it?

568
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,006
Save Africa,
an African refugee relief organization,

569
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,717
laundered donations
meant for South Sudanese refugees

570
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,637
- and transferred them to a Swiss account.
- Save Africa?

571
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,891
Jang Noik Foundation?

572
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,477
- Yes.
- Behind that

573
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,187
will be Kangoh Art Foundation.

574
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,314
Yes.

575
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,401
Then the brains behind it
will be Director Jang Geumseok.

576
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,155
Whoever gets the center gets Kangoh.

577
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,284
So do they call it Kang Seongju's center?

578
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,288
The Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center
is part of the Synergy Team.

579
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,040
The Synergy Team's team leader

580
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,668
is Senior Executive VP Kang Seongju.

581
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,338
So saying the center belongs to him...

582
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,799
would be correct, right?

583
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,551
What's more...

584
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,137
- [gun fires]
- [shatters]

585
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,181

587
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,020
Director Jang!

588
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,939
You're a sniper.

589
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,608
Shooting suits me better than golf.

590
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,278
Incredible! [laughs]

591
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,197
Have you been busy lately?

592
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,866
Isn't it my job to be busy?

593
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,201
- [laughs]
- [chuckles]

594
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,078
Mother.

595
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,163
You're here.

596
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,751
KANGOH MILL

597
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,671
[Seongju] Chairman Kang Minguk
was the first chairman of Kangoh,

598
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,507
and he loved Kangoh Mill.

599
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,719
As far as I can remember,

600
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:29,181
he used to come here before a big event
and get lost in thought for some time.

601
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,228
My grandfather always lived by this motto,
"You may fail,

602
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,773
but you can't make any mistakes."

603
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,360
The former chairman's
management philosophies were well known.

604
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,989
Did you bring me here to tell me that?

605
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,203
However, the current chairman,
Kang Joongmo,

606
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:57,251
is trying to change those teachings
with dogmatism and self-righteousness.

607
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,297
That's why...

608
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,217
I thought we could come together...

609
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:12,600
and try to realign the spirit of Kangoh
that my grandfather had established.

610
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,981
I need the backstory of Milton's birth
from 10 years ago...

611
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,903
as evidence for embezzlement
and breach of trust against Chairman Kang.

612
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,616
- I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
- Mr. Chu.

613
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,037
You heard me.
How can you pretend like you didn't?

614
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,375
I misjudged you.

615
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,629
[sighs]

616
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,007
How much longer
will you be my father's avatar?

617
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:49,929
After a while, will you let Han Taeoh
take away that role as well?

618
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,056
I don't care who you are.

619
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,476
I won't forgive you
for running your mouth.

620
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,062
Mr. Chu.

621
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,942
I meant what I said.

622
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,195
Seeing your skills

623
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:09,949
being used as a puppet for Kangoh
is sincerely such a waste.

624
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,164
[sighs]

625
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,000

maybe the purpose of Milton Law Firm

00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:13,979
Always keep in mind the big picture
Jo Sundong has drawn for you.

698
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,981
[inhales sharply]

699
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:18,400
Let's be honest.
That big picture isn't for me.

700
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,778
It's for himself.

701
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:24,823
Whether that big picture
is for you or him,

702
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,617
he's someone we need.

703
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,578
We still have a long way to go.
Don't let your guard down.

704
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,042
- I understand.
- Just become the owner of Kangoh.

705
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,378
You can do anything you want after that.

706
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:42,508
We can change the president
a thousand times over if you want.

707
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,738
Call Chu Hyeokjin.

708
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,457
[line ringing]

709
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,293
I'll put Chairman Kang on.

710
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,047
What?

711
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,885
Okay.

712
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,136
I'll be right there.

713
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,101
HAN TAEOH

714
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,566
[car honks]

715
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:50,826
[chuckles softly]

716
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,204
When did you get here?

717
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,622
You should've called.

718
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,165
I would've come out sooner.

719
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,711
- Let's go see the ocean.
- Right now?

720
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,379
[chuckles softly]

721
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,007
[waves splashing]

722
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,225
It's a perfect ocean.

723
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,687
It is a perfect ocean.

724
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:21,940
[sighs]

725
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,070
This is nice.

726
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:32,993
Let's get married.

727
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,580
I want to get married.

728
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,172
[chuckles softly]

729
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,508
Okay, let's get married.

730
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,095
The day you proudly enter Bisunjae.

731
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,390
We're almost there.

732
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,600
[Inha chuckles softly]

733
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,189
[sighs]

734
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:06,026
Do you believe Taeoh's plan
will be a complete success?

735
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,778
No.

736
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:18,538
I trust you, Kang Inha.

737
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,415
[Inha chuckles softly]

738
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,042
[chuckles softly]

739
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,754
[exclaims] Sweet!

740
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,884
[Joongmo] Why are you so surprised?

741
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,304
I came for what's mine.
Is that so surprising?

742
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,390
No, sir.

743
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:43,855
Get rid of any legal issues that could
arise from reassigning the center.

744
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,608
- by tomorrow morning.
- [all] Yes, sir.

745
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,406
Mr. Chu, you don't seem happy.

746
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,573
Of course not.

747
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,826
How could I dare interfere?

748
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,458
Everyone,
I hope there are no misunderstandings.

749
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:08,505
As each case is unique,
we must prevent any unintentional leaks.

750
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:11,800
I will hold onto your phones
until after the meeting.

751
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,064
Mr. Chu?

752
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:27,774
Yeah.

753
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,408
{\an8}CHU HYEOKJIN

754
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:44,082
If you look at the graph here,
department stores and network start-ups

755
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,667
have a much higher return.

756
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,175
[people speaking indistinctly]

757
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,555
[sighs]

758
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:07,731
This is Chairman Kang delivering
a fatal blow to Kang Seongju.

759
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,736
Am I going to get screwed?

760
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,237
Damn it...

761
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,531
My phone.

762
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,202
I think I have to let him know.

763
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,872
[gasps]

764
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,291
Why did you follow me here?

765
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:29,669
- You take my phone and now you're spying?
- Spying?

766
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,590
By any chance,

767
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,717
is this what you need?

768
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:41,014
Go ahead and use it.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Chu.

769
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:42,724
No, it's fine.

770
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:45,227
Fair is fair. We shouldn't defy it.

771
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,563
I appreciate the gesture.

772
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,680
Is there anything wrong?

773
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,182
No.

774
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,059
Get back to work.

775
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,154
[door opens]

776
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,157
Mother.

777
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,534
We have a problem.

778
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,246
What's wrong?
It's not like you to cause a fuss.

779
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,165
Father is trying to take the center.

780
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:49,875
Take it?

781
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:54,045
[sighs] He's changing it so it's
directly under the chairman's authority.

782
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,213
Says who?

783
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,884
Mr. Chu just called me. It'll be announced
during an emergency meeting.

784
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,474
I think it's time to bring it out.

785
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,561
- What will you do?
- What do you mean?

786
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:14,191
I'll show them that Kangoh
doesn't just belong to Kang Joongmo.

787
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,079
[grunts softly]

788
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,792
- Where's the chairman?
- There are no signs of him yet.

789
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,169
[car approaching]

790
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,670
[honking]

791
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,631
What the hell?

792
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,882
[engine revving]

793
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:43,136
[grunts softly] Hey! Wait! Hey!

794
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,721
Move your car out of the way!

795
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,056
That's filthy.

796
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,599
Oh!

797
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:51,102
The owner and this punk! One and the same!

798
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,688
Look at you!

799
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:56,483
- [car revving]
- Hey.

800
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,443
Aren't you uncomfortable in that? Gosh.

801
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,570
So frustrating!

802
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,118
[sighs]

803
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,000
KANGOH RESORT CEO, KANG INJU

804
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,961
[sighs and grunts softly]

805
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:24,928
[sighs] Look at those eyes.

806
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,639
He could shoot lasers from them.

807
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,391
- [scoffs]
- [door opens]

808
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,020
[Joongmo sighs]

809
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,902
Han Taeoh is a man of many hats.

810
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,531
People might think he was Kang Taeoh
instead of Han Taeoh.

811
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,077
[Joongmo] I'm sure you were surprised
when I suddenly called for this meeting.

812
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,289
However, praise should always be given

813
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,501
in front of an audience to mean anything.

814
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,212
Vice President Kang Seongju

815
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,589
has made a great contribution to Kangoh

816
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,508
and everyone here knows that.

817
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,219
He was able to look into the future,

818
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,514
and he established the center
for foreign cooperation

819
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,767
into a mecca
for future innovation technologies.

820
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:16,771
Vice President Kang Seongju's skills
continue to evolve even now.

821
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:21,860
I'm sure everyone is aware
of that fact and what a marvel it is.

822
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:24,821
So despite being my son,
I will put my pride aside

823
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,615
and borrow his skills once more.

824
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:32,287
- Vice President Kang Seongju.
- Yes, sir.

825
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:36,624
Can you revive
the dying Kangoh Securities?

826
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,336
Let's see what you can do.

827
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,921
I'll leave Kangoh Securities to you.

828
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,507
[sighs]

829
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,470
- Chairman...
- This isn't an order as the owner.

830
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,846
This is a sincere request...

831
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,515
as your father.

832
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:56,936
Is it inappropriate to use
my authority as a father at work?

833
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,605
[members] No, sir.

834
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,232
- [man 1] It's fine.
- [man 2] You're not wrong.

835
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,692
[chuckles]

836
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:06,071
As you know,
I don't normally say wrong things.

837
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,490
There's one more thing.

838
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,450
As of today,

839
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,660
the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center

840
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:17,415
will be split-off and reorganized to be
directly under the chairman's authority.

841
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,959
Vice President Kang Seongju,

842
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,588
no, I should call you
President Kang Seongju now.

843
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,090
I will make sure

844
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,051
no one ruins
what President Kang Seongju has created

845
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,720
and try to lead it well.

846
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,849
Seo Wonhae, the current center director,

847
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,769
will be the new team leader
of Kangoh's Synergy Team.

848
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:41,981
The current training center director will
fill the vacant center director position.

849
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,984
I will be appointing Chae Donguk.

850
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,445
[banging]

851
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,007
1 DAY AGO

852
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,300
[â™ª rock music playing over speaker]

853
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,470
[Taeoh] You're playing the role...

854
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,306
of the victim well.

855
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:20,854
You don't like fishing.

856
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:24,399
People can't always do what they like.

857
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,988
Fishing in a run-down spot
on the verge of closing...

858
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,867
with that tacky speaker.

859
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,246
This combination
is often called pretentious.

860
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,540
[Donguk] You wouldn't come all this way

861
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,627
to start a fight with me.

862
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:48,423
You were abandoned by Kang Seongju

863
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,633
and I'm here to revive you.

864
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,011
What are you up to?

865
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,517
I need your anger
against Kang Seongju, Professor.

866
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,021
[exhales]

867

[breathing heavily]

Unfortunately, it's not me.

892

It's up to you whether you believe it
or not. Do whatever you want.
