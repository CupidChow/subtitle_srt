{\an8}Goodness. Thank you again
for attending, sir.

10
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,154
{\an8}The center has achieved
so much over the last five years.

11
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,740
{\an8}I had to come in person to compliment you.

12
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,242
{\an8}Mr. Chae.

13
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,578
{\an8}Do you like the chairman that much?

14
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,705
{\an8}Normally, this punk...

15
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,083
{\an8}I mean...
Weren't you Kang Seongju's person?

16
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,003
{\an8}No, I'm always the chairman's person.

17
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,922
{\an8}Oh.

[Donguk] This is the employee who
wrote the speech you'll be giving today.

20
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,106
Hello.

21
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,316
I work on the global leader training team.

22
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,443
My name is Han Taeoh.

23
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,989
It's so nice to see
a young man with a spirited writing style.

24
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,034
He placed at the top of his class.

25
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,869
What are you doing? Thank him.

26
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,830
Thank you.

00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,129
Everything's ready, sir.

29
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,090
- Shall we go?
- Go ahead.

30
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,634
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

31
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,094
You too.

32
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,139
You stay, young man.

33
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,851
I'll see you at the ceremony.

34
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,770
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

35
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,831
Tell me.

36
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,042
From what you see and feel,
what type of owner am I?

37
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,922
I'm asking because the contents
of your speech have nothing to do with me.

38
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:57,260
By any chance, did you create an image
of what you hoped for in an owner?

39
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,181
- That's right.
- [Joongmo] In other words,

40
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,683
you don't think I'm the ideal owner.

41
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,562
Answer me. What type of owner am I?

42
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,107
If you don't like my answer...

43
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,903
will I be fired?

44
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,531
[chuckles softly]
If I fired you for being cheeky,

45
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,659
wouldn't I be taking a step back
from being an ideal owner?

46
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,789
You...

47
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,960
are fired.

48
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,218
You're going to need me in the future.

49
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,887
Because you first thought of this center?

50
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:45,642
That's why you confidently
asked Mr. Chae to set up this meeting.

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,729
The price for my report.

52
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,898
I'm here to collect.

53
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,193
[Joongmo] <i>Every small or big thing</i>
<i>that happens in Kangoh</i>

54
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,778
<i>is reported to me.</i>

55
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,113
For the past five years,

56
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,242
you didn't raise this center
to its worth of 30 trillion won.

57
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,534
It was my people.

58
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,121
Only...

59
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,000
Only 30 trillion won.

60
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,919
- What?
- [Taeoh] To be honest,

61
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,088
it doesn't matter if you need me or not.

62
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,048
As for me...

63
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,677
I can go somewhere else that needs me
and just create another Kangoh.

64
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,845
I know.

65
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,390
I know you're qualified.

66
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,519
Han Gilsu.

00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,729
[Jisuk] <i>Don't come near!</i>

68
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,315
<i>Don't come near me!</i>
<i>Let go!</i>

69
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,734
Turning your innocent father
into a murderer.

70
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,194
Was that you?

71
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,198
The more a pebble stands out,

72
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,368
it's only natural to wonder
where they're from

73
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,161
or how they grew up.

74
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,544
Innocent person...

75
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,880
So...

76
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,385
So the devil has no sins?

77
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,440
It seems my efforts were futile.

78
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,651
I'll turn in
my letter of resignation today.

79
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,945
It was a short time, but--

80
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,573
[Joongmo] Nothing you can't do.
Nothing you won't do.

81
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,702
Don't feel at ease because you lost
your composure only briefly.

82
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:31,539
Because in that brief moment,
you showed me everything.

83
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,207
It's an inexcusable defeat.

84
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,211
Never let your inner thoughts show
from now on.

85
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,839
Even if you're up against me. Never.

86
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,133
If you want to work for me,

87
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,011
you need to learn to hide your real self.

88
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,769
I'll bear that in mind, Chairman.

89
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,064
Nothing you can't do.
Nothing you won't do.

90
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,733
That's the kind of person
I need most right now. Besides...

91
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,152
I have your weakness now.

92
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,821
It's the icing on the cake.

93

CO-PROSPERITY COOPERATION CENTER

{\an8}In many situations in South Korea,

96
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,666
{\an8}the weak have been forced to make
sacrifices without prior agreement,

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,877

of happiness for the majority.

[microphone turns off]

100
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,692
[Joongmo] Someone told me

101
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,445
about the infinite possibilities
of this center.

102
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,614
Some people may say

103
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,910
that the center is a monster that deceives
and preys on the weak and poor.

104
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,121
Who cares if it's a monster?

105
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,541
Countless of startups emerge
and disappear every day.

106
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,585
We're giving them an opportunity.

107
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,713
Being a part of the center?
Take pride in it.

108
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,590
Monster?

109
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,552
Become a more brutal and thorough monster!

110
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,388
As long as you're a person of Kangoh...

111
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,598
As long as you're one of my people,

112
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,436
prove to everyone that it will soon
become a brand.

113
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,731
Only those who can prove it
can survive in Kangoh.

114
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,110
Instead of offering comfort
with "prosperity" and "cooperation,"

115
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,279
become a monster

116
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,073
and become passionate
about saving something!

117
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,658
That is the purpose

118
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,369
of establishing
the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center.

119
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,956
It's the goal and the reason
to move forward!

120
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,044
He's forcing loyalty and sacrifice.

121
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,713
Kangoh.

122
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,757
It's a place that's worth it.

123
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,885
To those who survived...

124
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,845
I make a promise.

125
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,430
Privileges of Kangoh!

126
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,390
- The pride...
- The pride...

127
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,726
- of being the best.
- [Joongmo] ...of being the best.

128
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:09,447
Center Director Chae Donguk
will be relieved of his position.

129
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,532
He's useless now, so he'll be discarded.

130
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,202
If he's lucky...

131
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,621
he could be recycled.

132
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,545
Will Kang Seongju
naturally succeed the position?

133
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,589
Kang Seongju wants Kangoh's control tower.

134
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,717
To Kang Seongju...

135
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,387
the center is just a shortcut there.

136
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,391
<i>Where all of Kangoh's capital and power</i>
<i>are located.</i>

137
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,062
<i>Where the subsidiaries</i>
<i>and affiliates are managed.</i>

<i>Kangoh Corporation.</i>

141
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,487
<i>That's where...</i>

142
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,240
<i>Kang Seongju wants to be.</i>

143
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,312
As of today, I'll be working beside you.

144
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,773
My name is Han Taeoh.

145
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,821
<i>The real game...</i>

146
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,990
<i>begins now.</i>

147
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,378
FIVE YEARS LATER

148
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,082
Father!

149
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:35,384
- I thought you collapsed.
- Are you disappointed I'm fine?

150
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,095
What happened?

151
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,431
As you can see, I'm eating.
Is there a problem?

152
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,196
But it's strange,

153
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,865
I get this pain in my neck
whenever I see Han Taeoh.

154
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,077
Rumors say that he could be
the youngest chief secretary soon.

155
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,703
So he'll become even cockier?

156
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,456
He's never caused problems
in the last five years.

157
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,625
Father seems satisfied with him.

158
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,251
That's the problem.

159
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,087
Father's too dependent on him.

160
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,171
They're too close.

161
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,299
What if he does something moronic?
It'll ruin us.

162
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,593
President Kang,
you should watch your mouth.

163
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,889
Someone might think you're hoping
for things to go wrong.

164
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,268
When assisting your husband,
don't just focus on the big picture.

165
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,896
Taking care of the small things
applies too.

166
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,482
He's the eldest son of Kangoh.

167
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,194
Make sure he acts like it.
He should watch his mouth and behavior.

168
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,154
Yes, Mother.

169
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,824
[laughing]

170
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,869
Excuse me, Mother?

171
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,459
Speak for yourself.

172
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,212
Before telling my wife
how to assist her husband,

173
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,589
examine how you assist yours.

174
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,508
What are you doing?

175
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,429
Learn some respect
before complaining about your treatment.

176
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,223
Do you think we're the same
just because I talk to you?

177
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,100
- Stay out of it, punk.

[knock on door]

181
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,044
You're ready to be discharged, sir.

182
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,089
Did you tell Director In what I told you?

183
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,008
Don't worry.

184
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,512
What did Kim Sangsu say?

185
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,055
Congressman Kim Sangsu says

186
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,476
there won't be any issues
getting the results you want.

187
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,061
After Kim Sangsu becomes the party leader,

188
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,605
we'll work on his presidency.

189
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:56,484
After that...
the Royal Road Project finally begins.

190
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,239
On the west coast,
I'm thinking of building a large city.

191
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,324
ONE YEAR AGO

192
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,619
A mega project which is
a hundred times bigger than Kangoh City.

193
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,624
I'm going to build a country
inside the country of Korea.

194
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,919
Do you think my dream...

195
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,546
is absurd as well?

196
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,465
At Kangoh,

197
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,135
we have the greatest resource,
the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center.

198
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,389
The center will make your dream come true.

199
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,061
[Joongmo] <i>Kangoh will become a country.</i>

200
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,816
The west coast site that'll make
my dream come true has been purchased.

201
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,401
We just have to break ground.

202
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,831
A paraplegic patient...

203
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,584
uses the HMD, a head mounted display,

204
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,712
on their head like this.

205
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:03,300
Through it, this paralyzed dad can go
to the playground with his kids.

206
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,179
A paralyzed high school student
can play basketball with friends,

207
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,347
play games,

208
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:13,269
and all of those things
can even feel real.

209
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,897
Also... What's more...

210
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,191
Did you steal it?

211
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,653
- Excuse me?
- How can someone forget the contents

212
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,863
of their development?

213
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,407
- Well, the thing is...
- [Inha slams table]

214
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,703
Doctor,

215
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,456
we're not helping you practice
your presentation because we're bored.

216
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,375
- Yes, but...
- You said that next year

217
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,128
Kangoh Electronics DMC will be merged
with the software center.

218
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,841
We're not just helping because
our team is pro-DMC.

219
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,386
We put our team's life and soul
into this project.

220
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,470
[bangs]

221
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,889
That's what I'm trying to say.

222
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,517
You worked so hard on your research.

223
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,686
Shouldn't it come to light?

224
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,772
Unless you want to kill
your precious baby,

225
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,399
you should try to keep it alive!

226
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,529
- I apologize.
- Again with that!

227
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,906
Stop saying you're sorry!

228
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,616
[cell phone vibrates]

229
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,742
Seriously.

233
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,962
Now.

234
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,505
I got too worked up.

235
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,759
Sorry. I want to apologize to everyone.
Let's do this!

236
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,260
- We can do it!
- We can do it!

237
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,345
We can do it!

238
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,221
We can do it.

239
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,141
[Hyewon] It's the last official event
before the party conference.

240
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,310
We have to pay attention to every detail.

241
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,772
And how about mentioning children
when talking about the fine dust?

242
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:44,068
Instead of "young people,"
call them "struggling job seekers."

243
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,279
Make it to be employees being laid off
for the minimum wage increase

244
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,323
and show pity to small business owners.

245
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,408
Good, much more appealing.

247

There's nothing like this
to relieve stress.

- [Seongju] Of course.
- [man] Not to mention,

00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,017
it's fun shooting it.

In five days,
at the Hanmi Party Conference,

279
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,987
Jo Sundong will be appointed
against the chairman's intent,

280
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,409
which will open the doors to attacks
on the Royal Road Project as futile.

281
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,454
So Jo Sundong was picked
to be the one to carry the weight?

282
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,500
What's Kang Seongju voting
for with the center?

[cell phone vibrates]

284
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,672
That's what we need to figure out
while he's drunk with victory.

285
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,549
Must be nice.

286
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,136
His first victory against my father.
I bet it'll taste sweet.

287
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,679
[Hyewon] There's more.

Kang Seongju's the first guest
for the Blue House Talk Concert.

289
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:07,062
Oh Gyeongcheol texted me to pick a topic
and prepare the script.

290
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,858
A tribute for Kang Seongju
on behalf of Jo Sundong?

291
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,693
Kang Seongju could've requested it first.

292
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,279
In exchange for making him a party leader?

293
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,365
As the starting point for future costs.

294
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,491
What if...

295
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,871
the chairman finds out
about their secret deals?

296
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,832
How much and to what extent
will Mr. Kang's punishment be?

297
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,168
I'm looking forward to it.

298
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,503
Kang Seongju won't just accept
the punishment.

299
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,465
He'll do whatever he can to try and break
the absolute and universal law

300
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,926
that Kangoh is Kang Joongmo.

Jo Sundong, that bastard!

331

He'll instigate and fuel the madness
and try to tear Kangoh apart.

How long has he been planning

333

in the shadows after I abandoned him?

334
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,548
I should've taken care of him back then!

00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,095
[Hyewon] What face do you think
Chairman Kang will make

353
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,598
when he finds out Congressman Jo
was nominated,

354
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,434
and the fact that you already knew?

355
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,437
It wasn't just me.
We already knew together.

356
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,275
Leave me out of there.

357
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,486
I don't exist to Chairman Kang yet.

358
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,113
Aren't you considering marrying Inha?

359
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,160
[chuckles softly]

360
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,579
Did I get ahead of myself?

361
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,331
I told him I wasn't ready yet.

362
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,916
Not yet.

363
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,543
"Not yet"?

364
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,007
"Not yet" it is.

365
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,485
[Hyewon sighs]

366
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,987
I know now is more important than ever.

367
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,073
I just want us to be careful.

368
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,699
It is important.

369
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,495
As important as it is,
it'll only get harder for us

370
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,415
if we don't catch Kang Seongju now.

371
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,918
Chairman Kang bought the site
for Royal Road.

372
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,796
Kangoh Group poured in funds from within.

373
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,257
There are no problems if you win,

374
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,428
but if you lose,
it's breach of trust and embezzlement.

375
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,848
You'll find something
if you dig into Oh Gyeongcheol.

376
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,975
Being the guest on the talk show

377
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,644
was Oh Gyeongcheol's idea,
not Congressman Jo's.

378
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,606
Two days.

379
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,567
Bring me concrete facts...

380
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,820
in two days.

381
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,952
A RELIABLE WORKER WHO WORKS
WITH THE PEOPLE, JO SUNDONG

382
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,509
[clears throat]

383
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,808
[both chuckle softly]

384
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,394
[man inhales sharply and exhales]

385
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,277
[inhales sharply]

386
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,113
Do you have something to say to me?

387
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,657
- Yes.
- What is it?

388
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,535
I know you're not pleased with me.

389
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,786
Oh.

390
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,206
[in English] And?

391
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,000
I don't know what the general manager
said to you,

392
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,212
- but it's probably true.
- [in Korean] Is that so?

393
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,631
- If you don't like me because of that...
- [snaps]

394
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,886
You were a great reporter in Gwanghwamun.
The district office is different, right?

395
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,223
Being a social affairs reporter
is close to manual labor.

396
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:20,185
- I'm well-trained in most things.
- Of course. Sure.

397
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,980
Secretary Na, the reason I don't like you

398
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,233
isn't because of Mr. Yu.

399
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,612
So there's another reason
you're displeased with me?

400
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,281
I've been through a lot of hardships
in politics,

401
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,450
and I've studied many people.

402
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,036
I can conclude from my research...

403
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,623
that no matter how hard you try
to hide yourself,

404
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,585
most people have a gap
they don't know about.

405
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,712
[snaps] Through that,

406
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,423
others can see inside.

407
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,471
But it's strange. I can't see through you.

408
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,059
I don't trust people I can't see through.

409
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,524
Mmm. There's another person
who's like that. Do you know who?

410
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:12,070
[chuckles softly] Congressman Jo Sundong?

411
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,739
[man chuckles]

412
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,325
[laughing]

413
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,371
Wow, I may not trust you,
but you'd make a great drinking buddy.

414
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,872
- [chuckles]
- [chuckles softly]

415
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,917
Ah. Some of the aides
are getting together later

416
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,336
to celebrate the conference
at an afterparty.

417
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,046
Would you like to come?

418
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,466
- I'm sorry. I have plans today.
- [man] Really?

419
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,261
- [chuckles] I'm off.
- Okay.

420
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,350
[door closes]

421
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,145
Are you out of your mind?

422
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,439
Who? Ko Huichan?

423
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,566
Huiju, calm down.

424
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,650
Are you insane?

425
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,571
I'm not deaf. Take it easy.

426
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,823
Does it look like I can right now?

427
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,700
Ko Huichan? Are you kidding me?

428
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,868
Miss!

429
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,663
- Are you going to argue with your mother?
- Stay out of it!

430
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,911
[sighs]

431
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,245
I'll be outside.

432
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:06,184
- Why do I have to hear about Ko Huichan?
- Chairman Ko of Daejong adores you.

433
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,895
Let's go ahead
with the engagement first...

434
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,314
- Mom.
- He wants to hold the wedding next year.

435
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,942
[chuckles] I know. So why?

436
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,070
I like Huichan. He's gentle and funny.

437
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,030
You really don't know what he's like?

438
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,283
Everyone knows about the trouble he caused
in the States!

439
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,412
Everyone gets a little lost
when they're young.

440
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,790
- The present is what's important.
- Whatever. I don't care.

441
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,876
Judging from the rumors I heard,
he's still just a child.

442
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,795
[clicks tongue]

443
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,004
Watch your mouth.

444
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,424
A forced marriage.

445
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,759
I won't do it.

446
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,680
Is there anyone in our family
who wasn't forced into marriage?

447
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,306
That's why everyone's miserable.

448
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,642
Do you want me to live miserably like you?

449
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,687
- Kang Huiju.
- I don't want that for me.

450
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,773
If you force this...

451
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,527
I'll die.

452
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,739
And I mean it.

453
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,872
- [sighs]
- [door opens and closes]

454
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,876
[line connects]

455
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,129
Is Ko Huichan back from the States?
Find out where he hangs out.

456
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,090
- [sighs]
- [line disconnects]

457
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,010
I'd never agree to an arranged marriage.
I'm not crazy.

458
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,732
CONTACTS

459
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,275
TAEOH

460
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,573
[sighs]

461
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:56,836
Did you come alone?

462
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,715
Impressive. [chuckles]

463
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,051
This way.

464
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,846
[man 1] <i>It's for real, starting now.</i>

465
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,351
Management rights will go to Kang Seongju,
Chairman Kang will be ousted before that,

466
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,355
and all of that will be achieved by us.

467
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,106
- Okay?
- And the old man,

468
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,194
wants to know
how much he can trust Kang Seongju.

469
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,363
Either way, he's Chairman Kang's son.

470
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,907
When the time comes,
won't he take his dad's side?

471
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,576
When that time comes...

472
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,162
there's a saying that goes...

473
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,458
"Once you're in too deep,
it's hard to pull out."

474
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:40,255
Those types of people
are scared of the word "losing" the most.

475
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,632
- Aren't I right? Especially...
- [men chuckle]

476
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,552
...when it comes to money.

477
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,264
[knocking on door]

478
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,892
- Gentlemen, your dish is ready.
- [man 3] Come on in.

479
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,812
[man 1] Now, let's have a drink.

480
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,730
Let's drink something strong.

481
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,566
- [chuckles]
- [faint beeping]

482
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,484
[man 4] It's going
to go down smooth tonight.

483
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,844
[cell phone vibrates]

484
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,268
[Hyewon] <i>Come to Inha's place.</i>

485
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,858
Kang Seongju will put Jo Sundong
at the forefront

486
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,652
and try to control
the National Assembly's MOEL and MOLIT.

487
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,323
They'll use their power to advance
the Royal Road Project

488
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,951
despite Kangoh's financial collapse
and the resulting economic crisis.

489
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,163
Furthermore, they'll try to brand them
as an evil dictatorship.

490
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,625
After they destroy the Royal Road Project,

491
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,920
they'll name Chairman Kang
for embezzlement and negligence.

492
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,090
<i>We've already anticipated that much.</i>

493
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,719
<i>But the real deal starts now.</i>

494
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,889
<i>After they successfully oust</i>
<i>Chairman Kang,</i>

495
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:16,559
<i>the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center</i>
<i>will be separated from Kangoh</i>

496
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,478
<i>which is the start of Kang Seongju's plan.</i>

497
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:22,106
- Wait, what?
- The center's separation and independence.

498
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,025
But that's not all.

499
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,570
Energy chemistry, communications,
and logistic services.

500
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,655
Also, electronics.

501
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,742
That's the portfolio of the subsidiaries
that'll be formed with the center,

502
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,203
wrapped to look like a good cause

503
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,830
for increased autonomy
and responsible management.

504
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,291
Transition to a holding company...

505
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,252
That was Kang Seongju's goal.

506
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,630
He'll try to steal the core of Kangoh.

507
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,716
The center's the main part,
not Kangoh Holdings.

508
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,636
But he's going to accelerate it.

509
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,848
He'll make Jo Sundong the owner
with the Blue House on his back.

510
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:57,934
This is just...

511
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,978
- [glasses clink]
- [Seongju chuckles]

512
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,813
[Inha] <i>We can't compete with that.</i>

513
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,482
- [Hyewon] <i>You're right.</i>
- [Seongju exhales]

514
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,902
[Hyewon] <i>They have almost a 100% chance</i>
<i>of their plan succeeding first.</i>

515
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,946
I understand. Thank you.

516
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,739
Do you really think...

517
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,618
- Kang Seongju will beat us?
- That's what the results show.

518
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,786
There are other ways.

519
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,332
We can persuade Chairman Kang
to secede the center first.

520
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,919
- Well?
- Chairman Kang won't give up the center.

521
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,297
We don't have the justification or power

522
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,175
- to change his mind yet.
- [Inha] So what?

523
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,553
- Do we just sit back and watch?
- Why would we do that?

524
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,764
In the end, we'll complete our goal.

525
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,100
Congressman Jo won't get into
the Blue House.

526
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:43,021
He's bait to provoke Chairman Kang
to get rid of Kang Seongju.

527
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,357
That's the role I've decided
for Jo Sundong.

528
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,818
So trust me.

529
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,446
Jo Sundong and Kang Seongju...

530
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:56,034
won't be able to take anything they want.

531
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,036
- [clinks]
- [both laugh]

532
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:00,997
As long as I'm here.

533
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,000
[reading] Save Africa.

534
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,670
It's an African refugee relief
organization run by Jang Noik Foundation.

535
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,005
Jang Noik Foundation.

536
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,049
I know it well.

537
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,843
Anyway, these foundations are the problem.

538
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,555
But if it weren't
a problematic foundation,

539
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,933
we wouldn't have been able to meet at all.

540
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,017
On that note...

541
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,271
should we be thanking
the Kangoh Art Foundation?

542
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,443
[slurps]

543
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,161
I should've come to the hospital,

544
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,455
but there are eyes watching me.

545
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:28,584
I thought it'd be a hassle for you,
so I asked you to come here.

546
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,670
As I've said before,

547
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:35,133
there are no issues with the chairman
aside from his blood pressure.

548
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,551
I know that.

549
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,178
I'm sure you will do well.

550
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,101
Drink it.

551
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,603
[grunts softly]

552
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,773
I'm very busy right now...

553
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:55,695
I need to prepare for the 10th-anniversary
symposium for the Heart Transplant Center.

554
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,071
It's concerning to me.

555
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,490
[Geumseok] I hear your son

556
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:04,078
was admitted into rehab
for drug addiction.

557
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,212
It's been a while since he was fired
from Johns Hopkins.

558
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,882
Yet you've already decided to have him

559
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,468
as the next head of surgery
at Kangoh Hospital?

560
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,930
What do you intend to do?

561
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,401
[Taeoh] I have confirmed that a villa
was purchased

562
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,653
under Congressman Jo's daughter's name

563
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,988
in San Sebastian, Spain.

564
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:43,367
I also confirmed a cash deposit
of $5 million

565
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,287
to his daughter's Swiss bank account
two days after that.

566
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,959
Did you track it?

567
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,337
- Yes.
- Who is it?

568
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,006
Save Africa,
an African refugee relief organization,

569
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,717
laundered donations
meant for South Sudanese refugees

570
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,637
- and transferred them to a Swiss account.
- Save Africa?

571
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,891
Jang Noik Foundation?

572
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,477
- Yes.
- Behind that

573
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,187
will be Kangoh Art Foundation.

574
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,314
Yes.

575
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,401
Then the brains behind it
will be Director Jang Geumseok.

576
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,155
Whoever gets the center gets Kangoh.

577
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,284
So do they call it Kang Seongju's center?

578
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,288
The Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center
is part of the Synergy Team.

579
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,040
The Synergy Team's team leader

580
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,668
is Senior Executive VP Kang Seongju.

581
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,338
So saying the center belongs to him...

582
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,799
would be correct, right?

583
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,551
What's more...

584
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,137
- [gun fires]
- [shatters]

585
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,181

587
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,020
Director Jang!

588
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,939
You're a sniper.

589
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,608
Shooting suits me better than golf.

590
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,278
Incredible! [laughs]

591
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,197
Have you been busy lately?

592
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,866
Isn't it my job to be busy?

593
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,201
- [laughs]
- [chuckles]

594
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,078
Mother.

595
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,163
You're here.

596
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,751
KANGOH MILL

597
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,671
[Seongju] Chairman Kang Minguk
was the first chairman of Kangoh,

598
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,507
and he loved Kangoh Mill.

599
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,719
As far as I can remember,

600
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:29,181
he used to come here before a big event
and get lost in thought for some time.

601
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,228
My grandfather always lived by this motto,
"You may fail,

602
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,773
but you can't make any mistakes."

603
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,360
The former chairman's
management philosophies were well known.

604
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,989
Did you bring me here to tell me that?

605
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,203
However, the current chairman,
Kang Joongmo,

606
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:57,251
is trying to change those teachings
with dogmatism and self-righteousness.

607
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,297
That's why...

608
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,217
I thought we could come together...

609
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:12,600
and try to realign the spirit of Kangoh
that my grandfather had established.

610
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,981
I need the backstory of Milton's birth
from 10 years ago...

611
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,903
as evidence for embezzlement
and breach of trust against Chairman Kang.

612
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,616
- I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
- Mr. Chu.

613
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,037
You heard me.
How can you pretend like you didn't?

614
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,375
I misjudged you.

615
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,629
[sighs]

616
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,007
How much longer
will you be my father's avatar?

617
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:49,929
After a while, will you let Han Taeoh
take away that role as well?

618
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,056
I don't care who you are.

619
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,476
I won't forgive you
for running your mouth.

620
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,062
Mr. Chu.

621
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,942
I meant what I said.

622
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,195
Seeing your skills

623
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:09,949
being used as a puppet for Kangoh
is sincerely such a waste.

624
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,164
[sighs]

625
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,000

maybe the purpose of Milton Law Firm

00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:13,979
Always keep in mind the big picture
Jo Sundong has drawn for you.

698
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,981
[inhales sharply]

699
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:18,400
Let's be honest.
That big picture isn't for me.

700
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,778
It's for himself.

701
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:24,823
Whether that big picture
is for you or him,

702
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,617
he's someone we need.

703
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,578
We still have a long way to go.
Don't let your guard down.

704
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,042
- I understand.
- Just become the owner of Kangoh.

705
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,378
You can do anything you want after that.

706
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:42,508
We can change the president
a thousand times over if you want.

707
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,738
Call Chu Hyeokjin.

708
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,457
[line ringing]

709
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,293
I'll put Chairman Kang on.

710
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,047
What?

711
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,885
Okay.

712
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,136
I'll be right there.

713
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,101
HAN TAEOH

714
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,566
[car honks]

715
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:50,826
[chuckles softly]

716
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,204
When did you get here?

717
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,622
You should've called.

718
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,165
I would've come out sooner.

719
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,711
- Let's go see the ocean.
- Right now?

720
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,379
[chuckles softly]

721
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,007
[waves splashing]

722
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,225
It's a perfect ocean.

723
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,687
It is a perfect ocean.

724
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:21,940
[sighs]

725
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,070
This is nice.

726
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:32,993
Let's get married.

727
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,580
I want to get married.

728
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,172
[chuckles softly]

729
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,508
Okay, let's get married.

730
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,095
The day you proudly enter Bisunjae.

731
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,390
We're almost there.

732
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,600
[Inha chuckles softly]

733
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,189
[sighs]

734
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:06,026
Do you believe Taeoh's plan
will be a complete success?

735
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,778
No.

736
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:18,538
I trust you, Kang Inha.

737
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,415
[Inha chuckles softly]

738
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,042
[chuckles softly]

739
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,754
[exclaims] Sweet!

740
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,884
[Joongmo] Why are you so surprised?

741
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,304
I came for what's mine.
Is that so surprising?

742
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,390
No, sir.

743
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:43,855
Get rid of any legal issues that could
arise from reassigning the center.

744
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,608
- by tomorrow morning.
- [all] Yes, sir.

745
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,406
Mr. Chu, you don't seem happy.

746
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,573
Of course not.

747
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,826
How could I dare interfere?

748
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,458
Everyone,
I hope there are no misunderstandings.

749
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:08,505
As each case is unique,
we must prevent any unintentional leaks.

750
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:11,800
I will hold onto your phones
until after the meeting.

751
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,064
Mr. Chu?

752
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:27,774
Yeah.

753
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,408
{\an8}CHU HYEOKJIN

754
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:44,082
If you look at the graph here,
department stores and network start-ups

755
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,667
have a much higher return.

756
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,175
[people speaking indistinctly]

757
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,555
[sighs]

758
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:07,731
This is Chairman Kang delivering
a fatal blow to Kang Seongju.

759
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,736
Am I going to get screwed?

760
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,237
Damn it...

761
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,531
My phone.

762
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,202
I think I have to let him know.

763
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,872
[gasps]

764
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,291
Why did you follow me here?

765
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:29,669
- You take my phone and now you're spying?
- Spying?

766
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,590
By any chance,

767
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,717
is this what you need?

768
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:41,014
Go ahead and use it.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Chu.

769
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:42,724
No, it's fine.

770
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:45,227
Fair is fair. We shouldn't defy it.

771
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,563
I appreciate the gesture.

772
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,680
Is there anything wrong?

773
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,182
No.

774
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,059
Get back to work.

775
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,154
[door opens]

776
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,157
Mother.

777
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,534
We have a problem.

778
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,246
What's wrong?
It's not like you to cause a fuss.

779
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,165
Father is trying to take the center.

780
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:49,875
Take it?

781
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:54,045
[sighs] He's changing it so it's
directly under the chairman's authority.

782
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,213
Says who?

783
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,884
Mr. Chu just called me. It'll be announced
during an emergency meeting.

784
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,474
I think it's time to bring it out.

785
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,561
- What will you do?
- What do you mean?

786
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:14,191
I'll show them that Kangoh
doesn't just belong to Kang Joongmo.

787
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,079
[grunts softly]

788
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,792
- Where's the chairman?
- There are no signs of him yet.

789
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,169
[car approaching]

790
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,670
[honking]

791
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,631
What the hell?

792
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,882
[engine revving]

793
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:43,136
[grunts softly] Hey! Wait! Hey!

794
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,721
Move your car out of the way!

795
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,056
That's filthy.

796
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,599
Oh!

797
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:51,102
The owner and this punk! One and the same!

798
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,688
Look at you!

799
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:56,483
- [car revving]
- Hey.

800
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,443
Aren't you uncomfortable in that? Gosh.

801
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,570
So frustrating!

802
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,118
[sighs]

803
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,000
KANGOH RESORT CEO, KANG INJU

804
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,961
[sighs and grunts softly]

805
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:24,928
[sighs] Look at those eyes.

806
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,639
He could shoot lasers from them.

807
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,391
- [scoffs]
- [door opens]

808
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,020
[Joongmo sighs]

809
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,902
Han Taeoh is a man of many hats.

810
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,531
People might think he was Kang Taeoh
instead of Han Taeoh.

811
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,077
[Joongmo] I'm sure you were surprised
when I suddenly called for this meeting.

812
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,289
However, praise should always be given

813
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,501
in front of an audience to mean anything.

814
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,212
Vice President Kang Seongju

815
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,589
has made a great contribution to Kangoh

816
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,508
and everyone here knows that.

817
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,219
He was able to look into the future,

818
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,514
and he established the center
for foreign cooperation

819
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,767
into a mecca
for future innovation technologies.

820
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:16,771
Vice President Kang Seongju's skills
continue to evolve even now.

821
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:21,860
I'm sure everyone is aware
of that fact and what a marvel it is.

822
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:24,821
So despite being my son,
I will put my pride aside

823
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,615
and borrow his skills once more.

824
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:32,287
- Vice President Kang Seongju.
- Yes, sir.

825
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:36,624
Can you revive
the dying Kangoh Securities?

826
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,336
Let's see what you can do.

827
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,921
I'll leave Kangoh Securities to you.

828
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,507
[sighs]

829
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,470
- Chairman...
- This isn't an order as the owner.

830
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,846
This is a sincere request...

831
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,515
as your father.

832
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:56,936
Is it inappropriate to use
my authority as a father at work?

833
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,605
[members] No, sir.

834
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,232
- [man 1] It's fine.
- [man 2] You're not wrong.

835
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,692
[chuckles]

836
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:06,071
As you know,
I don't normally say wrong things.

837
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,490
There's one more thing.

838
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,450
As of today,

839
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,660
the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center

840
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:17,415
will be split-off and reorganized to be
directly under the chairman's authority.

841
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,959
Vice President Kang Seongju,

842
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,588
no, I should call you
President Kang Seongju now.

843
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,090
I will make sure

844
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,051
no one ruins
what President Kang Seongju has created

845
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,720
and try to lead it well.

846
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,849
Seo Wonhae, the current center director,

847
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,769
will be the new team leader
of Kangoh's Synergy Team.

848
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:41,981
The current training center director will
fill the vacant center director position.

849
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,984
I will be appointing Chae Donguk.

850
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,445

851

853

[Taeoh] You're playing the role...

854
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,306
of the victim well.

855
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:20,854
You don't like fishing.

856
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:24,399
People can't always do what they like.

857
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,988
Fishing in a run-down spot
on the verge of closing...

858
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,867
with that tacky speaker.

859
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,246
This combination
is often called pretentious.

860
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,540
[Donguk] You wouldn't come all this way

861
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,627
to start a fight with me.

862
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:48,423
You were abandoned by Kang Seongju

863
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,633
and I'm here to revive you.

864
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,011
What are you up to?

865
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,517
I need your anger
against Kang Seongju, Professor.

Then you come here

Unfortunately, it's not me.

892

It's up to you whether you believe it
or not. Do whatever you want.
