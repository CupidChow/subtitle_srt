THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:06,891
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:07,285 --> 00:00:08,828
If I asked you to help me,

4
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:12,790
would you?

5
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:21,966
No.

6
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:25,678
Never.

7
00:00:29,182 --> 00:00:30,600
But I won't get in your way.

8
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:33,858
As long as I don't get
in your way either, yes?

9
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:38,566
I'm off.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,989
Even if you don't want to,
you'll end up helping me.

11
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:13,912
Where were you?

12
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:16,581
Do you have a talent
for surprising people?

13
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:19,667
The fact that you're surprised
means you're tired.

14
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:21,878
Do you want me to get you some medicine?

15
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:23,880
Why did you come back here?

16
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:25,423
I don't like sleeping alone.

17
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:28,134
I'm spending the night here.

18
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:56,704
Can I invite Inha to the Saturday dinner?

19
00:02:57,497 --> 00:02:58,790
I miss him.

20
00:02:58,873 --> 00:03:00,708
Why would you call him here?

21
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,752
Honey, be careful.

22
00:03:02,836 --> 00:03:04,337
Inha's part of our family, too.

23
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,047
Hey! Who says he's family?

24
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:10,593
- I have a name, and it's not "hey".
- How dare you speak to me like that!

25
00:03:10,677 --> 00:03:12,846
The chairman is still eating.

26
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:17,100
Inha deserves to come.

27
00:03:17,183 --> 00:03:18,351
- Right?
- Huiju.

28
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:20,937
How are you supposed to act at the table?

29
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,773
Daddy!

30
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:28,653
Mr. Moon.

31
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:30,989
Yes, sir.

32
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:34,284
Find out if Inha has plans.

33
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:35,368
Honey.

34
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:47,422
She wasn't thinking straight.

35
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:48,798
He's still my bloodline.

36
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:51,718
- He can come once.
- Once will become twice.

37
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:53,219
And it'll become a third.

38
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:55,847
There's no reason he can't come here.

39
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,016
Also, I don't need your permission.

40
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:01,686
Did you forget?

41
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,938
The promise you made me
when you brought him.

42
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:06,024
I did everything you wanted.

43
00:04:07,108 --> 00:04:10,528
- Like what?
- The inheritance waiver.

44
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:12,947
Did you think I wouldn't know?

45
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:18,870
Is that why you're acting like this?

46
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:21,080
Everything related to Kangoh Group

47
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:23,833
is decided by me.

48
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:25,043
In other words,

49
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:28,046
you just want me to keep my mouth shut.

50
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:31,549
- As I've done so far, and from now on...
<i>- Hello?</i>

51
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,051
It's me.

52
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:36,012
<i>Have you been well?</i>

53
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:39,599
I'll get straight to the point.

54
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,061
<i>Dinner this Saturday at Bisunjae.</i>

55
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:44,187
<i>Come.</i>

56
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,940
<i>Are you listening?</i>

57
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:48,691
Yes, I'm listening.

58
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:50,652
<i>I'll see you</i>
<i>at Bisunjae on Saturday.</i>

59
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,701
Let's go.

60
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,870
I got a call from Bisunjae.

61
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,085
The chairman himself called.

62
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,049
Well, I expected him to call,
but he's moving faster than I thought.

63
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:21,599
You can tear it apart or burn it,

64
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:23,101
do whatever you want.

65
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:39,409
INHERITANCE WAIVER

66
00:05:40,827 --> 00:05:42,412
<i>Chairman Kang Joongmo.</i>

67
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:44,831
To put it nicely, he's cold-hearted.

68
00:05:45,748 --> 00:05:47,125
To put it honestly,

69
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:48,918
he's cold-blooded.

70
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,548
Your mother used her authority
and upset him.

71
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,551
Before the succession was complete,

72
00:05:56,885 --> 00:06:00,513
the chairman probably had planned
to get the inheritance waiver from you.

73
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,223
Are you saying the chairman

74
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:05,185
thinks no differently
than my mother at Bisunjae?

75
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:07,687
Probably.

76
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:12,066
He's being friendly towards you

77
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,777
to punish your mother
for stealing his initiative.

78
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:17,113
As if he wants Jang Geumseok to see.

79
00:06:17,197 --> 00:06:19,491
It seems the chairman's kindness

80
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:22,410
won't last long.

81
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:23,912
It's just for now.

82
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:25,497
Damn it.

83
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:32,337
Someone who's innocent

84
00:06:33,588 --> 00:06:34,881
but not naive.

85
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:38,468
Someone who knows their place

86
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:40,386
and the extent of their reach.

87
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,638
And of course,

88
00:06:42,555 --> 00:06:44,766
this person
won't get greedy in the future.

89
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:46,768
This person...

90
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,938
is Kang Inha.

91
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:54,192
You just have to imprint that version
into their heads.

92
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:57,320
Then they'll take care of the rest.

93
00:06:57,403 --> 00:06:58,905
"Innocent."

94
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:01,741
"But not naive."

95
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,326
I know it won't be easy,

96
00:07:05,203 --> 00:07:06,538
but I trust you can do it.

97
00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:19,801
INHERITANCE WAIVER

98
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:23,263
Is there anything else related
to Kangoh Group that I don't know of?

99
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:25,807
I'm sorry. That's all, sir.

100
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,101
Yes. That's how it should be.

101
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:30,770
You shouldn't do anything else

102
00:07:30,854 --> 00:07:33,189
to betray my faith again.

103
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,568
There's a law firm in Singapore, Milton.

104
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:39,320
I'm thinking of signing them
as the new legal counsel.

105
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:44,784
It looks like you heard something
about Milton.

106
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:47,162
The thing is...

107
00:07:48,413 --> 00:07:52,208
- I heard they'll be sold off...
- What you're thinking is right, Mr. Chu.

108
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,546
I will have Milton.

109
00:07:57,297 --> 00:07:59,466
Milton will be a big weapon

110
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:02,093
to help grow Kangoh bigger than it is now.

111
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:06,097
Of course, the official relationship
between Kangoh and Milton

112
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:09,017
will be established for legal purposes
between Party A and B.

113
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:11,186
That's all.

114
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:19,569
If by chance

115
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:23,156
this hidden truth is leaked,

116
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:27,619
I'll be certain that the source
is you, Attorney Chu.

117
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,918
How long have you worked for me?

118
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:36,985
It's been 19 years, sir.

119
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:38,296
Nineteen years.

120
00:08:39,672 --> 00:08:41,299
It's time for a change.

121
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:47,222
I'll put Milton in your hands.

122
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:49,557
Try to turn it into a proper spear.

123
00:08:51,643 --> 00:08:54,854
Thank you, sir! Thank you!

124
00:08:55,563 --> 00:08:57,023
That's enough.

125
00:08:57,106 --> 00:09:00,902
I want you to be in charge of this waiver
and hold onto it.

126
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:03,446
- Excuse me?
- I don't know when,

127
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:06,366
but won't we need it one day?

128
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,535
Absolutely, sir.

129
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:14,040
I will keep this quiet, too.

130
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:26,427
KANGOH'S INVESTMENT VALUE

131
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:34,227
Is this...

132
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,855
The ultimate weapon
to make you the owner of Kangoh.

133
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:38,898
Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center.

134
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,901
That will
be the future of Kangoh.

135
00:09:44,404 --> 00:09:45,864
"The future of Kangoh."

136
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:56,833
For now,
turn in your letter of resignation.

137
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,543
Center Director Chae Donguk.

138
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,088
Thank you for believing in me.

139
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:05,049
I'll build a strong foundation,

140
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:08,761
and I'll present you with the perfect
Co-prosperity Cooperation Center.

141
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:10,972
Chairman Kang Seongju.

142
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:14,642
Before you enter Kangoh,

143
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:17,520
you should learn how to speak
with caution.

144
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:21,065
I'll be careful.

145
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:24,611
Drop me off here.

146
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:29,699
Stay. I'll give you a ride.

147
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:31,993
It's hard to park there. Just go.

148
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:33,953
Hey. Wait.

149
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:35,872
Be careful.

150
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:37,957
Hey! Wait!

151
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:43,379
Can't he quit working
at the construction site?

152
00:10:47,217 --> 00:10:49,511
HUIJU

153
00:10:49,594 --> 00:10:51,179
I don't believe it!

154
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:54,682
Are you that happy to hear from me?

155
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:57,602
Of course. Why wouldn't I be?

156
00:10:57,685 --> 00:10:58,812
It's been so long.

157
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:01,231
I'm on my way to tea lessons.

158
00:11:01,314 --> 00:11:03,650
Tea lessons at this hour.
Can you believe it?

159
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:06,903
Instead of my tutor's ugly face,

160
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:09,989
I'd rather see your handsome face!

161
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:12,617
Shall I buy you dinner?

162
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:16,746
I'll call my tutor! I'll say I have
a runny nose, cough, and a fever!

163
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,331
Miss...

164
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:23,586
Dinner's not enough.

165
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,380
You're indebted to me.

166
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:28,258
<i>The dinner on Saturday.</i>

167
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:29,926
<i>I begged Daddy to invite you.</i>

168
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:34,180
Ah. Did you?

169
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:37,976
Thanks, Huiju.

170
00:11:38,643 --> 00:11:40,103
<i>What? Is that all?</i>

171
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:43,189
<i>I'm hungry so come to Daejong Hotel.</i>

172
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:44,941
<i>I want something expensive!</i>

173
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:46,693
<i>Inha!</i>

174
00:11:46,776 --> 00:11:48,027
<i>Inha?</i>

175
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:18,391
<i>Hello, my sister.</i>
<i>Long time no see.</i>

176
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:20,393
You came empty-handed?

177
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:23,438
I thought you'd bring me a thank you gift.

178
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:32,906
- Tell me if you want anything.
- If I do, will you get it for me?

179
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:35,992
Don't you think Kang Huiju
is capable of that?

180
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:40,246
Right? Our father's daughter, Kang Huiju.

181
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,127
Won't you get punished by Mother
for skipping your lesson?

182
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:47,754
Mr. Lee just needs to keep quiet.

183
00:12:47,837 --> 00:12:49,631
- And your tutor?
- Thanks to me,

184
00:12:49,714 --> 00:12:51,674
he gets paid for doing nothing today!

185
00:12:51,758 --> 00:12:52,926
A free ride.

186
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:55,512
There's no reason to tell on me.

187
00:12:58,223 --> 00:13:00,391
What were you doing?

188
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,644
- It's a secret.
- Whatever.

189
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,229
Excuse me.

190
00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:05,730
Sure.

191
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:11,903
Do you know her?

192
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:13,363
What?

193
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,199
Ah. She's a friend.

194
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:17,909
Is this where you work?

195
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:22,664
- Hello.
- Hello.

196
00:13:23,414 --> 00:13:25,542
If you're Inha's friend,
do you know Taeoh?

197
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,586
- Uh...
- If you're talking about Han Taeoh,

198
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,963
yes, I know him.

199
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:32,924
I don't like my person
having women around them.

200
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:35,218
Kang Huiju.

201
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:37,846
I'm just kidding!

202
00:13:38,388 --> 00:13:41,266
- You know I'm joking, right?
- I understand even if you weren't.

203
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:44,811
I don't like women around my person, too.

204
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:52,152
Take this. I don't need it.

205
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:55,947
- Black bean noodles.
- You like the seafood course.

206
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,407
Isn't that why we're here?

207
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,783
Is that all?

208
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,785
Let's be honest. Daejong has better

209
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:04,372
- Chinese restaurants than Kangoh.
- But you'll order the noodles?

210
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,958
That's what I'm in the mood for today.

211
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,295
I'd like black bean noodles.
Make it super pungent.

212
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:12,213
Ask the chef. He'll know.

213
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:14,132
I will.

214
00:14:15,383 --> 00:14:17,510
Then,

215
00:14:17,594 --> 00:14:20,388
I'll have
the slightly less pungent noodles.

216
00:14:22,515 --> 00:14:23,641
I'll have them prepared.

217
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:34,319
Why is our princess
so grumpy today?

218
00:14:34,402 --> 00:14:36,863
- I'm getting a bad feeling.
- Because she's pretty?

219
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,699
Inha!

220
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:43,244
Be careful.

221
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,084
When will I see you again?

222
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:53,254
- I'll see you this weekend.
- Not at home.

223
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:54,798
Call me like you did tonight.

224
00:14:55,632 --> 00:14:57,467
Will you bring Taeoh next time?

225
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,302
- Bye.
- I'm not kidding!

226
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:01,298
Take her home safely.

227
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:02,680
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

228
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:07,435
I told you! I'm not kidding, okay?

229
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,437
Ah! I can't hear you!

230
00:15:09,521 --> 00:15:10,841
<i>I love you!</i>

231
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:34,045
Enjoy your meal.

232
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:48,393
If you felt uncomfortable
because of my sister, I'm sorry.

233
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:50,854
I apologize.

234
00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:53,857
Did you come back to tell me that?

235
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,151
Well...

236
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:57,652
sort of.

237
00:16:00,113 --> 00:16:01,364
I'll accept your apology.

238
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:04,033
I wasn't that great to her either.

239
00:16:07,787 --> 00:16:09,122
What time do you get off?

240
00:16:09,998 --> 00:16:14,627
- I'll wait for you.
- I told you I'm too busy to date.

241
00:16:15,211 --> 00:16:16,546
If it's okay with you,

242
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:21,050
I can buy you as much time as you need.

243
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:25,096
I don't trust people.

244
00:16:26,264 --> 00:16:27,348
Sorry.

245
00:16:48,912 --> 00:16:51,456
Now! Let's call it a night!

246
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:52,874
Great job, everyone!

247
00:16:52,957 --> 00:16:54,959
Great job!

248
00:16:58,797 --> 00:17:00,507
Shall we eat before we go?

249
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,883
Sounds good. I'm buying.

250
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:06,179
The chief should pay. Who else?

251
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,980
I don't trust people.

252
00:17:17,232 --> 00:17:18,233
You'll trust me.

253
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:21,277
By all means.

254
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:47,554
One year, 365 days.

255
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:50,306
Eight thousand,
seven hundred and sixty hours.

256
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,935
How much would that be measured in money?

257
00:17:58,731 --> 00:17:59,732
A lot.

258
00:17:59,816 --> 00:18:01,734
So rather than talking nonsense,

259
00:18:02,944 --> 00:18:04,487
try to get more sleep.

260
00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:13,329
I want to buy it.

261
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:15,165
Time.

262
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:03,379
Goodness.

263
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:07,342
I thought I smelled the gutter in here.
Here's why.

264
00:19:07,425 --> 00:19:08,426
You little punk.

265
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:10,303
Have you been well?

266
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:12,347
What's this?

267
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,015
Did you wish I wasn't?

268
00:19:14,098 --> 00:19:15,558
Don't worry about him.

269
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:17,435
He's always like that. Ignore him.

270
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,104
You little brat.

271
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:21,773
I told you not to call me that.

272
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:27,821
You keep talking back to me.
Is that how you talk to your brother?

273
00:19:27,904 --> 00:19:29,864
Ah! Wait! Wait a second!

274
00:19:29,948 --> 00:19:30,949
Hey, Huiju!

275
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:32,992
Let go! Let go of me!

276
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:34,410
Miss, calm down!

277
00:19:34,494 --> 00:19:35,954
You'll both get hurt!

278
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:37,038
Please!

279
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:38,456
What's going on?

280
00:19:39,082 --> 00:19:40,124
Your finger...

281
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,251
Let me see!

282
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:43,254
- You're bleeding!
- What are you doing?

283
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:46,297
Mr. Moon, what are you doing?
Get rid of her!

284
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:48,049
Get rid of her, Mr. Moon!

285
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:49,843
You saw it yourself

286
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:51,302
so I'm sure you get it now.

287
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:53,721
- Come on.
- You wait and see!

288
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:55,306
Slow down! It hurts!

289
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:59,811
This uncomfortable commotion
was caused by you

290
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:02,939
and that is why you shouldn't come
to Bisunjae.

291
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,483
If you understood me,

292
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:07,819
I trust that you know

293
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:10,989
what you should do next.

294
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,874
Then he left right after that.

295
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:24,544
Shall I call the young master
at Cheongdam?

296
00:20:27,797 --> 00:20:28,965
There's no need.

297
00:20:30,717 --> 00:20:31,843
Yes, sir.

298
00:20:34,053 --> 00:20:36,931
- Damn it!
- You scared me. Don't move.

299
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,767
You're always letting Huiju get to you.

300
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:41,394
Aren't you embarrassed?

301
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:43,313
I bet Madame Jang feels differently.

302
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:48,234
- Why would she?
- I gave her a reason to kick Inha out.

303
00:20:54,574 --> 00:20:55,950
Mr. Moon told me

304
00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:58,286
Madame Jang didn't even decide

305
00:20:58,786 --> 00:20:59,913
tonight's dinner menu.

306
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:01,956
She hates him.

307
00:21:02,624 --> 00:21:06,169
Father criticized her, too,
so she wouldn't want to feed him.

308
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:07,462
That's right.

309
00:21:09,756 --> 00:21:11,382
If it wasn't for Father's order,

310
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:14,385
that punk couldn't even dream of joining
our family dinner.

311
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:16,012
To Madame Jang,

312
00:21:16,095 --> 00:21:19,432
having him step foot in Bisunjae
is horrifying.

313
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:23,269
I bet she thought all night
about what she could do

314
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:25,313
to avoid sitting with him at the table.

315
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:28,024
I resolved that for her.

316
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:29,234
What does that mean?

317
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:30,735
It means...

318
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:31,861
<i>Gracias.</i>

319
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:45,143
Are you getting an idea
of what happened at Bisunjae?

320
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,855
If I had lived my whole life

321
00:22:48,938 --> 00:22:52,025
without any greed as Baek Inha,

322
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,278
would I have lived comfortably?

323
00:22:55,862 --> 00:22:57,071
I don't know.

324
00:22:58,573 --> 00:23:00,909
But I'm sure of what I need to do now.

325
00:23:07,874 --> 00:23:08,958
Kill Baek Inha.

326
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,376
What?

327
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,128
You're a shell of Kang Inha,

328
00:23:12,212 --> 00:23:14,589
so you're reminiscing over old memories.

329
00:23:15,715 --> 00:23:18,718
Baek Inha is entitled to whine over
not getting a meal,

330
00:23:18,802 --> 00:23:19,803
but...

331
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:22,388
Kang Inha can't do that.

332
00:23:23,556 --> 00:23:25,767
You're going to have
to face more humiliation

333
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:27,519
and insults.

334
00:23:31,898 --> 00:23:32,982
Don't worry.

335
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:34,734
I'm going to make you perfect.

336
00:23:36,277 --> 00:23:37,987
Chairman Kang Joongmo's third son,

337
00:23:39,155 --> 00:23:40,156
Kang Inha.

338
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,828
As we expected,
Chae Donguk and Kang Seongju met.

339
00:23:45,537 --> 00:23:47,247
Once we cross into Kangoh's door,

340
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:50,542
the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center
will be set.

341
00:23:51,251 --> 00:23:52,752
Chae Donguk and Kang Seongju.

342
00:23:53,461 --> 00:23:56,089
Thanks to them, we bought ourselves time.

343
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:58,758
The proposal
is now in Kang Seongju's hands.

344
00:23:58,842 --> 00:24:00,385
Finally, our plan

345
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:02,804
has started.

346
00:24:44,095 --> 00:24:45,430
What's wrong with you all?

347
00:24:45,722 --> 00:24:48,725
Does no one care about Inha
after he left like that?

348
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:50,685
You don't know why he left like that?

349
00:24:50,977 --> 00:24:52,228
You were the cause.

350
00:24:52,312 --> 00:24:54,022
You started it.

351
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:56,375
You brat!
After what you did to my finger...

352
00:24:58,234 --> 00:24:59,235
That's enough.

353
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:05,533
Who knew

354
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:07,994
you people could be this cruel
and cold-hearted?

355
00:25:08,077 --> 00:25:10,997
- Huiju, sit down.
- You're like a group of psychopaths.

356
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,583
Sit down now.

357
00:25:23,843 --> 00:25:25,094
I'll see to her.

358
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:30,517
Inju, why did you do that?

359
00:25:33,686 --> 00:25:35,104
Father, what did I do?

360
00:25:35,188 --> 00:25:36,481
How dare you

361
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:38,233
insult me in my house?

362
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:41,528
- When did I?
- I'm the one that invited him.

363
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:43,112
However, you sent him away

364
00:25:43,196 --> 00:25:44,697
without my permission.

365
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:45,824
How dare you?

366
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,618
Father, it wasn't like that.

367
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:50,703
Madame...

368
00:25:50,787 --> 00:25:54,499
- I mean, Mother...
- I'll have to think about

369
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,627
what you gained from insulting me.

370
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,772
- Mom.
- You're 17. You're practically an adult.

371
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:21,067
I won't tolerate your childish behavior.

372
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,195
Being entitled comes with duties.

373
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:26,406
Being prudent.

374
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:27,615
That's one of them.

375
00:26:33,663 --> 00:26:35,623
Ms. Jin will bring you an ice pack.

376
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:36,916
Put it on your cheek.

377
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:02,984
Did you need something?

378
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:04,736
What's gotten into Huiju lately?

379
00:27:05,403 --> 00:27:07,989
Why does she keep mentioning
the child in Cheongdam?

380
00:27:11,534 --> 00:27:13,953
You know why, don't you?

381
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:17,081
Well...

382
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,960
Her new math tutor

383
00:27:22,003 --> 00:27:23,922
is a friend of Master Inha.

384
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:27,634
- Who?
- Master Inha said he had a friend

385
00:27:27,717 --> 00:27:29,177
in a rough situation.

386
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,512
Are you out of your mind?

387
00:27:31,137 --> 00:27:32,347
Sir, we're in trouble...

388
00:27:33,556 --> 00:27:34,557
Say it.

389
00:27:35,975 --> 00:27:37,101
Miss Huiju...

390
00:27:41,147 --> 00:27:42,982
She's not in the bathroom

391
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:44,651
or the dressing room.

392
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:49,447
I checked the basement and the greenhouse
just in case, but she isn't there.

393
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:50,990
Her phone's not here either.

394
00:27:51,074 --> 00:27:52,909
I think she left on her own.

395
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:54,494
Keep your mouth shut.

396
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:56,162
Don't let the chairman find out.

397
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,914
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:28:10,885 --> 00:28:13,805
MOM

399
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,168
TAEOH

400
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:52,552
- Hello?
<i>- I ran away from home.</i>

401
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,627
Hi!

402
00:29:30,715 --> 00:29:33,218
That's good!

403
00:29:34,302 --> 00:29:35,303
Ah.

404
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:38,765
Thank you for respecting me
and not calling Inha.

405
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,433
Good job.

406
00:29:41,976 --> 00:29:45,855
Why are you staring at me like that?
Is it your first time seeing a runaway?

407
00:29:45,939 --> 00:29:47,565
Get up if you're done.

408
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:51,611
Do you know why I came here
after running away?

409
00:29:52,821 --> 00:29:55,406
The first time I spoke with Han Taeoh.

410
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,866
The adults will worry.

411
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,160
Running is the only thing
we have in common!

412
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:07,502
Get up.

413
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:13,341
Hmm? I know her.

414
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,386
We meet again.

415
00:30:16,469 --> 00:30:17,762
Yes, hello again.

416
00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:20,431
But why are you two...

417
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:22,934
Taeoh is my math tutor.

418
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:25,270
I heard you're in the same department.

419
00:30:26,146 --> 00:30:28,314
You can be Taeoh's peer.

420
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:30,567
If you need a friend,
be friends with Inha.

421
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,735
You're quite cute.

422
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:35,697
I'm more pretty than cute.

423
00:30:38,032 --> 00:30:39,492
Taeoh, let's go.

424
00:30:43,413 --> 00:30:45,748
Huiju, get in right now.

425
00:30:45,832 --> 00:30:46,833
I said that

426
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:49,460
I'd run far away if you told Inha.

427
00:30:49,544 --> 00:30:52,005
Did you really think
your threat would work on me?

428
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:53,840
- Taeoh!
- I'm your teacher.

429
00:30:55,884 --> 00:30:58,052
If you don't like it,
you can skip the name.

430
00:30:58,344 --> 00:31:00,263
Then come with me or...

431
00:31:02,015 --> 00:31:03,641
I won't move a step.

432
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:06,686
Yeah, Taeoh. Let's go together, okay?

433
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:07,812
I'm begging you.

434
00:31:07,896 --> 00:31:10,815
If you're going to take Taeoh home,
can I get a ride, too?

435
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:13,026
Do you think
this is a subway or something?

436
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:14,819
Do you even know what a subway looks like?

437
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:17,864
I saw it on TV!

438
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,408
Is that what you wanted to hear?

439
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:22,076
Let's help each other out.

440
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:24,829
I'm Taeoh's neighbor.
I live across the street.

441
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:27,081
What? Across the street?

442
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,215
You two live here?

443
00:31:35,298 --> 00:31:37,258
You see each other morning and night?

444
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:38,343
Drive safely.

445
00:31:38,426 --> 00:31:39,427
See you later.

446
00:31:41,763 --> 00:31:43,973
I should go, too. Thanks for the ride.

447
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,234
Did you know they lived here?

448
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:55,401
Are you joking?

449
00:31:55,485 --> 00:31:57,529
This is so annoying.

450
00:31:57,612 --> 00:32:00,240
No, you can't. Not Taeoh.

451
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:02,158
I don't have to tell you why, right?

452
00:32:02,242 --> 00:32:03,368
What about you?

453
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,372
Do you like her?

454
00:32:09,457 --> 00:32:10,500
Nope.

455
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,126
You can't lie to me.

456
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:15,964
I hope she likes you, too.

457
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:18,383
I mean it.

458
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:19,676
If Mother finds out,

459
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:21,386
Taeoh will be fired, got it?

460
00:32:21,469 --> 00:32:23,138
I'm confident I won't get caught.

461
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:25,431
Seriously...

462
00:32:29,644 --> 00:32:32,605
See? I told you I had a bad feeling.

463
00:33:20,904 --> 00:33:23,198
<i>As of May 4, 2013,</i>

464
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:25,909
<i>your employment contract
has been terminated.</i>

465
00:33:41,424 --> 00:33:42,884
Ring it up together.

466
00:33:43,593 --> 00:33:44,844
I'll buy tonight.

467
00:33:53,436 --> 00:33:55,313
Mr. Moon smoothed it out with Mother.

468
00:33:55,396 --> 00:33:58,191
So go inside and beg for forgiveness
no matter what.

469
00:33:58,942 --> 00:34:01,486
Shall I ask for them to move Taeoh
into the house?

470
00:34:02,111 --> 00:34:03,696
I don't like him living there.

471
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,407
- Are you still talking about Taeoh?
- I'm rooting for you.

472
00:34:08,952 --> 00:34:10,662
What do you know about Taeoh?

473
00:34:10,745 --> 00:34:14,833
When you're getting to know someone,
20 days is more than enough.

474
00:34:25,218 --> 00:34:26,636
Oh, my...

475
00:34:35,478 --> 00:34:37,522
You look like you're about to go to war.

476
00:34:38,273 --> 00:34:39,524
Every day's a war.

477
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:41,860
Fortunately, the winning rate isn't bad.

478
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,495
But don't you want to know

479
00:34:54,164 --> 00:34:57,458
where we'll be in 10 years?

480
00:34:58,001 --> 00:35:00,086
You'll be where you want to be,

481
00:35:01,588 --> 00:35:03,548
and I'll be where I want to be.

482
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:09,012
- I guess Kang Inha won't be there.
- I told you.

483
00:35:09,095 --> 00:35:12,599
I don't want to be the middleman
for you to get to Inha.

484
00:35:12,682 --> 00:35:15,059
Why would you
bring that up now?

485
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,483
Stop your independent war
and focus on going to Inha.

486
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:23,610
Don't think about using me

487
00:35:24,277 --> 00:35:26,321
or trying to get help from someone else.

488
00:35:30,492 --> 00:35:32,994
There's a timing to everything in life.

489
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:36,664
It's whether you can grab it or not.

490
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:41,377
If you can grab it, how will you use it?

491
00:35:41,961 --> 00:35:43,797
The outcome of a war rests on that.

492
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,673
It's not always about the attack.

493
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:58,019
I hope you win this war.

494
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,350
What did you just say?

495
00:36:05,401 --> 00:36:07,821
A new math tutor is coming.

496
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:26,464
- My uniform.
- What about it?

497
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:29,050
- I have to go to school.
- You said you'd rest today.

498
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:30,510
When?

499
00:36:30,593 --> 00:36:33,179
- Last night, I'm sure of it...
- Uniform!

500
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:40,145
You don't look well.

501
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,439
You should've taken the day off.

502
00:36:46,317 --> 00:36:47,402
I'm going to.

503
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:49,571
What?

504
00:36:57,328 --> 00:36:59,539
The director will kill me
if she finds out!

505
00:36:59,622 --> 00:37:01,416
I'll kill you if you don't!

506
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:04,210
Call the school and say I'm sick
and will be absent.

507
00:37:04,294 --> 00:37:05,462
It's so simple.

508
00:37:06,212 --> 00:37:07,547
Where are you going to go?

509
00:37:11,926 --> 00:37:13,219
Mr. Lee?

510
00:37:16,473 --> 00:37:17,682
Oh!

511
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:19,350
Uh...

512
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,368
I found you.

513
00:37:41,247 --> 00:37:43,583
Are you really leaving like this?
No farewell?

514
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:46,669
What kind of teacher doesn't care about
their student at all?

515
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:49,672
"Take care. Study hard."
Isn't that the least you can say?

516
00:37:49,756 --> 00:37:51,216
This isn't right!

517
00:37:56,596 --> 00:37:59,265
I came all this way to say goodbye!

518
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:01,476
I never asked you to. Farewell?

519
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,186
I definitely don't want to do that.

520
00:38:04,187 --> 00:38:05,230
I'm going to do it!

521
00:38:06,064 --> 00:38:07,273
I want to do it!

522
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,484
That crappy farewell.

523
00:38:17,116 --> 00:38:18,117
I like you.

524
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,704
I said, I like you.

525
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:24,916
So?

526
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:26,709
I just told you that I like you.

527
00:38:27,252 --> 00:38:29,045
Is that the only thing you can say?

528
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,302
Yes, Mr. Moon.

529
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:41,141
What are you doing?

530
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:44,060
Speak for yourself.

531
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:51,067
Yes, Mr. Moon.

532
00:38:51,651 --> 00:38:54,571
Ah, aside from the advance payment,
I don't need the rest.

533
00:38:54,654 --> 00:38:56,030
Send me the account number.

534
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:57,615
I'll send it back.

535
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:03,037
A teacher and a student?

536
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:06,124
No.

537
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,793
I'm an employee and you're the employer.

538
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:11,754
That ended upon termination
of the contract.

539
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:13,173
And you like me?

540
00:39:14,257 --> 00:39:15,633
I told you.

541
00:39:16,509 --> 00:39:19,721
If you're testing my patience,
you won't win.

542
00:39:20,305 --> 00:39:23,433
Do you have anything left to say?

543
00:39:33,776 --> 00:39:34,777
You're right.

544
00:39:36,613 --> 00:39:38,698
Employee and employer.

545
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,660
I forgot for a moment.

546
00:39:42,744 --> 00:39:44,329
Party A and Party B.

547
00:39:45,455 --> 00:39:47,790
A type of servant
who works for my dad's money.

548
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:52,003
The relationship between
an owner and servant never changes.

549
00:39:52,086 --> 00:39:54,047
That's what my grandfather said.

550
00:39:56,633 --> 00:39:57,967
Thanks for your hard work.

551
00:39:58,384 --> 00:40:01,596
Right.
You said you wouldn't say goodbye.

552
00:40:03,097 --> 00:40:05,433
Then, continue to work hard.

553
00:40:07,101 --> 00:40:09,813
Outside the line you drew, Mr. Han Taeoh.

554
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:20,490
I'm done. Come and get me.

555
00:40:53,773 --> 00:40:56,442
I saw you and Huiju earlier by chance.

556
00:40:56,526 --> 00:40:59,070
Aren't you being unnecessarily harsh
on her?

557
00:40:59,154 --> 00:41:01,114
Were you the nosy type?

558
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:02,198
No.

559
00:41:03,116 --> 00:41:05,493
But I can't seem to help myself with you.

560
00:41:07,954 --> 00:41:09,038
Don't worry about it.

561
00:41:09,956 --> 00:41:11,499
It's none of your business.

562
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:16,212
Think of Kang Huiju
as one of your many means.

563
00:41:16,296 --> 00:41:18,882
Do you know that's really out of line?

564
00:41:18,965 --> 00:41:20,842
I think you're just being
overly sensitive.

565
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:24,262
I don't know what you're trying to say,

566
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,724
but I don't need your advice.

567
00:42:03,885 --> 00:42:07,222
<i>Na Hyewon, what's your deal?</i>

568
00:42:12,018 --> 00:42:15,897
- Coffee!
- Yes, all right! Coffee's coming!

569
00:42:17,565 --> 00:42:20,068
Two coffees!

570
00:42:21,069 --> 00:42:22,429
I'm in a great mood today!

571
00:42:22,487 --> 00:42:24,113
You don't have to.

572
00:42:24,697 --> 00:42:26,491
No. Wait!

573
00:42:26,574 --> 00:42:28,993
- What? I'm the winner.
- Get your hands off.

574
00:42:29,994 --> 00:42:32,330
- Flush.
- What?

575
00:42:34,207 --> 00:42:36,209
I bet that's fun.

576
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:39,462
If I had money, I'd clean them out!

577
00:42:41,673 --> 00:42:44,092
Shall I hit up Hyewon again?

578
00:42:46,094 --> 00:42:49,722
What's she going to do? Kill her mother?

579
00:42:58,648 --> 00:43:00,441
- Take it inside.
- Yes, sir.

580
00:43:07,532 --> 00:43:10,451
Damn it. What are you doing?

581
00:43:10,994 --> 00:43:11,995
Put them back!

582
00:43:35,185 --> 00:43:39,564
I'll die either way. This is no big deal.

583
00:44:12,597 --> 00:44:14,557
- That's all.
- Thank you.

584
00:44:38,957 --> 00:44:42,210
She ran her mouth
saying how smart her daughter was.

585
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:44,045
You really go to Hanguk University.

586
00:44:44,129 --> 00:44:46,339
You grew up well.

587
00:44:46,422 --> 00:44:48,424
Rags to riches, right?

588
00:44:50,969 --> 00:44:53,638
- Who are you?
- Your mom ran off with 50 million won.

589
00:44:53,721 --> 00:44:55,181
We came here to collect.

590
00:44:55,265 --> 00:44:56,266
"Mom"?

591
00:44:56,808 --> 00:44:57,851
I don't have one.

592
00:44:58,351 --> 00:45:00,145
What's wrong with you?

593
00:45:00,728 --> 00:45:04,315
That's your problem.
We're just here to collect.

594
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,485
Then collect it by finding her.

595
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:10,572
Or go to the police
and file a formal complaint.

596
00:45:12,532 --> 00:45:14,951
That rude little brat. What the hell?

597
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:17,412
What are you doing? Get her.

598
00:45:17,495 --> 00:45:18,746
Yes, boss.

599
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,131
Where are you going?

600
00:45:28,214 --> 00:45:29,924
Listen to the rest before you go.

601
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:40,560
Boss.

602
00:45:42,604 --> 00:45:45,690
How dare you look me up
and down like that!

603
00:45:45,773 --> 00:45:47,442
You crazy wench!

604
00:45:50,445 --> 00:45:51,488
Who are you?

605
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:55,283
What's going on?

606
00:45:55,783 --> 00:45:57,368
What do you think you're doing?

607
00:46:01,122 --> 00:46:03,082
I'll see you at home later. Okay?

608
00:46:10,423 --> 00:46:11,823
Stop. Put your phones away.

609
00:46:19,516 --> 00:46:20,517
What are you doing?

610
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:23,561
- Do you have a place to go?
- I don't understand.

611
00:46:23,645 --> 00:46:25,897
Do you have a place to go
so you can avoid them?

612
00:46:26,523 --> 00:46:28,650
Is that all?

613
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,612
How many times do you think
I've been through something like that?

614
00:46:33,947 --> 00:46:35,031
A whole lot.

615
00:46:35,657 --> 00:46:38,076
But I never once avoided it or ran away.

616
00:46:38,868 --> 00:46:39,953
Do you know why?

617
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:43,832
If I ran away, it felt like
I was accepting her as my family.

618
00:46:47,418 --> 00:46:49,170
What happened today is no big deal.

619
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:51,339
I did nothing wrong.

620
00:47:00,265 --> 00:47:01,266
Inha!

621
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,725
What now?

622
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:06,020
Thugs came for Na Hyewon.

623
00:47:06,104 --> 00:47:07,272
Who came for her?

624
00:47:07,355 --> 00:47:09,899
They tried to hit her and asked for money.
It was chaos.

625
00:47:29,252 --> 00:47:31,838
KANG INHA

626
00:47:35,091 --> 00:47:37,093
NA HYEWON

627
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:42,765
<i>The number you...</i>

628
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:44,517
What the hell?

629
00:48:10,084 --> 00:48:12,324
<i>The number</i>
<i>you have dialed is not responding...</i>

630
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:18,343
Damn it.

631
00:48:42,075 --> 00:48:43,243
<i>The number you...</i>

632
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,240
I was worried about you.

633
00:49:23,324 --> 00:49:24,325
I'm so relieved.

634
00:53:16,516 --> 00:53:18,351
I'm going to stay at Inha's house.

635
00:53:20,854 --> 00:53:21,938
Bye.

636
00:53:26,401 --> 00:53:27,402
Don't go.

637
00:53:30,655 --> 00:53:31,948
Don't go, Hyewon.

638
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:41,291
If I don't go,

639
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:44,586
what difference will it make?

640
00:54:08,985 --> 00:54:10,904
We don't mean anything to one another.

641
00:54:13,281 --> 00:54:14,866
How do you know that?

642
00:54:14,949 --> 00:54:16,201
The way you're acting...

643
00:54:17,368 --> 00:54:18,995
In a month or two, no.

644
00:54:20,246 --> 00:54:22,457
Are you sure you won't regret it tomorrow?

645
00:54:24,584 --> 00:54:25,585
You're not, are you?

646
00:54:26,711 --> 00:54:27,712
This is our reality.

647
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:33,176
I won't regret it.

648
00:54:36,095 --> 00:54:37,096
Sorry.

649
00:54:38,473 --> 00:54:39,766
I know I'll regret it.

650
00:54:42,936 --> 00:54:45,104
Didn't you want to live
a different life than now?

651
00:54:46,105 --> 00:54:47,482
If we settle now,

652
00:54:48,566 --> 00:54:50,443
nothing will change.

653
00:55:38,074 --> 00:55:39,394
<i>The way you're acting...</i>

654
00:55:39,993 --> 00:55:41,619
<i>In a month or two, no.</i>

655
00:55:42,996 --> 00:55:45,165
<i>Are you sure you won't regret it tomorrow?</i>

656
00:55:49,043 --> 00:55:51,045
Taeoh!

657
00:55:52,046 --> 00:55:53,047
Han Taeoh!

658
00:55:59,846 --> 00:56:01,097
Han Taeoh!

659
00:56:10,857 --> 00:56:12,734
KANG INHA

660
00:56:32,086 --> 00:56:35,924
KANG INHA

661
00:56:48,353 --> 00:56:49,354
Hello?

662
00:56:59,405 --> 00:57:00,406
Tell me.

663
00:57:07,497 --> 00:57:09,082
5 YEARS LATER

664
00:57:13,503 --> 00:57:18,216
CO-PROSPERITY COOPERATION CENTER
5TH ANNIVERSARY

665
00:57:21,136 --> 00:57:22,345
The chairman is here.

666
00:57:48,204 --> 00:57:50,373
Sir, congratulations!

667
00:57:50,456 --> 00:57:52,000
How do you feel today?

668
00:57:56,838 --> 00:57:58,339
Please, say a word.

669
00:58:39,547 --> 00:58:42,467
This is the employee who wrote the speech
you'll be giving today.

670
00:58:47,931 --> 00:58:48,932
Hello.

671
00:58:49,349 --> 00:58:52,811
I work on the global leader training team.
My name is Han Taeoh.

672
00:58:58,817 --> 00:58:59,859
<i>Our game...</i>

673
00:59:01,945 --> 00:59:02,987
<i>Our game...</i>

674
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,450
<i>...has only just begun.</i>
