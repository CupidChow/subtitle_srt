00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,653
You look happy.

6
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,204
Since when did this place

7
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,499
become freely accessible for just anyone?

8
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,958
I'm not just anyone.

9
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,711
I'm your son.

10
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,840
Yes.

11
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,260
The sole reason
you've been able to survive

12
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,014
in Kangoh is because you share my blood.

13
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,432
That was your only excuse.

14
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,856
- I met with CEO Park Sajin because...
- [Joongmo] I want you out of Kangoh now.

15
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,777
You will be terminated
tomorrow morning at 9:00.

16
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,948
After that, you will be issued a notice
to be kicked out of Kangoh Group.

17
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,117
Why?

18
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,078
Why can't it be me?

19
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,249
I have the abilities
to make your dreams come true too.

20
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,333
Abilities?

21
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,754
Did you think those were your abilities?
Not Han Taeoh's?

22
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,631
Is that why you stole him?

23
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,508
[Joongmo] If it were Taeoh instead of you,

24
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,052
I wouldn't have had
to split Kangoh in half

25
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,138
the way I did now.

26
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,933
I did everything in my power
to gain your approval.

27
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,270
So why haven't you acknowledged me
for a single moment?

28
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,856
Did you kill Inju
because I didn't acknowledge you?

29
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,608
My son! Your brother!

30
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,284
You killed him.

31
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,453
Kang Inha is a hollow shell.

32
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,538
Baek Inha!

33
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,040
That's who you are.

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,794
Put everything you have
in your hands down.

35
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,754
Go back to your old life.

36
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,548
If you go back and live quietly,

37
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,342
I won't make you pay

38
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,512
for your crimes.

39
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,563
[exhales] What if I don't want to?

40
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,523
What?

41
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,317
I'm not the one that killed Inju.

42
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,069
It was you.

43
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,656
The person who made me this way
and killed Kang Inju!

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,993
In the end, it was all you.

45
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,457
You're finally showing your true colors.

46
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,210
Go back to being Baek Inha?

47
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,212
Now?

[chuckles softly]

49
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,049
I can't do that.

50
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,009
[Joongmo] I wasn't asking you.

51
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,803
If I tell you to leave, you leave!

52
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,266
That's the law of Kang Joongmo and Kangoh!

53
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,851
I'm different from my mother.

54
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,648
I won't give up that easily
without even trying.

55
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,526
There's nothing you can do.

I don't know. Is there really nothing?

I've come too far to turn back.

69

you had reached out this hand
a little earlier.

Kang Joongmo's Kangoh is gone.

I just got the call
and I'm on my way to the hospital now.

I really didn't kill anyone.

127
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,246
So why would you tell me that?
What does that have to do with me?

128
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,539
I screwed you over.

129

The night I supposedly
killed Kang Inju and Shin Bona.

132

Everything from that night was recorded
on Shin Bona's phone.

I really didn't kill anyone.

You are under arrest for escaping prison
and for obstruction of justice, Han Taeoh.

You have the right to remain silent.

188
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,357

What's going on?

192
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,580
Where's Han Taeoh?

193
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,791
Why are you asking me?

194
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,379
Because I know my dad was hiding him.

195
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,841
Tell me. Where is he?

196
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,637
I don't know.

197
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,306
Why do you think I'll know?

198
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,517
I don't care about this.

199
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,311
Really?

200
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,898
Then you won't care if I report this.

201
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,862
I'll tell them that the last person
my dad was with before he fainted

202
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,197
was Han Taeoh.

203
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,411

Someone came in.
It's proof there was an accomplice.

257
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,231
It's a speculation.

258
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,820
Our job's to start with a speculation
and catch the culprit.

259
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:13,947
What if you can't?

260
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,492
Mo Gijun could escape
if something goes wrong.

261
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,745
You need to charge Mo Gijun first,
and then...

And then...

263
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,790

00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,219
- Han Taeoh.
- I'll help you...

266
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,972
catch the real culprit.

First of all, taking evidence like this
can cause problems for you.

270
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,867
Someone who should uphold
the law commits a crime?

271

That's why you should help me, sir.

We have a pro bono program at Milton

304
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,801
Are you using me

00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,471
to promote Milton,

306
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,182

307
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,517
Neither.

308
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,145
I'm only following the chairman's orders.

309
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,649
Chairman Kang Joongmo
could see everything clearly.

310
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:23,196
He asked me to help you
finish this matter.

311

[Sajin sipping] How's Chairman Kang?

318
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,832
Is he showing progress?

319
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,877
I know you met with my father.

320
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,380
Did he promise you something?

321
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,300
He said he'd give me Energy.

322
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,595
You didn't refuse him.

323
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,263
In my position,

324
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,932
it's more appealing

325
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,269
to stand with the owner
over the bastard child of Kangoh.

326
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,271
Energy.

327
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,148
[sighs] I'll give it to you.

328
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,359
If you don't like the bastard of Kangoh,

329
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,906
you can help me become
the owner of Kangoh.

330
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,242
Someone of the Kang bloodline
to be your cannon fodder and shield.

331
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,661
I'll be that for you.

332
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,539
I don't know.

333
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,124
It's not that appealing.

334
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,710
I'll be honest with you.

335
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:04,255
If Chairman Kang
hadn't collapsed like that,

336
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,591
wouldn't you have been ousted?

337
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:11,304
If Chairman Kang wakes up tomorrow,

338
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,557
you're fated to leave Kangoh as planned.

339
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,101
Those chances are slim.

340
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,103
That's your wishful thinking.

341
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:24,275
You can never have Kangoh
as long as Chairman Kang's alive.

What if Han Taeoh returns to work
based on the court ruling?

345
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,585
Even if that happens, don't worry.

346
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,965
As of now, is there anyone who can help
Han Taeoh besides the chairman?

347
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,678
The one who made the ridiculous dream
of Royal Road a reality

348
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,931
was Han Taeoh, not your father.

349
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,808
Right.

350
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,980
If the time comes to make a decision,

351
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,066
accept Han Taeoh as one of our own.

352
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,404
Aside from our board members,

353
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,823
I'll gather as much stock
as I can for now.

354
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,880
Why now?

355
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,342
Why?

<i>I was treated as less than human
for a long time.</i>

358
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,505
There were frequent beatings
and verbal abuse.

359
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,382
That's why.

360
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,885
That's why I killed them.

361
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,038
[Myeongjin] You could've just quit.

362
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:23,478
- How could you kill someone?
- You don't know what it's like.

What about Han Taeoh?

364
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,982
Did you plan that too? Even perjury?

365
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,277
Yes.

366
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,446
[Myeongjin scoffs]

367
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:38,117
You've answered "yes"
to all of my questions, Mr. Mo.

368
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,247
You created a falsely accused perpetrator
to take the fall

369
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,084
and even committed perjury
for the perfect crime.

370
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,169
And you're willing to admit to everything?

371
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,673
Where'd your determination
to not get caught go?

372
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,140
This wasn't your idea, was it?

373
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,777
I planned everything.

374
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,737
I did it.

375
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,365
Who planned this...

376
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,743
and ordered it?

377
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,288
No one.

378
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,257
[Inha] <i>Kang Joongmo's Kangoh is gone.</i>

379
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,553
Kang Inha's Kangoh is about to begin.

380
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,354
KANG JOONGMO

381
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,527
[thudding]

382
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,538
[exhales]

383
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,558
[scoffs softly]

384
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:50,458
Even if that time comes,
there's no need to complicate things.

385
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,085
Han Taeoh was falsely imprisoned.

386
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,590
Who will help him if Kangoh doesn't?

387
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,553
He was one of our own once.

388
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,805
He was more loyal than anyone.

389
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,932
Then...

390
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,560
as the division director of
the Future Strategy Office?

391
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,645
No.

392
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:15,107
As the planning and coordination director
of Kangoh Corporation.

393
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,151
- Excuse me?
- [Geumseok] Yes.

394
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,403
There is no such department at Kangoh.

395
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:24,784
It's a new department
that I plan to make for CEO Kang Seongju.

396
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,002
[Mr. Tak exclaims]

397
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,505
[chuckles]

398
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,633
[Taeoh] Is it tomorrow?

399
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,759
[Mr. Tak exhales softly]

400
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,470
Even after the darkest night
comes the dawn.

401
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,097
It's finally here.

402
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,433
Let's have a drink before you go.

403
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,812
You've never asked me to grab a drink.

404
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,605
You must want something from me.

405
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,697
[exhales sharply]

406
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,286
Why Hong Kong?

407
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,872
There's an investment company there
called Gold H Investment.

408
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,791
It's a paper company

409
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,962
that I created to make Kang Inha
the chairman.

410
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,007
No one knows it exists, but me.

411
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,884
Not even Kang Inha.

412
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,457
[Mr. Tak] I guess one more knows.

413
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,056
Me.

414
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,308
[Taeoh chuckles softly]

415
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,060
- You're right.
- [chuckles]

416
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,939
Now that I know your secret,
will you kill me?

417
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,776
Do you want to gamble for real with me
before you die?

418
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,239
Not shooting craps
in an illegal gambling den,

419
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,743
but seizing control of the great Kangoh.

420
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,245
A real gamble.

421
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,464
[Mr. Tak exhales sharply]

422
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,260
[man 1] He's coming.

423
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,137
[man 2] Where is he?

424
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,806
- Why isn't he coming out?
- Was it not today?

425
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,141
[man 2 sighs]

426
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,309
Boss!

427
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,895
- Boss!
- Boss! [chuckles]

428
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,147
- You've been through so much!
- [man 1 chuckles]

429
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,648
- Tofu.
- [gate closes]

430
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,400
Boss! Have some tofu!

431
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,568
Hey!

432
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,570
Have some tofu!

433
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,405
Who the hell eats tofu these days?

434
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,324
Still, have a bite.

435
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,408
Let go of me!

436
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,910
Open wide!

437
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,161
Don't do it!

438
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,746
Don't!

439
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,834
Congrats on your release, Boss.

440
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,297
[Mr. Tak] Is that you?

441
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,341
Hyangmi's daughter?

442
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:50,596
I knew your name sounded familiar.

443
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,014
Right? [laughs]

444
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,225
Taeoh and I are on different pages.

445
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,768
I don't trust gamblers.

446
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,353
What?

447
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,813
- Gamblers?
- [Mr. Tak] Hey.

448
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,567
I don't trust you either, Hyewon.

449
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,985
You're Hyangmi's daughter.

450
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,780
Yoon Hyangmi ran off with my money.

451
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,951
Since we're on the same page,
let's talk about work.

452
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,328
That's what I wanted. Yes.

453
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,043
[Mr. Tak claps]

454
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,549
[Hyewon] Gold H Investment.

455
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,593
Michael Chang,
a Wall Street investment genius,

456
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,304
founded an investment firm
in Hong Kong in 2021.

457
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,557
Michael moved to the States
when he was young.

458
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,852
He graduated Cornell summa cum laude
and is an eccentric genius.

459
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,645
He was an active rower in college.

460
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,815
He fell in love with trekking
and works as a professional now.

461
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,860
Wait a second.

462
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,320
Who's Michael Chang?

463
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,951
I heard all about Gold H Investment
from Inmate 3866, so I know it well.

464
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,497
But he never told me about Michael Chang.

465
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,337
MICHAEL CHANG, 53,
AMERICAN, PROFESSIONAL TREKKER

466
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,382
- [door opens]
- Me?

467
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,343
- [door closes]
- [Wan] Come on.

468
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,262
He's an old man.

469
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:16,515
He's not even
some friendly neighborhood guy.

470
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,517
He's an old dude from the outskirts.

471
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,060
Who are you?

472
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,145
Me?

473
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,813
Seonu Wan.

474
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,773
The ace

475
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,734
in this field.

476
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,405
<i>There's something you don't know about me.</i>

477
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,741
- [gun fires]
- [Amico groans]

478
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,867
[Wan] I'm a rabid dog.

479
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,452
A mad dog.

480
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,078
Woof, woof!

481
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,872
[in Italian] Do you have a death wish?

482
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,707
Who will kill me?

483
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,337
Ah. Mo Gjiun?

484
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,798
But he went to jail, didn't he?

485
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,510
[in Italian] Later.

486
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,764
- [gun clicking]
- Ah.

487
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,643
[in Korean] That's not loaded.
Don't waste your energy.

488
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,562
- [shop bell ringing]
- [grunts]

489
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,606
Wan!

490
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,817
Damn it!

491
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,987
Do we still have business?

492
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,073
[Wan clicks tongue]

493
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:17,243
Come on. Why would you say that?

494
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,161
Tell me why you're here.

495
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,664
[Wan] Gold H Investment.

496
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,750
You had me fooled completely.

497
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,878
But you gathered shares
loud enough for me to hear.

498
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,298
[Taeoh sighs]

499
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,427
- So?
- What do you mean?

500
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,430
You need my help.

501
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,775
[laughing]

502
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,280

504
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,866
YOUR PURCHASE WAS SUCCESSFUL

505
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,375
Sir, there's trouble.

506
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:18,262
[in English] Well, it is indeed an honor
to join your foundation.

507
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,388
[in English] Thank you.

508
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:22,808
Mother.

509
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,520
- Please, excuse me.
- Sure.

Gold H Investment?

512
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,449
[in Korean] But, since when?

Look into it right now.

00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,764
Yes, sir.

FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE

521
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,189
We're almost there.

522
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,653
You just need to come out
and pull the trigger.

523
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:20,574
Great job.

524
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,203

[Hyeokjin] Your Honor,

527
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:39,093
I am not just here
to defend Han Taeoh today.

528
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,471
I am here

529
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:46,100
to give our country's judiciary
a chance to apologize for the wrongs

530
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,436
inflicted on an ordinary citizen
of this country.

531
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,523
I hope that the outcome of this trial

532
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,816
becomes an opportunity

533
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:58,153
for him and for all those
who cherish and love him

534
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,907
to have hope for a new life.

535

[people speaking indistinctly]

536
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:13,127
[judge] First, as a member
of the judiciary, I offer my apologies.

537
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,295
Defendant.

538
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,340
Will you stand for a moment?

539
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,425
DEFENDANT

540
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:25,889
Defendant...

541
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,892
Han Taeoh is innocent!
