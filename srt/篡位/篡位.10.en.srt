00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,653
You look happy.

6
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,204
Since when did this place

7
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,499
become freely accessible for just anyone?

8
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,958
I'm not just anyone.

9
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,711
I'm your son.

10
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,840
Yes.

11
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,260
The sole reason
you've been able to survive

12
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,014
in Kangoh is because you share my blood.

13
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,432
That was your only excuse.

14
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,856
- I met with CEO Park Sajin because...
- [Joongmo] I want you out of Kangoh now.

15
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,777
You will be terminated
tomorrow morning at 9:00.

16
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,948
After that, you will be issued a notice
to be kicked out of Kangoh Group.

17
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,117
Why?

18
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,078
Why can't it be me?

19
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,249
I have the abilities
to make your dreams come true too.

20
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,333
Abilities?

21
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,754
Did you think those were your abilities?
Not Han Taeoh's?

22
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,631
Is that why you stole him?

23
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,508
[Joongmo] If it were Taeoh instead of you,

24
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,052
I wouldn't have had
to split Kangoh in half

25
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,138
the way I did now.

26
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,933
I did everything in my power
to gain your approval.

27
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,270
So why haven't you acknowledged me
for a single moment?

28
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,856
Did you kill Inju
because I didn't acknowledge you?

29
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,608
My son! Your brother!

30
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,284
You killed him.

31
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,453
Kang Inha is a hollow shell.

32
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,538
Baek Inha!

33
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,040
That's who you are.

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,794
Put everything you have
in your hands down.

35
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,754
Go back to your old life.

36
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,548
If you go back and live quietly,

37
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,342
I won't make you pay

38
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,512
for your crimes.

39
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,563
[exhales] What if I don't want to?

40
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,523
What?

41
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,317
I'm not the one that killed Inju.

42
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,069
It was you.

43
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,656
The person who made me this way
and killed Kang Inju!

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,993
In the end, it was all you.

45
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,457
You're finally showing your true colors.

46
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,210
Go back to being Baek Inha?

47
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,212
Now?

48
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,922
[chuckles softly]

49
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,049
I can't do that.

50
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,009
[Joongmo] I wasn't asking you.

51
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,803
If I tell you to leave, you leave!

52
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,266
That's the law of Kang Joongmo and Kangoh!

53
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,851
I'm different from my mother.

54
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,648
I won't give up that easily
without even trying.

55
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,526
There's nothing you can do.

58
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,326
I don't know. Is there really nothing?

59
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,579
Get out of my sight
before I call security!

00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,926

00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,301
I've come too far to turn back.

69
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,055
This wouldn't have happened
if you had acknowledged me...

70
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,683

74
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,870
you had reached out this hand
a little earlier.

75
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,706
Kang Joongmo's Kangoh is gone.

76
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,875
Kang Inha's Kangoh is about to begin.

77
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,296
How's Chairman Kang?

78
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,508
I just got the call
and I'm on my way to the hospital now.

79
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,676

I don't know.

at that time?

He missed the golden hour
to take his heart medicine.

We'll have to wait for him
to regain consciousness.

Don't get the wrong idea,
I'm not here to confess.

You're a wanted man right now.

But you show up in front of a prosecutor?

126
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,283
I really didn't kill anyone.

127
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,246
So why would you tell me that?
What does that have to do with me?

128
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,539
I screwed you over.

129
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,333
I came to repay that debt.

130
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,709
What?

00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,913
The night I supposedly
killed Kang Inju and Shin Bona.

132
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:03,008
Everything from that night was recorded
on Shin Bona's phone.

133
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,261
I really didn't kill anyone.

134
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,351

I'm listening to this nonsense.

You are under arrest for escaping prison
and for obstruction of justice, Han Taeoh.

156
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,159
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can

- What does inferiority solve?

You...

- have the right to an attorney.
- Your inferiority will solve nothing.

It provides no consolation
to the deceased!

You need to do that.

What's going on?

192
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,580
Where's Han Taeoh?

193
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,791
Why are you asking me?

194
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,379
Because I know my dad was hiding him.

195
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,841
Tell me. Where is he?

196
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,637
I don't know.

197
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,306
Why do you think I'll know?

198
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,517
I don't care about this.

199
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,311
Really?

200
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,898
Then you won't care if I report this.

201
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,862
I'll tell them that the last person
my dad was with before he fainted

202
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,197
was Han Taeoh.

203
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,411

Someone came in.
It's proof there was an accomplice.

257
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,231
It's a speculation.

258
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,820
Our job's to start with a speculation
and catch the culprit.

259
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:13,947
What if you can't?

260
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,492
Mo Gijun could escape
if something goes wrong.

261
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,745
You need to charge Mo Gijun first,
and then...

And then...

263
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,790

00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,219
- Han Taeoh.
- I'll help you...

266
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,972
catch the real culprit.

First of all, taking evidence like this
can cause problems for you.

270
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,867
Someone who should uphold
the law commits a crime?

271

That's why you should help me, sir.

We have a pro bono program at Milton

304
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,801
Are you using me

00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,471
to promote Milton,

306
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,182
or are you trying to promote yourself?

307
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,517
Neither.

308
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,145
I'm only following the chairman's orders.

309
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,649
Chairman Kang Joongmo
could see everything clearly.

310
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:23,196
He asked me to help you
finish this matter.

311

[Sajin sipping] How's Chairman Kang?

318
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,832
Is he showing progress?

319
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,877
I know you met with my father.

320
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,380
Did he promise you something?

321
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,300
He said he'd give me Energy.

322
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,595
You didn't refuse him.

323
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,263
In my position,

324
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,932
it's more appealing

325
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,269
to stand with the owner
over the bastard child of Kangoh.

326
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,271
Energy.

327
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,148
[sighs] I'll give it to you.

328
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,359
If you don't like the bastard of Kangoh,

329
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,906
you can help me become
the owner of Kangoh.

330
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,242
Someone of the Kang bloodline
to be your cannon fodder and shield.

331
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,661
I'll be that for you.

332
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,539
I don't know.

333
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,124
It's not that appealing.

334
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,710
I'll be honest with you.

335
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:04,255
If Chairman Kang
hadn't collapsed like that,

336
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,591
wouldn't you have been ousted?

337
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:11,304
If Chairman Kang wakes up tomorrow,

338
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,557
you're fated to leave Kangoh as planned.

339
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,101
Those chances are slim.

340
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,103
That's your wishful thinking.

341
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:24,275
You can never have Kangoh
as long as Chairman Kang's alive.

What if Han Taeoh returns to work
based on the court ruling?

345
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,585
Even if that happens, don't worry.

346
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,965
As of now, is there anyone who can help
Han Taeoh besides the chairman?

347
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,678
The one who made the ridiculous dream
of Royal Road a reality

348
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,931
was Han Taeoh, not your father.

349
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,808
Right.

350
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,980
If the time comes to make a decision,

351
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,066
accept Han Taeoh as one of our own.

352
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,404
Aside from our board members,

353
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,823
I'll gather as much stock
as I can for now.

354
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,880
Why now?

355
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,342
Why?

[Myeongjin] <i>Why did you kill</i>
<i>Kang Inju and Shin Bona?</i>

<i>I was treated as less than human
for a long time.</i>

358
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,505
There were frequent beatings
and verbal abuse.

359
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,382
That's why.

360
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,885
That's why I killed them.

361
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,038
[Myeongjin] You could've just quit.

362
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:23,478
- How could you kill someone?
- You don't know what it's like.

363

What about Han Taeoh?

364
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,982
Did you plan that too? Even perjury?

365
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,277
Yes.

366
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,446
[Myeongjin scoffs]

367
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:38,117
You've answered "yes"
to all of my questions, Mr. Mo.

368
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,247
You created a falsely accused perpetrator
to take the fall

369
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,084
and even committed perjury
for the perfect crime.

370
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,169
And you're willing to admit to everything?

371
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,673
Where'd your determination
to not get caught go?

372
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,140
This wasn't your idea, was it?

373
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,777
I planned everything.

374
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,737
I did it.

375
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,365
Who planned this...

376
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,743
and ordered it?

377
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,288
No one.

378
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,257
[Inha] <i>Kang Joongmo's Kangoh is gone.</i>

379
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,553
Kang Inha's Kangoh is about to begin.

380
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,354
KANG JOONGMO

381
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,527
[thudding]

382
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,538
[exhales]

383
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,558
[scoffs softly]

384
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:50,458
Even if that time comes,
there's no need to complicate things.

385
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,085
Han Taeoh was falsely imprisoned.

386
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,590
Who will help him if Kangoh doesn't?

387
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,553
He was one of our own once.

388
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,805
He was more loyal than anyone.

389
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,932
Then...

390
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,560
as the division director of
the Future Strategy Office?

391
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,645
No.

392
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:15,107
As the planning and coordination director
of Kangoh Corporation.

393
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,151
- Excuse me?
- [Geumseok] Yes.

394
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,403
There is no such department at Kangoh.

395
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:24,784
It's a new department
that I plan to make for CEO Kang Seongju.

396
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,002
[Mr. Tak exclaims]

397
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,505
[chuckles]

398
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,633
[Taeoh] Is it tomorrow?

399
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,759
[Mr. Tak exhales softly]

400
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,470
Even after the darkest night
comes the dawn.

401
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,097
It's finally here.

402
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,433
Let's have a drink before you go.

403
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,812
You've never asked me to grab a drink.

404
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,605
You must want something from me.

405
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,697
[exhales sharply]

406
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,286
Why Hong Kong?

407
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,872
There's an investment company there
called Gold H Investment.

408
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,791
It's a paper company

409
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,962
that I created to make Kang Inha
the chairman.

410
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,007
No one knows it exists, but me.

411
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,884
Not even Kang Inha.

412
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,457
[Mr. Tak] I guess one more knows.

413
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,056
Me.

414
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,308
[Taeoh chuckles softly]

415
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,060
- You're right.
- [chuckles]

416
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,939
Now that I know your secret,
will you kill me?

417
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,776
Do you want to gamble for real with me
before you die?

418
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,239
Not shooting craps
in an illegal gambling den,

419
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,743
but seizing control of the great Kangoh.

420
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,245
A real gamble.

421
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,464
[Mr. Tak exhales sharply]

422
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,260
[man 1] He's coming.

423
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,137
[man 2] Where is he?

424
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,806
- Why isn't he coming out?
- Was it not today?

425
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,141
[man 2 sighs]

426
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,309
Boss!

427
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,895
- Boss!
- Boss! [chuckles]

428
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,147
- You've been through so much!
- [man 1 chuckles]

429
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,648
- Tofu.
- [gate closes]

430
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,400
Boss! Have some tofu!

431
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,568
Hey!

432
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,570
Have some tofu!

433
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,405
Who the hell eats tofu these days?

434
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,324
Still, have a bite.

435
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,408
Let go of me!

436
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,910
Open wide!

437
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,161
Don't do it!

438
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,746
Don't!

439
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,834
Congrats on your release, Boss.

440
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,297
[Mr. Tak] Is that you?

441
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,341
Hyangmi's daughter?

442
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:50,596
I knew your name sounded familiar.

443
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,014
Right? [laughs]

444
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,225
Taeoh and I are on different pages.

445
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,768
I don't trust gamblers.

446
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,353
What?

447
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,813
- Gamblers?
- [Mr. Tak] Hey.

448
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,567
I don't trust you either, Hyewon.

449
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,985
You're Hyangmi's daughter.

450
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,780
Yoon Hyangmi ran off with my money.

451
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,951
Since we're on the same page,
let's talk about work.

452
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,328
That's what I wanted. Yes.

453
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,043
[Mr. Tak claps]

454
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,549
[Hyewon] Gold H Investment.

455
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,593
Michael Chang,
a Wall Street investment genius,

456
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,304
founded an investment firm
in Hong Kong in 2021.

457
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,557
Michael moved to the States
when he was young.

458
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,852
He graduated Cornell summa cum laude
and is an eccentric genius.

459
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,645
He was an active rower in college.

460
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,815
He fell in love with trekking
and works as a professional now.

461
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,860
Wait a second.

462
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,320
Who's Michael Chang?

463
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,951
I heard all about Gold H Investment
from Inmate 3866, so I know it well.

464
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,497
But he never told me about Michael Chang.

465
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,337
MICHAEL CHANG, 53,
AMERICAN, PROFESSIONAL TREKKER

466
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,382
- [door opens]
- Me?

467
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,343
- [door closes]
- [Wan] Come on.

468
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,262
He's an old man.

469
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:16,515
He's not even
some friendly neighborhood guy.

470
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,517
He's an old dude from the outskirts.

471
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,060
Who are you?

472
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,145
Me?

473
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,813
Seonu Wan.

474
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,773
The ace

475
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,734
in this field.

476
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,405
<i>There's something you don't know about me.</i>

477
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,741
- [gun fires]
- [Amico groans]

478
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,867
[Wan] I'm a rabid dog.

479
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,452
A mad dog.

480
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,078
Woof, woof!

481
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,872
[in Italian] Do you have a death wish?

482
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,707
Who will kill me?

483
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,337
Ah. Mo Gjiun?

484
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,798
But he went to jail, didn't he?

485
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,510
[in Italian] Later.

486
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,764
- [gun clicking]
- Ah.

487
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,643
[in Korean] That's not loaded.
Don't waste your energy.

488
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,562
- [shop bell ringing]
- [grunts]

489
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,606
Wan!

490
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,817
Damn it!

491
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,987
Do we still have business?

492
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,073
[Wan clicks tongue]

493
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:17,243
Come on. Why would you say that?

494
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,161
Tell me why you're here.

495
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,664
[Wan] Gold H Investment.

496
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,750
You had me fooled completely.

497
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,878
But you gathered shares
loud enough for me to hear.

498
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,298
[Taeoh sighs]

499
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,427
- So?
- What do you mean?

500
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,430
You need my help.

501
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,775
[laughing]

502
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,280

504
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,866
YOUR PURCHASE WAS SUCCESSFUL

505
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,375
Sir, there's trouble.

506
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:18,262
[in English] Well, it is indeed an honor
to join your foundation.

507
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,388
[in English] Thank you.

508
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:22,808
Mother.

509
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,520
- Please, excuse me.
- Sure.

511
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,402
Gold H Investment?

512
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,449
[in Korean] But, since when?

513

518
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,553
Look into it right now.

519
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,764
Yes, sir.

FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE
DIVISION DIRECTOR KANG INHA

521
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,189
We're almost there.

522
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,653
You just need to come out
and pull the trigger.

523
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:20,574
Great job.

524
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,203
Thanks, Hyewon.

526
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,837
[Hyeokjin] Your Honor,

527
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:39,093
I am not just here
to defend Han Taeoh today.

528
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,471
I am here

529
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:46,100
to give our country's judiciary
a chance to apologize for the wrongs

530
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,436
inflicted on an ordinary citizen
of this country.

531
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,523
I hope that the outcome of this trial

532
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,816
becomes an opportunity

533
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:58,153
for him and for all those
who cherish and love him

534
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,907
to have hope for a new life.

535
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,993
[people speaking indistinctly]

536
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:13,127
[judge] First, as a member
of the judiciary, I offer my apologies.

537
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,295
Defendant.

538
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,340
Will you stand for a moment?

539
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,425
DEFENDANT

540
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:25,889
Defendant...

541
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,892
Han Taeoh is innocent!

[gavel banging]
