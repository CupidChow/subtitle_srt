THE LATE SEO JISUK

00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,287
Taeoh.

6
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,009
Do you remember
your college rooftop house?

7
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,888
The person who broke my window
and caused a mess.

8
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,977
Since I was born, I've never had a mother.

9
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:50,985
But you had an incredible mother
who prayed for your future.

10
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:04,415
I think that's why you were bold
and confident all the time.

11
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,130
I'm sure it was hard for you
to secretly protect her.

12
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,980
Your mother's keepsake.

13
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,400
It seems like she left you a letter.

14
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,290
Thanks.

15
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,045
[Hyewon] Taeoh.

16
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,175
We started in the mud pits
and got this far.

17
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,011
You're stronger than anyone I know.

18
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:03,099
I admit that's why I held onto you
and came all this way.

19
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,769
So don't fall apart now.

20
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:30,251
THE LATE SEO JISUK

21
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,188
[Jisuk] To my loving son, Taeoh.

22
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,358
If you're reading this,

23
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,902
it will be my second time
leaving this world.

24
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:01,574
Even if it's my time to go,
there's something I want you to know.

25
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,745
Rage doesn't solve everything.

26
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,792
But if I'm sure about one thing,

27
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:15,630
it's that I don't want my son
to be buried in the past.

28
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,347
Bury your rage, hate,
and regret along with this letter.

29
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,559
I hope you'll be able to walk forward.

30
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,440
I lack so much as a mother
and didn't give you anything.

31
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,821
I know it's shameful of me to ask,
but can I ask you for one last favor?

32
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:46,244
I hope... you can let go of the past.

33
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:53,042
And... I hope tolerance
will always be with you in your future.

34
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,756
Please take your time...

35
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,342
getting to me.

36
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,889
If we meet again,
I want to give my son a big hug.

37
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,184
My son...

38
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,729
I love you.

39
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,690
Your loving mom.

[gate rattling]

43
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,265
[Taeoh] Why did I run this far?

44
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,060
For what?

45
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,898
I don't plan on playing
in the minor leagues forever.

46
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,150
So, I'm going to use you.

47
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,111
You'll be my rope that'll help me reach...

48
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,072
the major leagues.

49
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,996
Desires for what I can't have?

50
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,417
In the end, you didn't trust me. Why?

51
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:07,046
You thought I'd mess things up,
and you're the only capable one!

52
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,717
If you're going to apologize, don't.

53
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,222
"I'm sorry. I was wrong."
I didn't come to hear that.

54
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,058
[breath trembling]

55
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,560
You ruined everything.

56
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,396
Our plan. Our dream.

57
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,483
[Taeoh] An unforgiveable revenge?

58
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,612
For what reason?

59
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,144
[Geumseok] This uncomfortable commotion
was caused by you...

60
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,228
[Inha scoffs]

61
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,898
[Geumseok] ...and that is why
you shouldn't come to Bisunjae.

62
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,122
[Joongmo] Did I send you there for this?

63
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,624
It's the absolute worst!

64
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,376
In the end,

65
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,338
you didn't have
any expectations from me...

66
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,798
Father.

67
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,303
Finally, it's tomorrow.

76
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,910
I've endured everything for so long.

77
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,956
Kangoh can't fall
into someone else's hands!

78

80

Call the legal team and have me released!

That's enough.

It's over now.

85
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,140

I'm sick of it now.

88
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,607
Are you out of your mind?

89
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:22,069
-Why do you think I came all this way?
-Who was it for?

90
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,196
Was it for me?

91
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,156
Was it really for me?

92
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,325
No, Mother.

93
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,828
Don't say that.

94
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,706
It was for your greed.

95
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,292
Isn't that why you pushed me this far?

96
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,171
What?

97
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,008
[tearfully] My entire life...

98
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,177
I've never once been happy.

99
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,472
Walking on eggshells and pleasing others.

100
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,601
I never did what I wanted!

101
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,647
I was miserable.

102
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,155
I want to stop now.

103
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,659
I want to be happy.

Hey, Jingyeong.

122
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,216
It's a good day today,
and the sky's clear too.

123
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,427
Are you going
to the shareholders' meeting?

124
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,015
Yes, it seems my lifelong dream
is about to come true.

125
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,266
[Jingyeong] I'm sorry, Dad.

126
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,185
I have something to tell you.

127
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,368
Did you see Mom?

128
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,413
How is she?

129
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,458
Don't worry. She's fine.

130
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,626
[Huiju sighs]

131
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,465
Do we...

132
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,884
have a chance today?

133
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,768
I guess this is my seat.

134
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,520
[chuckles] Does it matter where we sit?

135
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,939
Bees will find their way to flowers.

139
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,000
Speaking of which, Mr. Park's late.

140
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,920
You're right. He left before me.

141
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,440
[door opens]

142
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,140
[Joongmo] The sole reason
you've been able to survive

143
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:06,019
in Kangoh is because you share my blood.

144
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,771
That was your only excuse.

145
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,111
[Inha] I'm different from my mother.

146
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,030
I won't give up that easily...

147
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,408
without even trying.

148
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,175
[Jingyeong] I suffered from Kang Inju,

149
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,136
and I lived in hell every day.

150
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,266
To the point
where I didn't want to live anymore.

DOCTOR PARK JINGYEONG

152
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,107
[Jingyeong] I couldn't live sober.

[sighs]

154
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:58,989
I'm sorry, Father.

155
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,117
No, you did nothing wrong.

156
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,244
It's my fault.

157
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,833
When you went astray,
all I did was scold you.

158
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,169
It's my fault for not looking deeper.

159
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,968
Right. I'll do my part as your father
before it's too late.

ARREST WARRANT

162
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,201
[Myeongjin] Mr. Kang Inha.

163
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:48,705
You are under arrest for the murder
of Kang Inju and Mo Gijun.

164
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,666
What are you saying?

165
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,668
Arrest him.

166
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,503
Wait a second!

167
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,505
-[man] Get out, you two.
-Let go of me!

168
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,507
-Do you know who I am?
-[Dongmyeong] Sir.

169
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,591
Get this off of me!

Okay. Hang up.

Yes?

178
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,262
[Jingyeong] My father wants to meet you.

179
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,098
Where do I need to go?

180
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,440

-Goodness!

00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,401
I'm sorry. I'll just pass through.

182
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,737
-[man 1 shouts]
-You scared me!

183
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,280
[Mr. Tak] It's you!

184
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,700
Chief Gyeong!

185
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,579
-What's this?
-It's me! [laughing]

186
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:57,709
Back in prison,
I had to follow your orders,

187
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:01,338
but it's the other way around
now that I'm out.

188
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,340
[laughing]

189
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,093
You're supposed to be working
for your country.

190
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,845
You shouldn't have done that!

191
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,889
-You bastard!
-[man 2] Come on!

192
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,017
-You bastard!
-You bastard! [laughs]

193
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,852
It's not what you think.

194
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,355
Oh, right. Let me pick up my kid first.

195
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,940
-Stop that!
-[Wan] Hey!

196
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,818
Sounds like a trick to me.

197
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,277
Just come with us quietly.

198
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,071
What are you doing?

199
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,155
-Okay.
-[man 2] Let's go.

200
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,323
-Come on.
-Let go!

201
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,408
Let's go.

202
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,118
-Follow me!
-Okay, don't hit me!

203
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,202
What are you doing?

204
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,108
[scoffs softly]

205
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,954
Damn it...

206
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,208
[sighs quietly]

207
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,422
[door opens]

208
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,635
[door closes]

209
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,137
[Myeongjin sighs]

210
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,058
I kept you waiting, didn't I?
I had things to take care of.

211
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,894
Is Han Taeoh behind this?

212
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,772
If that's the case, you chose wrong.

213
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,024
[chuckles softly]

214
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,026
Let's talk about the case.

215
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:52,157
Shall I start with Kang Inju's murder
or the conspiracy to murder Mo Gijun?

216
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,410
You have no proof or witnesses.
All you had was a warrant.

217
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,502
You'll have to take responsibility
for bringing me here.

218
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,342
You really do underestimate
our nation's prosecutors.

219
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,426
[Inha scoffs softly]

220
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,845
Who said I had no proof or witnesses?

221
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,110
[door opens]

222
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,168
[Gijun] But, Inha?

223
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,796
I'm a little scared.

224
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,633
You're scared?

225
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,345
It's only a matter of time
before I get a death sentence.

226
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,515
Now that it's come to this...

227
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,059
I'm kind of scared.

228
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,317
I shouldn't have said that.

229
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,612
Don't worry about what I said.

230
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,366
Is it tough in there?

231
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,494
Just hold on a little more.

232
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,205
I'll make things easier for you.

233
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,333
We're friends.

234
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,675
-[grunting]
-[stabbing]

235
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,274
[breathing heavily]

236
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,449
Mr. Mo Gijun! Are you all right?

237
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,577
[cell phone vibrating]

238
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:07,959
PARK JINGYEONG

239
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,637
What's the matter?

240
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,639
You were right.

241
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,557
Mo Gijun...

242
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,604
was attacked.

243
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,316
[exhales softly]

244
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,446
[handcuffs clinking]

245
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,530
No.

246
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,866
Don't get up. Just listen to me.

247
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,786
[Gijun sighs]

248
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,415
Who do you think...

249
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,043
did this to you?

250
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,714
Someone capable of abandoning others
for their personal gain.

251
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,217
Kang Inha has no friends.

252
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,636
You were just...

253
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,097
another dog to him.

254
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,308
-You're the only living proof...
-[grunts]

255
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,977
...who knows what Kang Inha did
and can block his path.

256
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,941
Mo Gijun...

257
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,612
you're nothing more and nothing less.

258
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,911
All the crimes you've committed so far,
if you were on your own...

259
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,456
do you think all of that
would've happened?

260
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:39,968
I'll help you.

261
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,390
The days of living
as someone else's dog are over.

262
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,978
I'll help you...

263
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,814
live your own life.

264
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,692
[breath trembling]

265
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,157
[sobbing quietly]

266
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,597
How could you?

267
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,726
Do you know what I did to protect you?

268
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,772
Tell me.

269
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,942
Was I just one of your dogs?

270
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,153
I wasn't a friend?

271
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,115
Tell me!

272
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,286
I know.

273
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,749
You shouldn't have wavered until the end.

274
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,628
-What?
-If you're a dog...

275
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,509
you should've stayed loyal to me.

276
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,390
You bastard!

277
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,522
[Inha] Gijun.

278
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,359
What do I hate most in the world?

279
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,655
Disgusting things.

280
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,412
But this disgusting and nasty thing

281
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,332
got all over me.

282
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,751
Why?

283
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,921
Because you didn't do your job properly.

284
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,007
[Gijun] I'm sorry.

285
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,137
[Inha scoffs]

286
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,223
[chuckling]

287
00:30:57,313 --> 00:31:00,525
[Taeoh] Chairman Kang promised you Energy.
Leave with that.

288
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,528
You're talking
as if you're the one giving it to me.

289
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,572
Why does it matter who gives it to you?

290
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,782
Just pay a fair price for it.

291
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,744
How much do you want?

292
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,372
One share...

293
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,041
will be a million won.

294
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,334
[Sajin] What?

295
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,378
Even with the management premium...

296
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,923
You bargained
between Chairman Kang and Inha.

297
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,508
Did that keep you busy?

298
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,137
I guess you missed
the stock price increase.

299
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,018
[Sajin chuckling]

300
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,396
You remind me of a young Kang Joongmo.

301
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,483
Ah.

302
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,611
One more thing.

303
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,742
I hope you won't get involved
with Kang Inha anymore.

304
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,245
-Why not?
-I'm more than enough on my own.

305
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,272
We're from the prosecutors' office
and we appreciate your cooperation.

306
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,610
Move out of the way.

307
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,530
[people speaking indistinctly]

308
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,205
[man 1] Grab everything.

309
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,874
-[Dongmyeong] You can't touch that.

I have to talk to you.

Yeah, I have to meet someone.

[Wan] Hey, Han?

330
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,862
Spit it out.

331
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,532
Don't try to resolve things yourself.
Call me if something happens.

333
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,661

You came.

[Huiju sighs]

340
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,034
What happened?

341
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,921
[Joongmo] I asked her to call you.

please rise from your seat.

348
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,830
Do you have any last words?

349
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,356
We walked together looking towards
the same place.

350
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,444
When I thought we had arrived...

351
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,948
we were each looking
at something different.

352
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,786
How unfortunate.

[♪ sentimental song continues playing]

357
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,106
I don't.

[people speaking indistinctly]

359

some sort of excuse?

[judge] Silence.

00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,406
I will render a verdict.

362
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:34,914
The defendant, Baek Inha,
murdered his brother, Kang Inju,

363
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:38,334
attempted to murder his accomplice,
Mo Gijun,

364
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,003
and tried to destroy evidence.

365
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,048
With all things considered,

366
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,592
the court judges have agreed

367
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:50,638
that the nature
of the crimes are serious and heavy.

368
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,974
The verdict.

369
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,896
The defendant, Baek Inha,
is sentenced to life in prison.

[♪ sentimental song continues playing]

371
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,359
[Taeoh] How is it in there?

372
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,198
Don't ask me that.
Think about how it was for you.

373
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:53,868
It's not much different.

374
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,914
-I won't forgive you.
-I don't plan on asking for forgiveness.

375
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,542
Would asking for forgiveness
change anything?

376
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,467
Let me ask you one thing.

377
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,220
Why did you do that to me?

378
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,639
I don't know.

379
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,853
I can't remember the reason anymore.

380
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,481
Why did I do it?

381
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,483
Where did things go wrong?

382
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,694
[exhales softly] Maybe...

383
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,240
it was because you were Han Taeoh.

384
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,078
You were none other than Han Taeoh.

385
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,213
Inha.

386
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,971
I liked that you were my friend.

387
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,099
I'm glad.

388
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,561
[Taeoh] Let's be friends.

391
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:12,029
[Taeoh] We just have to decide
what we'll do, and what we want to do.

392
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,865
Together.

Take care of yourself.

[Inha] Taeoh.

397
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,378
Never mind.

398
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,673
Bye.

399
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,509
I won't see you out.

Do you have to go?

402
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:12,900
What's with you?

403
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:17,029
It's not like this is my first time
suddenly going on a trip.

404
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,114
It's just the timing.

405
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,158
Mother's not here.

406
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,077
And Father's not feeling well.

407
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,537
You're here.

408
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,918
You take care of
Mom and Dad until I get back.

409
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,922
How long will you be away?

410
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,758
I don't know.

411
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,178
I think this trip...

412
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,847
might take a little long.

413
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,645
What's with that look?

414
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,313
Wait.

415
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,232
Are you disappointed?

-Okay.

419
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,077
Forget it. I'll take it down for you.

420
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,538
Go.

421
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,042
The presidential election isn't far away.

422
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,919
Move as quickly as possible.

423
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,425
Yes, sounds good.

424
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,552
Report the progress back to me.

[inhales sharply]

428

Do you want a beer?

429
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,857
Suddenly?

430
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,234
The reason I suddenly want
to drink beer...

431
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,987
We're college buddies and neighbors.

432
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:43,615
Also, we have the same humble background
with the same goal.

433
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,743
I think that's more than enough reason.

434
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,746

What about you?

438
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,024
Are things going well?

439
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,277
It's okay.

440
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,450
You haven't gone to see Inha, have you?

441
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,790
I want to focus on myself now.

442
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,417
Yeah.

443
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,920
That was always the path you wanted.

444
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,017
I swear...

445
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,228
you haven't changed at all either.

446
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,984
I envy that you can be persistent
and achieve your goals

447
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,029
without having to change.

448
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,491
You're the same.

449
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,370
You're the same as me.

450
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:16,542
In the past or present,
we still live as fiercely as we can.

451
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,669
We dream of other things.

452
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,088
Just as we did today,

453
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,674
we won't stop tomorrow either.

454
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,679
That's us.

456
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,893

of more than 10%.

expansion in Kangoh Group.

Will you continue to attend
bipartisan luncheons in the future?

I'll invite you
to the Blue House next month.

[elevator dings]

475
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,216
I heard a lot of things happened

476
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,510
while I was in the hospital.

477
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,638
I was on the verge of losing Kangoh,

478
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,308
and you overcame the crisis.

479
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,103
I always thought that someone

480
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:09,107
with no self-interest
and who only thinks of Kangoh's well-being

481
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,902
could become the owner of the 151st floor.

482
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,696
An owner

483
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,949
should protect and take care
of what's given to them.

484
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,868
However,

485
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,871
you couldn't protect
what was given to you.

486
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:26,958
Your love, your friend,
and even your family.

487

In the end, you have nothing beside you.

488
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,006
You know better than anyone else.

489
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,512
-I--
-If I give you one last chance...

490
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,232
will you be able to protect it?

I'd be lying if I said no.

500

But I have trust in my father's choice.

501

He's never been wrong.

502

Thanks.

Still, don't let your guard down.

If there are any issues
in Kangoh's management,

505
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,372
I could aim for this position

506
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,833
whenever I want.

507
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,335
Okay.

00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,004

You won't suddenly call me to work, right?
