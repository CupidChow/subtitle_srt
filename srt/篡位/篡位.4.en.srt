Don't you know that no one
can come in here without my permission?

Did you forget that EF Tower
wouldn't exist without my family?

10
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,940
Give back the center
you stole from my son.

11
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:52,237
Is the center Seongju's weapon or yours?

12
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,323
If not both, is that what your brother,
Jang Noik, wants?

What did you say?

00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:03,915
If you're going to pursue
that greed to take over Kangoh...

- [tableware rattles]
- ...by using the center, do it properly.

- You're getting above yourself.
- Excuse me?

00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,550
Did you really try to deceive me
with the Jang Noik Foundation?

You should've been prepared for this

20
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,180
when you used Jo Sundong
as a card against me.

[cutlery clinking]

22
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,978
You're a demon.

Well, you're not an angel either.

24
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:32,193
That's right. Now that you know,
return the center back to Seongju!

I'm going to destroy that foolish dream
you want so badly with my own two hands!

00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,028
We'll finish this...

00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,705
You can't expose my connection
with Congressman Jo

35
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,374
because you're afraid
you'll tarnish Kangoh's image.

36
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,419
But not me!
I don't care about Kangoh's image!

00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,463
I will do anything for my son!

No, let me be more honest.

39
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,762
There's nothing I won't do for myself.

40
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,056
Go ahead.

I wanted to bring you down myself,

who wanted to do the same.

Then you come here
and to try to make a deal with that lie?

00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,346
Unfortunately, it's not me.

64
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,390
Do you expect me to believe that lie?

65

It's up to you whether you believe it
or not. Do whatever you want.

- Are you crazy?
- I already know that you were with him.

- Don't lie! Tell me the truth!
- Don't be ridiculous!

Is this any way to act
in front of your father?

It's true I stopped by,

115
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,363
but he was fine until I left.

116
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,367
You all know he has a heart condition.

117
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,330
I only learned recently that his heart...

118
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,708
could stop at any moment.

119
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,418

Wait. You kept it to yourself?

No.

00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,639
Come to think of it,

Go and get some rest.

Hey, Kang Inju!

00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,665
Are you insane?

says the chairman needs complete rest
more than anything right now.

138
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,724
He asked me to tell you

139
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,727
to all leave.

140
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,147
[chuckles softly] I don't believe this.

141
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,066
That rude bastard.

142
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,944
He should tell us himself.

143
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,905
How dare he make a mere secretary tell us?

144
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,450
[Geumseok] If that's what the doctor
suggested, we should listen to him.

145
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,413
Let's do what the doctor said
and let your father rest.

146
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,497
- Let's go.
- [Geumseok] Okay.

147
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,222
What are you doing? Let's go.

148
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,275
We should go too.
There's nothing for us to do here.

149
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,200
You're not like us.

150
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,661
Arrogant punk.

151
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,077
- What about you?
- I have to get back to the art center.

152
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,162
Don't be too late.

153
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,290
The elders at Daejong are stricter
than you may think.

154
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,375
- Mom.
- [Geumseok] Just so you know,

155
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,671
we'll be discussing
the details of the wedding soon.

156
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,090
Father collapsed.

157
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,259
And that's why we must hurry.

158
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,221
You need to be supportive of your brother.

159
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,731
[car engine starts]

160
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,239
[line rings]

161
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,992
[sighs] Did you find out
where Ko Huichan has been?

162
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,161
Damn it.

163
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,206
Father could've given us a warning
before collapsing.

164
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,961
At least pretend you're worried.

165
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,548
- People can hear you.
- [Inju clicks tongue]

166
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,550
Hey, did you hear something?

167
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,095
- No, sir.
- Happy?

168
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,975
It would be nice if Han Taeoh
were on my side at times like this.

169
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,434
Just buy him.

170
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,186
Do you think he's you?

171
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,106
People are all the same.
Do you think he'll be any different?

172
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,941
Shut up already! [clicks tongue]

173
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,697
Then... how about using Huiju?

174
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,657
What's with you today? Are you crazy?

175
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,577
- Why would you bring that brat up?
- Who knows?

176
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,620
She could be the answer.

177
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,873
What if Huiju

178
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,916
- and Han Taeoh--
- Do you want a divorce?

179
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,585
Eyes up front.

180
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,630
Hey, turn on some exciting music.

181
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,798
Yes, sir.

182
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,095
Other than Chu Hyeokjin and us...

183
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,893
who else do you think knows
about Milton and Father?

184
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,063
I'm sure it's someone on the inside.

185
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,026
- An insider?
- Someone close to your father,

186
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,110
or an enemy.

187
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:07,489
[sighs] We have to find out
who it is immediately.

188
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,408
And do what?

189
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,329
Will you thank them for taking care
of the dirty work for us?

190
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,956
Forget about those useless thoughts.

191
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,043
Take the opportunity
when it presents itself.

192
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,753
What will you do?

193
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:25,215
We must prepare an emergency meeting
with the key executives of the group.

194
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,718
Don't you think we should get to work

195
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,471
to make it rewarding
for our anonymous informant?

196
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,233
[Taeoh sighs quietly]

197
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,401
[cell phone vibrates]

198
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,532
KANG INHA

199
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,661
[Inha] <i>Come out.</i>
<i>I just got to the hospital.</i>

200
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,049
The chairman is still unconscious.

201
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,009
Director In says that...

202
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,596
he can't guarantee anything right now.

203
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,057
You told me to trust you.

204
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,851
Is that still valid?

205
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,192
Or...

206
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,947
- is it over for us?
- That won't ever happen.

207
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,865
Keep your word!

208
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,452
Or we all go under for this.

209
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,205
I know what you're scared of.

210
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,833
- I know...
- What I'm scared of isn't important.

211
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,126
It's important to me.

212
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,922
If you start to waver, our plan crumbles.

213
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,012
Trust me and wait, no matter what.

214
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,848
I'm asking as a favor.

215
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,559
Let's be honest.
There's no other way besides that.

216
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,688
I'll wait. No...

217
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,359
I'll try to wait.

218
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,291
[cell phone vibrating]

219
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,879
PRESIDENT KANG INJU'S SECRETARY

220
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,506
Hello?

221
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,759
[man] <i>President Kang Inju</i>
<i>would like to see you.</i>

222
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,178
[Inju sighs]

223
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,438
How's this place?

224
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,657
It's nice.

225
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,952
You can move in today if you want.

226
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,038
I'm saying you can have it.

227
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,541
Is it expensive? I won't be able
to afford it in this lifetime.

228
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,168
This is suitable for you.

229
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,671
It's quite desirable.

230
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:14,426
However, it seems like
you didn't do your research.

231
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,519
You live in a tiny studio apartment
that you don't even own.

232
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,354
Do you want me to be your person?

233
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,231
What if I do?

234
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,275
- [inhales sharply] I thought you hated me.
- I do.

235
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,487
But you're desirable.

236
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,322
Are you trying to acquire me

237
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,616
in case the chairman dies?

238
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,536
- Can I not?
- The chairman is still alive.

239
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,538
I know that.

240
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,998
- I do...
- [Taeoh] If you really wanted me,

241
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,335
you should've brought something bigger
than this house.

242
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,716
Something bigger...

243
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,305
[grunts softly]

244
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,687
Tell me what you want.

245
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,413
- [Inha yells]
- [cell phone clatters]

246
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,209
Why now?

247
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,590
Everything you have

248
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,800
should be enough

249
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,429
to make me want to become your person.

250
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,555
[scoffs]

251
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,727
[exclaims softly]

252
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,521
You're out of your mind.

253
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,108
I'd have to be
to consider working for you.

254
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,793
[door opens]

255
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,088
- [door closes]
- [sighs]

256
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,008
MO KIJOON

257
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,262
Where are you?

258
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,223
Come up.

259
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,558
Come up here right now, you asshole!

260
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,484
[elevator dings]

261
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,252
- [whacking]
- [Inju exclaims]

262
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,380
[yells]

263
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,464
Oh!

264
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,927
I'm the one hitting you, and I'm tired!
Hey, does that hurt?

265
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,473
- No, sir.
- That's right.

266
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,476
I told you. I'm hitting you,
but I'm the one dying here.

267
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,436
Yes, sir.

268
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,146
Starting tomorrow,

269
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,649
have someone follow Han Taeoh.

270
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,278
No, wait.

271
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,031
I can only trust you.

272
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,701
You do it.

273
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,538
Don't eat or sleep.
Watch him closely, okay?

274
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:31,957
Yes, sir.

275
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,501
[clatters]

276
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,670
[sighs]

277
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,051
What are you looking at? Get out.

278
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,685
[door opens]

279
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,104
- [exhales]
- [door closes]

280
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,188
[sighs]

281
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,275
If he's a human being,

282
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,945
I'm sure we're bound
to find something he's hiding

283
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,197
if we look hard enough.

284
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,784
- [sirens wailing in distance]
- [footsteps approaching]

285
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,052
The situation is bad,
yet you seem relaxed.

286
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,013
You and Inha aren't the only ones
who need comfort.

287
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,015
I need to be comforted too.

288
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:36,021
You're not expecting that comfort
to come from me, are you?

289
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,442
I can't afford that right now.

290
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,528
Chairman Kang has collapsed.

291
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,449
Kang Seongju will seize the chance to rise
while carrying his mom.

292
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,160
What can we do in a situation like this?

293
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,749
Wait.

294
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,919
That's not the answer I wanted.

295
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,881
At the very least,
you should have the answer.

296
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,175
You say not to expect comfort from you...

297
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,470
but you want answers from me.

298
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,390
You said to trust you.

299
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,559
Then shouldn't you have all the answers?

300
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,813
Kang Inha is the only person
who can demand anything from me.

301
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,024
What if I become...

302
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,569
someone who can demand things
from you soon?

303
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,906
Soon?

304
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,494
Marriage?

305
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,122
Why does that sound like
a full stop to me?

306
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,457
As if your ultimate goal...

307
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,335
was always getting married.

308
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,754
But it's not, is it?

309
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,007
Are you trying to interfere
with my view on life now?

310
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,342
Fine.

311
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,886
Let's say that's your ultimate goal.

312
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,347
Then instead of looking so angry,

313
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,141
shouldn't you use your head...

314
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,225
[scoffs]

315
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,853
...to try and find a way
to overcome this crisis on your own?

316
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,522
Or at least pretend to?

317
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,774
You could put in the effort...

318
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,402
to achieve your goal.

319
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,989
That's not advice. You're berating me.

320
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,241
Thanks.

321
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,325
Don't mention it.

322
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,860
[door opens]

323
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,828
I'm here, sir.

324
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,378
[tires screeching]

325
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,679
[engine accelerating]

326
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,397
Can I trust you?

327
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,528
[Taeoh] You know my weakness.

328
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,659
If I fail...

329
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,286
I'll expose your weakness.

330
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,622
If I succeed?

331
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:45,335
- Did this work come at a cost?
- Reward and punishment come as one.

332
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,505
You've never once asked for a reward.

333
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,384
I plan on asking for more from now on.

334
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:59,099
[Joongmo] Sometimes I think that
I didn't choose you,

335
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,476
but you chose me.

336
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,895
If that's true...

337
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,857
- why me?
- I never chose you.

338
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,736
I chose my future based on my judgement.

339
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,029
Your future?

340
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,532
Yes, my future.

341
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,033
[Joongmo] Then answer me.

342
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,036
This dangerous act
we're performing right now.

343
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:25,125
Are we doing it for you or for me?

344
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,842
Chu Hyeokjin, you bastard!

345
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,764
Vice President Kang Seongju.

346
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:44,436
- Tell him to come here now.
- Will you call him here and punish him?

347
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,729
How?

348
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,523
A demotion? Pay cut?
Will you confine him to his villa?

349
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,858
I won't forgive anyone,

350
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,485
not even you,
for insulting my son like that.

351
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,405
I'm sure you can let it slide this time.
And after that?

352
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,116
Can you guarantee
you can stop him next time?

353
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,037
The question of guarantee.

354
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,874
You bring it up because you're confident
you can handle it.

355
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,501
A one-off approach.

356
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,588
It should be finished with a first strike.

357
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,591
Make sure they don't try it a second time.

358
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:18,053
Eliminate future threats
that could come after.

359
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:19,971
I will...

360
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,850
- file a complaint against you.
- What?

361
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,101
An anonymous source

362
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:29,606
whistle-blowing the dark connection
between Milton and you.

363
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,108
We will move one step ahead of them.

364
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,988
Vice President Kang Seongju will never
be able to raise this problem again.

365
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,955
Who did you have your eye on
in the prosecution?

366
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,503
Prosecutor Ha Myeongjin.

367
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:55,090
He used to be a cop
and has no other connections.

368
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,426
An ex-cop prosecutor with no connections.

369
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,887
I bet he's thirsty.

370
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,722
Whether it's a promotion or money...

371
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:04,974
or both.

372
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,020
What's my role in your plan?

373
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,189
Just stay silent.

374
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,818
As if nothing has happened.

375
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:19,614
As for Milton,
continue to handle it as usual.

376
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,247
Who will benefit more

377
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,500
from what we're doing right now?
You or me?

378
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,419
Neither you nor I.

379
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,630
The biggest beneficiary in this...

380
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,508
will be the Royal Road Project.

381
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,927
[laughing]

382
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,472
A wise answer to a silly question.

383
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,099
It was a pointless question.

384
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,435
Tell me what you want.

385
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,105
Like you said,
a reward should follow success.

386
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,817
When I'm faced with a big crisis...

387
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,362
just lend me a helping hand.

388
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,781
You know how to crack a joke.

389
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,116
I mean it.

390
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,910
Just think of it as insurance.

391
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,747
Sure.

392
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,541
Now.

393
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,755
Bring out the last piece of the puzzle
you prepared.

394
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,591
Kang Inha.

395
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,303
- Who?
- The last puzzle piece that I prepared

396
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,305
is your third son.

397
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,849
Is that child

398
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,268
the best you could do?

399
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,187
Someone to become your scapegoat.

400
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,147
Someone to become the devil for you.

401
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,899
That's who you need.

402
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:39,319
You're desperate
for someone like that as well.

403
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,989
You speak as if you know
what I'm thinking.

404
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,240
That's your problem.

405
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,994
You need someone from your bloodline
to do what your other two sons can't.

406
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,915
He exists, so why not use him?

407
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,085
Once you're done with him, toss him out.

408
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,172
He was surplus anyway.

409
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:03,426
He's someone who can be used
or discarded when needed.

410
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,726
- [Joongmo] There can't be any setbacks.
- [Taeoh] Yes, sir.

411
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,103
He can't get greedy for Kangoh.

412
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,315
[Taeoh] Yes, sir.

413
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:21,236
Prepare a comprehensive contract
outlining his role,

414
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,404
and specifying what he can and cannot do.

415
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,282
Include every detail, and bring it to me.

416
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,742
Do it yourself.

417
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,453
- Yes, sir.
- As soon as it's ready...

418
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,415
bring him to me.

419
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,627
Yes, sir.

420
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,764
[Donguk] <i>When you say you need me,</i>

421
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,518
is it you or Kang Joongmo?

422
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,272
[inhales sharply] Does it matter?

423
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,439
Of course.

424
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,526
What I want...

425
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,238
isn't a dog like you. I want the owner.

426
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,909
The dog has a new owner.

427
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,998
You don't need to look at me like that.

428
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,877
Either way,
you're the one that's expendable.

429
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,173
[cell phone vibrating]

430
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,844
NA HYEWON

431
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,639
- Kang Seongju just--
- [Hyewon] <i>Inha disappeared.</i>

432
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,400
His phone is off,
and he took some time off from work.

433
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,194
I came to his place, but he's not home.

434
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,948
I don't know where he went.

435
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,056
That...

436
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:14,933
I've seen it before.

437
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,853
- I'll bring him back.
- I'll go too.

438
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,314
Stay here. Nothing will happen.

439
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,492
[door opens and closes]

440
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,579
[waves splashing]

441
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,695
[young Inha] Mom.

442
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,359
You're here.

443
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:52,030
Don't leave the headquarters
for the time being.

444
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:55,825
Can't you handle Kangoh Securities
at headquarters?

445
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,996
I plan on doing just that.
Since we're in a state of emergency,

446
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,206
I'll take care
of the urgent matters first.

447
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,586
You need to be swift
so your father can recover in peace.

448
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,838
[Inju] Hey, Seongju!

449
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,383
Why would you stay at headquarters?

450
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,468
[scoffs]

451
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,388
With the raid and Father's absence,
someone has to deal with this.

452
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,391
Yeah, so why does that have to be you?

453
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,018
Then you do it.

454
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:23,978
Happy?

455
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,732
[inhales sharply] You little...

456
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,941
Wait, you can't.

457
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:34,197
It's been a while since the prosecution
lost trust in you, hasn't it?

458
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,742
- You little punk.
- A stepmother is still a mother.

459
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,911
Common sense and courtesy.

460
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,370
[scoffs]

461
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,997
Is that too much to ask for?

462
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:47,126
Just pick one role.
Either be a stepmother or a mother.

463
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,170
Cut the act. It's sloppy.

464
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,963
- Damn you.
- Damn me?

465
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,049
Stop messing around.

466
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,384
Don't piss me off.

467
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,098
Let's not shed unnecessary blood.

468
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,059
Stop huffing and puffing like that.

469
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,310
You little punk.

470
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,024
- [door slams]
- He's so ignorant.

471
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,986
I think we need to do something.

472
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,947
It's okay, Mother.

473
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,367
Foolish people can only get so far.

474
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,452
That's why he's dangerous.

475
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:25,331
When someone is dumb,
they use brawns over brains first.

476
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,793
Don't you know reckless
and impulsive people are the scariest?

477
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,877
Mother.

478
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,004
Don't worry. Okay?

479
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,132
I'll be home later. Please take it easy.

480
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,678
[door opens and closes]

481
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,772
[cell phone vibrating]

482
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,483
HAN TAEOH

483
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,486
Did you find him?

484
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,738
- [waves splashing]
- Yeah.

485
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,325
[line disconnects]

486
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,370
[sighs]

487
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,004
[Inha] Go.

488
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,339
I want to be alone.

489
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,551
[Taeoh] I'll get to the point.

490
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:23,389
The chairman's fine.
Nothing was wrong with him to begin with.

491
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,067
You should've told me!

492
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,195
At the very least, I should've known!

493
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,827
Calm down.

494
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,705
Just listen to why I lied.

495
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,041
Are you trying to teach me
a lesson right now?

496
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,417
You're amazing, Taeoh.

497
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:56,255
In the end, you didn't trust me. Why?

498
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,051
You thought I'd mess things up,
and you're the only capable one!

499
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,056
It wasn't you,
I just didn't trust the situation.

500
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,350
- Don't play games with me.
- Games?

501
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,311
You think I bet my entire life on you
to play pointless games?

502
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,774
If things don't go according to plan,
you'll have to survive to start over!

503
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,611
What if I drag you into this and we fail?

504
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,154
It's over then.

505
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,115
I'd do the same thing again. Why?

506
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,327
For you, Inha.

507
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,497
[Inha sighs]

508
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,208
You always say it's for me.

509
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,961
Not for you, but for me.

510
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:40,675
Making you the chairman of Kangoh
is the reason I exist.

511
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,094
[scoffs softly]

512
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,054
That's the reason?

513
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:47,848
Then what about you?

514
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,852
Does nothing exist for you?

515
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,437
Nothing.

516
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,564
Ah.

517
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,360
If there was anything, it's you, Inha.

518
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:01,654
Except for me.

519
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,158
The one thing you want for yourself.

520
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,370
Nothing.

521
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,956
The reason I exist...

522
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,500
is you and only you.

523
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,554
Let's go. The chairman wants to see you.

524
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,933
Chairman Kang Joongmo's third son,
Kang Inha.

525
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,102
This is the start.

526
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,531
- [♪ upbeat song playing]
- [glasses clinking]

527
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:02,798
What? [chuckles softly] Who is this?

528
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,301
[Huiju scoffs softly]

529
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,386
I can't bring myself to see this.

530
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,390
As for the rest of you,
will you excuse us?

531
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,060
Who are you to tell my friends to leave?

532
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,021
Do you want to be humiliated
in front of them?

533
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,774
Or would you rather endure it alone?

534
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,069
Get out.

535
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,196
I said, get out.

536
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,450
[woman] What the heck.

537
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,454
Now.

538
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,791
How will you humiliate me?
Go ahead and do it.

539
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,876
Ko Huichan...

540
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,295
I will not marry you.

541
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,005
What?

542
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,673
That was it?

543
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,885
I'm glad you feel that way.

544
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,305
Anyway, I don't like you.

545
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,851
So don't dream of marrying me.

546
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,145
I heard our parents all want this.

547
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,314
Then you can marry the parents.

548
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:05,403
- I hear your dad's in critical condition.
- Forget it. I've told you what I want.

549
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,279
Do you have a lover?

550
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,450
I know you have one too.

551
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,327
So you do have one.

552
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,955
I'm glad we have something in common.
That's good.

553
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,582
Moron.

554
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:21,794
[grunts softly]

555
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:27,425
- Hey.
- You convince your parents.

556
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:30,886
[chuckles softly]

557
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,017

- [line ringing]

560

Mom.

561
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:56,120
I'm going to do what Dad wants
and date her officially.

562
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,675
[tires screeching]

563
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,141

[car door closes]

565
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,191
What are you doing?

566
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,194
At least you'll pretend to know me
if I die because of you.

567
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,820
Are you being serious?

568
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,364
When have I ever
not been serious with you?

569
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,284
No matter what I did,
you've never taken me seriously.

570
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,290
It's late. Go home.

571
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,880

577
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,126
There's no point.

578
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,587
You know I can do this all night.

579
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,815
Go.

580
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,819
[sighs softly] I'm going
to tell my parents

581
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,071
that I'm going to marry you.

582
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,408
You just wait and see.

583
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,910
I'll take care of everything.

584
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,248
My parents will have no choice
if I insist.

585
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,168
Okay, let's get married.

586
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,005
What's next?

587
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,800
Do you think your parents will give in?

588
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,969
In the meantime, what about me?

589
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:22,224
Shall I endure being treated like scum
and dream of becoming your husband?

590
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:23,976
I'll protect you.

591
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,894
What will you protect me with?

592
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,232
Huiju.

593
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,278
Your job isn't to protect me.
It's to protect yourself.

594
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,239
Surviving the Kangoh family.

595
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,826
Do you still think
the world is on your side?

596
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:43,746
This isn't a fairy tale,
and there's no happily ever after.

597
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,123
You should've stopped
the princess act by now!

598
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,752
Is it a crime to love you my whole life?

599
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:54,173
Can't I dream of a fairy tale world
where we live happily ever after?

600
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,884
I'll turn that fairy tale into a reality!

601
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,427
[breathing heavily]

602
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,763
It's a crime if it's forced.

603
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,682
Don't drag me into your fairy tale.

604
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,644
Wait and see.

605
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,105
See if I marry you...

606
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,108
or not.

607
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,861
If you want to waste your time,
be my guest.

608
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,781
I won't change.

615
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,604
I know you're all busy.

616
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,647
I won't waste too much of your time.

617
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,983
Let's discuss the main agenda briefly.

618
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,568
According to legal procedures,

619
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,197
I'm sure everyone here is fully aware

620
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,783
that while Chairman Kang is away,

621
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:29,536
I am obligated to take the role

622
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,789
as the acting chairman.

623
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:38,754
However, I lack too much
to take responsibility of Kangoh Group.

624
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:42,549
That being said,
I know myself all too well.

625
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,012
For that reason, I have decided that...

626
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:52,893
for the sake of Kangoh
and for all of you here,

627
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:57,981
a much more qualified leader
should lead Kangoh Group.

628
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,820
I nominate Kang Seongju,
the president of Kangoh Securities,

629
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,907
to be the acting chairman of Kangoh Group.

630

637
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,086
A thousand shares per person?

638
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,840
What? It's not 1,000 won per share?

639
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,053
[man] What? I don't believe it!

640
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,189
Sir, something's off
with Kangoh Securities.

641
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:23,942
What is this?

642
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,570
5,013,000 shares?

643
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,782
- Call Kangoh Securities! Hurry! Go!
- [phone ringing]

644
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,867
[man] Yes, sir.

645
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,831
You just rest.

646
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:43,253
Your son, Seongju,
will lead Kangoh Group well.

647
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,006
Don't worry about a thing.

648
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:56,141
Kang Seongju's time is now.

649
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:59,186
Kangoh will become your world.

[cell phone vibrating]

651
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,572
Just a moment.

652
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,370
Yes, if it's not urgent,
can we talk later...

653
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,750
What did you say?

654
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,962
{\an8}<i>Kangoh Securities shareholders</i>
<i>have received</i>

{\an8}<i>instead of small dividends.</i>

657
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:32,260
An unprecedented selling accident
at Kangoh Securities.

658
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,971
Instead of 1,000 won per share,

659
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:38,308
shareholders received 1,000 shares
in this ridiculous accident.

<i>in the stock market today.</i>

How in the world did this happen?

663
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,361
There seems to have been a technical error
in the process.

664
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,529
Mr. Yang!

665
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,536

Kang Seongju's command,

the Kangoh Securities legal team
have called a meeting.

However, this violates
excessive issuance of stocks

under Commercial Law Article 629.

673
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,733
There is no way to avoid
the prosecution summons

680

They certainly went too far with this.

How could they sell over
five million shares in half a day?

682
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,544
How is that a technical error?

A hundred and twelve trillion won.

684

But was this really a mistake?

Is something up?

There's a rumor I did it.

688
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,642
- I don't know...
- Do I look crazy?

689
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,728
Why would I go through the hassle?

690
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:07,189
I'd rather kill him
than go through the trouble.

What's Seongju going to do now?

693
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,283
All he wanted to do
was stay at headquarters.

694
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:23,246
I bet he's going to get the boot soon.

I'm sorry for harming Kangoh's image.

702
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:22,889
If something like that could harm Kangoh,
we wouldn't be at our best as we are now.

703
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,810
I'm sure you did this knowing that,
so why did you do it?

This is our first time meeting
face-to-face.

So it was a gift for me.

- Which means you want something in return.

00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,909
I believe every gift comes with a price.

709
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:49,291
I have also experienced that nothing
in this world is for free.

710
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,084
What do you want?

711
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,546
[sighs]

712
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,756
If I save you--

713
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,717
You'll save me?

714
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,762
Isn't that why you were looking for me?

715
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,764
If I save you,

716
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:09,519
officially acknowledge me
as a person of Kangoh.

717
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,563
As Chairman Kang Joongmo's son.

718
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,440
As Kang Inha.

719
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,691
[Taeoh] <i>Don't back out now.</i>

720
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,194
The moment you hesitate or waver...

721
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,571
it's game over.

722
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,659
[laughing]

723
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:33,710
It seems you hold value
to the title of being my son.

724
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,880
[chuckles softly] Not at all.

725
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,840
I am well aware

726
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:44,304
that being your son is nothing more
than just a label.

727
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:46,973
But?

728
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,768
Please make an exception for me.

729
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,229
"Kang Inha is Kang Joongmo's son."

730
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,273
Please make sure everyone's aware of that.

731
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,651
I want the world to know.

732
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,111
Please, do it yourself.

733
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,491
That's my condition for this deal.
It's the only way...

734
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,870
Kang Joongmo's Kangoh can continue.

735
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:11,915
[exclaims softly]

736
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,344
Read it and sign it if you agree.

737
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,222
We can catch up after that.

738
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,395
[Inha sighs]

739
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,944
HEIR TO KANGOH
CONTRACT

740
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:42,821
What if...

741
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,033
I don't sign? What happens then?

742
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,246
We won't see each other again.

743
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,583
Then I guess I have no choice...

744
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,044
but to sign.

745
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:09,180
Foreign investors continue to sell
amid bad news from Kangoh Securities.

746
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,265
[man] There he is!

747
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,142
[camera shutter clicking]

748
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,436
[woman 1] Is it true that
Gold & Simon were involved?

749
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,188
[man 1] Do you admit that losses fall
on the small investors?

750
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:20,650
[woman 2] How do you feel about sucking
the life out of those small investors?

751
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,944
Do you have anything to say
to the investors?

752
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,738
[man 2] Can you give us a few words?

753
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,072
[woman 3] Please share a few words!

754
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,326
- We'll make a statement next time.
- [reporters clamoring]

755
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,453
[door closes]

756
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,038
[sighs]

757
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,625
[scoffs]

758
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,218
[plant stems snapping]

759
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,394
[Joongmo] Will that really
get rid of your anger?

760
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:04,819
You...

761
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,574
What are you doing here?

762
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,785
[sighs softly]

763
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:13,787
Wait.

764
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,499
Did you trick all of us?

765
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,045
Were you just playing with us?

766
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:25,757
[Joongmo] Exactly.

767
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:29,594
You should've put your plan into action
if you wanted to kill me.

768
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:32,806
[Geumseok grunts softly]

769
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,184
[Joongmo] You still don't know?

770
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:41,481
You can't take anything from me.

771
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,690
I'll kill you!

772
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,443
Ah!

773
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:48,863
[Joongmo] You missed your chance.

774
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:50,615
I'm alive,

775
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:53,827
and I came back to punish you.

776
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,705
You can look forward
to my punishment for you.

777
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,544
I'll see you at the board meeting.

778
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,011
- Mother, what did...
- [screaming]

779
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,904
[door opens and closes]

780
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,284
[Mr. Moon chuckles softly]

781
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,119
Sir.

782
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,749
Prepare a feast for dinner.
We'll have a guest.

783
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,669
Tell everyone to attend dinner.

784
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:46,963
Yes, sir.

785
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,257
[gate opens]

786
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:23,708
[Joongmo] Skip the formalities
and just have a seat.

787
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,335
Yes, Father.

788
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:38,806
[cutlery clatters]

789
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,275
[door opens and closes]

790
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,862
Inha, welcome.

791
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,239
A big welcome.

792
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,243
Let's begin.

793
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,543
[camera shutter clicking]

794
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:45,123
Chairman Kang, do you acknowledge
your relationship with Milton?

795
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,875
Do you have anything to say
about Kangoh Securities?

796
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,544
[reporter 1] Please, say something.

797
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,382
Are you ready, Father?

798
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,009
[reporters] Father?

799
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,093
Did he say "father"?

800
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,763
- [reporter 2] Is he really your son?
- [reporter 3] Say something please.

801
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,849
[reporter 4] Did you have a child
out of wedlock?

802
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,893
- [reporter 5] Please, say a word!
- [reporters speaking indistinctly]

803
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,864
[♪ melancholy song playing]
