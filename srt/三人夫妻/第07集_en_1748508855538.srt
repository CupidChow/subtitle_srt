2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,560
There is aatorship, does the

3
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,040
Rice Restaurant offer the

4
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:56,160
members of staff to live together

5
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,400
so that,

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,440
it is

7
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,440
Don't play with me!

8
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,440
Well...

9
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
I'll pay for it.

10
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
Miya!

11
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
Wait!

12
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Miya!

13
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Wait!

14
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
Hey, I'm dead!

15
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
Miya!

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
I'm dead!

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,440
This is a story about three people getting married.

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
Let's get started.

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Start!

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,440
Honey!

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
Even if that happens,

22
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,440
you have to go to work properly, Miya.

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,440
From 10 am to 1.30 am,

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,440
the marriage is held every year.

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,440
I'll go to work properly.

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
I'll pay for it.

27
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
I'll pay for it.

28
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Hey, Miya!

29
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
Miya!

30
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
Miya!

31
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
Miya!

32
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
Here you go.

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,440
I'll go to play again.

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Sorry.

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
Thank you.

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
Honey, what should I do?

37
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
Honey!

38
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
Sorry.

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,440
I can't get in the way of time.

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
I'll go to the wrong place.

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Come back!

42
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,440
It's Miya's mother.

43
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
Megumi.

44
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,440
I wonder if she's the one who bought it herself.

45
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
What?

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Are you having trouble?

47
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,440
I can't tell you what happened.

48
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
It's okay.

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,440
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,440
I am okay, but I think of a fuga that plays a prank on me in my heart.

65
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,440
I found something.

66
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,440
For example,

67
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
it was red when I used to drink quail milk.

68
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
No way!

69
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,440
I'm sending thisSte Banko photo to wore son's date.

70
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,440
You were showing off my connected bad things because I wanted to be a nice girl.

71
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
I was so happy to see you.

72
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,440
And I was so happy to see you.

73
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,440
But you said you had no choice but to be with me.

74
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
No way!

75
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,440
And the man in the 13th grade, Ken?

76
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,440
He was so kind to send me to the 11th grade every day after the school.

77
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
I was the one who was sent to the school, right?

78
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,440
Of course.

79
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,440
You said you were the one who was sent to the school,

80
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,440
and you were the one who was sent to the school.

81
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,440
And you were sent to the school, and you were 10 km away.

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,440
I was so young.

83
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
You were so mature.

84
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,440
You were born in a room called the princess's room.

85
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Or the princess's room.

86
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,440
Or the giant room.

87
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,440
Look at that.

88
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,440
You look like a prince to the young man.

89
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,440
I'm not a princess.

90
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,440
I was always in a good mood for you.

91
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,440
You should have told me.

92
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,440
I'm not the type to say things that everyone wants to say.

93
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,440
I don't know what happened,

94
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,440
but I think it's better to have a good image of yourself.

95
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Where are you going?

96
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
You bought my clothes, didn't you?

97
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,440
No, it's not like that.

98
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,440
It's better to have a good image of yourself.

99
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,440
I'm not good at that.

100
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,440
I misunderstood that I was being a man to you two.

101
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,440
I thought that the relationship between the two of us would be established.

102
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,440
I thought that the world was turning around me.

103
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,440
I'm in a great situation.

104
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Hey, you guys!

105
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
I'm working!

106
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,440
3 of you.

107
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,440
I hope you come back anytime.

108
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,440
It's the 7th year of the Gyoza.

109
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,440
Mia, are you eating?

110
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
I'm eating.

111
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,440
When I married my favorite idol, he cried and ate a lot of bonito.

112
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,440
By the way, Mia, you can eat natto.

113
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
What?

114
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
You can eat curry.

115
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,440
That's the worst.

116
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,440
If you eat something sour, you'll be energetic.

117
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,440
He's not eating, but he's energetic.

118
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,440
What are you talking about?

119
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,440
I'm not going to come back to Mia when I eat Gyoza.

120
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,440
He's not happy to have a lot of it.

121
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,440
Don't you say that?

122
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,440
He doesn't eat what he likes, even though he comes to Gyoza every day for Mia.

123
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,440
I've never made curry for him.

124
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,440
I didn't know that.

125
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Really?

126
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
No.

127
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,440
I'll make Japanese curry for him tomorrow.

128
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,440
Hey, let me have it.

129
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Hurry up.

130
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
It's good.

131
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,440
I like your work.

132
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
I'll make it for you.

133
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
If...

134
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
If...

135
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,440
If Mia didn't come back to Gyoza,

136
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,440
I think we could have a chance.

137
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:26,440
I can't say it well, but I like Mr. Takuzo who cares about Mia.

138
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
What do you mean?

139
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,440
He goes to the car late at night,

140
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,440
and he works with three weird wives.

141
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,440
He's kind of a weirdo, but he likes Mr. Takuzo.

142
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Mia always cares about Mr. Takuzo,

143
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,440
when she says she doesn't like him.

144
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,440
I'm jealous of those two.

146
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,440
I want to be a part of them.

147
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
That's why I like them.

148
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Good luck, Mr. Takuzo.

149
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Fighting!

150
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,440
This is the best day for Dragon Chronicle 4.

151
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Tenbuyer?

152
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,440
The game is on.

153
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
No, no.

154
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,440
Hey, there's something like you and me.

155
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,440
I can't let anyone get what I want.

156
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,440
My stuff!

157
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Me! Me!

158
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
What?

159
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Takuzo, what are you doing here?

160
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
I'm...

161
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:35,440
I think it's good for me to be a part of them.

162
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Mia's boyfriend...

163
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
He's a good guy.

164
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,440
He's a good guy.

165
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
That's...

167
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,440
I think it's for the sake of my life.

168
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,440
When we were dating,

169
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,440
you didn't do anything so unprofessional, did you?

170
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,440
Not for Shinpei.

171
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Then, for yourself?

172
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,440
You don't want to be separated from Shinpei, do you?

173
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
That's...

174
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Yes.

175
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
It was for my own good.

176
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,440
I was in a car all this time.

177
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,440
I was satisfied with my love for you.

178
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
I was satisfied with it.

179
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
And then,

180
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,440
I ran away from you.

181
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,440
I had three of us.

182
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:40,440
I might regret it.

183
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
But...

184
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,440
I want to live with you.

185
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
I'm waiting for you.

186
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
This is the sycobia.

187
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
No, I'll take it.

188
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Three of us?

189
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,440
If I change my shoulder,

190
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,440
which one will be the top and the bottom?

191
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,440
Three of us.

193
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
I'm home.

194
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
I'm home.

195
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Welcome home.

196
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
I'm full.

197
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,440
You're too full to eat curry and gyoza.

198
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,440
I think so.

199
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Living with three of us is a luxury.

200
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
I think so.

201
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Well...

202
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
Yes.

203
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Yes.

204
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Well then...

205
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Here.

206
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,440
Can I ask you to give me another one?

207
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
What?

208
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Shinpei.

209
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Takuzo.

210
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
What should I do?

211
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,440
Three of us are the top three.

212
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Is it impossible to be the top three?

213
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
I don't know.

215
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,440
I don't care.

216
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
I don't care.

217
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
I don't care.

218
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
But...

219
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,440
I want to face them.

220
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Yes.

221
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
I see.

222
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,440
Well, I'll answer it with my voice.

223
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Okay?

224
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
Okay.

225
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,440
Okay.

226
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
Three of us.

227
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Are you ready?

228
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Ready, set...

229
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Go!

230
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
No!

231
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
Wait a minute.

232
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
There are two Joka.

233
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
What?

234
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,440
I'm going to the Love Hotel as the next step.

235
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
The final day.

236
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
I'm excited.

237
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,440
Do you want to buy something in the convenience store?

238
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,440
There's nothing inside.

239
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,440
But it might not be enough.

240
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
What about condoms?

241
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
I brought a lot.

242
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
I didn't expect it.

243
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
Isn't it big?

244
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
I brought a lot because it's small.

245
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
There are a lot.

246
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
I'm excited.

247
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
I'm excited.

248
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
I'm excited.

249
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
I'm excited.

250
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
Here it is.

251
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Yes.

252
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
I'm excited.

253
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
I'm excited.

254
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
I'm excited.

255
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
I'm excited.

256
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
Okay, then.

257
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
What are you doing?

258
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
What are you doing?

259
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
I can't do this.

260
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
I can't do this.

261
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
Mr. Park?

262
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
What are you doing?

263
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
What are you doing?

264
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,440
I'm sorry.

265
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
I'm sorry.

266
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
I'm sorry.

267
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
Mr. Kim?

269
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
What happened?

270
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Do you want to call the police?

271
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Don't call the police.

272
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Are you crazy?

273
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
I'm embarrassed.

274
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
I'm sorry.

275
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
Are you a shoe?

276
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
I'll call the police.

277
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
What are you doing?

278
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
I was in a bad situation.

279
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
I was in a bad situation.

280
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
I was in a bad situation.

281
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
Mr. Park.

282
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
What's going on?

283
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
Honey-Fu-Fu-Key-Kak.

284
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
What's up?

285
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
It's funny.

286
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
What's up?

287
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
I'm sorry.

288
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
I'm going to make a reservation for your parents.

289
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,440
Maybe you'll meet someone who thinks you're a girl.

290
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
I want to change.
