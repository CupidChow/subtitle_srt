1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
A day before the marriage

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
A house by myself

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A morning by myself

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
A man drinking the coffee I put in by himself

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Mitsuda Takuzo

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The protagonist of this story

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'll think about the marriage a while ago

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,620
Ngoji

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Nice to meet you

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,200
I want to say goodbye to you

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
The next day

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,200
The staff is moving a little bit, and this is the girl

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Then, I'll let you sign the contract

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Yes

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Thank you very much

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Thank you very much

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,200
This girl is also a single person, Miyaguchi Yanaguchi

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,200
This is also the main character

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
If you like, everyone can sign this

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Is it okay? Thank you very much

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
Please sign it

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,200
The first step is to move on to this point

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
I'm really glad to see you, Miyaguchi

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,200
I've been living for 10 years

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,200
The one who can do work

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,200
The one who got a curry from the customer

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
I'll also sign it

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
Thank you

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,200
The one who can take the most valuable number

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Miyaguchi, you were not a vegan

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,200
No, I was a vegetarian

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
I'll eat it

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
But

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Love, marriage, and heaven are not good

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
The whole body is in a state of emergency

36
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
I'm tired

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Please

38
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Thank you

39
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,200
What's wrong?

40
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,200
The girl who is in a relationship with a dancer who is 24 million yen a year

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Ponkotsu Miyajan

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Shinpei

43
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
What?

44
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,200
I'm going to marry my friend's wedding this week

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Yes

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
I heard

47
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,200
I'm sorry, I've been busy with my work

48
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,200
I'm going to get married

49
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,200
I'm going to get married to that guy

50
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Dash

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,200
By the way, this girl is also a main character

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Satomura Shinpei

53
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
It's rare

54
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,200
There are many people who are not married now

55
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Really, everyone thinks about it

56
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,200
I'm sure

57
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
I know

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Marriage is not only happiness

59
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,200
I've heard such things a million times

60
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,200
I understand it with a lot of effort

61
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
But

62
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
It's a good thing

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Shinpei

64
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Are you free this week?

65
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Yes

66
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Please exchange your ring with the two of you

67
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm sorry

68
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Yuki, congratulations

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Congratulations

70
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
It's beautiful

71
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Tell me, appeal

72
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Write, pressure

73
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,200
The two of you are recognized as a husband

74
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Yaya's style is different

75
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
As a result

76
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
It's amazing

77
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
I'm so happy

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,200
What's going on with the law?

79
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
It's a good thing

80
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
I made a contract

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Contract?

82
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Yes, it's a contract for a high school

83
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,200
I decided on the case of marriage

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,200
And I made a contract for a proper role

85
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Marriage is free

86
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Yes, it's different from the family contract

87
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Marriage is not that heavy

88
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
I see

89
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,200
From now on, no matter what happens

90
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Let's take care of it

91
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
To protect your smile

92
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,200
And to make us happy

93
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,200
I'll be grateful for your love

94
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,200
From now on, please

95
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Miyako

96
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,200
I thought it was amazing

97
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,200
I think it's possible if it's not the two of us

98
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,200
It's possible even if it's not the two of us

99
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,200
What do you mean?

100
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,200
It's better not to be too many

101
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,200
It's not that big

102
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Three people

103
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
I might be able to get married if it's three people

104
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Congratulations on your great discovery

105
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,200
I can do it

106
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
I can't support them alone

107
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,200
But I think they can support me

108
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,200
If I'm alone, I'll be better

109
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,200
I don't think so

110
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Are you serious?

111
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Of course

112
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Because you want to get married

113
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,200
What? You said that?

114
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
I didn't say that

115
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,200
But I'm getting a lot of money

116
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
I'll say it

117
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,200
But I want to do what I can

118
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,200
But it's so hard for the two of us

119
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
We're in the middle of a responsibility

120
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Mia is also the main part of my life

121
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Aren't you scared?

122
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
It's me

123
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
But if it's three people

124
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
I can see it

125
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,200
I can see the hope

126
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
I can do it

127
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
No, no, no

128
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
What?

129
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Let's find it

130
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,200
The person who can be married if it's three people

131
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
We're home

132
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
So this is

133
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
We're home

134
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Three people are coming

135
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Three people like this?

136
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,200
They're talking about getting married

137
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Three people

138
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,200
What are three people?

139
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
That day

140
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
What are you thinking about?

141
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Momomomom

142
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Momomomom

143
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,200
What's going on?

144
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Momomomom

145
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Momomomomom

146
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Three people

147
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
They're talking about getting married

148
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I don't know

149
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
I don't know

150
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
It's weird

151
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
You don't need it

152
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Who are you?

153
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Momomomomomom

154
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
What?

155
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
You know

156
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,200
I got a call from my ex

157
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Yeah

158
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200
He said he's going to get a divorce tomorrow

159
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
What?

160
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
I see

161
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
It's a shame

162
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,200
I think I was going to get a divorce

163
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Yeah, I'll be right back

164
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
What?

165
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Are you sure?

166
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Of course

167
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
You're kind

168
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,200
You're so nice

169
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
You're so nice

170
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
So

171
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,200
I brought you here

172
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Long time no see

173
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Long time no see

174
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,200
I got a message from you

175
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm worried about you

176
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Hi

177
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
How are you?

178
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,200
I thought you'd be jealous

179
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Sorry

180
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
I wanted to give you a kiss

181
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Did I?

182
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Go up

183
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Go ahead

184
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Then you can think of something stupid

185
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,200
I'm glad you came to see me

186
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
I've been smelling it for a month

187
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
I see

188
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,200
But I was almost 100 years old

189
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
I'm a big girl

190
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
I'm sorry

191
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,200
I'm a rabbit pack

192
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,200
I've been watching Takuzo and Miyachan and Shinpei from heaven

193
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,200
The opening video is my birthday

194
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,200
I was able to give a happy life thanks to Takuzo

195
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,200
So Miyachan's secret strategy starts

196
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Why did you choose a rabbit?

197
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,200
I wanted to buy it because I saw you, the owner of the Ushijima-kun

198
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
What a secret

199
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,200
I'm so happy to read that manga

200
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
What a secret

201
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Shut up

202
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,200
I like rabbit scenes

203
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
I like it

204
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
I like it

205
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Really?

206
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
I like it

207
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Did you make it all?

208
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
No, I made it

209
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,200
I made it and made it

210
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Wow

211
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Takuzo is a good guy

212
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Takuzo?

213
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm so proud of you

214
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,200
I respect you, Takuzo

215
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
I can't do this

216
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Can I see something else?

217
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
No effect

218
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,200
I'm curious about the one you made

219
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Which one?

220
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,200
I want to see the back

221
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
What about an hour later?

222
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,200
I know, I'm a seed-ha

223
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I'm so happy

224
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
I like it

225
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,200
I like it

226
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,200
I like it

227
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Miyachan

228
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
What?

229
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Why did you break up with such a good guy?

230
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,200
It's interesting and solid

231
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
It's the best

232
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,200
You...

233
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
That's not good

234
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
What?

235
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,200
You can't say that

236
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,200
You're so pitiful

237
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,200
What do you mean?

238
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,200
I was so upset

239
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
I was drinking at the waterfront

240
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
I was going to the car

241
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
I was going to the car no matter how far I went

242
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,200
It was raining and I was going to the car

243
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
I was going to the car no matter how far I went

244
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
I hated it so much

245
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,200
That's why I broke up with you

246
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
I don't know

247
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
What?

248
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
You're kind

249
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
No

250
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,200
I'm heavy

251
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,200
You're good

252
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Takuzo said he would send me even in this situation

253
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,200
He's a good guy

254
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Shinpei...

255
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,200
You said that because you didn't want to get married

256
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Three of us?

257
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,200
That's all there is to it

258
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
On the contrary

259
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,200
I want to be with you forever

260
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,200
I want to find the shape of you

261
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,200
I want to be with you forever

262
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
I thought about it

263
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,200
But I've been thinking about it

264
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Now...

265
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,200
I'm serious

266
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Here it comes

267
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,200
What's wrong?

268
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Sorry

269
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
I've been staying up all night

270
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
What?

271
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
That's right

272
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
If you were so far away

273
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
You'd have to pay 18,000 yen

274
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Sorry

275
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Alright

276
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Alright

277
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
There's a car nearby

278
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Let's go

279
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Miya can drive

280
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
We'll drive

281
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
What?

282
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
I'm sorry

283
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
I'm sorry

284
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
I'm dead

285
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
I'm alone

286
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
I'm sorry

287
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
18,000 km?

288
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,200
This distance is for Miya

289
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,200
It's not all

290
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
But

291
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
It's heavy

292
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
It's kind

293
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Takuzo

294
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,200
I'm sure Miya has this

295
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,200
The kindness she felt

296
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Is it because she's with someone

297
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,200
That she's so comfortable?

298
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
I'm sorry

299
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Good morning

300
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Can I have a minute?

301
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Sorry to keep you waiting

302
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
It looks so good

303
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
I'll get it for you

304
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Wow

305
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
It's good

306
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
It's good

307
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
Here you go

308
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,200
What's this?

309
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
I'll have a bite

310
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
No

311
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,200
If you're going to make me a big bite

312
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
It's fine

313
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Takuzo

314
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Yes

315
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Can we be

316
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Three people?

317
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Please

318
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
What?

319
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
I'll do it

320
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
If you could come in again

321
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
If you could come in again

322
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,200
I think Miya will marry you

323
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Are you going to marry me?

324
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
What?

325
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
I won't do today's work
