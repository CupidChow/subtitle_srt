00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,540
Ukensvit

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,000
On the next day, Tak Manhashita was announced.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,620
Three of us said,

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,000
how about we try it and try for the first year

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Thank you, Mr. Takuzo.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Three people?

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Mr. Takuzo, I just called you on the new house.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want you to make the new house three people.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Three people?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes. Three parents and three children.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I think the children will be waiting for the bed.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, I see.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I beg you.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Poor thing.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Three people became a part of the word.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Mr. Takuzo, do you want a bun?

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
One last one.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Don't eat the crushed bun.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What?

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's go.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'll take care of it.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
One liter.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Good.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm also in trouble.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I want to go somewhere.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll call you.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank you for five years.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm from the Beaver Construction Agency.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, I am.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Excuse me, but I want to name you...

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Mr. Sato Mura Shinpei.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Don't call me.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Mr. Takuzo, do you have anything to do?

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What?

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm going to the office.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Mr. Takuzo, I have a appointment with a customer.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Mr. Takuzo.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Mr. Takuzo.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hurry up.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Mr. Takuzo.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm going to the office.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll bring you a book.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I see.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Mr. Takuzo.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm busy.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hurry up.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hurry up.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I want to go to the hot spring.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I see.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll go to the hot spring.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I see.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll go to the hot spring.

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll go to the hot spring.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Excuse me.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What is this?

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Excuse me.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
30 years old is the first time I've ever been an adult.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I see.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No, I don't understand.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But...

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I feel like I like my husband.

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I like him.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If it's not like this, I can't marry Takuzo for the rest of my life.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What?

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mia.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I see.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I love you.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I should have.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm home.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Welcome home.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Mia.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What?

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What?

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You...

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Wait.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm home.

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Wake up.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Mia.

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Wake up.

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What?

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
One, two, three.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Wait.

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What?

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What?

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What?

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What?

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What?

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Mia.

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's go to the hot spring.

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The hot spring?

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Of course, three of us.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll go to the hot spring.

95
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What?

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What?

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What?

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What?

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
gosa

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Bring me here.

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Dude, that's...

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's a rocks.

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's almost a drama.

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
SwrÃ¤ge

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm tired.

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm going.

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm going.

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm going.

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's go see the alpaca next time.

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm tired. I want to go to the hot spring.

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's an alpaca.

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What are you going to do with that dirty piece of trash?

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's easy.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Then, the alpaca.

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The one you want to see.

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I know.

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's okay.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There's no way to get rid of the alpaca.

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Maybe this is a three-person merit?

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Mia will never let you go.

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Then, you'll fight.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're going to fight with me, and I'll be against you.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You're going to fight with me, and I'll be against you.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You're a special person.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Why do you have to go to the alpaca?

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What are you going to do with the sandalwood?

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's sandalwood.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's sandalwood that you've been tweeting about.

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What is sandalwood?

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's white and long like a grape.

131
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's in the human body.

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I want to see it.

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What?

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're not the same as Shunpei.

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's a great day.

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You look happy.

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's been a while since we've been on a trip.

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm eating.

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's coming.

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's coming.

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's coming.

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's coming.

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's coming.

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's coming.

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's coming.

146
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's coming.

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's coming.

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Look at me.

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Thank you.

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Itadakimasu.

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a octopus?

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's a octopus?

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You're so rude.

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Maybe it's a girlfriend.

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well...

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Really?

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This person...

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No, I know.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's a good octopus.

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What is it?

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I made it for her.

163
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm so relieved.

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm happy with octopus.

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Octopus.

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Look at me.

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Isn't it cool?

168
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Ken.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
A friend?

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Bye.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I put it on.

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Octopus.

173
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Look.

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Here.

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Wow.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Amazing.

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Today's pants...

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
are a bit too long.

179
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No, no, no.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's too early.

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No, no, no.

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Excuse me.

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It feels good.

184
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm so happy today.

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He's always like that.

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think octopus is more stretchy.

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I see.

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I think they're good friends.

189
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
They're good friends.

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I think they're good friends.

191
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I see.

192
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I think they're good friends.

193
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They're good friends.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
A friend?

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Me and Mia are different.

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Guru.

197
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's the first time I've met people like Mia.

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's like...

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
They're like,

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Mia is riding a mountain bike.

201
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
There's no one around now.

202
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The world is different.

203
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What?

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So...

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm not good at talking like this.

206
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Actually...

207
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm so confident that I was chosen by Mia.

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Even though I'm so fluffy,

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm accepted by the world.

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But...

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I can't get married with them.

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You can't get married with them?

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No.

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I can only have the things I have.

215
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But...

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I was chosen by them.

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I was chosen by them.

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm confident.

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What?

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What?

221
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You're really kind.

222
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What's the relationship between the three of them?

224
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
They're really good friends.

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What's wrong?

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What's wrong?

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Nothing.

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I knew it.

231
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What?

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No.

233
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's okay.

234
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
This is...

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No.

236
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You two are not good friends.

237
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm not good.

238
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm so happy.

239
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm so happy.

240
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Mr. Takuzo.

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
If you don't mind,

242
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
can I ask you to do it?

243
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes.

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Is the person you met in the shop

245
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
your original?

246
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes.

247
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
After Mia,

248
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I broke up with her

249
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
about three months ago.

250
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Why didn't you marry that beauty?

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's a waste.

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I thought you'd marry her.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But she didn't really like me.

254
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
She was just a different person.

255
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm so frustrated.

256
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Hey!

257
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't think so.

258
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What do you want to do?

259
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It has nothing to do with me.

260
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What?

261
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Then you were rejected.

262
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's boring to date Mr. Takuzo.

263
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I can't live with you.

264
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't have anyone like you.

265
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't have anyone like you.

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Don't worry.

268
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm not sure if I can live with you.

269
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Shut up.

270
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What are you talking about?

271
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You said you can't marry me.

272
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And this is different.

273
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Why?

274
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm so upset.

275
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm not sure.

276
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I want you to be happy

277
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
as long as you're like that.

278
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm not happy.

279
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You said the same thing.

280
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I was so upset.

281
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I was in the college.

282
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I was rejected for a year.

283
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
A year?

284
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I thought he was a different person.

285
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I can't date a woman

286
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
who's not like you.

287
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That's so cool.

288
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That's so bad.

289
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You're laughing.

290
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I've been trying to stop you.

291
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But you said you were in a bad mood.

292
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It was hard to walk with you.

293
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What's wrong with that?

294
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I was in a bad mood.

295
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Really?

296
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What's wrong with that?

297
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I was in a travel-based service area.

298
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I was hit by a car.

299
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's why I couldn't eat udon.

300
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's terrible.

301
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What a bad timing.

302
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And I was in a car with a high-speed car.

303
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I was in a lot of trouble.

304
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I took a rice ball to my schoolmate's house.

305
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I told my classmate not to be angry.

306
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Then I got hit by a normal person.

307
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's so gross.

308
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
A middle school boy is a rice ball.

309
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Why?

310
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Why are you driving there?

311
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No, no, no.

312
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Why?

313
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No, no, no.

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Today's story is also...

315
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I hope we can talk about it one day.

316
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
We can.

317
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm sure.

318
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
One day.

319
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh, right.

320
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What?

321
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This is...

322
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
a scarf.

323
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It might be cold.

324
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Use it.

325
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What?

326
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
A kimo.

327
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why are you bringing it?

328
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No, no.

329
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This is not it.

330
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Why?

331
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I kept talking until the morning.

332
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I woke up at 6 a.m.

333
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
and woke up at 3 a.m.

334
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Ria, Ria.

335
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The game is over.

336
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Wait a minute.

337
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What?

338
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Something to forget?

339
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Excuse me.

340
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Do you have anything to tell me?

341
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay.

342
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Let's go.

343
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll drive.

344
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Let's go.

345
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You can go straight.

346
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I see.

347
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Where are you going?

348
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
A few days later.

349
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, my.

350
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Wait a minute.

351
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Ria, there's still something to do.

352
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What's this?

353
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What's this?

354
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
A zipper.

355
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What?

356
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What?

357
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I told you.

358
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Our company is about to sign a contract.

359
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So I told you to drive.

360
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
No.

361
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I didn't hear it.

362
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I told you.

363
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And you said it looks interesting.

364
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You did it properly.

365
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
No.

366
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We haven't changed the line yet.

367
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Really?

368
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Wow.

369
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I sent you a different type of takumi.

370
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What?

371
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I have to move the car.

372
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You have to carry it.

373
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
No, wait a minute.

374
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
When will you start cleaning?

375
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't have a place to go back.

376
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Have you ever done a cleaning?

377
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm not sure.

378
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll do everything I can to make it work.

379
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I've made my decision, so I'll protect you.

380
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'll do it every day.
