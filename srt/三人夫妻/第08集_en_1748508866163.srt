1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
Yes, that's how I feel.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,700
So I didn't let you� up anything.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,580
Why?

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,700
You've understand everything.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,520
Tent slower.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's interesting, right?

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Three couples.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll do it.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Excuse me!

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I have to ask the company...

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No wait

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No

14
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,540
Something interesting.

15
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,360
This is for the couples.

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,360
A story that's waiting for the wedding.

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Bunny-FooF!

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,360
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle.

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
Good morning.

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
Good morning.

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
It looks delicious with toast.

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
It's good. Give it to me.

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
Here you go.

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
It's good.

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
Where's Mia?

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
She's buying something.

27
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,360
Really?

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Yeah.

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Sorry.

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
I can't help it.

31
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
I was just run away.

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
I'll hurt you.

33
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Sorry.

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
I was just running away.

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
I was too busy.

37
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,360
I decided on three.

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Will you give me another chance?

39
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Someone's here.

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
I'll go out.

41
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
Don't run away.

42
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,360
I'll go out.

43
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Mom, I'm home.

44
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
What?

45
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
What's this?

46
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
My mom.

47
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Why?

48
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Why all of a sudden?

49
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Mom, I'm home.

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Natsuko.

51
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Mom, I'm home.

52
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
I'm not good at the toilet.

53
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
What should I do?

54
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
What should I do?

55
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,360
The best food in the table.

56
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,360
Kaku-zushi.

57
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
Kaku-zushi.

58
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Wow.

59
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Thank you.

60
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
I'll take it.

61
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Eat it tomorrow.

62
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Where did you go with my table?

63
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
Well...

64
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
I'm here to introduce my friend.

65
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
I don't think it's a big deal.

66
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Where's your job?

67
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,360
I'm doing a dancer.

68
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
I see.

69
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
You're doing a great job.

70
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Where do you live?

71
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
Well...

72
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
Well...

73
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
I live in Asabu.

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,360
I live in Asabu's power mansion.

75
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
You're a great place.

76
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Kaku-zushi.

77
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Kaku-zushi.

78
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
The laundry is done.

79
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
I'm running to the bathroom.

80
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Oh, thank you.

81
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
What?

82
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,360
This girl doesn't want to see your laundry.

83
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
Kaku-zushi.

84
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
You're hiding it.

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Your mother is a maid.

86
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Well...

87
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
No, no, no.

88
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
I'll explain it to you.

89
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Mother, I'm going to...

90
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Oh, no.

91
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,360
Your mother is telling me.

92
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
You...

93
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
You're a maid.

94
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
You like men, don't you?

95
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
You're a maid, aren't you?

96
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
What?

97
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
No.

98
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,360
I thought it was a bad idea to marry you.

99
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
Well, but...

100
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,360
I really don't want to say anything.

101
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,360
You don't want to say anything?

102
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,360
I don't want to say anything.

103
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,360
I'm just looking forward to being married.

104
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,360
I don't want to say anything.

105
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
No way.

106
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
There are so many fun things.

107
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,360
You're a maid in Tokyo.

108
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
What's this?

109
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,360
Is there a maid?

110
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
A maid with a long face.

111
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,360
You're a nice girl.

112
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
What's this?

113
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Nothing.

114
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
You're not a young man.

115
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
You don't look like a father.

116
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
I'm not ashamed.

117
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
I'm not old enough to be a maid.

118
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
You're saying that.

119
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,360
Is Takuzo that kind of person?

120
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
He's been hard on me.

121
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
He's just like me.

122
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
That's true.

123
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Right?

124
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
He's been hard on me.

125
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
What's wrong with him?

126
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,360
If I were him, I'd be jealous of such a nice mother.

127
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Oh, my.

128
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Thank you for your help.

129
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Thank you.

130
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,360
I don't understand

131
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,360
how men and women are like.

132
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,360
I want him to be happy.

133
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
That's enough.

134
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,360
I want him to be happy.

135
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
I'm home!

137
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,360
I bought a lot of sushi at the supermarket.

138
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Donata?

139
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
It's Mia.

140
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
3 of us.

141
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
A few hours later.

142
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
I'm getting ready.

143
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
I'm getting ready.

144
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Mom.

145
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,360
If you do something so uncoordinary,

146
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
I'll cut the scene with you.

147
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Mom.

148
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
Mom.

149
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,360
It's my first time.

150
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,360
It's so fun to be with someone.

151
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Was that Mia?

152
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
Yes.

153
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,360
You're going to be a parent of your parents.

154
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,360
I'm going to be a parent of my parents.

155
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
If you're angry, I'll be happy.

157
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Mom.

158
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
The second time is here.

159
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Megumi.

160
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
Dad!

161
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
It's a dream.

162
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Good morning.

163
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Don't be so surprised.

164
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Mom.

165
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,360
I have something to tell you.

166
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
1 hour later.

167
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Even if you accept my husband's proposal,

168
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,360
I'm still trying to convince you.

169
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,360
So I decided to let you go.

170
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,360
You don't have to understand.

171
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:21,360
But I want you to be my daughter.

172
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
What?

173
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
What?

174
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,360
I might be wrong about your mother.

175
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Actually,

176
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,360
I've thought about it since my father was ill.

177
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Why are there only two of us?

178
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,360
If you were to be my daughter,

179
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
I would be happy.

180
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,360
But if you're a general,

181
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
of course, it's strange.

182
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
I'm going to be a husband for three people.

183
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,360
But I can't help it.

184
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,360
I've been a parent for 32 years.

185
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
I know your personality.

186
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Right?

187
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Mom.

188
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
But,

189
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,360
you have to do your best.

190
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,360
I'll regret it if you let me go.

191
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Yes.

192
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
I'm busy.

193
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Go away.

194
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
I'm glad he's a child.

195
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,360
I want to be a parent like his mother.

196
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
That's what I want, Mia.

197
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
I want to be a parent like him.

198
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Three years.

199
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
What did you say?

200
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,360
I said I'll give you the money.

201
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
I said it.

202
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
I want to be a parent like him.

203
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Mom.

204
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,360
I thought I'd see you here.

205
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Hey.

206
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
It's about what happened before.

207
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
I'm...

208
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
I'm a bad person.

209
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,360
I might not be able to meet people who think I'm a bad person.

210
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,360
I think it's better for me

211
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
to have three people.

212
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
I think...

213
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,360
I think I can see a different world from before.

214
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
I want to...

215
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
change.

216
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,360
I'll close the door and fight.

217
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Go for it!

218
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Let's go!

219
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Let's go!

220
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
Go!

221
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Thank you.

222
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Go for it!

223
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Let's go!

224
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Damn it!

225
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Three people's house.

226
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,360
Now, the final day.

227
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
What should I do first?

228
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,360
Let's check the things I brought.

229
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Okay!

230
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
Why did you bring it so much?

231
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
I think it's better to have a lot of things.

232
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Then, the aroma candle.

233
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
This one.

234
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Did you forget the lighter?

235
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Sorry.

236
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
I forgot the light.

237
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
I forgot the light.

238
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
I forgot the light.

239
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
I forgot the light.

240
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
I forgot the light.

241
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
I forgot the light.

242
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
I forgot the light.

243
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
I forgot the light.

244
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
I forgot the light.

245
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
Sorry.

246
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Go ahead.

247
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Let's go to the shower first.

248
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Okay.

249
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Let's go to the shower.

250
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
I'll go back to the bathroom.

251
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,360
I'll leave the toilet and the toilet.

252
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
Okay.

253
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
I'll go back.

254
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,360
If you're back, please take a shower.

255
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,360
Yes.

256
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Let's go.

257
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Let's go.

258
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
What?

259
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,360
Thank you so much.

260
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Me too.

261
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Thank you.

262
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Wait.

263
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Wait.

264
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
Wait.

265
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
Wait.

266
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
Wait.

267
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,360
I'll start with the three of us.

268
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
Okay.

269
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Okay.

270
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
Okay.

271
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
I'll start with the three of us.

272
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Okay.

273
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
What will you do with the picture?

274
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
I'll do it.

275
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
I want to do it.

276
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,360
I don't know what will happen next.

277
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,360
I don't know if this path is right.

278
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
But,

279
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,360
for the three of us, it's a big step.

280
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,360
Un establishment of deliverance will live right.

281
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,360
When it comes to this relationship,

282
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,360
even if it'll go on,

283
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,360
I 셋 in one place.

284
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Magnet.

285
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
If it works,

286
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,360
I'll go out.

287
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,160
...

288
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,980
Whoa, what a surprise.

289
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,980
Changed clothes...

290
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,060
What's the occasion?

291
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,480
You still want to talk to me about last night?

292
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,360
What's the point of that?

293
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
No.

294
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
What?

295
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
My hand.

296
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
Your hand.

297
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Please marry me.

298
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
Maribiri.

299
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
What you want to do with Mr. Park is...

300
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,360
...to live with someone.

301
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,360
Don't you two like it?

302
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,360
I want to be careful with my life.

303
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,360
I want to be friends with Mr. Park.

304
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Friends?

305
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,360
Let's try it with me.

306
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,360
Friends are not friends.

307
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
Friends.

308
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,360
From the moment you think of it, you are close.

309
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
What do you think?

310
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
Sunny Hoos.

311
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,360
I'm sorry.

312
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,360
It's not like you're a weird girl.

313
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,360
What's wrong with getting married without a relationship?

314
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
You're a genius.

315
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,360
When you're feeling bad, you don't have to stick to it.
