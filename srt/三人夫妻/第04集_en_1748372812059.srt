1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
What's going on?

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,700
I was caught.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,700
It's dangerous.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,200
It's dangerous.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,300
Did you see it?

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,800
I thought I could cut my finger.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,300
Be careful.

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,300
Be careful.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,300
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,300
Where are you going?

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,300
I'm going to the hospital.

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,300
Where?

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,100
What?

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,100
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,100
Hey!

16
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,100
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,100
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,100
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,100
What's wrong?

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,100
Where are you going?

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,100
Not yet.

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,100
The three of us are talking about the festival.

23
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,100
Three of us!

24
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,100
There's no place to go back.

25
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,100
I didn't change the previous mansion.

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,100
Idiot.

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,100
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,100
You think you can do it?

29
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,100
We'll look for a place to go.

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,100
We can't go anywhere.

31
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,100
We can't go anywhere.

32
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,100
We have to do something like that.

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,100
No, we can't.

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,100
For example,

35
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,100
for example,

36
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,100
Shinpei.

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,100
Look at this.

38
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,100
What do you think?

39
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,100
What do you think?

40
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,100
You said it earlier.

41
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,100
Why did you leave it like this?

42
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,100
Why didn't you buy a new toilet paper for the next person?

43
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,100
There's still so much left.

44
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,100
This.

45
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,100
This is it.

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,100
This amount is absolutely not enough.

47
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,100
You can't cut your butt off with a single roll.

48
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,100
That's not good for people.

49
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,100
I've been curious about it since I was a kid.

50
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,100
You can't close the toilet lid when you're out.

51
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,100
Why?

52
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,100
You want to smell the scent of your plants?

53
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,100
No, it's not.

54
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,100
Why can't you close the lid?

55
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,100
Shinpei.

56
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,100
You can use the toilet to get the human's main prize.

57
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,100
You're talking about the toilet paper?

58
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,100
I was in a relationship with Mia.

59
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,100
I was in a relationship with the person who was in a relationship with Mia.

60
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,100
So I was the one who put all of them together?

61
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,100
No, it doesn't make sense.

62
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,100
The main prize doesn't change.

63
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,100
I'll protect it.

64
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,100
I'll protect the toilet paper and the toilet lid.

65
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,100
I'll protect it.

66
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,100
You can say anything.

67
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,100
What about you?

68
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,100
Who will you choose?

69
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,100
If you're in trouble...

70
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,100
Don't be like that.

71
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,100
You can't be in trouble.

72
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,100
You can choose every day.

73
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,100
What about the toilet paper?

74
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,100
When?

75
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,100
If you're in trouble.

76
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,100
Why?

77
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,100
Why are you in trouble?

78
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,100
It doesn't make sense.

79
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,100
What about the cleaning?

80
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,100
If it's dirty...

81
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,100
Don't do it dirty.

82
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,100
You're a fool.

83
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
Don't say stupid things.

84
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,100
You're a fool.

85
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,100
You're living in a dirty room.

86
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,100
You're sleeping in a trash bag.

87
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,100
What about the futon?

88
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,100
How many times do you wash the futon?

89
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,100
The futon?

90
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,100
What?

91
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,100
Do you wash the futon?

92
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,100
The worst.

93
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,100
The worst.

94
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,100
I'll decide everything about the paper.

95
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,100
I've decided. I'll protect it.

96
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
I'll do it every day.

97
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,100
It's like you're in Tokyo.

98
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,100
I'm tired.

99
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,100
I didn't think it would take 5 hours to decide the rule.

100
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,100
I can't watch the table.

101
00:04:46,100 --> 00:05:01,100
Men Лю

102
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,100
The smell of the blood of the年 stage ...

103
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,100
Don't do anything weird in my room.

104
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,100
I won't!

105
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,100
It's a very simple question.

106
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,100
In the future, being a husband for three people...

107
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,100
...will be a sex for three people.

108
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,100
I'm not sure if it's possible.

109
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,100
I'm just trying to get some information.

110
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,100
I'll just take it slow.

111
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
It's a delicate question.

112
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
I see.

113
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,100
So, until you make the right decision, you don't have to do anything?

114
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,100
Well, I should be more careful with that.

115
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,100
What? What?

116
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,100
What?

117
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,100
You forgot something.

118
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

119
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Three people's wives.

120
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
I'm afraid you'll be a problem.

121
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,100
I'm afraid of that.

122
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
I'm afraid.

123
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,100
I'm afraid.

124
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,100
I'm afraid.

125
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,100
I'm afraid.

126
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,100
I'm afraid.

127
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:12,200
I'll help you and you

128
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,220
Stop it. I don't want to fight you

129
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,360
I'm gonna die

130
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,360
No, no, no.

131
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
I'm just kidding.

132
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,360
If it's a normal condition, it might be bad.

133
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,360
If it's a bad condition, it might be bad.

134
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
No, no, no.

135
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,360
No, no, no.

136
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,360
No, no, no.

137
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,360
No, no, no.

138
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Hey, Sakagi, you're stuck in the corner.

139
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
No, no, no.

140
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
No, no, no.

141
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,360
No, no, no.

142
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,360
Hey, Takujou-san.

143
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,360
Have you ever done a sanp?

144
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,360
I've been told I want to try it on my own.

145
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,360
But I don't want to be a part of the sex.

146
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,360
No, I'm not saying that.

147
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
I can't do it.

148
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:18,240
So

149
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
I'm back.

150
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
I'm back.

151
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
Takuzo.

152
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Takuzo, welcome back.

153
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Welcome back.

154
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Taku, come on in.

155
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Sit down.

156
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
Sit down.

157
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
I haven't washed my hands yet.

158
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Thank you.

159
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Hurry up.

160
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
What's this?

161
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Did you make this?

162
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I made it from my childhood.

163
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Eat it.

164
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
Hurry up.

165
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
I'll eat it.

166
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
It's good.

167
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
What's this?

168
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
It's good.

169
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Which one?

170
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
I put it in the right way.

171
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
The right way?

172
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
This?

173
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Wow.

174
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Wow.

175
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
You're so good at this.

176
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
I can't believe it.

177
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
Let's eat.

178
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Ready, set, go.

179
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
Itadakimasu.

180
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
I'm glad it was delicious.

182
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
What?

183
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
I kind of enjoyed it.

184
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Please keep saying it.

185
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
3 women.

186
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
Oh, no.

187
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
After a week.

188
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Nice!

189
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,040
How was your breakfast today?

190
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,220
Before so much smoke.

191
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,580
Oh yeah. I do.

192
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,000
Thank you.

193
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,780
It's fine since it's pretty early.

194
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,620
My phone's ringing!

195
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,280
Hey, want something?

196
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
What?

197
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
I should go.

198
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Got it. I'll be right there.

199
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
The company?

200
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Yeah.

201
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
I'll be right there.

202
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
I haven't done any of today's tasks.

203
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
It's okay. It's work.

204
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Don't worry about it.

205
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
Thank you.

206
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Sorry.

207
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Hey, Shinpei.

208
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,240
The TV remote control is bad.

209
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Who do you think it is?

210
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,240
I'm back to the plan after all.

211
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,240
I'm glad that my role was perfect.

212
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Sorry.

213
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Hey, what about dinner?

214
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
On the weekend when I called you.

215
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Let's go.

216
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
Welcome back, Takusawa.

217
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Welcome back.

218
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,240
I'm going home today.

219
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
I'll be right back.

220
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
It's rare.

221
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
I'll be right back.

222
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Thank you.

223
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Are you going home first?

224
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,240
I'm glad that you two came back.

225
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
I'm home.

226
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
I'm home.

227
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
I'm fine.

228
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
Where were you?

229
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
I went to see the dance event.

230
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Shinpei was on the show too.

231
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Just a minute.

232
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
Where's the dinner?

233
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
The dinner is still here?

234
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
We're here to make you stay.

235
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
What's that?

236
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
Nothing.

237
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Do you want some tea, Mia?

238
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
Yeah.

239
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
Is it enough?

240
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
I guess I'll have to.

241
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,240
I wrote the tea in the store.

242
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,240
I told you I'd be fine when I get out.

243
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,240
What?

244
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,240
I'm fine if you're busy.

245
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
I'm fine.

246
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
If you have something to say,

247
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
I think you can do it for me.

248
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
That's the way it is.

249
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,240
You're going to do it if you don't.

250
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
Shut up.

251
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
You should've told me.

252
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,240
I thought I'd do it.

253
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
What?

254
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,240
I thought I'd do it when I get home.

255
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Here.

256
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
I forgot.

257
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
What?

258
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
Don't be ridiculous.

259
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
I'll do it now.

261
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
I'll do it.

262
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
You can go back to the dance.

263
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
Wait.

264
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
What's that?

265
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
It's fine.

266
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
You can play if you like.

267
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
I'll do it.

268
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Stop it.

269
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
What are you doing?

270
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
You're so bad!

271
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,240
Did you buy it for us?

272
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
No.

273
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Mia.

274
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
It's good.

275
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,240
I'll have some too.

276
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
Here.

277
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
I'll buy it.

278
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Okay.

279
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Here.

280
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
I'll...

281
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,240
I'll...

282
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
I'll buy it.

283
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Mia.

284
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,240
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
I'm sorry.

287
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Then...

291
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
let's get married.

292
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Is this okay?

293
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
Yes.

294
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,240
I should have apologized to you

295
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
in the past.

296
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,240
You were so stubborn.

297
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
We were.

298
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
I thought so.

299
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,240
I thought it was not bad for the three of us.

300
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
Okay.

301
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Then...

302
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,240
can I have another word with you?

303
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,240
Yes.

304
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,240
What about Etch?

305
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
For example,

306
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,240
is it possible for you to be a three-person partner?

307
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
What about Mia?

308
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
What about me?

309
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,240
You can't be a partner?

310
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm sorry.

311
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,240
I don't know.

312
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
I see.

313
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Let's think about it.

314
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Yes.

315
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
Yes.

316
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Let's do it.

317
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Why?

318
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
Why?

319
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
I'm too handsome.

320
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
You don't know?

321
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
Why?

322
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
You're a man.

323
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
Friendship is a love.

324
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
I want to know how you feel.

325
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
I want to know how you feel.

326
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,240
I want to know how you feel.

327
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,240
I'm not good enough to be with you.
