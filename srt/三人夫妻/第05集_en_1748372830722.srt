1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The day after the meeting

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,120
I'm home

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,620
Welcome home

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,620
I'm going to cook now

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,620
Yay, Kyobu!

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm going to get the dishes out of the dryer

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Thank you, thank you

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,500
I'll make a stand-up for you later

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,500
I'm going to make a stand-up for you later

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,500
I'm going to make a stand-up for you later

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,000
After all, when the people on the table are busy,

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,500
I calmed down to help everyone

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Cheers!

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's so good

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's so good

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's good

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Can I have some too?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay, okay

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Thank you

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We're the same

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A little?

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I was just pretending to be a good cook

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Don't say that like you're sick

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Shinpei, try it too

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not a good cook

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, I see

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What do you use for your eyes?

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Soy sauce

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Fried fish sauce

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Soy sauce

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What about fried chicken?

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm a good cook

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What? A self-cooking?

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's so annoying

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure, but I'm going to try it

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You said that when you were young

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Really?

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Shinpei, you're going to have a rest next week

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Is there something?

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm going to perform a dance

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
On the street

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Huh?

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You took a break?

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I want to do the dance

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That person is my master

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's good to have a boyfriend

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Takuzo, come here

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, I'll think about it

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
These three might get married

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Or not

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Anyway, let's try it

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's talk about it

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, it looks like Shinpei

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Maybe it's not like that

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The third couple

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The third couple

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Wow, I'm so happy

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a group of three

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What?

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're going to marry three people, right?

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
She's going to be a girl

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yuki, who's married to a girl

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If it's three people, they'll be jealous

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I wonder what it is

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They look like they're going to be fine

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
They're going to be jealous again

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I wonder if they'll be able to control their emotions

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're not jealous

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why am I?

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There are times when they want to get jealous

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why? They're both men

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What are you talking about?

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You should realize this

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What?

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't take it too seriously

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You should work hard and worry

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What?

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What?

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I like Shinpei

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I like Shinpei too

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You know

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I think it's better to have a relationship with Takuzo than before

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We'll have a problem later

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I wonder what I should do to make them get along better

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Do you want some coffee?

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll get it

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Miya, you can't do this

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I can't help it

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Gura, gura

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Gura, gura

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Gura, gura

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Gura, gura

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What's scary?

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Gura, gura

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Gura, gura

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Gura, gura

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Open the door

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I want some coffee

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm going

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Really?

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm going

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sorry for not having dinner

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Are you angry with Takuzo?

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What?

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm going to have dinner

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Gura

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Welcome home

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm home

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I wonder what I did

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Takuzo

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm off to work

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I want to go to the convenience store

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Really?

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Do you think I'm avoiding Shinpei?

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What?

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't think so

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
After the fight, I was a little too far away

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why did you come here?

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm sorry to say that I'm going to be late

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But I'm a very delicate girl

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I want to go see you

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What?

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
500 yen

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
500 yen?

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Where?

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What?

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hey

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This is Tenma

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Takuzo's colleague

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He's a friend

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Why are you always looking at me?

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm a bit

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm a bit lazy

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Take it with the toilet

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I took it

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's dirty

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Tenma

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I can't get married

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What?

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll tell you the truth

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You're a man who can get married

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sure a man like us is not suitable for marriage

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Takuzo

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Have you ever heard of a friend?

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Friend?

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
A friend

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That is, we get married in a friendship relationship

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We were together yesterday

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So we don't have stress

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We don't have any unnecessary physical strength

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What?

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We get married with someone who doesn't have love

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Friendship is a perfect love

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If you want to be loved, you can go out

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Why do you get married?

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Isn't it just a friendship?

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
A man who doesn't get married

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He's a man who can't get married

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He's a man who can live a life of his own

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He's a man of the past

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He's a man of the past

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He's a man of the past

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What do you think, Wan?

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
With me?

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm just kidding

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Choton

173
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're so scary

174
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What?

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There's only one car in the parking lot

176
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You dropped it?

177
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You dropped it too much

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't throw it

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Can I ask you something?

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What?

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Can you tell me something?

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Can you tell me something about Yura?

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No, no

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
She's not a woman of the past

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
She's the one in front of me

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Nia?

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You've been here before, right?

188
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Nia

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I wonder

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
She's like a baby to him

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What kind of person is she?

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
A handsome dancer

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Do you understand?

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry to say this

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But I don't think it's that important

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm going to dance on the street

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm going to be bullied

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I can do it like that

199
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't have any other choice

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't know the meaning of life

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
There it is

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Thank you

203
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Is this all?

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sorry

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So you're using your time to be a dancer

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You have a stable job and skills

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You can return it to me, right?

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What?

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Can you tell me something?

210
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What?

211
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm going to be a dancer

212
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm going to be a dancer

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You're going to be a dancer?

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm not going to be a dancer

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Thank you

216
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm confident

217
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm glad

218
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm going to be a dancer

219
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm going to be a dancer

220
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Why are you here?

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm going to be a dancer

222
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Nia

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You're going to be a dancer?

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You used to be a dancer

225
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You're a man of his influence

226
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You're interested in dancing because of Shinpei

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I didn't have any interest in my group

228
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Nothing

229
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You're all gathered up

230
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You're all the same as before

231
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm here to see Shinpei

232
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Shinpei is a rare place to attend

233
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's also popular to be with her

234
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm here

235
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Shinpei

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Shinpei

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Shinpei

238
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Shinpei

239
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Shinpei

240
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Sorry, I have to go home

241
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Shinpei

242
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What?

243
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What is it?

244
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Nia told me

245
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
She said she had something to drink

246
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Thank you

247
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I like you because you're Shinpei

248
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You should get married

249
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You don't like me?

250
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
No, I'm just a nuisance

251
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You looked like you had fun when you were having dinner

252
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What?

253
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You were in love with her after the show

254
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Really?

255
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
She won't tell me about it

256
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Nia

257
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
She's still a little far away from me

258
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But Takuzo is kind of open-minded

259
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He's a good friend

260
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He's kind of jealous

261
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If you say that

262
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Nia

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
She looked so in love with her when she was dancing

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Shinpei is cool

265
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So

266
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's hard to say

267
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But I

268
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm not good enough to be with you

269
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
To be honest

270
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's hard to be with you

271
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And to be compared to you

272
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What about you?

273
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What did you think of my dancing?

274
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't want to hear about you

275
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I want to hear what you think

276
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I was surprised

277
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I couldn't open my eyes

278
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I wanted to see you

279
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It was amazing

280
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What?

281
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Well

282
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Maybe

283
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Takuzo

284
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You love me, don't you?

285
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What?

286
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I thought you were jealous

287
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You were jealous

288
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You were jealous

289
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I thought you were jealous

290
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I thought you were jealous

291
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I thought you were jealous

292
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I thought you were jealous

293
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I didn't mean to say that

294
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's okay

295
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm Takuzo

296
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm a cool guy

297
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I can be jealous

298
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What?

299
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
My sound?

300
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yes

301
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Cheers

302
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Cheers

303
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Cheers

304
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Takuzo

305
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm happy

306
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I want to talk to you

307
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm happy

308
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Don't worry

309
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm happy

310
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's different from what you think

311
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
One more time

312
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's too much

313
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Thank you

314
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm sorry

315
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Please

316
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Don't hate me

317
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The End
