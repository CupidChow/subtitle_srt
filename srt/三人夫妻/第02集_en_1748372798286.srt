1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The one who is playing with the Marble Dwarf is Mitsuda Takuzo.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
He is the main character of this story.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
He has no business with the Daikoubutsu, and he is a beloved Chinjou Loser.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But that's not the case.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The Daikoubutsu of Takuzo can't ask for such a death if they are together.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If they are married, they can have a lot of fun.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The responsibility and burden are to live in the third place.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Isn't that great?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is what I want to talk about.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
First, let's try it.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What do you think?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What kind of friendship is this?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
No, I'm serious.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If you say so, you can't say that you're angry.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's a great idea.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Are you serious?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not serious.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What do you mean?

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I like you, Takuzo.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What?

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, I'm lonely by myself.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I see.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
In any case,

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
he is refusing to marry Tomo with an innocent story.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But Miyawara doesn't want to admit it, so he is on the story.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He used me just right.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's what I mean.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's totally wrong, Takuzo.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm not saying anything wrong.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If you say so,

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
we're both in the same age.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Shut up.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It has nothing to do with Takuzo, right?

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's the same thing that's been involved in.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's not good.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's not good to get on the show.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If it's not like this, Takuzo can't marry for the rest of his life.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Miyawara, calm down.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But...

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Well,

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
if you can't marry him,

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
it's better not to do it.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm going.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is the story of the three bad guys who are waiting for their marriage.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What is it?

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Money Zoof!

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Thank you.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's Irai.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Irai Irai.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, no.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm sorry. I did it.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're so polite.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Irai Irai Irai Irai Irai.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Irai Irai Irai.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Irai Irai Irai.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Irai Irai Irai.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Um...

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, Tema.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is the next Irai's customer information.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Thank you.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thank you.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Takuzo,

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I won't do today's work.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's good.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Irai Irai.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a chance to win.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I will do it.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is a delicate girl who works with a rabbit's heart.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Tema Sayo.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Takuzo's junior

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and a member of the block who has made a huge block.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
By the way, the friendship between men and women is a rule.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What?

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
To Miyawara?

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Were you fine?

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes, I'm fine.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm fine, but...

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But?

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I was a cheap guy.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I wanted him to be jealous, so I brought him here.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're so stupid.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I was told that Takuzo couldn't marry him.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There's no such a cheap guy.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He's a good guy.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He's a good guy.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You're being unreasonable.

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm being unreasonable.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But I still like Miyawara.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What?

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Were you listening?

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm curious about what you like, but I'm not interested in what you don't like.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm curious too.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And this and that?

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The result is...

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Moe Moe.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm home.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm home.

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Did you like the one I gave you?

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What?

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Takuzo.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I hope you won't mind.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm sorry that I can't accept you.

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm sorry that I hurt you more.

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You can't marry Takuzo!

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I still like Miyawara.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm not sure.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm not sure.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm not sure.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm not sure.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm not sure.

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm not sure.

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm not sure.

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm not sure.

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm sure.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Taku.

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What?

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll do it.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're awake?

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Do your best.

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm not sure.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And...

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
On the day of the party...

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Takuzo couldn't even swim.

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
His eyes were red.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Everyone, welcome back.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We're about to have a party.

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We're about to have a party.

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Please welcome the girls.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll do it.

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Excuse me.

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm Takuzo Mitsuda.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Thank you.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm Kanazawa O.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Um...

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes?

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What do you want to do when you get married?

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Suddenly?

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm a construction worker.

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh, yes.

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Wow.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why did you want to be a construction worker?

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What?

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Why did I...

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wait a minute.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I like building.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I can't believe it.

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The extension of the block?

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Tickle feel time.

157
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The charm of the block is...

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's said to be the strongest cheek toy on earth.

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But it's a building that I imagined in my heart.

160
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Or a giant robot.

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Or a big city.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's a work that can be made by designing and designing monsters.

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is a work I made in three months.

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I was inspired by my unconsciousness.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I learned that I still see it.

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This is really...

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's amazing.

168
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The block...

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't know if you think it's a toy for Yohji.

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Well, I think it's better to be appealed by yourself.

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Today is a good day.

172
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's right.

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Well then...

174
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll see you later.

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Ouch.

177
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Ouch.

178
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,080
THimi

179
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:53,180
The Collapse of the Seamless

180
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,640
I got the monster at 8 rằngum 480 yen for 1 unconditionally and gold Oy buy

181
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,640
And the sense of shame and defeat.

182
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,640
The words that were said by the great girls are the words of the past.

183
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,640
The Takuzo is so boring!

184
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,640
It was so boring.

185
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
It was so boring.

186
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
It was so boring.

187
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,640
The great girl, two more.

188
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Takuzo!

189
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,640
I can't even reply to my phone.

190
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Can't you talk for a while?

191
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Well, it's not bad to change.

192
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,640
What?

193
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Takuzo!

194
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
Takuzo!

195
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
Takuzo!

196
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Takuzo!

197
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Takuzo!

198
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Takuzo!

199
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Takuzo!

200
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
Takuzo!

201
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
Takuzo!

202
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
Takuzo!

203
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
No. 4, the freezing.

204
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
I'm sorry.

205
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,640
It's not like you're sick.

206
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,640
You're so nervous that you can't eat or drink.

207
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
I'm asking you to buy something new.

209
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
I'll make something for you.

210
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
I'm sorry.

211
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
I'm sorry.

213
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
I'm sorry.

214
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
That's why...

216
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,640
Miyano,

217
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
you're like a child.

218
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,640
Marriage is like a impossible for me.

219
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,640
That's because you're too nice.

221
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
When I was in elementary school,

222
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,640
there was a guy named Hiro in the same school.

223
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,640
I thought he was my best friend,

224
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
so I was with him all the time.

225
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,640
But one day,

226
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,640
my parents told me,

227
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,640
I shouldn't take too much of Hiro's side.

228
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
I was in a hurry.

229
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,640
I was in a hurry because my parents said

230
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,640
I had a call from the school.

231
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
I was in a hurry.

232
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
I don't know.

233
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,640
I don't know how to communicate with people

234
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,640
or things.

235
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,640
I didn't think I'd like to be a teacher like you.

236
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,640
I think my direction is

237
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
the right direction for my work.

238
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
I want to marry Shinpei,

239
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,640
so I think I used my strategy.

240
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,640
But I didn't think I'd be able to do it well.

241
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
I'm not lying.

242
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,640
I think I could accept

243
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,640
what I couldn't accept.

244
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,640
I think I could accept what I could.

245
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
I think I could be a good person

246
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,640
if you could come in with me.

247
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Takuto, are you okay?

248
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
How's the fever?

249
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
It's 6°C.

250
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,640
What? 4°C?

251
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
It's not that bad.

252
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
What's that flower?

253
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
I bought it.

254
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,640
It says Bucca.

255
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,640
What's Bucca?

256
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,640
It's a flower that's decorated with roses.

257
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,640
Really?

258
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,640
It's not that bad.

259
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
You're so lucky.

260
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,640
Hurry up and make a Udon.

261
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
Open.

262
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Done.

263
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
Okay.

264
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
I'll eat.

265
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
How's it?

266
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
It's really good.

267
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,640
I'm glad.

268
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
Mia, have some too.

269
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Okay.

270
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
Here you go.

271
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,640
Sorry.

272
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,640
Thank you.

273
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Here you go.

274
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
It's so good.

275
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
It's so good.

276
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,640
I think it's a good combination.

277
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
I feel good when I'm weak.

278
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,640
I feel like I'm not alone.

279
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
I'm a better person.

280
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
The first one is...

281
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
Go!

282
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,640
It's like a rock.

283
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,640
It's already done.

284
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
I got it.

285
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Please give me some.

286
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
What?

287
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
I'll do it.

288
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
I'll do it.

289
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
I'll do it.

290
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Thank you.

291
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
Okay.

292
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,640
I recovered a little.

293
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Thank you.

294
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
Thank you.

295
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Thank you.

296
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Shinpei.

297
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
I think Mia

298
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
wants to get married to you.

299
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
It's weird to say that.

300
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
But I want you to think about it.

301
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
I'm scared.

302
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,640
I'm scared that I'll have to raise my child.

303
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
I don't think I can get married.

304
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
I'm like this.

305
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,640
Mia is a good girl.

306
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
She's a good girl.

307
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,640
I'm a good girl.

308
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
I'm a good girl.

309
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
I'm a good girl.

310
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,640
If someone like Takuzo

311
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
is around,

312
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,640
I'm really happy.

313
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
A person like me?

314
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
I'm a good girl.

315
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
I'm a kind person.

316
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
I'm happy to be with you.

317
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
I'm happy to be with you.

318
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
I'm happy to be with you.

319
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,640
I'm not ready to answer you right away.

320
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
What?

321
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Half a year?

322
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,640
No.

323
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
I want to think about it for a year.

324
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,640
How about

325
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
I try for a year

326
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,640
and think about it for a year.

327
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
Are you trying to make me try?

328
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
What?

329
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,640
Thank you, Mr. Takuzo.

330
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,640
Wait a minute.

331
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,640
Miya-chan.

332
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
Wait a minute.

333
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
Mr. Takuzo is trying to make me try.

334
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
What?

335
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
What?

336
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
What?

337
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
No, no, no.

338
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
What?

339
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,640
What?

340
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
What?

341
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
What's this?

342
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,640
I'm sure it's a lie.

343
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
What's this?

344
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
What's this?

345
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
What's this?

346
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,640
Three people?

347
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
What's this?

348
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
What's this?

349
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
What's this?

350
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
What's this?

351
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
What's this?

352
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
Hey, Mr. Takuzo.

353
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,640
Mr. Takuzo.

354
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
Mr. Takuzo?

355
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Of course, three people.

356
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
I was sent here.

357
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
I was chosen here.

358
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
That's so funny.

359
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,640
What?

360
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
I'm sorry.
