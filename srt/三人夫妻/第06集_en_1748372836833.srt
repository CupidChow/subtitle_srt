1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,340
But

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,660
Baitoon

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,620
Baitoon

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,500
Hey Takutho!

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,340
Beer!

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,460
Hey silicone!

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,700
Are you okay?

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,380
I mean...

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,380
What do you mean?

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,380
What do you mean?

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,380
Kiss?

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,380
No.

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,380
It doesn't make any sense.

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,380
What?

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,380
What?

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,380
You...

17
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,380
You don't mean anything?

18
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,380
Well, it's a bit of a joke.

19
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,380
It's a frank expression of love.

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,380
No.

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,380
What's the point of being so timid?

22
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,380
I was surprised.

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,380
No, don't live anymore, idiot.

24
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,380
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,380
Are your shoes okay?

26
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,380
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,380
And the next morning...

28
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,380
Oh, my.

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,380
Actually, last night...

30
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,380
I had this.

31
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,380
I'm home.

32
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,380
What?

33
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,380
What's wrong?

34
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,380
What's wrong?

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,380
Mia-chan, tomorrow...

36
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,380
I'll go fishing.

37
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,380
What's that?

38
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,380
If you say it's a family, you'll go fishing, right?

39
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,380
I'm already a nether.

40
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,380
Tomorrow is the sea.

41
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,380
What's that?

42
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,380
It's tuna.

43
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,380
What?

44
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,380
It's tuna.

45
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,380
It's a octopus.

46
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,380
I'm glad you're getting along.

47
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,380
Mia-chan.

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,380
Yeah, that's right.

49
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,380
Sunny roof.

50
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,380
What's a fishing?

51
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,380
I've decided on my own.

52
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,380
I have a plan.

53
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,380
Yura, Yura.

54
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,380
Yura, Yura.

55
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,380
Yura, Yura.

56
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,380
Yura, Yura.

57
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,380
Yura, Yura.

58
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,380
Yura, Yura.

59
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,380
Please don't hate me.

60
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,380
Don't hate me.

61
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,380
Shut up.

62
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,380
You'll run away.

63
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,380
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,380
I didn't want to go fishing.

65
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,380
But...

66
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,380
I woke up too early.

67
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,380
I'm tired.

68
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,380
I don't have a tool.

69
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,380
If you don't want to go, you can go home.

70
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,380
Go home.

71
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,380
Why do you care about fishing?

72
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,380
It's a waste.

73
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,380
What?

74
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,380
No.

75
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,380
I'm so happy to remember you.

76
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,380
It's okay.

77
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,380
My family...

78
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,380
They weren't always close.

79
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,380
My father was very close.

80
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,380
So I remember four family members.

81
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,380
I'm so worried about them.

82
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,380
I'm worried about you.

83
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,380
Sunny, be careful.

84
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,380
It's a waste of money.

85
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,380
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,380
Take it off.

87
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,380
Is it okay?

88
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,380
I'll take care of it.

89
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,380
You're so kind.

90
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,380
Sunny, you're so cool.

91
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,380
I had fun back then.

92
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,380
After that, my mother died of illness.

93
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,380
My father was also in the hospital.

94
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,380
We were left behind.

95
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,380
We went somewhere.

96
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,380
Did you have a relative?

97
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,380
A relative?

98
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,380
I was taken to a relative.

99
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,380
But I was the worst.

100
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,380
My brother bought me a room for two people.

101
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,380
He was so busy with my business.

102
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,380
He went to college with a scholarship.

103
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,380
He's now a student.

104
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,380
That's great.

105
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,380
He's great.

106
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,380
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,380
I'm sure you'll never get a home like that.

108
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,380
I said everything.

109
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,380
But I was taken to a relative.

110
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,380
I'm stupid.

111
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:42,380
I'm sure I can't forgive you for not being able to live like your father.

112
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,380
Shinpei isn't a bad guy.

113
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,380
Thank you.

114
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:16,380
But I can only see my brother as a dancer.

115
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,380
He told me he didn't want to see me until I got a job.

116
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,380
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,380
It's okay.

118
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,380
You'll understand someday.

119
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,380
Really?

120
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,380
Yes.

121
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,380
I'm sure of it.

122
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,380
I'm sure of it.

123
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,380
It's here.

124
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,380
What's wrong?

125
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,380
What's that?

126
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,380
It's huge.

127
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,380
It's huge.

128
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,380
It's here.

129
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,380
It's huge.

130
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,380
It's huge.

131
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,380
It's huge.

132
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,380
But fishing is a good hobby.

133
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,380
I see.

134
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,380
You should buy it at a supermarket.

135
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,380
I'm not sure.

136
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,380
I'm not angry.

137
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,380
I'm not angry.

138
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,380
Thank you.

139
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,380
It's not a hobby of the original.

140
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,380
I've never heard of fishing from Shinpei.

141
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,380
It's not a hobby.

142
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,380
You're getting along well.

143
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,380
Cheers.

144
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,380
Cheers.

145
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,380
But if you get a job, you'll be a friend.

146
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,380
Really?

147
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,380
No.

148
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,380
I'm just feeling like being a friend.

149
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,380
It's okay.

150
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,380
What's your story?

151
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,380
I decided to become a sugar-coated guy.

152
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,380
A sugar-coated guy?

153
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,380
I can become a sugar-coated guy even if I'm a partner.

154
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:44,380
I thought it would be better for a child to have a family bond.

155
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,380
I decided to talk seriously.

156
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,380
You're thinking about it.

157
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,380
Who's thinking about it?

158
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,380
What about you?

159
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,380
Are you thinking about your child?

160
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,380
I'm not thinking about it.

161
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,380
If a child is born,

162
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,380
I'm sure he'll feel bad for his husband.

163
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,380
What?

164
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,380
What?

165
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,380
What are you doing?

166
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,380
Thank you.

167
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,380
You're welcome.

168
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,380
My husband and wife are parents of a student in a school,

169
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,380
but I think someone else is feeling bad.

170
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,380
You're living together without a family.

171
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,380
That's a theory.

172
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,380
We have to figure out what happens.

173
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:59,380
So you should make a deep bond between your husband and your wife.

174
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,380
It's better if you make a deep bond between your husband and wife.

175
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,380
But I'm glad you two are dating.

176
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,380
We're not dating.

177
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,380
Why?

178
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:18,380
You said that you had a sexual voice between your husband and wife.

179
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,380
Hey!

180
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,380
Hey!

181
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,380
Damn it!

182
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,380
It's a fish!

183
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,380
I...

184
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,380
Hey, stop it!

185
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,380
Stop it!

186
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,380
It's cold.

187
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,380
It's cold.

188
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,380
Hey, Mr. J.

189
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,380
Hey, stop it.

190
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
Stop it.

191
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,380
It's a octopus!

192
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,380
It's a big octopus!

193
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,380
It's not a big octopus!

194
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,380
Oh, sorry.

195
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,380
It's cold.

196
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,380
I should go home.

197
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,380
I'm sorry.

199
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,380
Can you do it again?

200
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,380
Well...

201
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,380
Can you help me?

202
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,380
No.

203
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:35,380
I told you not to do that because I'm sorry.

204
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,380
Mr. Takuzo...

205
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,380
I don't care.

206
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,380
I know how you feel.

207
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,380
Why are you here?

208
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,380
Why are you here?

209
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,380
If you like Mia so much, you two can live together.

210
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,380
What do you think?

211
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,380
Here you are.

212
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,380
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,380
I'll do it myself.

214
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,380
It's okay.

215
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,380
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,380
I'm sorry I made you angry.

217
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,380
Do you know what I'm angry about?

218
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,380
I know.

219
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,380
Then, it's okay.

220
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,380
It's not okay.

221
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,380
Please.

222
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,380
I really can't do this.

223
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,380
I don't know how you feel.

224
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,380
But...

225
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,380
I want to change.

226
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,380
I want to know more about Mr. Takuzo.

227
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,380
Mia is so mean.

228
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,380
She knows Mr. Takuzo's face.

229
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,380
I want to see it too.

230
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,380
Her face?

231
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,380
I want to see it too.

232
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,380
What's her face?

233
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,380
What's her face?

234
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,380
When I'm with Mia, I wonder what Mr. Takuzo will do.

235
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,380
It's okay.

236
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,380
I won't hurt you.

237
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,380
I can't do this.

238
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,380
I've never imagined this.

239
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,380
Then, imagine it.

240
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,380
No.

241
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,380
But...

242
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,380
I'm hungry.

243
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,380
I'll make it.

244
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,380
I want to eat.

245
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,380
I want to eat.

246
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,380
What?

247
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,380
What's this?

248
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,380
I'm sorry.

249
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,380
I'm sorry.

250
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,380
I'm sorry.

251
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,380
Then, don't make me cry.

252
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,380
I'm sorry.

253
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,380
I understand.

254
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,380
What's wrong?

255
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,380
No.

256
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,380
I'm wearing dirty shoes.

257
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,380
I can't tell.

258
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,380
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,380
They're going to the next step.

260
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,380
Mia, are you okay?

261
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,380
Mr. Takuzo and Ms. Takuzo?

262
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,380
I see.

263
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,380
I knew it!

264
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,380
I felt wrong about the two men.

265
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,380
I've always been in love with Mia.

266
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,380
Mia didn't come back.

267
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,380
It's for the sake of the new movie.

268
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,380
It was a suicide.
