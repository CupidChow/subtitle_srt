This is very poisonous.

Arrest them.

Let me explain.

13
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,220
I didn't expect Prince Yuwen

14
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,780
would meet a spy

15
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,579
in front of us.

16
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,020
You were right.

17
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,420
The Prince of Nanyuan really sent someone here.

Fortunately, you found it in time.

19

Otherwise,

there is a fine line between life and death.

Don't let your guard down.

27
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,340
You and Qilang should go and receive punishment.

28

How's that?

Women also love flying kites.

I haven't seen Godfather going out.

Tying is the most important thing.

Even a Chief

They've never asked for forgiveness.

You don't have to guard the Nether Palace anymore.

I'm going back to my room.

178
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:10,540
Sister Li,

179
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,020
you don't want to tell me,

180
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,860
but I don't want to keep it to myself.

181
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,140
Why is

182
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,860
Eunuch Liu giving you a hard time?

183
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,620
Maybe it's because I have no money to reward him

184
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,210
and he holds a grudge.

185
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,740
It's normal for things like this

186
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,420
to happen in the palace.

187
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,940
Doesn't seem like it...

188
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,660
I'm tired. I'm going back.

189
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,220
Beauty Li,

190
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,140
I've been waiting for you.

191
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:05,900
Eunuch Liu.

192
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,740
Beauty Li,

193
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,980
have you made up your mind?

194
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,820
You are kind.

195
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,020
I can't live up to

196
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,340
your kindness.

197
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:34,860
Look at you.

198
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,060
You're such a beauty.

199
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,420
You're just going to live your life like this?

200
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,180
You're willing to.

201
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,980
But I'm not.

202
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,540
Everyone in the imperial mausoleum knows

203
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,100
your name

204
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,940
has been written

205
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,820
on the list of Tribute Ladies.

206
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,020
But for some unknown reason,

207
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,500
it disappeared.

208
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,180
Look at you, you have neither power nor money.

209
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,460
What else can you use

210
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,180
to get your life back

211
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,860
from those people

212
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,570
in the Zhaoding Bureau?

213
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,380
I didn't...

214
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,340
What's wrong

215
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,140
with living your life with me?

216
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,890
Don't be so upset.

217
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,260
Eunuch.

218
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,140
Eunuch.

219
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,660
Who is it?

220
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,140
Who?

221
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,180
Who?

222
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,900
That's it?

223
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,420
Old pervert.

224
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,180
That took quite the effort.

225
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,740
Mistress, you're so good.

226
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,700
I'm usually too gentle.

227
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,860
I don't usually hit people.

228
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:23,980
Yinlou.

229
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,300
You...

230
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,260
What are you doing?

231
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,580
Hit him!

232
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,020
What if he dies?

233
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,660
With my strength,

234
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,780
he won't die.

235
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,420
Then what...

236
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,940
What if he wakes up?

237
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,260
Kill him.

238
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,260
Just kidding.

239
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,370
You're still in the mood to joke?

240
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,340
Oh no, oh no.

241
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,300
Oh no.

242
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,210
You're going to kill us.

243
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,020
I...

244
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,460
Tell me, what's the most painless way

245
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,500
to die?

246
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,420
Don't worry. You won't get hurt.

247
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,860
He's hit pretty hard.

248
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,780
Eunuch Liu.

249
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,860
You're finally awake.

250
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,020
What happened to me?

251
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,740
Someone covered you with a sack and beat you up.

252
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,020
I wonder which bastard

253
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,660
tied you to the entrance of the tomb.

254
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,060
He beat you up so bad you were all bloodied

255
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,540
with broken arms and legs.

256
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,020
But

257
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,340
luckily, we've brought you back.

258
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,460
Everything is fine.

259
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,220
Don't worry.

260
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,340
But I remember

261
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,460
I was in the house...

262
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,100
You...

263
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,340
You...

264
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:54,970
Eunuch Liu.

265
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,900
We're sorry.

266
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:57,860
We

267
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,740
shouldn't have played that extra round of cards.

268
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,460
When we found you,

269
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,300
you were in such dire state.

270
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,780
You were stripped

271
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,020
completely.

272
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,180
With only–

273
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,420
Anyway,

274
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,100
it's...

275
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,300
evil.

276
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,220
This person is so evil.

277
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,060
It must be a robbery.

278
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,380
Yes.

279
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,860
It might've been a thief.

280
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,740
I saw it.

281
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,780
He was a big man.

282
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,060
Poor Eunuch.

283
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,940
He's lying there naked,

284
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,020
all frozen.

285
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,170
How many people

286
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,500
know about this?

287
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,700
Not that many.

288
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,060
About more than half the people in the Imperial Mausoleum

289
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,780
know about it.

290
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,260
But

291
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,020
everyone's loyal,

292
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,940
and they

293
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,020
brought you back.

294
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,460
I also have to say,

295
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,780
you laid in a good position.

296
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,100
Right in front of the Nether Palace.

297
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,180
That's a good place that leads to all

298
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,700
with a wide view.

299
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,780
Have you caught the culprit?

300
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,780
This guy

301
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,660
went like wind.

302
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,540
He also had his head covered.

303
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,460
No one saw his face.

304
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,660
But

305
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,740
don't worry.

306
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,900
I have an idea.

307
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,460
Call everyone out

308
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,860
and investigate them one by one.

309
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,100
Check the Imperial Mausoleum thoroughly.

310
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,540
Anyone with a sack

311
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,020
is the real culprit.

312
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,180
Am I right?

313
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,340
-Yes.
-Yes.

314
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,940
Don't, don't.

315
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,340
Don't alarm the people

316
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,980
for a petty theft.

317
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,220
That won't do.

318
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,300
Eunuch Liu,

319
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,500
you are the head of the Imperial Mausoleum.

320
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,940
We need your help in everything.

321
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,180
How could a thief

322
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,420
just rob you like this.

323
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,420
Also, look.

324
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,020
Beauty Li.

325
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,940
Beauty Li also got slapped twice.

326
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,700
He hit

327
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,900
the late emperor's woman.

328
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,820
He is extremely vicious

329
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,700
and disregards the law.

330
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,340
We can't tolerate them.

331
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,980
Let's report to the Imperial City.

332
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,700
Yes, report it to the Imperial City.

333
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,140
No! No!

334
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,380
Don't report

335
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,980
to the Imperial City.

336
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,380
Everyone may leave.

337
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,340
This...

338
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,620
-Dismissed.
-Eunuch Liu.

339
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,460
We're not reporting this to the Imperial City?

340
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,980
Consort Dowager Duan.

341
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,220
Enough.

342
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:10,660
Dismissed.

343
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,900
Just leave.

344
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,220
Fine.

345
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,740
Eunuch Liu,

346
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,089
take good care of yourself.

347
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,020
Call us if you need anything.

348
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:21,900
We'll come to see you.

349
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,900
No.

350
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,700
Fine.

351
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,740
Take a rest.

352
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,500
Let's go.

353
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,140
Let's go.

354
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,100
Eunuch,

355
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,460
have some tea.

356
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,500
Get lost!

357
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,710
[Imperial Mausoleum, the Graveyard Behind the Mountain]

358
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,250
Watch out!

359
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
You're so ruthless!

360
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,260
I've never seen someone

361
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,300
throw themselves under the bus like this.

362
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,580
Sit down.

363
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,660
Stop laughing.

364
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,820
That pervert's skin is too thick!

365
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,260
My hand still hurts.

366
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,220
Are you okay?

367
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,340
I'm fine.

368
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,160
Thank you, Yinlou.

369
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,180
When Eunuch Liu forced me to be with him,

370
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,080
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

371
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,430
I'm too ashamed to tell you.

372
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,540
I know I'm useless.

373
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,310
I'm afraid you'll look down on me.

374
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,450
When you said

375
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,930
you're by my side,

376
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,160
I felt so relieved.

377
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,630
From now on,

378
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,510
I won't fear anything anymore.

379
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,900
Do you know?

380
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,970
Since entering the palace,

381
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,030
no one has ever

382
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,460
treated me so well.

383
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,570
You're so annoying.

384
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,970
People will become greedy when they get used to being treated well.

385
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,320
If you think I'm annoying in the future

386
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,330
and leave me alone,

387
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,710
I won't be able to stand it.

388
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,500
I think you saying

389
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,940
that I'm smart,

390
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,200
is right.

391
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,630
But I really don't want to care about you.

392
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,180
You

393
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,560
always hold my hand

394
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,450
so tightly.

395
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,500
Can't you stand up for yourself?

396
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,310
Don't drag me in next time, okay?

397
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,030
Bu Yinlou.

398
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,100
Why are we here?

399
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,610
This is

400
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,130
is the cemetery of lowly concubines.

401
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,010
Why aren't there any tombstones?

402
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,940
Is no one managing this place?

403
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,080
It's nothing.

404
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,170
It has always been like this.

405
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,490
Women in the Imperial City...

406
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,830
Who cares

407
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,560
about if they are dead or alive.

408
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,110
A tombstone?

409
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,710
No one even remembers

410
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,110
what they were called when they were alive.

411
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:47,760
They've been trapped in the Imperial City

412
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,770
for their whole life.

413
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,780
They can't even go back after they've died?

414
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,590
It'd be good even if their family

415
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,310
could take them back.

416
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,950
Not only them,

417
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,480
they have no choice since entering the palace walls.

418
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,750
Even an ordinary woman's

419
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,220
life and death

420
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,400
is not up to them.

421
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,800
This is our fate.

422
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,170
Us Bu family,

423
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,570
[Bu Yinlou's Second Mother, Bu Chenshi]

424
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,270
a century-old family,

425
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,200
a hairpin empire.

426
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,020
We are not those small families.

427
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,740
We don't need everything

428
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,300
but we can't lose dignity.

429
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,820
I asked you to come back to the residence with me before

430
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,540
and you refused.

431
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,310
But now,

432
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,360
the rumor of me committing adultry

433
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,300
has been spread.

434
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,240
If I don't solve this,

435
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,590
it would look bad for me.

436
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,660
Don't be immature.

437
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,820
But I don't want to.

438
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,190
You're an outsider,

439
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,660
yet I brought you into my residence

440
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,000
and gave you a status.

441
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,930
That's your blessing.

442
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,790
How dare you

443
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,850
continue pretending to be fake in front of me.

444
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:03,820
Mother.

445
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,120
I am fine.

446
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,040
My temper is not well-liked.

447
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,190
Since you're tired of it,

448
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,910
why don't you show mercy

449
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,720
and let me and Zhuo Ying

450
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,230
leave.

451
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,470
No way.

452
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,620
Zhuo Ying is my daughter.

453
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,510
She can't go anywhere.

454
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,490
Just because I'm a woman,

455
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,010
and I don't come from a good background,

456
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,810
so my wish

457
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,990
doesn't matter at all,

458
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:41,870
right?

459
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,240
I don't mind

460
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,270
just living my life in vain.

461
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,540
But I don't want to see

462
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,470
Zhuo Ying living the same fate as me,

463
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,730
to be at the mercy of others

464
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,000
and have no choice.

465
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,560
It is an woman's fate

466
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,950
to be inferior.

467
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,810
You and Zhuo Ying's lives,

468
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,450
are not up to yourselves.

469
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:11,780
Mother.

470
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:17,820
Zhuo Ying.

471
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,010
I just hope

472
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:21,810
you can grow up soon.

473
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,800
In the future,

474
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,190
you must leave here.

475
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,130
Be free

476
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,230
and have a happy life.

477
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,040
Don't live

478
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,940
like me.

479
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,250
Why?

480
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,030
Just because we are women?

481
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:00,920
Can't we take control of

482
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,180
our lives?

483
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,320
You're different.

484
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,210
Your status is higher than ours.

485
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,520
Of course you are different.

486
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,040
Maybe...

487
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,980
you might have a tombstone.

488
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,210
Look at this cage.

489
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,390
It used to have a bird, right?

490
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,660
Was it a noble bird?

491
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,550
Or a lowly bird?

492
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,150
Dead or alive,

493
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,790
don't they live in the same cage anyway?

494
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,030
What's the difference?

495
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:37,710
Yinlou.

496
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,720
It's just a bird.

497
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,860
What are you thinking about this for?

498
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,950
You're right. It's just a bird.

499
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,470
I don't want

500
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,560
be buried here one day.

501
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,410
Do you think

502
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,180
you can leave this place?

503
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,950
Dream on.

504
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,470
What can you do?

505
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,020
Right.

506
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,710
What can I do?

507
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,860
[After the Emperor passes away, none of the concubines
trapped in the high walls of the palace can escape having to guard the mausoleum.]

508
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,400
[They can’t control their fate, and can’t express their wishes.
They can only stay in the shabby mausoleum and spend the rest of their lives there.]

509

[Peace Room]

511
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,640
you are too impulsive.

512
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,570
Aren't you afraid that Eunuch Liu

513
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,290
will come after you?

514
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:26,550
I am.

515
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,900
But

516
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,820
I can't let people like this

517
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,790
off the hook.

518
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,380
They won't stop.

519
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,030
They will stop after being beaten up.

520
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,300
Listen to

521
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,770
the arrogance in your tone.

522
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,310
This is not like you.

523
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,200
In the past,

524
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,000
though you used to play tricks,

525
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,220
but you merely did things

526
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,400
in the dark.

527
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,990
Why did you put on

528
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,930
such a big show this time?

529
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,820
That's in the past.

530
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,920
How can it be the same?

531
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,470
How is it different?

532
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,700
I have someone high up.

533
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:02,670
It's just that I can't

534
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,350
show if off in public.

535
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,480
How annoying.

536
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,630
Let me say that a few more times

537
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,420
for fun.

538
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,060
I have someone high up.

539
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,280
I have someone high up.

540
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,620
I have someone high up.

541
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,240
With that now, at least when I do things

542
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,510
I have a stronger aura.

543
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,190
I see.

544
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,460
Rather than relying on

545
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:24,800
Chief Xiao,

546
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,190
you might as well count on His Majesty

547
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,790
to take you back to the palace.

548
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,100
When the late emperor was there,

549
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,280
you didn't make put in any effort, and that's fine,

550
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,670
after all, there wasn't a chance given to you

551
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,010
to make progress.

552
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,440
But now,

553
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,280
this opportunity

554
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,410
to become successful

555
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,590
is placed right in front of you.

556
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,310
It doesn't matter who you follow.

557
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,230
Why do we have to suffer here?

558
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,810
Since this opportunity

559
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,410
is so precious,

560
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,510
let those

561
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,100
who want to progress go ahead.

562
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,830
Why make things difficult for me?

563
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,980
Nothing is difficult in the world,

564
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,190
as long as you can do nothing.

565
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,010
I just want to do nothing now.

566
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,600
You're from a noble family.

567
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,960
You've been educated since young.

568
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,850
I don't believe you can do nothing.

569
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,900
I couldn't do it

570
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,290
because I had regrets.

571
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,640
I'm very calm now,

572
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,820
and have no regrets,

573
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,370
so I can do nothing for all I want.

574
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,680
Why can't you

575
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,400
search for a good future for yourself?

576
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,330
What kind of logic is that?

577
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,350
No means no.

578
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,110
Whether I want it or not

579
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,630
is the most important thing.

580
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,890
Fine.

581
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,660
Right.

582
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,640
Chief Xiao also told you

583
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,650
to keep a low profile.

584
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,030
But you didn't listen either.

585
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,590
You even beat

586
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,220
Eunuch Liu up.

587
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,620
What are you talking about?

588
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,190
He told you that before the Imperial Mausoleum.

589
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,290
In the palace,

590
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,100
you've caused a lot of troubles.

591
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,080
It's better for you

592
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,620
to keep a low profile here.

593
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,880
I forgot about that.

594
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,670
These days,

595
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,690
I caused so much trouble,

596
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,870
and even beat Eunuch Liu.

597
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,850
I've definitely ruined Chief Xiao's plans.

598
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,910
If he sees me,

599
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,510
he will scold me to death.

600
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:09,970
Tong Yun.

601
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,270
What day is it today?

602
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,280
14th.

603
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,650
Tomorrow is the 15th.

604
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,290
[Imperial Prison]

605
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,860
We only obey our master's

606
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,620
direct orders.

607
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,680
We've never came into contact

608
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,100
with the Secret Service.

609
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,360
This mission

610
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,670
is to save the His Highness.

611
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,230
I really don't know about the Secret Service

612
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,570
you want to know about.

613
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,010
Prince of Nanyuan is far away in West Shu.

614
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,020
In order to get orders,

615
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,870
there has to be a way.

616
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,390
What is it?

617
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,860
There's an object.

618
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,120
There is a pair of jade

619
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,000
passed down from

620
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,010
the Yuwen family.

621
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,100
His Highness has one.

622
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,160
This jade can command all the Secret Services

623
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,340
around the world.

624
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:58,650
Where's the other one?

625
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,070
It's with the His Highness.

626
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,900
Perhaps after getting that jade,

627
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,330
we can find

628
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,010
the Secret Service Yuwen Liangshi

629
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,230
planted in the capital.

630
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:10,660
Then...

631
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,220
shall we make His Highness hand out the jade?

632
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,680
No.

633
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,240
His Majesty detained Yuwen Liangxu

634
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,000
in the capital

635
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,220
using the excuse that he is ill.

636
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,610
The officials of the Prince of Nanyuan's palace

637
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,830
are very dissatisfied with this.

638
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,970
We can't alert them on the surface.

639
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,780
Or people with ulterior motives

640
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,910
can cause troubles.

641
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,180
We can only be polite towards him.

642
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,590
Find a good time to get close to him.

643
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,820
When will there ever be a good time?

644
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,010
If His Highness needs help

645
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,400
he will definitely bring that piece of jade

646
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,040
to contact someone in the Secret Services.

647
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,470
Pass my order.

648
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,560
If he goes out,

649
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,570
tell me immediately.

650
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,530
Yes.

651
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,070
By the way,

652
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,620
I'll take a day off tomorrow.

653
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,480
I will be leaving the capital.

654
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,910
Take care of everything.

655
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,720
That's strange.

656
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,020
To you it's work, and more work.

657
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,600
You even work on your rest day.

658
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,100
You don't even go home often.

659
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,400
You're basically rooted in

660
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,620
Zhaoding Bureau.

661
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,260
What's going on?

662
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,390
Take me with you.

663
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,000
It's just a personal matter. You don't have to follow me.

664
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,140
Personal?

665
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,510
What personal matter can Godfather have?

666
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,770
Is there something that he can't tell me?

667
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Who is trying to replace

668
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,440
my position as

669
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,650
his right hand man?

670
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,040
[Zhaoding Bureau]

671
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:22,870
Godfather,

672
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,680
it's rare for you to go out for a personal business.

673
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,700
As the saying goes, clothes make the man.

674
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,670
I think

675
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,180
you have to be able to show your identity

676
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,190
through your clothes.

677
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:31,990
So,

678
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,210
I prepared some new clothes

679
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:34,970
for you to choose from.

680
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:35,470
Take a look.

681
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,320
Which one do you like?

682
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:37,950
No need.

683
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,060
If I may share

684
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,150
my humble thoughts,

685
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,630
I think

686
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,230
this green one is good.

687
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,030
Handsome.

688
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,540
And with

689
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,990
this black deer pendant.

690
00:30:59,370 --> 00:30:59,830
It's elegant.

691

Is it

692
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,400
too flashy?

693
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,200
Are you not satisfied?

694
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,090
That's fine.

695
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,130
Go ahead and give me your requests,

696
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,070
it's better than having none.

697
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,460
Do you want to be

698
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,900
a handsome young man,

699
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,050
or a cold and aloof martial artist?

700
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,140
Or

701
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,580
an unparalleled deity?

702
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,430
Even if

703
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,780
you want to wear red and green,

704
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,590
and dress like a lady,

705
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,440
I can help you with it.

706
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,990
What do you want?

707
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:42,800
Godfather,

708
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,640
please take me there too.

709
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,740
I like to fly kites too.

710
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,050
How did you know?

711
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,350
I secretly asked

712
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,290
the old master who made kites.

713
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,590
I know everything.

714
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,150
It's just making kites.

715
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,500
What's wrong with a man having hobbies?

716
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,340
It's not embarrassing.

717
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,020
Learning a skill

718
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,740
can even make a living.

719
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,400
Show them to me.

720
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,910
Let me have a look.

721
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,600
This is...

722
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,610
A moth?

723
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,090
Goldfish!

724
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,580
Looks like

725
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,090
hobbies might not necessarily make a living.

726
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,780
If I wear this,

727
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,420
will I really look good?

728
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,030
Trust me.

729
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,040
Bring it in.

730
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,090
Bring it in.

731
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:49,660
Godfather,

732
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,210
where are you going?

733
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:52,560
The Imperial Mausoleum.

734
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:53,820
The Imperial Mausoleum?

735
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,660
You’re going to the Imperial Mausoleum?

736
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:56,970
Since when are you this close

737
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:57,510
with Consort Dowager Duan?

738
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,650
Even closer than with your son?

739
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,150
Chief.

740
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,800
Chief.

741
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,690
Yuwen left his residence.

742
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,790
Where is he going?

743
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,050
The football field.

744
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,460
Let's go and meet them.

745
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:13,930
Are you still going to the Imperial Mausoleum?

746
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,480
Yes.

747
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,380
Mistress,

748
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,940
do we have to be out so early?

749
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,620
I'm just nervous.

750
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,290
Hurry.

751
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,150
[Hua'an Gate]

752
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,120
Your Highness, you're amazing.

753
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,460
You are a master

754
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,430
on this football field.

755
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:06,980
Chief Xiao,

756
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,250
I haven’t had enough fun,

757
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,510
yet you brought a group of people

758
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,600
to swarm here.

759
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,909
Are you

760
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,380
here to arrest me?

761
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,270
I am the legitimate brother

762
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,280
of the Prince of Nanyuan.

763
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:19,540
What?

764
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,010
I can't even go out?

765
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:22,900
You're overthinking.

766
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,830
It's just that it seems like Your Highness

767
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,710
is in a good mood,

768
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:26,760
so I'm here to accompany you.

769
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,280
Since you're accompanying me,

770
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,130
there's no reason not to play.

771
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,510
I'm not

772
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,770
good at football.

773
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,040
That’s right.

774
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,350
The chief is only good at doing things

775
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,530
in the dark.

776
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,000
I understand.

777
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:41,920
What are you talking about?

778
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,510
Don't be rude.

779
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,760
Since you've asked,

780
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:51,120
I will do everything to accompany you.

781
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,460
But without a prize

782
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,179
it's boring.

783
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,080
I have

784
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,290
a premium jade pendant.

785
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:58,930
Along with the jade

786
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,610
on Your Highness's waist.

787
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,630
Whoever wins

788
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,350
will take both of them.

789
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,540
Your Highness is backing out now?

790
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,680
Don't provoke me.

791
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,770
I won't fall for your trap.

792
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,350
It doesn't matter.

793
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,910
This childish thing

794
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,510
is boring anyway.

795
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,200
You may go ahead, Your Highness.

796
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,140
Give the ball back to the prince.

797
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:40,850
Fine.

798
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,120
You have good taste.

799
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,050
In terms of setting traps,

800
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,390
I'm no match for you.

801
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,570
But in terms of

802
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,870
having fun,

803
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,250
no one dares to be first

804
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,640
if I say I'm second.

805
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,240
I’d like to see

806
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,180
what else the Chief of Zhaoding Bureau

807
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,140
is good at other than

808
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,360
the many ways of

809
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,910
torturing people.

810
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,170
I'll wait for you.

811
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,960
Qilang, keep an eye on the court.

812
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,850
The rest of you get changed and go on.

813
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:13,520
Yes.

814
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,240
Godfather!

815
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,250
Can you do it?

816
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,230
We don't usually play this.

817
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,230
Cao Chun'ang.

818
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,410
Cut the crap.

819
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,540
You just need to help chief

820
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,550
keep an eye on His Highness,

821
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,060
and leave the rest to us.

822
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,410
Let's do it quickly.

823
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:27,760
No.

824
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,020
Can you do it?

825
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,130
Watch me.

826
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:04,550
Okay.

827
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,590
Red team gets one point.

828
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,790
Don’t force yourself, chief.

829
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,300
I’ll take your jade for sure.

830
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,330
Pass the ball.

831
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:50,540
Cao...

832
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,350
It's in!

833
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,030
Godfather!

834
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,080
It's in!

835
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:57,970
It's in!

836
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:04,950
Nice shot!

837
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,370
Nice! Nice shot!

838
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,660
Red team scores another point.

839
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,180
Cao Chun'ang!

840
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,940
Get off.

841
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,450
Switch.

842
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,250
I...

843
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,010
Black team scores one point.

844

[Princess Hede's Maid, Ruolan]

845
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:54,970
Good.

846
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,820
Go! Go!

847
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:57,950
Snatch it!

848
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,080
-Eunuch Cao.
-He's worse than me.

00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,220
Chief She.

850
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,190
Greetings, Princess Hede.

851
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,790
The people of Zhaoding Bureau

852
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,560
love playing football too?

853
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:07,990
Even so you shouldn't be

854
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,080
taking up my football venue.

855
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,620
You're even losing.

856
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,730
My apologies for that.

857
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,810
Us Zhaoding Bureau

858
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,920
work around the clock

859
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,220
12 hours a day.

860
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,950
We don't have the time

861
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,290
to have fun.

862
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,430
If we had the time

863
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,390
to let our men play football from time to time,

864
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:29,950
we wouldn't have to

865
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,930
have Chief Xiao be beaten

866
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,940
so badly just for

867
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,790
a jade...

868
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:36,870
Jade?

869
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,530
Why would Chief Xiao gamble

870
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,620
for no reason?

871
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:43,800
Please forgive me, Your Highness,

872
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,940
I dare not say more.

873
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,100
Isn't he blatantly bullying

874
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:54,900
Chief Xiao, someone who only knows how to torture people,

875
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:55,950
for not knowing how to play football?

876
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,760
Who is he?

877
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,020
How dare he offend someone this vicious?

878
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,960
Princess Hede,

879
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,520
he is the younger brother of the Prince of Nanyuan,

880
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,160
Yuwen Liangxu.

881
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,660
He's not good at it, yet he keeps taunting.

882
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,880
He's gone too far.

883
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,210
Chief Xiao,

884
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,430
I booked

885
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,480
this field today,

886
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,040
yet I have nowhere to play.

887
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,550
Don't you think

888
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,270
I should play for you?

889
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,540
Princess is right.

890
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,050
His skills

891
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,140
is indeed not bad.

892
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,320
I am really of no match.

893
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,460
Wait.

894
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,840
How can we swap people so easily?

895
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,900
Not only that,

896
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,550
I also want to

897
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,030
play against you alone.

898
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:55,710
Fine.

899
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,350
Bring on the one on one.

900
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,980
Black gets another point.

901
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,660
Again!

902
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,940
Black wins!

903
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,330
Thank you, Your Highness.
