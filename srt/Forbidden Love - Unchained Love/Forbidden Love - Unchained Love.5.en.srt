[Suburb of the Imperial City, Zhongshan]

5
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,100
Welcome, Chief Xiao.

6
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,070
The cavalry of West Shu

7
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,960
came from surrendered Qiang tribes.

8
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,480
The hoof marks of their horses

9
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,360
are deeper than those from the capital.

10
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,130
These are indeed Prince of Nanyuan's horses.

11
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,190
It seems that he has entered Zhongshan.

12
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,580
Search the mountain.

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,540
Yes!

14
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:29,700
Chief.

15
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,470
Prince Fu has entered the palace.

16
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,790
For what?

17
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,090
I don't know.

18
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,150
But there's another matter.

19
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm not sure if

20
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,079
it's related to this one.

21
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,720
Consort Duan’s maid

22
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,810
is making a fuss,

23
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,120
saying the Consort Dowager has gone missing.

24
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,880
Missing?

25
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,490
I found this.

26
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,410
[Empress Rong'an]

27
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,110
Her Majesty's leaf tag.

28
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,720
The Empress took Consort Dowager Duan away.

29
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,280
She is not after the Consort Dowager,

30
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,710
but Prince Fu.

31
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,970
Godfather,

32
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,780
no matter what the Empress is up to,

33
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,460
as long as the Prince of Nanyuan dies,

34
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,140
she will not get her way.

35
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,240
Please do not lose sight of what's important.

36
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,650
Chief Xiao. You're such a good person.

37
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,030
I’m comforting you.

38
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,010
You've suffered so much

39
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,310
that I can't stand it.

40
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,250
We're making a big fuss.

41
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,800
The Prince of Nanyuan

42
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,150
will soon notice something is wrong.

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,829
If we miss this opportunity,

44
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,550
it'll be hard to catch him again.

45
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,980
We must act now.

46
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,840
Xiao Duo.

47
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,670
Forget it.

48
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,250
I can't rely on him.

49
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,080
I will hold my destiny in stride.

50
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,360
If this time,

51
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,950
I really can't escape death,

52
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,260
then there is only one way.

53
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,640
I want to die comfortably.

54
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,320
Why are you here?

55
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,990
Your Highness,

56
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,230
are your formalities not a little too much?

57
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,590
Didn't you leave the city?

58
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,530
You forced me

59
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,660
to put my seal

60
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,220
on my promise to protect you.

61
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,230
I couldn't not come.

62
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,400
What- what's going on?

63
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,030
You- you're finally here.

64
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,409
I was so scared.

65
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,670
You left a trail of leaf tags.

66
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,100
It would be hard for me

67
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,530
not to find them.

68
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,920
Rong'an is full of tricks.

69
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,220
Did she leave

70
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,440
anything else suspicious here?

71
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,210
Yes. An incense burner.

72
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:51,680
You inhaled it?

73
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,400
No.

74
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:54,710
I put it out.

75
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,600
The placement of the incense burner

76
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,650
is very eye-catching.

77
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,409
It's obviously up to no good.

78
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,270
Where do you think it is from?

79
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:14,910
Are you alright?

80
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,100
Your Highness was right.

81
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,030
Prince Fu has entered the Hall.

82
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,800
Have the officials been informed?

83
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,110
Yes.

84
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,070
All the officials of any significance

85
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,090
in the whole court

86
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
have already entered.

87
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,610
In no time at all,

88
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,830
they will definitely catch the adulterous pair

89
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,720
right in the act.

90
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,030
I must see this spectacle

91
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,060
with my own eyes.

92
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,500
Prince Fu.

93
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,720
Where is Consort Dowager Duan?

94
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:57,830
Xiao Duo?

95
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,740
Where is Prince Fu?

96
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,410
You must be joking.

97
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,000
How can Prince Fu

98
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,470
enter the inner court?

99
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,900
So you two

100
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,370
conspired to lie to me?

101
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,130
Xiao Duo.

102
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,690
All these years,

103
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,490
haven't I treated you well enough?

104
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,380
Haven't I rewarded you enough?

105
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,810
Everything I did

106
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,820
was for you.

107
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,920
Why did you betray me?

108
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,590
Do you remember

109
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,300
you once raised

110
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,900
a dog with a body full of white fur?

111
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,790
You treated it very well.

112
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,130
You even let it

113
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,020
sleep in your bed.

114
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,370
And it was smart too.

115
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:41,130
It knew it had to be obedient

116
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,730
to gain your love.

117
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,330
But whenever it revealed any bit of its feral nature,

118
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,930
you had it beaten

119
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,100
within an inch of its life.

120
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,080
Beasts are beasts after all.

121
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,180
Once tamed,

122
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,730
it'd become exceedingly obedient,

123
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,580
and let its owner have its way with it.

124
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,130
But I'm

125
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,020
not a beast.

126
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,590
Your Highness, are you calling for someone?

127
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,360
I advise you not to make this a big deal.

128
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,340
You are still grounded

129
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,860
and you should not be here.

130
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,140
How dare you!

131
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,730
What are you doing?

132
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,620
Why are you so surprised?

133
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,820
I think you must have been

134
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,210
distracted by Prince Rong these days.

135
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,430
You have not noticed that your subordinates

136
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,650
have been replaced

137
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,780
by my people.

138
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,110
I am the Empress of Ye.

139
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,630
What do you dare do to me?

140
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,440
I dare not do anything,

141
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,920
I am merely making a suggestion.

142
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:00,890
After all these years of managing the Imperial Harem,

143
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,650
you must be tired.

144
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,620
Why don't you find a quiet place,

145
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,090
and have a good rest?

146
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,330
Cao Chun'ang.

147
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:18,400
Your Highness.

148
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,920
What did Chief Xiao mean?

149
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,520
He wants me

150
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,620
to leave the Imperial City.

151
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,560
The two of you

152
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,200
incompetent fools!

153
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,590
How dare you

154
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,360
embarrass me in front of Xiao Duo?

155
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,410
Your Highness.

156
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,000
Fine.

157
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,230
I'll grant your wishes.

158
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,250
Lady Zhang Yujin

159
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,560
has had illicit relations with the eunuch Yan Sunlang.

160
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,540
Your Highness.

161
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,890
What a disgrace to the Imperial Harem. A disgrace!

162
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,810
Your Highness!

163
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,800
-Your Highness! -Your Highness!

164
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,860
-Your Highness! -Your Highness.

165
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:04,560
Chief.

166
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,450
I am at fault.

167
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,510
I failed to carry out your orders.

168
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:09,810
The Prince of Nanyuan

169
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,490
has escaped.

170
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,670
The person in the carriage he left behind

171
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,800
was not him at all,

172
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,790
but his brother, Yuwen Liangxu.

173
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,420
I didn't expect this bastard

174
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,900
would make use of his own brother

175
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,460
to put on this disappearing act.

176
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:24,670
Chief.

177
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,310
Now the young Prince Yuwen

178
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,150
is in our hands.

179
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,420
We only have to send him to the imperial prison

180
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,430
and interrogate him for one night.

181
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,280
Then, I'm sure this tender,

182
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,120
pampered, young master

183
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,670
would confess to everything.

184
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,930
Send him to the villa in the south of the city.

185
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,400
Keep an eye on him.

186
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,160
Chief.

187
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:56,850
Villa?

188
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,900
Are we going to interrogate him or not?

189
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,260
Can't you tell?

190
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:02,850
No.

191
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,960
Why not?

192
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,170
Godfather has already figured out the ins and outs

193
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,060
of the entire Yuwen family.

194
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,780
That young Prince Yuwen

195
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,920
is a complete playboy.

196
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,180
He has nothing to do at all

197
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,610
with the Prince of Nanyuan.

198
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,120
What could you get out of him?

199
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,510
Don't make trouble.

200
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,730
The Prince of Nanyuan has a vast network in West Shu.

201
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,740
Now that he has escaped,

202
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,380
we won't be able to touch him for a while.

203
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,940
Godfather must be very upset.

204
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,370
Well...

205
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,670
Leave.

206
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,490
Go.

207
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,260
Ah Duo.

208
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,860
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,880
We were so close to getting the Prince of Nanyuan.

210
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,460
Where's Yinlou? I want to see her.

211
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,770
I made a grave mistake.

212
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,660
Chief Xiao, what are you doing?

213
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,580
Please get up.

214
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,590
First,

215
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,110
I didn't do my duty as your advisor,

216
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,000
causing you to be deceived by the Empress.

217
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,310
You entered the palace alone and were put in harm's way.

218
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,570
Second,

219
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,250
I left Zhongshan without permission,

220
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,130
and allowed the Prince of Nanyuan to escape.

221
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,400
This is akin to letting the tiger back to the mountain.

222
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,830
Please allow me to die

223
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,140
to atone for my crimes.

224
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,820
Chief Xiao,

225
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,210
are you blaming His Highness for ruining the plan?

226
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,430
I dare not.

227
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,230
Prince Rong passed away in an accident,

228
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,950
and now there is this disaster.

229
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,180
The palace is wracked by chaos,

230
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,780
and I’m responsible for it.

231
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,890
It was my recklessness

232
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,290
that almost created a huge problem.

233
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,760
I... I promise you.

234
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,700
Before I ascend the throne,

235
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,170
I will not act recklessly again.

236
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,140
Chief Xiao, please get up.

237
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,070
I will make a new plan immediately.

238
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,430
Xiao Duo is too arrogant.

239
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,210
Look at him. He has no respect

240
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,810
for you, the future Emperor,

241
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,140
at all.

242
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,390
Your Highness,

243
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,640
you shouldn’t show him mercy.

244
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,370
Chief Xiao

245
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,470
is just thinking of the bigger picture.

246
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,610
Why burn the bridge?

247
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,050
In the future... In the future,

248
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,610
there's still a lot I have to rely on him for.

249
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,370
His Highness is too kind.

250
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,460
Xiao Duo,

251
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,480
all these years,

252
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,280
I could not win you over,

253
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,340
no matter what I gave to you.

254
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,520
Your heart is hard as steel.

255
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,720
You think you have won?

256
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,950
In this Imperial City,

257
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,300
we are but caged birds

258
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,110
huddling together for warmth.

259
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,170
Who are we to hope for a good ending?

260
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,910
I'm waiting to see the day

261
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,140
you'll lose the whole game.

262
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,330
Brother, here.

263
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,810
It's a reward from a Lady. It's sweet.

264
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,330
It's really sweet. Ah Duo. Here.

265
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,660
Godfather,

266
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,550
please take the medicine.

267
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,760
Don't get sick.

268
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,090
You might not want to talk,

269
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,690
but I have to.

270
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,630
You shouldn't have come back yesterday.

271
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,430
All these years, you laid low in the palace.

272
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,740
What was it all for?

273
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,880
Wasn't it

274
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,760
to avenge the Second Master?

275
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,970
We almost succeeded.

276
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,720
But for Consort Dowager Duan,

277
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,700
you undid all of your efforts.

278
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,110
Why are you doing this?

279
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,600
Since I've done it,

280
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,660
there's no need to speak more about it.

281
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,510
Are you still worried about her?

282
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,780
She's smart,

283
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,630
she can protect herself.

284
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,770
Not even the Empress

285
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,700
can do anything to her.

286
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,670
What are you worried about?

287
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,430
I know.

288
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,300
But I can't.

289
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,120
What's wrong?

290
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,050
You've always been decisive.

291
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,650
Why is it that when it comes to her,

292
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,160
you become soft-hearted?

293
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,380
If I were Ah Duo,

294
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,740
it wouldn't be strange at all

295
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,040
to do this.

296
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,830
It's only that I am me,

297
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,150
carrying the secret of my identity,

298
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,760
and the blood-soaked debt of my family.

299
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:06,900
I have no choice,

300
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,060
nor the right to be kind.

301
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,710
I can only harden my heart,

302
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,230
and keep going down this path as a wicked person.

303
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,410
Godfather,

304
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,760
I didn't mean that.

305
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,640
I just don't want-

306
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,200
That is the truth. You may leave.

307
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:25,630
Godfather.

308
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,430
Leave!

309
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,150
In this Imperial Palace,

310
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,390
what ends begins again, endlessly.

311
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,870
I...

312
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,700
may never be able to get out.

313
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,560
Abyss Clear and Jade Clean

314
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,100
The ministers came to Fengyi Palace.

315
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,410
When they looked,

316
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,400
they saw two people inside,

317
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,450
entangled together in a state of undress.

318
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,640
It turns out that Lady Zhang

319
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,590
was trying to lay hands on Eunuch Yan.

320
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,060
That scene was truly

321
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,880
an ugly one.

322
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,620
Mistress, let me drink some water first.

323
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,490
Xiao Duo

324
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,270
I slapped Chief Xiao.

325
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,910
Let me think about it.

326
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,590
Let me think. Let me think.

327
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:01,970
Could that be...

328
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,700
Could that be

329
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,700
the only way?

330
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,380
If you were not going to die,

331
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,140
I would never

332
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:07,850
use that method.

333
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,950
But you must promise me:

334
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,080
if you recover,

335
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:10,920
you must not

336
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,470
dismember or skin me.

337
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,400
What's done is done.

338
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,280
Then- then- then.

339
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,830
My apologies then!

340
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,480
According to the book,

341
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,630
a strong application of external force

342
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,560
can improve the circulation of qi and blood,

343
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,170
so as to purge toxins from the body.

344
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,600
This antidote

345
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,610
is a little rough,

346
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,750
but it's effective.

347
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,500
Look at you.

348
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,850
Haven't you recovered?

349
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,020
Chief Xiao,

350
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,660
you won’t blame me, will you?

351
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,880
You won't, right?

352
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:48,630
You...

353
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,200
Your Highness.

354
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,640
I've already arranged

355
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,560
for someone to assist you.

356
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,090
You’d better leave as soon as possible.

357
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,120
Chief Xiao.

358
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,090
Chief Xiao.

359
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,990
Chief Xiao.

360
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,250
Please don’t be angry.

361
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,810
Chief Xiao.

362
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,120
Please don’t be angry.

363
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,690
Chief Xiao.

364
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,400
Get out!

365
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,130
He must hate me now.

366
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,900
Right now, is he pondering

367
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,290
how he will torture me?

368
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,610
I'll continue.

369
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,950
And then,

370
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,560
the Empress became furious.

371
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,620
She gave Consort Zhang a length of white rope

372
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,550
on the spot,

373
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,480
and beheaded Eunuch Yan.

374
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,880
As for what happened after,

375
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
it's even more unbelievable.

376
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,480
Her Majesty

377
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,830
asked to go to Tanxi Temple.

378
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,070
She said she has failed her duty as the Empress,

379
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,410
and must reflect on herself.

380
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,260
What do you think?

381
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,330
Mistress?

382
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,570
Mistress! Mistress!

383
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,060
Xiao Duo

384
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,510
Have you been listening

385
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
to me talking?

386
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,160
Well,

387
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,980
I'm going out for a moment.

388
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,950
I'll hear you out to later.

389
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,910
I knew it! You weren't listening to me.

390
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,170
I was so close

391
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,040
to killing the King of Nanyuan

392
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,000
in order to avenge you.

393
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,820
Ah Duo,

394
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,480
wait for me a bit longer.

395
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,120
Soon.

396
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,950
Soon...

397
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,380
Who let you in?

398
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,140
Get out!

399
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,660
It was just a slap.

400
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,810
Why are you so angry?

401
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:16,970
Why are you here?

402
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,830
I'm here to apologize to you.

403
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,770
Why don't we forget

404
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,580
about all the meaningless love and hatred

405
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,340
with a sip of wine?

406
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,220
You don't look well.

407
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,320
Are you sick?

408
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,670
Then why are you

409
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,890
out here?

410
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,690
Let me help you back.

411
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,740
Stop drinking

412
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,300
if you're not feeling well.

413
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,040
Let me tell you a secret.

414
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,020
Fine, I'll listen.

415
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,900
Tell me! Tell me!

416
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,240
Tell me!

417
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:14,720
Tree.

418
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,420
Yes.

419
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,350
It's a pear tree.

420
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,240
It's blooming well.

421
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,090
I will only tell you

422
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,040
that this pear tree doesn't belong here.

423
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,400
It was re-planted

424
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,360
from outside the Imperial City.

425
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,350
Originally,

426
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,710
there were two identical ones.

427
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,420
What happened to the other one?

428
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,580
It froze.

429
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,360
Now, this is the only one,

430
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,130
left all alone.

431
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,350
It grows with the seasons,

432
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,700
blooms for no purpose,

433
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,560
but has never bore fruit again.

434
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,850
Well, if you wait another three or five years,

435
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,620
it'll bear fruit no matter what.

436
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,660
It's different.

437
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,600
The Imperial City is different from the outside.

438
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,910
Even its original appearance

439
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,180
has changed.

440
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,490
Even it,

441
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,830
does not recognize itself anymore.

442
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,770
Why does it matter

443
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,250
if it bears fruit or not.

444
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,530
It can never get out again anyway.

445
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,350
Let me show you something.

446
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,180
My mother gave this to me.

447
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,750
Her hometown is in West Shu.

448
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,850
There, people live by the water,

449
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,530
so they treat fish as gods that bring good fortune.

450
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,000
When I was young,

451
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,600
my mother always coaxed me.

452
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,440
She said that as long as

453
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,780
this Fish Immortal is around,

454
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,210
it can help me transform calamity into fortune.

455
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,090
As long as I need, it will be efficacious.

456
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,300
You say your tree is barren?

457
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,700
I'll ask the Fish Immortal to manifest its power,

458
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,050
and let it fruit gradually.

459
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,040
Bear fruit.

460
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,700
Bear fruit.

461
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,540
Bear fruit.

462
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,800
The Fish Immortal agreed!

463
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,560
I did drink a little,

464
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,830
but I'm not stupid.

465
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,200
You don't believe me?

466
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,880
It really agreed.

467
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,140
It clearly agreed.

468
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,360
Just now, the Fish Immortal told me:

469
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,330
"This tree,

470
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,520
flowers will fall from it immediately."

471
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,890
You don't believe me?

472
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,160
Close your eyes.

473
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,310
Close them!

474
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,890
Don't open your eyes. Wait for me.

475
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,360
Don't open your eyes.

476
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,180
Don't open your eyes.

477
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:50,930
Don't open your eyes.

478
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,160
Look! Flowers are falling!

479
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,310
Flowers are falling.

480
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,960
Wait... Wait a minute.

481
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,050
Wait a minute.

482
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,230
♫ The faraway mountains have been undisturbed for a thousand years ♫

483
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,070
♫ Snow falls and hair turns gray overnight ♫

507

From this day on,

508
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,950
you are the Emperor.

509
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,600
You must always remember to be poised and upright.

510
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:32,080
You must look dignified.

511
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,570
You must have everyone who kneels here

512
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,550
submit to you, and fear you.

513
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,640
I...

514
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,830
You should call yourself "This Esteemed One."

515
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:45,480
Hall of Imperial Supremacy

516
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,040
This Esteemed One...

517
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,090
This Esteemed One...

518
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:45,690
understands now.

519
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,670
Long live Your Majesty!

520
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,170
Ministers,

521
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,200
you may rise.

522
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,420
Thank you, Your Majesty

523
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,400
In the 11th year of Longhua,

524
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,250
Murong Gaogong ascended the throne.

525
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,270
It is truly ridiculous:

526
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,450
This man, originally a completely ineffectual

527
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,500
Lantern Prince,

528
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,060
managed to lay claim

529
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,170
to utmost power

530
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,510
within this Imperial City,

531
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,620
with the support of the Eunuch Service.

532
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,070
Shangqiong Palace

533
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,200
His Majesty looks rather uneasy.

534
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,050
Is there any difficulty

535
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,650
in the court?

536
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,260
Tell me.

537
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,780
Why is she avoiding me?

538
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,640
In my opinion,

539
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,870
maybe Her Highness

540
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,670
hasn't figured it out.

541
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,750
She tried so hard

542
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,320
to resist me.

543
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,600
I must have come on too strong

544
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,440
and scared her.

545
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,960
This is a good thing.

546
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,430
Your Majesty.

547
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,160
You are a refined gentleman,

548
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,630
and the Son of Heaven, no less.

549
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,930
No woman

550
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,360
won't remained unswayed.

551
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,710
Your Highness

552
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,260
came up with so many ideas

553
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,560
just so she can wait for you.

554
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,540
In my opinion,

555
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,600
she is interested in you.

556
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,120
Look.

557
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,310
You are the Emperor,

558
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,160
but she was the late Emperor's Consort Dowager.

559
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,650
A gulf separates the two of you.

560
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,790
Maybe Her Highness is worried

561
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,300
what she has with you

562
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,940
is ill-fated,

563
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,620
and destined not to last.

564
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,180
She can only avoid you

565
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,130
and endure the pain alone.

566
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,600
I believe she must be

567
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,880
weeping day and night.

568
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,610
Just as the poem goes, "I return your feelings with tears like pearls,"

569
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:05,310
"resenting that we didn't meet before my betrothal to another."

570
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,210
Sun Taiqing,

571
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,520
did you read

572
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,860
Wan Wan's novellas?

573
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,150
It was hard to refuse

574
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,040
the Princess' enthusiasm.

575
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,330
Then, tell me

576
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,920
what should I do?

577
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,530
Women are shy.

578
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,670
When they feel awkward,

579
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,940
they won't listen to anything you say.

580
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:32,990
Your Majesty,

581
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,000
you will have to be more subtle.

582
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:35,880
Subtle?

583
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,440
How?

584
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,380
You have to make Her Highness feel sorry for you.

585
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,020
You can pretend to be sick,

586
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,960
saying it's because of your overwhelming sorrow

587
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,850
over Prince Rong's death.

588
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,250
I was out of line.

589
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:04,990
Pass my order.

590
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,850
I want to fast and pray

591
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,900
for Prince Rong.

592
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,150
Your Majesty.

593
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:16,540
Actually,

594
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,179
you don't have to take it seriously.

595
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,190
Don't make it hard on yourself.

596
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,340
Fasting is not easy to endure.

597
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,530
I feel guilty about him.

598
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,840
As long as the guilt is not eliminated,

599
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,350
I won't be able to

600
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,030
face Yinlou.

601
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,360
Yes.

602
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,239
Let's eat.

603
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,440
Eat. This is delicious.

604
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,239
Try it.

605
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,100
Have a taste.

606
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,110
Mistress.

607
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,710
These thugs are so scary.

608
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,639
When will this end?

609
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:57,280
It's about time.

610
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,000
Eunuch Sun.

611
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,470
What brings you here?

612
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,690
Your Highness.

613
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,990
His Majesty

614
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,930
is fasting for Prince Rong.

615
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,450
He personally led the servants to make lanterns.

616
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,380
He also ordered

617
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,390
for them to be sent to the palaces and courtyards,

618
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,210
so everyone can pray for Prince Rong together.

619
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,160
His Majesty has suffered a lot.

620
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,460
These days,

621
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,770
he hasn't been sleeping much.

622
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,780
He has even lost weight.

623
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:35,920
What's more, no one around him

624
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,310
knows how take care of him properly.

625
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,600
Eunuch Sun.

626
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:44,860
I want to see His Majesty.

627
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,310
Okay.

628
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,740
I'll inform them now.

629
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,210
Come in with me.

630
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:24,760
Your Majesty.

631
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:28,420
Look.

632
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,020
Look how green these lotus leaves are.

633
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,160
After some time,

634
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,880
when the lotus flowers bloom,

635
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,650
I'll bring you here again here to admire them.

636
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,540
Your Majesty.

637
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,680
I have something to tell you.

638
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,100
Me too.

639
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,080
I also have something to tell you.

640
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,520
Last time,

641
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,910
I didn't mean to pester you.

642
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,550
It was only that I felt uneasy,

643
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,730
and only when I come here,

644
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,080
can I have a moment of peace.

645
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,820
Did

646
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,380
something happen to you?

647
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,320
I...

648
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,370
It was me.

649
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,000
I killed Prince Rong.

650
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,870
I didn't mean to.

651
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,540
But he

652
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,220
suddenly appeared behind me.

653
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,560
I was startled, so-

654
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,650
so I pushed, and he-

655
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,500
I didn't expect

656
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,430
things to turn out like this.

657
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,030
After that,

658
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,960
I dared not fall asleep at night.

659
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:27,760
Whenever I fall asleep,

660
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,310
I would see his face.

661
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,840
He's covered in blood, looking at me,

662
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,030
calling me "Uncle."

663
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,970
I did everything.

664
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:38,510
I-

665
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:39,480
fasted,

666
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,880
b- burned incense, chanted sutras.

667
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,280
But I can still see him.

668
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,870
Chief Xiao told me

669
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,720
I can’t tell anyone, but…

670
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,780
I I- really can't stand it anymore.

671
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,330
I...

672
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,140
I can only...

673
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,530
I can only

674
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,540
tell you.

675
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,320
Will you forgive me?

676
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,360
Your Majesty.

677
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,080
It was Prince Rong who died.

678
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,090
Why do you care about whether I think

679
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,390
he would blame you?

680
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:17,700
Because I...

681
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,460
I...

682
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,910
I care what you think of me.

683
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,940
Your Majesty and I

684
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,880
just knew each other when we were young.

685
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,860
Your affection for me...

686
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,170
I don't quite understand it.

687
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,500
This place

688
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,730
didn't use to be a pond

689
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,210
until a few years ago.

690
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,990
This used to be my mother's palace.

691
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,510
I've been timid since I was young.

692
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,310
After my mother passed away,

693
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,990
there was no one left to protect me.

694
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,670
I was often bullied by the other princes.

695
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,180
I remember that year,

696
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,120
we went to the Bu Residence to study.

697
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,130
Several princes

698
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,370
locked me up in a room.

699
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,630
It was dark,

700
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,570
so dark that there was no light at all.

701
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,460
I was scared.

702
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,390
I was so scared.

703
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,110
In that moment, you appeared.

704
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,340
You opened the door

705
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,720
holding a lantern

706
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,570
with a rosemallow drawn on it.

707
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,260
You stood in the light,

708
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,880
telling me that

709
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,520
you would bring me outside.

710
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,070
It's been too long.

711
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,960
I don't remember it anymore.

712
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,060
But I remember.

713
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,370
I'll remember it forever.

714
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,720
You might not understand

715
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,240
how important you are to me.

716
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,350
Yes, I've made

717
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,240
a grave mistake.

718
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,250
But I still hope that

719
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:55,720
in your eyes,

720
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,400
I'm not a scary person.

721
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,500
Yinlou.

722
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,610
Can you forgive me?

723
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:07,360
I...

724
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:17,860
Last time...

725
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,540
The lantern I gave you last time broke,

726
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,220
so I made another one for you.

727
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,690
Please accept it.

728
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,580
I will take it to mean-

729
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,100
to mean that you have forgiven me.

730
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:28,730
I...

731
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,830
I accept it.

732
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,680
But...

733
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,110
I'm not Prince Rong.

734
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,120
I can't forgive you on his behalf.

735
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,420
Similarly,

736
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,150
I have no right to criticize you.

737
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,460
But in my opinion,

738
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,010
doing things like fasting and praying

739
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,440
for show

740
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,870
will not get you forgiveness.

741
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,300
How about doing something

742
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,910
that can actually make up for your mistake?

743
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,730
After all, the dead is already dead,

744
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,580
but the living are still living.

745
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:03,470
The living?

746
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:08,170
I heard from the maids

747
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,770
that the servants of Chengyuan Palace

748
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,450
were exiled by the Empress Dowager

749
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,130
because of Prince Rong's death.

750
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,040
I see.

751
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,590
I understand now.

752
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,970
I understand now.

753
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,000
I should thank you for the lantern.

754
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,060
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

755
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,780
You've been busy.

756
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,290
I didn't have the chance to tell you.

757
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,320
Where is Her Highness?

758
00:41:59,070 --> 00:41:59,740
She's fine.

759
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,960
I heard that

760
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:01,840
she chatted happily

761
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,020
with His Majesty.

762
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:03,730
By the way,

763
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,700
she also received a lantern

764
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,000
made personally by His Majesty.

765
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,090
What did I say?

766
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,690
Her Highness

767
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,820
is indeed interested in His Majesty.

768
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,230
Here, your cloak.

769
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,660
Your cloak.
