I'm curious

132
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,740
why you chose an empty branch.

133
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,540
The rule of Dream House is to pick their customers

according to their flowers.

135
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,660
But there are always

If that's not the case,

141
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,660
why would you

come out every day

143
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,260
to the flower window?

144
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,900
So I guess,

145
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,020
you are not waiting for flowers,

146
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,420
but you're waiting for someone.

158
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,580
You are honey-lipped.

159
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,540
Tell me.

To be honest,

163
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,780
my family

164
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,020

I don't know what's going on.

169
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,380
So they want me to learn from you

170

and have you teach me drum dance.

171
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,820
So they want me to teach you

172

how to make men happy?

173
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,900
That's pretty much what it means.

174
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,500
I have trained many women

175

up till now.

176
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,100

00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,290
Anything easy is boring to me.

179
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,900
I'm not interested.

180
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,100
Sister,

181
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,620
why don't you

182
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,020
test me first,

183
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,100
and see if I have potential.

184
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,140
What if you like me?

185
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,180
You have plain looks,

186
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,780
and are not sexy enough.

187
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,620
I admit that I'm not sexy enough,

188
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,540
but you call this plain looks?

189
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,740
I think

190
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,500
I'm quite pretty...

191
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,090
Why don't you blink

192
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,500
and take a closer look?

193
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,100
Have you heard about how attractive looking back while smiling can be?

194
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,300
Try it, I shall have a look.

195
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,900
Looking back while smiling...

196
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,060
Watch this then.

197
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,900
I've been in the industry for many years,

198
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,340
I've never seen

199
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,340
someone this unsexy.

200
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,580
How about I try again?

201
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,420
No need.

202
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,620
I will

203
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,740
take you as my disciple.

204
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,690
Speaking of teaching a girl,

205
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,740
I've never failed

206
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,100
in doing so.

207
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,020
You will be the biggest challenge

208
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,460
in my life.

209
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,940
From now on,

210
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,180
you'll stay here.

211
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,580
You can leave

212
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,100
whenever you're done learning.

213
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,060
Oh no.

214
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,100
She really entered Dream House?

215
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,220
Yes.

216
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,740
And took her as her master?

217
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,940
Yes.

218
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,140
Good. Very good.

219
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,890
Keep an eye on her.

220
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,500
I want to see

221
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,500
how long she's going to mess around for.

222
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,740
Aren't you messing around too?

223
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,660
Go.

224
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,580
There are 180 songs in drum dance.

225
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,900
Sexy is its core.

226
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,580
And your posture, expression, and rhythm are the soul.

227
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,620
They are all equally important.

228
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,580
You are not talented at all.

229
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,940
Teaching you normally

230
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,580
will not work.

231
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,740
There is only one method left.

232
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,140
What method is it?

233
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,940
There is a song called Love Choice.

234
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,100
It's sexy yet not vulgar.

235
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,700
It can confuse audience

236
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,140
and make it hard to hide your feelings.

237
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,220
Cao Zijian once said

238
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,700
Luo Shen is gorgeous

239
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,060
and elegant.

240
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,780
She has bright eyes,

241
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,220
soft dimples,

242
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,940
and is gentle

243
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,300
and honey-lipped.

244
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,940
A dancer have to

245
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,100
convey their emotions at any time.

246
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,860
Be it a look

247
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,540
or posture.

248
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,060
The audience have to

249
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,660
feel your emotions.

250
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,420
Understand?

251
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,260
Understood. Love Choice right?

252
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,500
I got this.

253
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,340
From now on,

254
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,100
besides eating and sleeping,

255
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,380
just practice on the drum.

256
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,820
Remember,

257
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,540
when you practice dancing,

258
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,490
you have to gaze strongly at the surrounding drums.

259
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,740
Take them as

260
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,010
the person you dance for,

261
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,020
and convey your emotions at all times,

262
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,020
to evoke their emotions.

263
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,220
This is what Love Choice is about.

264
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,300
Sister.

265
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,940
Aren't you tired?

266
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,020
I either not do it,

267
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,900
or if I do, I have to do it

268
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,500
to my best abilities.

269
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:46,980
Good!

270
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:50,940
It's your turn now.

271
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,980
Her Majesty has been learning very hard lately.

272
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,940
She's been working so hard

273
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,410
she forgets to eat,

274
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,140
practicing all day

275
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,900
without stopping.

276
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,860
But,

277
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,420
I just don't think she's talented.

278
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,220
She doesn't look very elegant.

279
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,220
Didn't you ask Her Highness to go?

280
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,860
Why are you angry?

281
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,300
I'm not angry.

282
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,740
If you're not angry,

283
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,180
why do you look so down?

284
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,020
You have anger written all over your face.

285
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,060
Go back to the Zhaoding Bureau,

286
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,180
and gather manpower.

287
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,900
You've arranged people

288
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,060
to be stationed where Prince of Nanyuan's

289

Do we have a new task?

00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,940
To ban prostitution!

[Do Things in Peace]

00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,619
Ban prostitution?

294
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,619
Here, give me a massage.

295
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,540
It hurts so much.

296
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,780
You're not dancing,

297
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,500
but hitting the drum with your own body.

298
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,819
It hurts me watching you.

299
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,020
Look at how many times you've fallen.

300
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,300
If it were me,

301
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
I would go back and ask for Chief Xiao's forgiveness.

302
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,380
You can’t do this.

303

I refuse.

304

are you still angry?

306

I was angry back then.

But now,

I can't do that.

It's no big deal.

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,420
is angry with him

353
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,660
and ignores him.

354
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,180
So he came to

355
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,340
beg me.

356
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,340
He said I'm the most passionate woman

357
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,780
in the whole capital,

358
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,820
so I must know women best.

359
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,420
He just wants to learn

360
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,820
how to make women happy.

361
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,860
How could I agree?

362
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,460
Dream House only cheats men,

363
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,420
not women.

364
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,780
Master, I'm sincere.

365
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,180
I'm not cheating.

366
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,260
Who is your master?

367
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,780
His brother is the Prince of Nanyuan.

368
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,090
He's

369
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,020
Chief Xiao's rival.

370
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,220
When Prince Rong was alive,

371
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,140
he joined forces with Queen Rong'an

372
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,020
and almost became the Prince Regent.

373
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,660
When you were locked up by the Empress,

374
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,140
Chief Xiao was after him.

375
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,980
If he didn’t rush back to save you,

376
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,460
he would have been arrested alive.

377
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,580
Anyway,

378
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,820
stay away from

379
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,660
Young Prince Yuwen.

380
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,980
Just in case Prince of Nanyuan

381
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,980
or anything he does,

382
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,700
It's not good to get you involved.

383
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,060
Now that I think about it,

384
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,750
his behavior is very suspicious.

385
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,900
He sneaked into Chief Xiao's residence

386
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,940
and confessed his feelings to Wanwan ridiculously.

387
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,220
And now,

388
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,490
he's willing to lower his status

389
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,220
to be somewhere like this.

390
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,340
What is he up to?

391
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,700
You're are prince,

392
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,220
yet you can go all out like this?

393
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,260
That's rare

394
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,180
of a man to do this.

395
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,100
Of course.

396
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,300
For Wanwan,

397
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,090
I can do anything.

398
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,700
I'm telling you,

399
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,060
you can't tell anyone

400
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,420
about me being here.

401
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,300
Otherwise, I'll...

402
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,780
Wait, why are you here too?

403
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,490
Acting dumb in front of me?

404
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,020
Child's play.

405
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,740
What a coincidence.

406
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,540
I'm here to learn too.

407
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,940
Aren't you Chief...

408
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,620
Aren't you from Chief Xiao's residence?

409
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,580
That damn eunuch is such a playboy.

410
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,340
He's worse than a beast.

411
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,940
That's right, that damn bastard!

412
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,300
He's not human...

413
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,020
When I saw you opposing him that day,

414
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,260
I respected you

415
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,740
very much.

416
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,340
Looking at your plight, you're not having it easy either.

417
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,420
You injuring me last time

418
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,420
was an accident anyway.

419
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,700
Let's forget it.

420
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,300
I'll let it slide.

421
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,100
From now on,

422
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,140
we are brothers and sisters.

423
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,420
Trying to be friendly

424
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,500
to lower my guard?

425
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,820
What a petty trick.

426
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,420
I know better than this.

427
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,900
Okay, Senior.

428
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,860
Ms. Meng, there is a public official outside,

429
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,860
saying that they want to investigate our store.

430
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,260
Excuse me.

431
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,660
Master, don't go.

432
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,570
Where are you going?

433
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,860
I don't know which bastard

434
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,900
accused me of forcing people into prostitution.

435
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,340
Now the public officials want to shut my business.

436
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,620
Nonsense!

437
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,020
I'm not to be trifled with either.

438
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,780
I'll go and mediate.

439
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,490
No, Master.

440
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,620
I just want to arrange a flower bouquet

441
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,940
to apologize to Wanwan.

442
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,100
I've arranged so many of them,

443
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,140
and you are not satisfied with any of them.

444
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,860
Look at this.

445
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,220
Can this move her?

446
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,090
With your taste,

447
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,060
even if you arrange

448
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:45,860
ten more,

449
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,020
you wouldn't be able to move anyone.

450
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,140
Go to sleep.

451
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,300
Sleep?

452
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,420
She's saying

453
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,540
that,

454
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,540
anything can happen in your dream.

455
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,500
No.

456
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,540
I only need Wanwan.

457
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,620
Keep pretending.

458
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,540
He's pretty good at this.

459
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,780
What should I do?

460
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,380
Can I even gift this?

461
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,540
Senior,

462
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,740
I'm touched by

463
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,980
your sincerity.

464
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,020
Let me give you a hand.

465
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,980
Can you do it?

466
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,420
I'm a girl too.

467
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,780
Of course I know

468
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,500
what girls like.

469
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,020
I think this is already pretty good.

470
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:44,940
Look.

471
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,340
It's full of sincerity.

472
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,260
This is it.

473
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
Don't hesitate. Come on.

474
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,860
Give Wanwan a surprise.

475
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,860
You have good taste.

476
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:52,700
You also think this looks good too,

477
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,460
right?

478
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,980
I mean,

479
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,660
it's better to be uniquely ugly

480
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,300
than to be averagely pretty.

481
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,780
It's the most import

482
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,900
for her to remember you deeply.

483
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,770
What do I say

484
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,300
when I gift it to her?

485
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,180
Just say

486
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,290
in your heart,

487
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,100
she's just like this flower.

488
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,180
Thank you. I'll be on my way.

489
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,620
Go ahead.

490
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,020
Mistress,

491
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,210
why are you helping

492
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,500
Young Prince Yuwen

493
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,500
get Princess Hede?

494
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,780
This young prince must be

495
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,180
approaching the prince with a purpose.

496
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,300
It must be a cover.

497
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,660
He must have other intentions.

498
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,980
Anything concerning the princess,

499
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,980
concerns Imperial City.

500
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,620
Anything concerning Imperial City

501
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,860
concerns Chief Xiao.

502
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,020
As long as I’m here,

503
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,020
no one can

504
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,580
do anything to Chief Xiao.

505
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,860
I must

506
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,900
find out the truth.

507
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,660
He...

508
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,220
He's not trying to

509
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,860
impress the princess?

510
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,820
What?

511
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,980
Instead, he likes Chief Xiao?

512
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,660
What? The young prince went to Dream House?

513
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,540
That's right.

514
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,010
[A Thousand Iridescent Clouds Gather]

515
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,940
He didn't even try

516
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,700
to run away,

517
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,260
and moved in.

518
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,820
Though he saw

519
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,980
our men were watching,

520
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,980
he didn't make a single noise,

521
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,140
as if he didn't see anything.

522
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,300
Let him be.

523
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,180
He won't cause any trouble.

524
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,660
Just keep an eye on him.

525

Don't let him bother Her Highness.

526
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:23,820
Understood.

527
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,260
I'm afraid it's too late.

528
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,580
He's already bothering Her Highness?

529
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,060
He's not the one who approached Her Highness,

530
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,580
but Her Highness who's bothering him.

I shouldn't have trusted you.

This morning,

535
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,570
you were just calling me junior.

536
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,420
Now you're calling me

How dare you.

539
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,500
You told me to gift the flowers

540

and I did,

541
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,740
and said what you taught me.

542
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,660
In the end,

543
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,740
she said I have a unique taste.

544
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,180
Isn't that good?

545

She's praising you.

546
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,100
Would you punch someone if you were praising them?

547
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,420
It's well done, though?

548
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,460
How so?

549
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,540
Didn't you say

550
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,260
she ignored you?

551
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,620
Now she's not.

552
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,570
She's being very passionate, isn't she?

553
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,300
This is called being passionate?

554
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,100
From now on,

555
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,620
just keep doing this.

Don't let her out of your sight at any moment.

junior, do you think there is anything

560
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,700
I should be careful about?

561
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,380
No need.

562
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,060
Just be yourself bravely.

563
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,340
Don't think too much.

564
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,060
Go.

565
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:52,980
Be myself.

566
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,420
Thank you. I'm going.

00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,140
Go ahead.

Why is it him again?

There are so many steps here.

The sun is very strong, don't get tanned.

Otherwise, even the Buddha

I prepared a sedan chair for you in advance.

578

When I brought out

600
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,300
the sedan chair yesterday,

601
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,540
she was very excited

602
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,540
and touched.

603
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,580
But

604
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,020
she must be afraid that I'm tired

605
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,220
and felt sorry for me,

606
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,010
so she paid the

608

and asked them to send me off instead.

00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,140
Some issues have arose

700
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,100
with some of the Secret Services.

701
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,980
We need you to go there in person.

702
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,410
The remnants of West Shu can't stop causing trouble.

703
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,580
Godfather,

704
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,100
take me there.

705
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,900
Go back to Dream House and keep watch.

706
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,100
Let's go.

[Sleeping on Snow and Clouds]

708
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,140
What are you doing?

709
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,420
I have a new idea.

710
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,660
His Highness, I know I'm wrong.

711
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,540
I shouldn't have tormented you.

712
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,220
Please let me off.

713
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,780
What do you mean?

714
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,540
Stop pretending.

715
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:41,620
Let's not

716
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,820
beat around the bush.

717
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,980
Just tell me.

718
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,060
What are you up to,

719
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,300
trying so hard to chase

720
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,620
Princess Hede?

721
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,180
I'm up to nothing.

722
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,500
Your brother and Princess

723
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,540
are there fighting it out.

724
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,420
And here, you're busy hanging around Wanwan.

725
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,620
Do you have nothing better to do?

726

[Sleeping on Snow and Clouds]

727
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,980
So you really have nothing better to do...

728
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,980
Wanwan will pick be picking plum blossoms today.

729
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,210
What do you think I should do this time?

730
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,739
Pick it for her?

731
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,300
Good idea.

732
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,580
I'm going.

733
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,239
[Sleeping on Snow and Clouds]

734
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:25,580
It seems I've

735
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:26,460
really been

736
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,860
thinking too much.

737
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,420
What can someone like young prince

738
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,820
have up their sleeves?

739
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,739
He's just dumb.

740
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,699
You're so thoughtful.

741
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,300
You know Empress Dowager likes green plum blossoms

742
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,420
so you came to pick them specially.

743
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,940
It's just strange,

744
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,260
why all the plum trees

745
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,699
bald?

746
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,740
Mistress, it's him again.

747
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,260
Wanwan, catch it.

748
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,660
What do you want?

749
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,940
You're tying something as elegant as this

750
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,740
like you're typing firewood.

751
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,020
How is this?

752
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,500
Isn't it tidy?

753
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,660
Your Highness.

754
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,780
Did I offend you?

755
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,620
Or are you unsatisfied

756
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,020
with your situation in the palace,

757
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,340
and want me to

758
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,460
put in a word for His Majesty for you?

759
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,780
No.

760
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,420
Then what do you want?

761
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,700
I just–

762
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,380
I just want you to accept these flowers.

763
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,380
I've offended you over the past few days,

764
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,660
so I'm apologizing to you.

765
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,700
I'm afraid I can't pick it if I'm late,

766
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,220
so I sneaked in this morning.

767
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,700
The watchdog

768
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,780
chased me for five miles.

769
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,660
I couldn't run anymore.

770
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,900
So I fought with it.

771
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,340
Why

772
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,740
do you have to apologize to me?

773
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,980
Didn't I tell you?

774
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,140
I like you.

775
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,500
I want to make you happy.

776
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,180
If you don't accept them,

777
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,020
these plum blossoms

778
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,020
will just rot here.

779
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,260
I don't have the energy

780
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,580
to bring them away anymore.

781
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,380
Here you go.

782
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,100
See you soon.

783
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,890
This fool.

784
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,620
I don't have the energy to carry them too.

785
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:49,870
Cao Chun'ang.

786
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,460
What took you so long?

787
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,420
Mistress asked me to wait for you,

788
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,980
I've been waiting for a long time.

789
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,900
Her Highness knows that

790
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,180
I'm here?

791
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,660
Yes.

792
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,860
Mistress wants you to

793
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,930
pass a message to Chief Xiao.

794
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,780
Pass a message?

795
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,380
Good!

796
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,100
Good!

797
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,100
Great dance!

798
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,460
Mistress danced so well.

799
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,300
Not bad.

800
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,220
It's not bad.

801
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,460
It's just not bad?

802
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,140
Master, you are too strict.

803
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,620
Stop talking.

804
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,540
I get a headache when I hear you talking.

805
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,100
Junior is so naughty.

806
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,420
Thanks to your strategies,

807
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,570
Wanwan is finally being nice to me.

808
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,540
You're welcome.

809
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,540
Your nonsense

810
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,380
actually helped him.

811
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,900
It's no easy feat.

812
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,780
You're part of us now.

813
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,580
Master,

814
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,260
you're willing to take me as your disciple now?

815
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,340
I have nothing to do anyway.

816
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,620
I can...

817
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,980
teach you a trick.

818
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,380
Go ahead, Master.

819
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,690
From now on,

820
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,220
you'll stay at home,

821
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,020
and can't see the person you love.

822
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,140
Why?

823
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,180
Someone who keeps

824
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,020
lingering around everyday

825
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,700
will only make people annoyed.

826
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,500
But once they're gone,

827
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,900
it will makes people think about them.

828
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,700
Do you know

829
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,940
where the love for another person

830
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,060
normally start from?

831
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,180
Where from?

832
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,300
From thinking too much.

833
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,940
Thinking too much?

834
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,540
Think about it.

835
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,380
Thinking too much?

836
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,180
Sister Meng,

837
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,420
are you seriously teaching him?

838
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,700
Do I look like I'm not serious?

839
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,180
You should be careful too.

840
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,940
Maybe one day,

841
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,260
you will be the one falling into this.

842
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,900
What does this have to do with me?

843
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,100
Sister Meng,

844
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,420
now that I've learned this dance,

845
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,180
have I completed my learning journey?

846
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,170
You?

847
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,540
It's still early.

848
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:45,900
By the way,

849
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,260
I don't know

850
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,140
who this person is,

851
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,980
but they keep wanting to pick a fight with me,

852
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,250
and it's obvious that

853
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,090
they're trying to shut my business.

854
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,220
I need to find some officials I know

855
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,180
to talk about this.

856
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,220
I won't have the time to go to the flower window tomorrow.

857
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,540
You,

858
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,820
go meet the guests on my behalf at the flower window.

859
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,820
I'm going to the flower window?

860
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,500
We have already weeded out

861
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,300
most of Yuwen Liangshi's Secret Services

862
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,700
stationed in the Imperial Capital.

863
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,500
Tell our men not to slack off,

864
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,460
and don't miss any loophole.

865
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:15,940
Yes.

866
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,180
Godfather,

867
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,940
there's something I'd like to report today too.

868
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,220
Without Her Highness here,

869
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,660
it seems to be quieter at night.

870
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,100
I'm not too used to it.

871
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,300
By the way,

872
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,700
when I was at Dream House today,

873
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,780
Her Highness asked me to

874
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,580
pass a message for you.

875
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,620
She said Young Prince has nothing

876
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,820
to do with your plan,

877
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,460
so you can just let him be.

878
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,820
She's been trying so hard

879
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,020
to get close to Young Prince

880
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,140
to find out the truth for me.

881
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,740
I asked Tong Yun about it,

882
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,980
that's exactly it.

883
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,820
Why is she worried about me?

884
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,740
Her Highness is so loyal.

885
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,980
For your sake,

886
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,380
she's already tortured Young Prince

887
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,620
so much.

888
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,060
Here you are, still angry with her.

889
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,420
You're so petty.

890
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,530
Go to the Dream House tomorrow.

891
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,020
Tell her this is what I said,

892
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,500
and ask her to come back.

893
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,940
Yes.

894
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,420
Flowers for sale!

895
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,060
Sir, buy a flower.

896
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,460
My flower is blessed.

897
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,810
It will be chosen by Ms. Meng.

898
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,100
Okay, I'll take all these flowers.

899
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,460
Here.

900
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,940
Take the money

901
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,300
to buy new clothes.

902
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,730
Thank you.

903
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,580
You are such a good person.

904
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,260
Aren't you Eunuch Cao?

905
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,940
Why did you buy so many flowers?

906
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,290
No.

907
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,300
I just...

908
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,340
Are you throwing flowers into the flower window too?

909
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,460
No.

910
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,740
I just...

911
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,100
Can eunuchs go to brothels too?

912
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,380
Great!

913
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,500
Wonderful!

914
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:25,940
My lady!

915
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,170
Make a turn!

916
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:33,820
Bravo!

917
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:39,900
Bravo!

918
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,950
[Of Pearls and Jade]

919
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,630
[Of Pearls and Jade]

920
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,900
Bravo!

921
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,700
Bravo!

922
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:55,330
-Great!
-Bravo!

923
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,300
Gentlemen, time to toss your flowers.

924
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,220
-Good!
-Great!

925
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,060
You have so many flowers,

926
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,100
toss them quickly!

927
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,460
I...

928
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,980
You keep these flowers.

929
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,290
For what?

930
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,340
It matches

931
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,490
what you're wearing today.

932
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,580
I'm going to see Her Highness.

933
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,060
Didn't you just see her?

934
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,660
Just now?

935
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,300
That was Her Highness?
