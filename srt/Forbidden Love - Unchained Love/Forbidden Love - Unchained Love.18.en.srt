Godfather, Her Highness is fine.

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,140
What are you worried about?

6
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,940
Yuwen Liangshi has noticed

7
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,620
that I treat Bu Yinlou differently.

8
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,180
What you reminded me of earlier

9
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,780
is right.

10
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,780
Just because we are far from the Imperial City,

11
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,460
I became greedy

12
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,060
and reckless.

13
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,900
I almost caused her harm.

14
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,540
Godfather,

15
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,140
you and Her Highness

16

How about

18
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,340
let's just end it here?

19
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,380
That Bu Yinlou has always

20
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,540
been a smart alec since she was a kid.

21
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,620
Even my father

22
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,860
was fooled by her.

23
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,580

the relationship between her and Xiao Duo...

27
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,860
Don't you think you were embarrassing enough?

28
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,460
I was careless

29
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,540
and believed your nonsense.

30
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,860
Xiao Duo is so powerful

31
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,460
and there are so many beauties

32
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,740

your ridiculous sister?

35
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,780
Maybe...

36
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,740
Maybe he has a unique taste.

Surely

51
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,140
he has a weak point somewhere.

52
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,460
Yes.

53

59

to play the zither for you today.

60
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,100

73

Rong'an is still quite useful.

74
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,140
I was just worried there wasn't anyone

There's no point chasing him.

192

You should have some backbone.

193
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,820
Then tell me,

194
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,140
why is he avoiding me?

195
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,980
It doesn't make sense.

What do you mean?

197

Maybe he was just playing with you.

Clear out a room to hide her in

223

and ask a doctor to come take a look.

The doctor has checked. She's fine.

She said that in the past few years,

she had been living a tough life

234
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,220
so her body's weak.

235
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,370
She got too emotional

236
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,940

I’ve investigated it.

Her name is Qiu Yuebai.

240
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,220
She used to be a palace maid.

There was no trace of her after that.

it's indeed strange

and they were lovers.

Maybe it's her.

Please go back to your room.

Your Highness.

369
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,660
Why are you here?

370
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,580
What are you doing here?

371
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,980
Well,

372
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,700
there are so many stars tonight.

00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,500

Yes.

375
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,220
Your Highness, your room is over there.

376
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,140
Let me send you back.

377
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,180
Rest early.

378
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,620
Someone is inside.

379
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,500
No, no.

380
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,180
Move!

381
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,930
It's really empty.

382
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:42,820
No one is here.

383
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:43,820
Move!

384
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,900
Your Highness.

385
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,460
You are...

386
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,340
Cao Chun'ang.

387
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,380
Are you hiding a woman?

388
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,580
No, it's not...

389
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,820
It's me.

390
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,060
What happened?

391
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,340
Duo.

392
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,180
Miss Yuebai, right?

393
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,100
For our Chief Xiao

394
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,490
to meet an old friend,

395
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,860
is a happy occasion.

396
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,180
Go back to your room first,

397
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,900
I'll find you after I'm done.

398
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
It's no problem.

399
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,740
It's more important

400
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,220
for Chief Xiao to catch up with Miss Yuebai.

401
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,330
I have

402
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,180
nothing much to do anyway.

403
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,580
I'll go to bed

404
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,940
after washing up.

405
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,820
There's no need for Chief Xiao to come.

406
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,100
Duo, Yuebai.

407
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,260
What matching names!

408
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,940
Her Highness didn't even do anything,

409
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,490
Why do I feel

410
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,100
she's scarier

411
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,860
than the tortures in the imperial prison?

412
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,860
Godfather.

413
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:54,900
What are you going to do

414
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,140
about Miss Yuebai?

415
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,100
Let's ask first.

416
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,180
Playboy. Philanderer.

417
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,290
No wonder he's been cold to me these days.

418
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,420
Turns out he's brought his old lover here!

419
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,780
He's a man.

420
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,620
It's inevitable that he's fickle.

421
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,140
Although Chief Xiao

422
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,260
is not a complete man,

423
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,980
but they are all the same deep down.

424
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,340
Take it easy.

425
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,420
Why?

426
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,420
Bastard!

427
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
He wishes!

428
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,460
Eunuch Ba,

429
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,980
you will be a dog without a father from now on.

430
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,940
Let's just live a carefree life.

431
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,180
Tongyun,

432
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,660
if he dares to come again,

433
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,500
just say I don't want to see him.

434
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,140
Forget it.

435
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,820
I'd better not stay here

436
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,660
and be an eyesore.

437
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,740
I'm going back to the capital.

438
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,620
Let him and Qiu Yuebai

439
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,900
live their blissful life.

440
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,540
Why do I have to go back to the capital?

441
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,460
I've won so much dowry

442
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,700
from Bu Yin'ge,

443
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,980
and those dozen boxes of

444
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,900
valuable things.

445
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,660
It's better to find a place

446
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,860
where no one knows me,

447
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,900
and live a carefree life

448
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,060
far far away with that money.

449
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,170
How are you going to live that carefree life?

450
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,260
He's not the only player here.

451
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,020
Who doesn't know how to play?

452
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,300
Your Ladyship,

453
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,380
let me sing a song for you.

454
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,220
Your Ladyship,

455
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,540
let me massage your shoulders.

456
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,260
You the one who said

457
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,290
we will be together forver.

458
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,420
Now you've replaced me with new people.

459
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,500
Y-you hate me now.

460
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,820
Have you forgotten

461
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,100
our affection in the past?

462
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,860
Enough.

463
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,060
Take it easy.

464
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,340
Just tolerate what you can.

465
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,100
If you can't,

466
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,900
then just pack up.

467
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,540
Get out!

468
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,210
This is domestic abuse!

469
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,380
Fan me harder.

470
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,580
I can't live like this!

471
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,700
That's not bad.

472
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,660
Stop thinking about these stupid ideas.

473
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,100
You want to leave,

474
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,740
will Chief Xiao let you leave?

475
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,260
Don’t you remember he said

476
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,540
he brought you along

477
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,860
under the command of the emperor?

478
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,100
If you run away,

479
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,460
he will be implicated.

480
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,860
He treated me like this.

481
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,300
Why would I still care about him?

482
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,460
You're right.

483
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,460
In my opinion,

484
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,620
Chief Xiao is blind.

485
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,500
That Qiu Yuebai

486
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,780
is nothing compared to our mistress.

487
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,380
Of course.

488
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,340
But

489
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,860
Chief Xiao's

490
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,220
attitude is clear.

491
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,460
He wants to break up cleanly with you.

492
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,780
In my opinion,

493
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,220
it's a good thing...

494
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,180
I should be the one who breaks up with him!

495
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:18,980
How dare he

496
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,620
do it without thinking?

497
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,060
Qiu Yuebai is nothing.

498
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,740
I have to ask him.

499
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,420
Let's go!

500
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,020
How many years haven't we met?

501
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,540
Six years.

502
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,060
I remember it clearly.

503
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,500
When I was kicked out of the palace,

504
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,660
I was only 15 years old.

505
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,220
I have no family outside the palace.

506
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,780
I couldn't find any place to stay.

507
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,900
You said you would put me up.

508
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,290
You asked me to wait for you at the west of the city

509
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
on the seventh of the sixth month.

510
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,500
You said you would come.

511
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,500
When the time came,

512
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,020
I waited and waited,

513
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,260
day after day.

514
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,380
Even after my tears have dried up,

515
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,660
you still haven't come.

516
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,460
Why didn't you come to me after that?

517
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,820
I—

518
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,420
I waited until it was dark that day.

519
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,020
I was kidnapped by human traffickers

520
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,700
and sold to Hedong.

521
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,100
Over these years,

522
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,940
I've been wandering around

523
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,460
many places.

524
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,820
Talking about it now

525
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,020
brings back only painful memories.

526
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,780
Duo,

527
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,780
after all these years,

528
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,660
I just want to ask you one thing.

529
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,340
Why didn't you come that day?

530
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,900
Something happened suddenly

531
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,690
and I was late.

532
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,900
A few days ago,

533
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,500
I begged my the way back to the capital.

534
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,460
It was then that I heard my Duo

535
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,140
has became a high official.

536
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,780
So I came to West Shu.

537
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,220
Why didn't you look for me?

538
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,420
Did you forget me?

539
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,580
How did you know I was in West Shu?

540
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,460
I...

541
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,100
I heard it from someone.

542
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,300
You said you begged your way

543
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,580
back to the capital.

544
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,500
But this outfit

545
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,540
doesn't look like it.

546
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,060
The fabric of your clothes

547
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,540
is a new product from a quality store in the capital, right?

548
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,860
Jinguan City is far from the capital.

549
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,490
Where did you get the money for travelling?

550
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,300
Someone sent you here?

551
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,460
Who is it?

552
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,380
Did they ask you

553
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,220
about my past?

554
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,300
Duo.

555
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,700
Are you

556
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,820
unhappy that I came to look for you?

557
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,770
From now on,

558
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,450
don't go out to see anyone from outside anymore.

559
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,860
I'll send someone

560
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,940
to take care of your necessities.

561
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,380
Without my permission,

562
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,020
you're not allowed to leave this house.

563
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,180
Duo.

564
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,380
Don't go.

565
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,500
I heard you're looking for me

566
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,860
to register the reward

567
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,340
the capital sent to the Prince of Nanyuan's residence.

568
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,900
I was about to talk to you about it.

569
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,770
Shall we?

570
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:12,180
[Doing as One Pleases]

571
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,100
Let go!

572
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,100
Let go!

573
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,300
Does it hurt?

574
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,340
None of your business.

575
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,020
Don't get close to Qiu Yuebai anymore.

576
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,820
All I did was

577
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,940
show up in front of her

578
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,460
and you're already worried about her.

579
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,420
Who do you think you are?

580
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,300
No one cares!

581
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:37,860
Godfather.

582
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,940
Miss Yuebai is crying in her room.

583
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,300
Do you want to

584
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,500
go take a look?

585
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,620
Go take a look. Hurry up.

586
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,380
Do you still want to take a look?

587
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,260
Let her cry.

588
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,540
It seems like this reunion

589
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,100
is not that happy.

590
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,420
Tongyun, come in.

591
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,140
Your godfather is a bastard.

592
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,060
You're no good either.

593
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:25,800
[Doing as One Pleases]

594
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,900
It's none of my business.

595
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,860
This...

596
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,260
Godfather.

597
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,900
Are you alright?

598
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,540
Qiu Yuebai is hiding something.

599
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,540
I think someone

600
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,780
sent her to me on purpose.

601
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,860
Could someone be suspicious

602
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,140
of your identity,

603
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,700
and is using her to probe you?

604
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,100
Not necessarily.

605
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,660
If they were already suspicious,

606
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,180
I'm afraid I won't be

607
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,620
standing here right now.

608
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,000
Send some men to check out

609
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:54,820
who she has met

610
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,420
along the way.

611
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,180
I want to see

612
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,860
who is behind this.

613
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,740
Yes.

614
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,660
But Qiu Yuebai is a hidden danger.

615
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,220
If she finds out that you're not Second Master,

616
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,380
it will be a big problem.

617
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,620
Do you want to...

618
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,750
No.

619
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,090
Just confine her.

620
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,540
She is Duo's woman.

621
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,340
She is the only person

622
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,130
who was sincere towards him in the palace.

623
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,100
No matter how dangerous she is,

624
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,740
I can't kill her.

625
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,020
But Her Highness doesn't know

626
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,340
the reason behind this.

627
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,540
I think Her Highness

628
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,690
was really angry just now.

629
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,780
When a woman gets angry,

630
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,260
it's dangerous.

631
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,940
This matter involves too much.

632
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,980
We can't let her get involved.

633
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,460
Tell our men

634
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,580
to keep an eye on Qiu Yuebai.

635

Don't let anyone near her.

Yes.

638
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,140
Mistress,

639
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,580
eat something.

640
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,340
It won't interfere with you losing your temper.

641
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,420
I'm not eating.

642
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,580
I'm so angry, it's killed my appetite.

643
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,780
Why should I eat?

644
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,020
He even sent someone

645
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,700
to guard Qiu Yuebai's room.

646
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,740
Who is he guarding her from?

647
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,380
Shameless vixen.

648
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,420
Yes.

649

Qiu Yuebai

650
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,380
is obviously

651
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,740
a shameless vixen.

652
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,780
Xiao Duo.

653
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,740
I was talking about Xiao Duo.

654
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,940
Xiao Duo is a vixen.

655
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,700
I quit. I'm breaking it off.

656
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,100
I'll set him free to philander around.

657
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,940
Even if he comes to cajole me,

658
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:34,740
it won't work.

659
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,580
It won't work even if he kneels down to beg.

660
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,740
I don't want to be fooled by him.

661
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,540
Mistress, you finally figured it out.

662
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,420
Why hasn't he come to cajole me?

663
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,060
Godfather,

664
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,820
go in if you want to.

665
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,780
If not, go back and rest.

666
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,219
What's the point of

667
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,380
hanging around here?

668
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,540
I heard she was angry

669
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,350
and didn't eat well.

670
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,460
So what should I say

671
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,900
when I go in?

672
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,659
Actually,

673
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,460
it's not such a bad thing

674
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,540
to you and Her Highness

675
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,690
that Qiu Yuebai showed up.

676
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,620
Why don't we let Her Highness

677
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,420
go on misunderstanding you,

678
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,100
and let her give up on you?

679
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,620
It's better for her to feel sad for a while

680
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,500
than for her to waste a lifetime.

681
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,620
Tell her you sent it

682
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,020
and ask her to eat well.

683
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,140
He's really not coming?

684
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,540
I can't be cajoled.

685
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,500
He's not going to be able to cajole me ever again.

686
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,700
Has she eaten?

687
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,620
Are you still thinking about

688
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,300
whether Her Highness has eaten?

689
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,050
Miss Yuebai fainted again.

690
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,660
Get her a doctor.

691
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,820
I did.

692
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,540
The doctor has seen her,

693
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,900
but she refuses to take medicine.

694
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,860
She's making a fuss, saying she wants to see you.

695
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,580
Since she's a troublemaker,

696
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,060
let her wait.

697
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,820
Where is Ah Duo?

698
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,660
Godfather is busy today.

699
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,140
He asked me to talk some sense into you.

700
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,820
If you don't feel well,

701
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,620
you should listen to the doctor

702
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,140
and take your medicine.

703
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,180
Is he with Her Highness?

704
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,380
Miss Yuebai,

705
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,220
you shouldn't ask

706
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,020
what you shouldn't ask.

707
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,340
Duo,

708
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,660
has your heart really changed?

709
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,580
What about me?

710
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,660
What should I do?

711
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,820
How is Qiu Yuebai doing?

712
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,140
She has been sent to Xiao Duo.

713
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,060
But according to our spies,

714
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,170
Xiao Duo has been

715
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,420
treating her rather coldly.

716
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,420
He's only keeping her in the residence.

717
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,260
Your Highness.

718
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,180
Can such a woman

719
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,700
really be of help?

720
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,260
Xiao Duo

721
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,900
is such a powerful character.

722
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,660
How could he still have eyes for his old lover

723
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,260
from when he was down and out?

724
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,340
It's fine if he neglects her.

725
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,740
When a woman is desperate,

726
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,100
she will do anything.

727
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,260
Rongbao,

728
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,380
ask her to find a chance

729
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,260
to put this

730
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,580
into Xiao Duo's food.

731
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,700
Your Highness.

732
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,180
What is this?

733
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,340
Snow mugwort.

734
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,620
Fatal when ingested.

735
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,260
Your Highness.

736
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,460
If Xiao Duo dies in West Shu,

737
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,180
the capital will hold us responsible.

738
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,900
The Emperor

739
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,500
might take the opportunity to send troops.

740
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,740
How could Xiao Duo die in West Shu?

741
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,500
By the time his body

742
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,380
is found,

743
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,220
it must be in the cold river, on its way to the capital,

744
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,460
well outside of West Shu territory.

745
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,580
Because

746
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,620
his ship crashed into a reef,

747
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,140
it was destroyed and he was killed.

748
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,700
Not a single person was left alive.

749
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,980
Your Highness is wise.

750
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,420
Qiu Yuebai is sick?

751
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:31,380
Yes.

752
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,300
I happened to see when I walked past.

753
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,540
When the wind blew,

754
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,540
she fell to the ground

755
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,450
like a leaf.

756
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,540
Don’t expect Chief Xiao

757
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,380
to come here.

758
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,660
He must be in her room now.

759
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,300
Maybe he's cajoling her right now.

760
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,140
How dare he!

761
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,780
Chief Xiao sent someone to watch over her.

762
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,420
He said

763
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,980
no one is allowed to see Qiu Yuebai.

764
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,340
Don't do this.

765
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,940
I'm scared.

766
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,780
Bad news.

767
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,340
My mistress wants to cook spicy chicken

768
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,420
for Chief Xiao.

769
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,540
That chicken didn't cooperate,

770
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,860
so they're fighting now.

771
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,780
Her Highness is fighting with a chicken?

772
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,100
It's just a chicken.

773
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,020
I'll do it.

774
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,460
Take a look.

775
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,460
What are you waiting for? Go help.

776
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,940
Your Highness, please forgive me.

777
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,140
I've been wanting to pay you a visit.

778
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,700
It's just that

779
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,500
Duo is worried for my health,

780
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,460
and wouldn't let me.

781
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,580
He has always been like this.

782
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,380
Whenever it involves me,

783
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,700
he is extra cautious,

784
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,220
and wouldn't take no for an answer.

785
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,460
But the rules are the rules.

786
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,020
How can he be so willful?

787
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,900
Please be magnanimous.

788
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,540
Don't blame him.

789
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,100
If you're tired,

790
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,980
you can stand up yourself.

791
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,860
Are you waiting for me to help you?

792
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,020
I know you don't like me.

793
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,700
It's all my fault.

794
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,020
It has nothing to do with Duo.

795
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,660
If you are angry, come at me.

796
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,340
You applied powder well.

797
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,780
It's hiding the rosiness of your skin perfectly.

798
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,140
You do look ill,

799
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,740
yet you exude a beauty like Xi Shi's.

800
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,020
Unfortunately,

801
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,500
Xiao Duo doesn’t buy it.

802
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,580
He hasn't been here,

803
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:08,900
right?

804
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,260
What are you talking about?

805
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,620
I don't understand.

806
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,100
Was this woman

807
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,780
really Xiao Duo’s lover?

808
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,820
Xiao Duo

809
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:21,900
doesn't treat her

810
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,140
like she's his old flame.

811
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,940
But why didn't he deny it?

812
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,740
You are his brother?

813
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,140
He's lucky now.

814
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,700
You're rich and powerful,

815
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,420
you can buy him

816
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,780
as many lanterns as he wants.

817
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,860
Where is he?

818
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:40,700
Why don't you ask him

819
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,900
to come out and have fun too?

820
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:44,940
He's dead.

821
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,740
Two brothers.

822
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,140
Which one of them died?

823
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,060
Is Xiao Duo really Xiao Duo?

824
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,060
Switch a tactic,

825
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,340
and try harder.

826
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,180
I’m leaving.

827
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,740
Qilang, where are they?

828
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,140
Your Highness, no!

829
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,580
I was wrong, Your Highness.

830
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,100
This is...

831
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,540
If you do this,

832
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,900
I won't hesitate either.

833
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:27,660
I hit her.

834
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,740
Are you okay?

835
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,420
I didn't get hit,

836
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,580
of course I'm okay.

837
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,860
I'm just being jealous.

838
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:41,980
I'm doing great.

839
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,210
Chief Xiao,

840
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,300
if you’re hiding something from me,

841
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,100
you'd better come clean now.

842
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,340
If you do it too late,

843
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,260
I might not want to listen anymore.

844
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,780
I'll tell you in the future.

845
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,940
Don't bother.

846
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,020
Duo.

847
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,540
Her Highness didn't mean it.

848
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,460
Qiu Yuebai.

849
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,640
Listen carefully.

850
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,660
If you behave yourself,

851
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,460
I'll protect you for the rest of your life.

852
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,340
But if you dare

853
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,380
play tricks on Her Highness again,

854
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,500
I won't show mercy.

855
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,860
Do you understand?

856
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,780
It's just killing a chicken.

857
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,020
Why are you two here?

858
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,220
Too many cooks spoil-

859
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,260
Chief Xiao.

860
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,980
Keep an eye on her.

861
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,140
If she dares to make trouble again,

862
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,100
make her mute.
