[Episode 6]

4
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,780
Chief Xiao,

5
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,420
what brings you here?

6
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,940
Lanterns should be hung in the south, not the north.

7
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,050
Or it'll spoil the fengshui.

8
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,340
I'll hang it over there then.

9
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,720
Lanterns come better in pairs, not as one.

10
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,610
Or it'll spoil the fengshui.

11
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,620
Why is it spoiling the fengshui again?

12
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,740
This lantern doesn't go well with fengshui.

13
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,150
Well...

14
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,050
I'll put it in my room.

15
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,420
Why are you here?

16
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,770
Anything else?

17
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,050
Many people in the palace

18
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,140
are transgressing the rules

19
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,620
by modifying the furnishings in the palaces.

20
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,500
It's against the rules.

21
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,140
I'm here to investigate.

22
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,380
This lantern isn't of a type approved by palace regulations.

23
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,390
It must be confiscated.

24
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,250
Your Zhaoding Bureau is in charge of this too?

25
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,760
It's not a big deal.

26
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,940
Can't you just

27
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,740
gloss over it?

28
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,840
You really cherish this lantern.

29
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,980
It's from His Majesty,

30
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,090
I can't not cherish it.

31
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:34,140
It seems that Your Highness has become much more intimate

32
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,350
with His Majesty.

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,750
Somewhat.

34
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,310
I teased him a while ago,

35
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,160
so I'm not angry anymore.

36
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,510
I also thought it's not good to

37
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,320
give him the cold shoulder forever.

38
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,460
Actually, he's quite nice.

39
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,170
He's easy to talk to.

40
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,829
The newly selected Ladies

41
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,880
will enter the palace soon.

42
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,300
What a sight it must be,

43
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,770
to see beauties fighting for attention.

44
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,370
The Inner Court

45
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,340
has never been short of beauties.

46
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,190
That's great!

47
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,370
It's lively with more people around.

48
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,050
If I see a pretty one

49
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:05,800
during mealtimes,

50
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,400
I can even down half a bowl more rice.

51
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,430
If you want to win His Majesty's favor,

52
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,660
I'm willing to help you.

53
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,430
Why are you still thinking about this?

54
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,529
Can't we put it behind us?

55
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,540
Don't think about me

56
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,010
when it comes to ambitious things.

57
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,180
I can't do it.

58
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,180
You've been getting close

59
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:27,890
to His Majesty.

60
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,070
Turns out it was me

61
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,950
who misunderstood.

62
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,000
Then-

63
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,480
I-

64
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,159
I don't mean it that way.

65
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,800
I just wanted to make a new friend,

66
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:37,930
make another useful connection.

67
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,620
You want other connections?

68
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:43,560
No.

69
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,200
No, no.

70
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,790
You're the only connection

71
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,890
I have.

72
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,930
Others

73
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:49,900
are outsiders.

74
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,830
I don't know them.

75
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,380
I only know you.

76
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,840
Chief Xiao,

77
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,280
can you

78
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,830
not send me

79
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,010
to His Majesty?

80
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,440
I can't control

81
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,830
what's on His Majesty's mind.

82
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,350
Please listen to my reasoning.

83
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,450
The late Emperor's concubines

84
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,370
all went to the Imperial Mausoleum.

85
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,380
I'm the only one left

86
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,730
in the palace.

87
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,950
His Majesty comes to me

88
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,750
once in a few days.

89
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,970
Is this appropriate?

90
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,940
If word gets out, it'll look bad.

91
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,340
His Majesty ascended the throne not long ago.

92
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,070
Has he secured his position?

93
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,080
Seducing his sister-in-law

94
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,550
would make for scandalous news.

95
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,110
If word gets out,

96
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,659
it will be bad for you too.

97
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,450
Your Highness, are you

98
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,750
threatening me again?

99
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,610
What are you talking about?

100
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,760
No matter where I am, I will always

101
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,270
have your interests at heart.

102
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,740
I'm not doing this for myself.

103
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,710
It's all for you.

104
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,560
Let me consider your interests too.

105
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,990
Consider what?

106
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,210
It's already settled.

107
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,180
The lantern still has to be confiscated.

108
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,490
Why are you taking it away?

109
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,710
Where are the connections

110
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,140
you promised?

111
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,910
What's their use?

112
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,320
Anthology of a Thousand Zen

113
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,909
♫ The faraway mountains have been undisturbed for a thousand years ♫

♫ Snow falls and hair grays overnight ♫

115
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,590
Godfather, did you ask for me?

116
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,690
Has anyone in the palace

117
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,870
been spreading rumors about Consort Dowager Duan?

118
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,480
Consort Dowager Duan staying behind in the palace

119
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,170
has indeed created some rumors.

120
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,440
Some of them even came from

121
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,320
Chengyuan Palace.

122
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,450
There's something I need you to do.

123
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,930
How is it going?

124
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,870
His Majesty is benevolent.

125
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,550
Everyone in Chengyuan Palace

126
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,320
has been pardoned.

127
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,000
Everyone in the palace, and everyone outside,

128
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,770
are praising you for being a benevolent Emperor.

129
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:47,390
But when I went to announce the decree,

130
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,870
I ran into Eunuch Cao from Zhaoding Bureau.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,010
He insisted on taking some maids away,

132
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,280
saying Chief Xiao wanted to interrogate them personally.

133
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:57,380
No.

134
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,110
I just promised Yinlou

135
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,370
I would pardon the servants of Chengyuan Palace.

136
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,000
H- How could he

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,890
take them away?

138
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,310
Hurry up and command Chief Xiao-

139
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,160
No.

140
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,720
Ask Chief Xiao to come to Shangqiong Palace.

141
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,980
Yes.

142
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,860
Greetings, Your Majesty.

143
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,080
Please rise.

144
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,430
Chief Xiao, you…

145
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,610
I came in with bloodstains

146
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,620
and offended Your Majesty.

147
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,630
Please punish me.

148
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,440
What heinous crime

149
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,120
did the servants of Chengyuan Palace commit,

150
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,560
that you had to deal with them personally?

151
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,290
It is not worth insulting Your Majesty's ears

152
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,140
with the mindless gossip of the servants.

153
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,990
J- Just say it.

154
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,040
Go ahead.

155
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,000
These servants

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,180
made up stories about Your Majesty

157
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,530
seducing your sister-in-law,

158
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,460
and transgressing the boundaries of morality.

159
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,740
Those...

160
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,090
Those bastards!

161
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,680
How dare-

162
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,620
How dare they insult Yinlou?

163
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,210
Forgive me for saying this,

164
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,440
but the late Emperor has just passed.

165
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,910
Your frequent visits to Xiecui Garden

166
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,380
have already created rumors in the palace.

167
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:33,980
In my opinion,

168
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,120
it'll better to keep your distance from Her Highness,

169
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,510
so as to avoid fueling the rumors.

170
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,440
But...

171
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,290
Your Majesty.

172
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,470
If someone is talking out of turn,

173
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,770
just punish them.

174
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,500
You are the Emperor.

175
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,880
When the Emperor likes someone,

176
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:48,850
does he really

177
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,740
need permission from others?

178
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,900
Your Majesty.

179
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,450
Don't follow me.

[Abyss Clear and Jade Clean]

181
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,210
Greetings, Your Majesty.

182
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:41,640
Where is His Majesty?

183
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,540
Yinlou?

184
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:52,980
No matter what they say about you

185
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,950
or what they say about me,

186
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,550
don't worry.

187
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,610
I want you to be my consort.

188
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,580
Don't worry about

189
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:01,760
your status as Consort Dowager.

190
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,310
I'm the Emperor now.

191
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,150
I will take care of it.

192
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,500
As long as-

193
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,760
As long as we can be together,

194
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,570
we don't have to care

195
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,540
about anything.

196
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,130
Your Majesty.

197
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,730
You saved me from sacrificing

198
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,830
in the Pagoda,

199
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,550
so I will always be grateful to you.

But...

201
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't want to.

202
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,980
You don't want to?

203
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,010
Why?

204
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,730
Am I not good enough

205
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,280
or-

206
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,670
Yinlou, what do you want?

207
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,310
I can give you anything you want.

208
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:43,970
I want to be

209
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,970
a free person.

210
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,530
You can't give that to me.

211
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,720
I can't?

212

Yinlou

213
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,450
I'm no longer that kid

214
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,420
who was afraid of the dark.

215
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,930
I'm the Emperor now.

216
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,840
Look at me.

217

I'm the Emperor now.

218
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,140
As long as we are together,

219
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,720
you can have

220
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,070
whatever you want.

221
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,160
How-

222

How could you not be free?

223
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,400
To be able to refuse something I don't want to do

224
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,420
is true freedom.

225
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,390
I don't want

226
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,570

have gone to watch over the Imperial Mausoleum.

229
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,620
It's inappropriate for me to stay here.

230
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:20,930
I should go too.

231
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,270
Alright.

What's wrong?

237
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,100
You weren't so angry

238
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,610
when you came.

239

Godfather,

240
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,330
you insisted on escorting Consort Dowager Duan

241
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,180
to the Imperial Mausoleum personally.

242
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,570
Do you have another plan?

243
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,410
What plan?

244
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,890
Don’t hide it from me.

245
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,120
Consort Dowager Duan

246
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,080
isn't useful to you anymore.

247

She knows too many secrets

248

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,820
She's a trouble.

250
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,380
Are you going to

251
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,470
take action halfway,

252
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:46,770
and rid yourself of any future threats?

253
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,190
I got it wrong.

254
00:13:59,290 --> 00:13:59,580
No.

255
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:00,840
If you're not doing that,

256
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,270
why do you look so upset?

257
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,190
Shut up.

258
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,790
Watch your words later.

259
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,050
Don't mention anything about guarding the Mausoleum.

260
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,690
I understand.

261
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,670
Back then,

262
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,970
when the concubines left,

263
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,520
they made such a scene.

264
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,080
They cried and cried,

265
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,090
as if they were going to die.

266
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,050
Those who didn't know

267
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,650
would have thought they were going to be sacrified.

268

Don't worry.

269

This is quite the entourage.

That's right.

I feel unbelievably happy.

286

I'll get someone to send it there.

287

No.

Why are you running?

315
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,450
your sword looks interesting.

316
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,720
There are two swords in one sheath.

317
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,980
What's it called?

318
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,080
"Deng Huo."

319
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,340
It takes the name of Deng Huo Hell,

320

the foremost of the eight Hells.

321
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,910
Hell?

322
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,480
This sword is impressive.

323
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,320
It was bestowed by Emperor Taizu,

324
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,090
and the number one double-sword of Zhaoding Bureau.

325
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,560
According to Buddhist scriptures,

326
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,570
when a sinful person

327
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,040
descends to hell,

328
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,140
he will be tortured to death.

329
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,660
But when the cold wind blows,

330
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,210
he will be resurrected.

331
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,650
Excruciating pain, endlessly repeating.

332
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,210
Dying and resurrecting, and then dying once again.

333
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,930
Dying and resurrecting again, and then dying yet again.

334
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,240
Life and death. Death and life.

335
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,620
Enough. Enough.

336
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,480
How auspicious.

337
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,790
Emperor Taizu

338
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,090
bestowed this knife on me

339
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,320
to warn the people

340
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,500
that the Zhaoding Bureau is precisely that:

341
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,430
a boundless hell.

342
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,230
And servants like me

343
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,330
are hell's evil spirits.

344
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,560
We deserve to be feared, despised,

345
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,610
and shunned.

00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,660
are you unhappy?

350
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:26,880
Actually,

351
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,010
I think

352
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,520
you're wrong.

353
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,240
You are like Deng Huo

354
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,180
in that you appear intimidating.

355
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,730
Your presence in the Hall of Imperial Supremacy

356
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,200
serves as an injunction.

357
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,840
It reminds the officials of the court

358
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,100
that they must not transgress the laws,

359
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,190
nor harm the people.

360
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,000
Someone must keep an eye on them

361
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,010
on behalf of His Majesty.

362
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,730
Only when they comply,

363
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,160
can the Emperor's position

364
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,210
be truly stable.

365
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,440
Then, the people can live in peace.

366
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,260
I

367
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,060
admire you.

368
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,540
Your lies

369
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,470
are getting more and more skilful.

370
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,990
What do you mean?

371
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,330
I'm telling the truth.

372
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,340
As the saying goes, "Tough measures

373
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,140
evidence a benevolent heart."

374
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,820
It's talking precisely about people like you.

375
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,040
If the people misunderstand you,

376
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,510
they are committing an injustice.

377
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,980
In my opinion,

378
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:12,650
besides my mother,

379
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,660
in this world,

380
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,380
you are

381
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,690
the best person.

382
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,000
Do you really think so?

383
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:30,800
Chief Xiao,

384
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,160
you are a wonderful person.

385
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,630
It's your good name that should be known all over the land,

386
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,100
not infamy.

387
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,490
Really?

388
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,600
If you weren't a eunuch,

389
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,870
you could switch professions and enter a brothel instead.

390
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,670
I wonder how many noble ladies

391
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,930
would spend fortunes on you.

392
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,440
You only have to stand there.

393
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,200
You don't have to say anything,

394
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,380
nor do anything,

395
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,590
and you'd be able to earn money.

396
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,360
Your flattery

397
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,580
sounds awkward.

398
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,560
But I like it.

399
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,390
It's getting late.

400
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,230
Let's go.

401
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,230
It's too hard to coax him.

402
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,630
Let's go.

403
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,180
Your Majesty.

404
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:42,870
Your Majesty.

405
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,010
You're the esteemed Emperor,

406
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,980
you must stand up.

407
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,370
Your Majesty.

408
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,230
I don't understand.

409
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,410
You have been waiting for Her Highness

410
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,170
for so many years.

411
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,430
Now,

412
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,110
she's finally by your side.

413
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,120
Why did you let her go?

414
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,270
She said

415
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,410
she wants to be free.

416
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,310
She would rather guard the Mausoleum

417
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,860
than stay with me.

418
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,380
What could I do,

419
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,310
but to let go?

420
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:24,740
Your Majesty.

421
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,380
Which woman

422
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,860
doesn't admire power and yearn for support?

423
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,710
Without protection from the powerful,

424
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,940
how can she be free?

425
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,210
Think about it.

426
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,810
In this Imperial City,

427
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,710
how many people have risked their lives

428
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,190
to stand above all men,

429
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,160
and bask in infinite glory?

430
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,150
The one standing at the top now,

431
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,210
the one who is most powerful, is you.

432
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,480
The entire world belongs to you.

433
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,290
You should get

434
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,010
what you want.

435
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,480
Everyone in the world

436
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,500
should obey your wishes,

437
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,850
including Her Highness.

438
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,510
So,

439
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,690
if I wasn't the Emperor,

440
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,000
she would all the more have rejected me.

441
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,780
And the person who should be Emperor

442
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,740
wasn't me in the first place.

443
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,460
You are the Emperor.

444
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,850
You must be the Emperor.

445
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,160
You became the Emperor

446
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,390
because of Heaven's will.

447
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:31,810
Everything

448
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,330
is Heaven's will?

449
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,270
Yes,

450
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,040
Your Majesty.

451
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,510
Is it Heaven's will?

452
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,050
Heaven's will?

453
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:03,940
[Imperial Mausoleum]

454
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:06,880
Mistress.

455
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,820
I think we've reached.

456
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:18,810
The Imperial Mausoleum

457
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,990
is very close to Fushui Town.

458
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,810
The old Bu's residence is there.

459
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,320
My mother is there too.

460
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:26,910
Mistress.

461
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,930
Do you miss Her Ladyship?

462
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,480
What a pity.

463
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,000
Once you enter the Imperial Mausoleum,

464
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,140
you'll never be able to get out.

465
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,590
Otherwise,

466
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,520
it'll be good to visit Her Ladyship.

467
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,420
It's fine this way too.

468
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,110
Back then, my legitimate mother

469
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,830
threatened me with my mother's illness.

470
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:43,590
She said

471
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,690
as long as I entered the palace on my sister's behalf,

472
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,870
she would hire the best doctors

473
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,680
to let my mother recuperate.

474
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,740
My mother refused,

475
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,050
but I entered the palace without telling her.

476
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,350
If she sees me,

477
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,080
she would be mad at me.

478
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,320
Consort Dowager Duan,

479
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,510
since we have arrived at the Mausoleum,

480
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,110
I shall take my leave.

481
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,710
But I have to remind you

482
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,140
that you've caused

483
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,610
quite some controversy in the palace.

484
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,750
Here,

485
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,590
you'd better keep a low profile.

486
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,370
I'll keep that in mind. Please go ahead.

487
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,370
The...

488
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,680
journey here

489
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,940
took up much of your time.

490
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,410
Don't delay your business.

491
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,030
You can't wait for me to leave?

492
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,210
No.

493
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,930
I’m very reluctant

494
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,400
to part from you, Chief Xiao.

495
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:47,890
That’s great.

496
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,230
In that case,

497
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,790
you will be very happy

498
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,680
when you see me again.

499
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,110
I will...

500
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,430
see you again?

501
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,020
What?

502
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,280
You don't want to?

503
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,080
You keep saying

504
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,550
you want to conspire and collude

505
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,730
together with me.

506
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,930
We even left a seal on it.

507
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,580
Now you want to burn the bridge?

508
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,540
Of course not.

509
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,350
It's just that the situation is not yet stable.

510
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,960
The Zhaoding Bureau must be busy.

511
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,380
Yes, I am busy.

512
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,160
But I'm on orders from His Majesty

513
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,080
to escort you.

514
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,300
Your safety

515
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,730
is very important to me.

516
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,820
Naturally,

517
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,910
I must take good care of you.

518
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:34,670
Chief Xiao,

519
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,520
don’t bother.

520
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,710
Next month, on the 15th day.

521
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,760
Let's meet at this gate at 5 p.m.

522
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,870
Chief Xiao.

523
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,470
Chief Xiao.

524
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,360
You really don't have to.

525
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,360
Mistress.

526
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,290
Why do I feel like

527
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,340
Chief Xiao

528
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,890
is getting closer and closer to you?

529
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,200
What?

530
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,050
Are you surprised that I'm favored?

531
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,560
Extremely surprised.

532
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,140
It's all fake.

533
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,490
He tends to overthink things.

534
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,620
He has

535
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,090
expended much effort on me.

536
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,350
Who knows

537
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,400
how he will torture me in the future.

538
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,000
Godfather.

539
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:22,680
What are you thinking about?

540
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,630
Have you settled things at the Mausoleum?

541
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,730
Yes.

542
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,040
Her Highness' daily necessities

543
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,340
have been arranged for.

544
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,270
As you ordered,

545
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,910
barring any unforeseen circumstances,

546
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,670
no one will know that it was you.

547
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,650
It won't cause Her Highness any trouble either.

548
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,250
Okay, let's go back.

549
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,730
[Hall of Peace]

550
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,080
Yinlou.

551
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,010
Sister Li.

552
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,140
Yinlou.

553
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,290
Let me see.

554
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,800
Are you hurt?

555
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,070
Don't worry. I'm fine.

556
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,570
Look.

557
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,750
My hands are still hands.

558
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,880
My feet are still feet.

559
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,730
I heard that after I left,

560
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,710
you were brought to be sacrified,

561
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,050
but then came back to life.

562
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,080
To think that there really is such a thing as resurrection.

563
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:13,920
Yes.

564
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,680
I'll take it as

565
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,650
I've already gotten familiar

566
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,910
with the way to the afterlife.

567
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,750
The reapers

568
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,960
have seen my face.

569
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,520
If I go there next time,

570
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,320
I'll have someone I know to take care of me.

571
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,380
Go there?

572
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,780
Don't say anything ominous.

573
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,380
It's all good,

574
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,560
as long as you're safe.

575
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,710
I wonder

576
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,520
if it's a good thing or a bad thing

577
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,870
that you're here.

578
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:40,920
Why?

579
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,530
This place is even tougher than Xiecui Garden.

580
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,420
You don't understand.

581
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,360
If you enter the Imperial Mausoleum,

582
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,450
you

583
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,970
are no longer youself.

584
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,660
They used to be

585
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,970
each more competitive than the other.

586
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,070
Now, they don't compete to be the most beautiful,

587
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,750
they don't make trouble either.

588
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,220
They spend the whole day drinking tea and playing mahjong.

589
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,160
Can they still be considered

590
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,330
members of the Inner Court?

591
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,260
It's ridiculous.

592
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,250
How ridiculous.

593
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,480
Look.

594
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,820
Look at how lazy

595
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,460
all of them are.

596
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,600
They need to be motivated.

597
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,600
Motivated?

598
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:36,740
You...

599
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,620
Leave it.

600
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,620
9 Characters. 9 Characters.

601
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:43,670
How can you play this tile?

602
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,530
Let me do it.

603
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,090
Form a pung.

604
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:49,720
Form a pung.

605
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,640
-Here. Pung. -Pung.

606
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,150
This one.

607
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,760
I've never seen

608
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:55,470
the whole Inner Court

609
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,020
so unanimously lazy.

610
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,120
My Mistress has never

611
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,040
been so mainstream.

612
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,130
Wait for me.

613
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,350
This one.

614
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:01,940
Green dragon.

615
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,760
You're really playing this?

616
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,460
South.

617
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,220
Why are you doing this again?

618
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:06,890
Hurry up.

619
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,900
Hurry up.

620
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,620
8 Characters. 8 Characters.

621
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,330
I don't want it.

622
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,630
Wait. Wait.

623
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,180
Kong.

624
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,520
Hurry up.

625
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,400
Hurry up.

626
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,450
Be careful.

627
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,570
Is the standard of mahjong at the Masoleum

628
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,950
so high?

629
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,430
Back in the palace,

630
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,280
I never knew those women

631
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,960
were so good at this.

632
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,790
"One's work is mastered by diligence and ruined by play."

633
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,470
Forget it, Mistress.

634
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,740
You've lost over 80 rounds.

635
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,750
Treat it as a lesson learned.

636
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,920
No way.

637
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,360
I've lost half of my money.

638
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,790
I have to win some back.

639
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:41,920
No.

640
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,100
I'll play two more rounds.

641
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,110
Don't go.

642
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,750
You still want to lose more?

643
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,010
It's almost bedtime.

644
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,100
Let's go in.

645
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,820
If we run into Eunuch Liu,

646
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,790
it will be bad.

647
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,310
Who is Eunuch Liu?

648
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,540
Eunuch Liu

649
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,380
is the Chief Eunuch at the Imperial Mausoleum.

650
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,230
He is in charge of

651
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,530
all the household matters here.

652
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,510
"Every locality has its own deity."

653
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,270
Don't offend him.

654
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,300
But

655
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,780
you also cannot attract too much of his attention.

656
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,250
Beauty Li.

657
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,530
[Head of the Mausoleum, Eunuch Liu]

658
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,590
Eunuch Liu.

659
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,500
This must be

660
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,130
the new Consort Dowager Duan.

661
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,120
It’s late.

662
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,800
Why aren't you going to bed?

663
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,270
We'll go back now.

664
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,060
Wait.

665
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,160
Beauty Li,

666
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,180
I heard you lost a bracelet

667
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,480
a few days ago.

668
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,630
What a coincidence. I found one.

669
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,560
It's in my room.

670
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,820
Why don't you go back with me

671
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,760
and see if it's the one you left behind?

672
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,010
Beauty Li.

673
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,240
Well,

674
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,770
t- thank you then.

675
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,020
Beauty Li,

676
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,250
are you talking about

677
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,800
that vitreous enamel bracelet?

678
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,740
Look at you.

679
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,170
You lent it to me

680
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,140
back in Xiecui Garden.

681
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,860
You only have that one bracelet,

682
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,410
yet you don't take care of it.

683
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,640
I kept it safe.

684
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:29,480
Eunuch Liu.

685
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,400
Go and ask

686
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,410
the others.

687
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,470
The real owner must be really anxious.

688
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,140
Let's go.

689
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:46,910
Sir,

690
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,380
the new Consort Dowager Duan

691
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,600
has no awareness at all.

692
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,320
Why don't you teach her a lesson?

693
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,060
There was a message from the Imperial City,

694
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,140
asking me to take care of her.

695
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,580
The message passed through too many people,

696
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,230
so I'm not sure

Fine.

Nothing.

Thank you for earlier.

Be careful of Eunuch Liu.

Mistress, what do you mean?

707
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:42,930
I'm so confused.

Aren't we looking for the bracelet?

709
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,390
Exactly.

Okay, okay.

All of you must remember

that although you used to live in luxury

This is also your honor.

either turned insane,

I don't understand.

872
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,540
He's just a prisoner.

873
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,720
Why are you

874
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,720
treating him so well?

875
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,880
Although the Prince of Nanyuan returned to West Shu,

876
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,650
he has many secret services

877
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,780
in the capital.

878
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,500
If I don't remove all his spies

879
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,470
from the capital,

880
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,280
every step I take from now

881
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,250
will be exposed to him,

882
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,340
as if I were right under his nose.

883
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:26,770
Well,

884
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,110
what does this

885
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:28,950
have to do with His Highness?

886
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,850
The Yuwen brothers' parents passed away when they were young.

887
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,200
They depended on each other

888
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,710
and are very close.

889
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,270
If we keep Yuwen Liangxu around,

890
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,120
Yuwen Liangshi will definitely

891
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,970
use his spies here to rescue him.

892
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,730
I want to use this

893
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:45,920
to catch them all.

894
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,700
But in this situation,

895
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,170
the Prince of Nanyuan can barely protect

896
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,720
his own influence in the capital.

897
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,280
Will he use his spies

898
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,170
for his brother?

899
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,140
Humans are not made of gold or stone,

900
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,530
they are not impenetrable.

901
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,580
People have feelings, and they have flaws.

902
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,060
But you are also human.

903
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,200
You have no flaws.

904
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,790
You have a head of bronze and arms of iron.

905
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,840
You're invincible.

906
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,910
I'll take my leave.

907
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,880
You just said

908
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,220
he invited

909
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,740
an entertainer.

910
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:21,910
Yes.

911
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,680
But don't worry.

912
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,690
Qilang has been keeping an eye on him.

913
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,040
He didn't see anything unusual.

914
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,360
[Moonlit Staircase of Jade]

915
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,880
[The Prince of Nanyuan's younger brother, Yuwen Liangxu]

916
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:53,790
Stop.

917
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,480
You call this acrobatics?

918
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,030
Especially you,

919
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,000
the one who with the flying daggers.

920
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,260
Come on.

921
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,180
Show me the knife.

922
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:06,770
I understand now.

923
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,780
Your knife is not good.

924
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,750
It's already broken.

925
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,140
Don't think you guys are fine.

926
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:13,820
You guys are no better.

927
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,760
The acrobatics level in the capital

928
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,780
is much worse than the ones in West Shu.

929
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,250
You're all dismissed.

930
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,110
Why are you here?

931
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,000
Since the acrobatics are bad,

932
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,510
you don't have to watch them.

933
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,080
Monkshood root.

934
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,020
It's very poisonous.
