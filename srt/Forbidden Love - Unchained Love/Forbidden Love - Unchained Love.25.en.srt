4
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,880
Are you going to keep following me?

5
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,650
You don't look well today,

6
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,289
I need to see you off.

7
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,450
You should know

8
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,759
you and Consort Duan

9
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,680
need to meet in the middle about what happened today.

10
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,120
You never saw her,

11
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,730
and she never saw you.

12
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,050
No matter which of you

13
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,690
blabbers to my brother,

14
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,570
everyone will be put in a tough spot.

15
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,410
Consort Duan and Xiao Duo are illicitly involved with each other,

16
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,290
but you're helping them.

17
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,170
To think that the Emperor

18
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,450
has a sister like you.

19
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,640
You must be joking.

20
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,850
Look at you,

21
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,079
you went through so much to get out of Tanxi Temple.

22
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,690
Don't get sent back

23
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,090
because you like to joke.

24
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,770
I'll leave you alone now.

25
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,329
Your Majesty.

26
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,650
Consort Duan made a fool of you,

27
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,000
are you really going to let her off?

28
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,200
What else can I do?

29
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,480
If I report this matter

30
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,520
to His Majesty,

31
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,840
I will get myself into trouble.

32
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,800
Your Majesty,

33
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,079
Suhuai knows too much.

34
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,530
If she says something

35
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,930
against you,

36
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,160
the consequences will be dire.

37
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,320
Send her a message.

38
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,730
Tell her that if she keeps her mouth shut,

39
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,090
I will remember her kindness.

40
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,480
I will take care of

41
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,770
her family in the capital.

42
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,370
Yes.

43
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,800
Consort Duan and Xiao Duo are illicitly involved with each other,

44
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,720
but you're helping them.

45
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,760
By the way,

46
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,130
didn't the damned eunuch return to the capital?

47
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,530
You've been locked up here by His Majesty.

48
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,560
Why hasn't he come to help you?

49
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,329
Aren't you two close?

50
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,890
Will you listen to me now?

51
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,040
Greetings, Chief.

52
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:56,860
To think Xiao Duo actually

53
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,480
gave the ring symbolic of his status as Chief

54
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,290
to Yinlou.

55
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,010
Despite His Majesty's suspicions,

56
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,170
he even sent his trusted men

57
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,000
to protect her in secret.

58
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,650
It seems that

59
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,930
there really is some

60
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,680
unusual relationship between them.

61
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,209
Why do you want this?

62
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:18,970
To avoid favor.

63
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,280
I heard a rumor

64
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,570
at Shangqiong Palace

65
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,610
that Consort Duan

66
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,570
has a lover in West Shu.

67
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,320
Consort Duan offended His Majesty

68
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,290
for his sake.

69
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,300
That's why she was sent

70
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,409
to Deer's Reed Residence.

71
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,240
Could Yinlou's lover

72
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:38,760
be Xiao Duo?

73
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,530
She escaped from Deer's Reed Residence

74
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,159
and kidnapped Rong'an?

75
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:47,440
Yes.

76
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,040
Does she want to die?

77
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,409
If she didn't happen to

78
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:51,530
run into you and the Princess,

79
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,570
what would she do?

80
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,250
Fight Rong'an to the death?

81
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:59,159
Why would she she do that?

82
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,290
Godfather.

83
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,560
Godfather.

84
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,570
I went to the Dyeing Workshop

85
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,680
to see Tongyun.

86
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,880
I'm afraid Her Highness is hiding something from you.

87
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,650
I talked to Tongyun for a long time,

88
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,160
but she refused to tell the truth.

89
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,010
You need to see for yourself.

90
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,130
Qilang.

91
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,900
Chief.

92
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,930
Go investigate at the hospital.

93
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,210
Yes.

94
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,840
They're making me dye this big jar every day.

95
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,440
You may leave now.

96
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,290
Tongyun.

97
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,730
W- Why are you here?

98
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,450
I don't know anything.

99
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,800
I know what you're afraid of.

100
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,040
What happened to Bu Yinlou?

101
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,200
Why did she move to Deer's Reed Residence?

102
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,850
H- His Majesty dotes on her,

103
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,040
so—

104
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,760
If she really were favored,

105
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,970
why would you,

106
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,210
her personal maid,

107
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,840
be sent to such a place?

108
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,840
Think carefully.

109
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,170
Bu Yinlou isn't here.

110
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,280
If you get injured or disabled,

111
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,290
no one would dare stand up for you.

112
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,640
Godfather.

113
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,090
Tongyun is timid,

114
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,659
you're scaring her.

115
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,560
I didn't give you permission to speak.

116
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,880
Tongyun,

117
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,560
Godfather is really angry.

118
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,010
Tell him.

119
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:57,640
What do you mean?

120
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,360
My mistress didn't sleep with His Majesty.

121
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,010
She refused to.

122
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,130
That night,

123
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,370
she was going to take poison to disfigure herself.

124
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,440
It's all my fault, I gave us away.

125
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,250
His Majesty punished me

126
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,400
by sending me here.

127
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,120
Later,

128
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,770
Mistress was taken

129
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,280
to Deer's Reed Residence.

130
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,530
Why didn't she get off

131
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,640
that day at Yanguo Mountain?

132
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,530
Aren't you very formidable?

133
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,000
Why didn't you look into it yourself?

134
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,770
His Majesty sent

135
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,330
the palace's best fighter, Yu Zun,

136
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,640
to lead troops and lay in ambush at Yanguo Mountain.

137
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,560
She didn't get off

138
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,890
because she wanted to protect you.

139
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,170
She said

140
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,530
you've always been the one protecting her.

141
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,290
It was her turn to protect you.

142
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,810
Then why did she kidnap Rong'an?

143
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,890
It's all to

144
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,240
find the murderer for you!

145
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,280
I promised him

146
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,810
I will always be behind him

147
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,330
in doing what he wants to do,

148
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,650
and finding the person he wants to find.

149
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,450
I can't do that anymore.

150
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,640
The only thing I can do

151
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,560
is to find the person he wants to find,

152
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,810
and do what he wants to do, for him.

153
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,170
Godfather.

154
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,650
Wipe your tears.

155
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,410
I'm leaving.

156
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,330
Tell the Dyeing Workshop

157
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,800
to take care of Tongyun.

158
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,360
I've made the arrangements,

159
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,490
don’t worry.

160
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,520
Is Qilang still not back from the hospital?

161
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,090
-Go find him. -Chief.

162
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,920
Chief.

163
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,840
Chief.

164
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,170
I've got it. Her Highness is sick.

165
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,090
Sick?

166
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:05,640
Yes.

167
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,010
That doctor

168
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,530
didn't tell His Majesty the truth.

169
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,610
However,

170
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,570
when I interrogated him,

171
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,960
he said it was because

172
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,410
she ate something bad

173
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,370
and hurt her heart and lungs.

174
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,570
Her Highness deliberately

175

Stop it!

The maids at Deer's Reed Residence

neglected you.

196

I won't let anyone off.

they didn't do anything wrong.

he is dead.

352
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,730
Consort Duan

353
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,080
can finally see me now.

354
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,770
It seems to be missing something.

355
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,810
That's right.

356
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,120
That's right.

357
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,640
When the blood splashed on Consort Duan's face just now,

358
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,090
I thought red suited her.

359
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,560
I even told Consort Duan

360
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,920
she must be obedient.

361
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,080
In the Imperial City,

362
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,400
obedience is virtue.

363
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,680
As long as you're obedient,

364
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,450
nothing will go wrong.

365
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,770
You can be safe

366
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,440
for a long time.

367
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,240
Am I right?

368
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,200
Master is right.

369
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,450
Why are you still kneeling?

370
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,170
I was too engrossed in painting.

371
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,130
Rise.

372
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

373
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,570
I

374
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,960
summoned you this late at night

375
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,760
because of what happened during the day.

376
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,360
I was too anxious

377
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,930
and wronged you.

378
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,160
You won't hold it against me, right?

379
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,450
I am honored by Your Majesty's grace.

380
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,840
I could never take it to heart.

381
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,520
Good.

382
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,640
I remember

383
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,080
you and Consort Duan have always been close.

384
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,730
You've helped her a lot.

385
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,690
From now on,

386
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,210
come to Deer's Reed Residence more often

387
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,210
to keep her company.

388
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,440
What do you think?

389
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,970
My apologies.

390
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,210
I'm only a servant,

391
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,360
I dare not overstep.

392
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,530
It's all because of Your Majesty

393
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,090
that Her Highness took notice of me.

394
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,730
I dare not forget

395
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,970
my place.

396
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,280
Really?

397
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,320
Where is your place?

398
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,930
Serving Your Majesty loyally

399
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,120
is my place.

400
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,810
There’s one more thing.

401
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,450
I need you

402
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,840
to give me some advice.

403
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,120
Consort Duan

404
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,840
cannot go on staying

405
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,040
at Deer's Reed Residence.

406
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,330
But since

407
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,970
she became a consort,

408
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,330
those people in the court

409
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,400
have been nagging at me.

410
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Even my mother

411
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,560
is against Consort Duan entering the palace.

412
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,640
Do you have

413
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,960
a good solution?

414
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,520
The Buddha's Birthday is next month.

415
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,970
Everyone in the Inner Court will go to Tanxi Temple

416
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,080
to celebrate his birth.

417
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,360
Her Highness can personally copy Buddhist scriptures

418
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,080
and present them in public,

419
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,320
so as to show her loyalty to the Great Ye

420
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,970
and establish her virtue and benevolence.

421
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,760
Your Majesty can take the chance to summon her back to the palace.

422
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,970
Even if anyone opposes,

423
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,090
they will not dare voice it there.

424
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,400
Good.

425
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,970
Good.

426
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,800
I really need to rely on you

427
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,920
for these matters.

428
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,510
Okay.

429
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,580
I'll leave the preparation for Buddha's Birthday

430
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,560
in your hands.

431
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

432
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,730
Godfather,

433
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,650
don't be like this.

434
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,840
If there's anything,

435
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,720
we can discuss it later.

436
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,160
Discuss?

437
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,920
Search carefully.

438
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,320
Over there.

439
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,520
Over there!

440
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,520
Something's wrong! Come here!

441
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,210
The tragic death of her cousin

442
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,400
made Bu Yinlou understand that

443
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,680
what Murong Gaogoing felt towards her

444
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,370
was not love at all,

445
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,480
but absolute control

446
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,920
and possession.

447
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,980
She was just a toy he played with

448
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,730
at his fancy.

449
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,410
One mistake

450
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,810
and she would fall into a deeper hell.

451
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,450
Bu Yinlou felt a deep terror,

452
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,200
the kind in a dark night

453
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,330
that made her wish she were dead.

454
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,190
[Deer's Reed Residence]

455
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,630
[Dharma is like all]

456
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,650
Your Highness.

457
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,640
The Buddha's Birthday

458
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,290
is His Majesty's

459
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,970
grace to you.

460
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,200
You must

461
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,010
copy these scriptures well.

462
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,770
You already know

463
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,010
what will happen

464
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,360
if you offend His Majesty again.

465
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,560
[Buddha]

466
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,480
Stop being willful.

467
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,800
Your Highness.

468
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,080
Some people

469
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,810
and some things

470
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,490
are in the past.

471
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,760
Let bygones be bygones.

472
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,710
[For what reason? None can be applied. None can be said.]

473
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,090
I've arranged everything

474
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,210
for Buddha's Birthday,

475
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,210
as you have ordered.

476
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,780
But, Godfather—

477
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,690
No buts.

478
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,080
Say no more.

479
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,450
Princess, please wait a moment.

480
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,690
Please allow me to announce your arrival.

481
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,170
Chief,

482
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,450
the Princess barged in.

483
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,520
I couldn't stop her.

484
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,640
You may leave.

485
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,120
Yes.

486
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,640
Your Highness looks angry.

487
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,050
I wonder

488
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,570
how I have offended you.

489
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,130
These cherries are tribute items.

490
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,170
Strictly speaking,

491
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,050
only members of the royal family should receive them.

492
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:15,890
They shouldn’t be

493
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,490
in your hands.

494
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,090
The cherries are sweet,

495
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,600
but they belong to others.

496
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,090
You shouldn't take them.

497
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,730
I think you should understand

498
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,000
what I'm talking about.

499
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,690
I do.

500
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,010
But I like them very much,

501
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,010
I cannot do without them.

502
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,650
That's why I must try.

503
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,850
So it's true between you and Consort Duan?

504
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,690
That's right.

505
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,130
I've admired Her Highness for a long time.

506
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,970
How dare you!

507
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,170
She's a consort,

508
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,250
and my brother's woman.

509
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,090
So what?

510
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,330
He doesn't deserve her.

511
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,640
Xiao Duo,

512
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,570
we've known each other for years.

513
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,490
I appreciate your help,

514
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,640
and I admire your talent and integrity.

515
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,000
I treated you as my friend.

516
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,420
I have never

517
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,570
treated you with disrespect

518
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,760
because of the disparity in our status.

519
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,370
I have also never seen you

520
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,850
as the despicable man you're rumored to be.

521
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,730
I didn't expect you to be so domineering,

522
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,170
and to disregard my brother like this!

523
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,440
I was wrong about you.

524
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,200

all the servants killed

I think it was Consort Duan's cousin.

Apparently,

553
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,130
His Majesty forced Consort Duan

554
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,170
to hold a dagger and kill him.

00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,040
I've sent him away.

700
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,280
He's fine.

701
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,210
We will be fine too.

702
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,330
We won't die.

703
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,000
I don't want you anymore.

704
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,210
I don't want you anymore.

705
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,570
Don't you understand?

706
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,890
Then why are you keeping this?

707
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,520
Why did you

708
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,850
put them together?

709
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,160
I don't want it anymore.

710
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,600
♫ A long night is like yesterday's ♫

711
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:08,960
Are you crazy?

712
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,330
I've been crazy for a long time.

713
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,690
♫ The night breeze scattered into a song ♫

714
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,930
I don't want you

715
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:12,810
to submit to Murong Gaogong.

716
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:13,760
I don't want you

717
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,890
♫ Under the moon ♫

718
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,730
to risk yourself for me.

719
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,700
I don't want you to say

720
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,240
things that you don't mean.

721
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:20,210
♫ What am I sighing about ♫

722
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:16,980
I especially don't want us

723
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,650
to become strangers.

724
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,330
I can stop.

725
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,280
But only if you kill me.

726
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,450
♫ Laughing at the moonlight, it's too lonely ♫

727
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,560
The Imperial City

728
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,050
is surrounded by walls.

729
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:28,070
♫ Laughing at the stories, they're too tumultuous ♫

730
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,570
We can't possibly escape.

731
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,260
♫ What is love ♫

732
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,920
Then I'll tear down the walls!

733
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,480
♫ I still don't understand ♫

734
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,330
You bastard!

735
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,060
♫ The palace is as it was yesterday ♫

736
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,040
Why won't you listen?

737
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,670
♫ Whose soul has it trapped ♫

738
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,290
Fine.

739
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,880
♫ Fate is unpredictable ♫

740
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,850
♫ No one can escape ♫

741
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,700
♫ You are ♫

742
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:54,510
♫ The persistence of my lifetime ♫
