176
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,850
I'd be asking for those criminals' attention.

If that happens,

178
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,250

Being around the Prince, I've learnt some things.

I know Xiao Duo is not a good person.

240

You shouldn't get too close to him.

Don't worry.

00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,360
Say it.

522
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:55,770
Say what?

523
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,440
Father.

524
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,120
I seem to have forgotten something.

525
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:06,920
What is it?

526
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,770
I forgot to take the spicy chicken.

527
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,480
Eunuch Ba.

528
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,600
Dance for me.

529
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,330
Eunuch Ba.

530
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,050
Turn around.

531
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,330
Eunuch Ba.

532
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,650
What are you doing?

533
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,600
I just want to see

534
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,280
how many heads you have

535
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,800
for His Majesty to chop off.

536
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,580
What are you talking about?

537
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,360
Speak nicely.

538
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,130
Stop scaring me.

539
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,920
Let me ask you.

540
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,160
Have you and Chief Xiao

541
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,530
already...

542
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,290
What?

543
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,210
Nothing happened between us.

544
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:54,930
We didn't do anything.

545
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:55,490
Look.

546
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,140
Look at you.

547
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,330
You look so anxious.

548
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,570
It's proving your guilt.

549
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,890
I've seen it with my own eyes.

550
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,970
When you two meet,

551
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,610
your eyes are practically

552
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,760
glued onto each other's.

553
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,340
It's even more atrocious

554
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,280
than when we were apart.

555
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,500
Something must have happened

556
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,690
recently.

557
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,680
You just don't dare admit it.

558
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,400
What am I scared of?

559
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,080
I’ve told you before

560
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,650
that I like Chief Xiao.

561
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,890
You know how His Majesty

562
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,480
feels about you.

563
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,440
Sooner or later, you will have to return to the palace and become a concubine.

564
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,370
His Majesty

565
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,340
is Chief Xiao’s master.

566
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,450
By then, you will become

567
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,650
Chief Xiao's mistress.

568
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,650
It is scandalous for the two of you to have a relationship.

569
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,970
If you are not careful, your reputation will be ruined.

570
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,650
Or worse, you'll lose your head.

571
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,770
I know.

572
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,050
But it hasn't happened yet.

573
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,370
We'll talk about it when it does.

574
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,160
Mistress.

575
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,490
If you really want to

576
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,170
flirt around,

577
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,770
you should at least pick someone intact.

578
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,960
Chief Xiao

579
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,530
is a eunuch after all.

580
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,010
You can't

581
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,690
like him as a man.

582
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,040
Even if he were a cripple,

583
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,560
I would still like him.

584
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,600
What are you talking about?

585
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,850
Why do you

586
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,330
have to be so foolish?

587
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,010
Give it up.

588
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,450
Stop talking.

589
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,160
I'm going to sleep in another room.

590
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:12,880
I-

591
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,650
I haven't finished yet.

592
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,400
I-

593
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,480
I think you really have gone crazy.

594
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:30,850
Who is it?

595
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,560
It's me.

596
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,810
You-

597
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,530
What is it?

598
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,320
I can't sleep.

599
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,000
I came to sleep with you.

600
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,050
You're still smoking mosquitoes this late at night?

601
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,200
This place is remote and close to water.

602
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,640
There are many mosquitoes and bugs here,

603
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,250
I'm afraid you'll get bitten at night.

604
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,480
That's why I said

605
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,690
that as long as you're here,

606
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,370
I feel extra secure.

607
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,960
Let's stay the way we were at Tianfang Water Pavilion,

608
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,170
okay?

609
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,160
Stop it.

610
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,810
I have no bad intentions.

611
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,880
Your bed is wide,

612
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,160
let's lie down together and talk.

613
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,280
Do you

614
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,810
feel hot?

615
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,520
A little.

616
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,090
You probably can't sleep like this.

617
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,850
Back at Tianfang Water Pavilion,

618
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,530
I think I slept on the floor.

619
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,010
You're wearing so much. Of course you feel hot.

620
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,520
It's cold at night.

621
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,920
So you're cold.

622
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,130
Let me warm you up.

623
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,770
You smell so good.

624
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,889
Didn't you say

625
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,850
you would talk with me?

626
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:18,120
Why aren't you saying anything?

627
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,639
What do you want to talk about?

628
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,000
Tell me about

629
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,969
what you would be doing

630
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,360
if you didn't enter the palace.

631
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,090
I've never thought about it.

632
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,400
But I have!

633
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,120
But I have.

634
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,370
I thought about how

635
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,400
if you hadn't entered the palace,

636
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,010
given your age,

637
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,410
you would be married by now.

638
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,880
Maybe

639
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,090
you would even have a child.

640
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,610
With a personality like yours,

641
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,820
you wouldn't obey the commands

642
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,930
of your parents and matchmakers.

643
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,480
You would probably

644
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,860
only marry a girl

645
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,970
that you like.

646
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,600
Well,

647
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,250
what kind of girl do you like?

648
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,770
Is she cool

649
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,200
like Wan Wan,

650
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,160
or elegant

651
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,890
like Sister Meng?

652
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,210
Or...

653
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,250
is she someone like me?

654
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,240
Fine. Stay silent.

655
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,330
♫ The night is nearly falling ♫

656

Last night,

I talked some sense into her.

She was very convinced,
