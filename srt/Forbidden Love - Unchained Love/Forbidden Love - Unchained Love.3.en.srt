00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,100
Let's light the lanterns.

5
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:48,860
Yes.

6
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,420
Tonight, we'll hold the funeral.

7
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,500
For the lighting of lanterns,

8
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,610
we would like to ask for everyone to be alert

9
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,940
to avoid delaying the late emperor's ascension.

10
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,860
After lighting your lanterns,

11
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,980
go back to your palace.

12
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,580
Keep an eye on that lamp.

13
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,940
It cannot go out.

14
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,380
If we have to light it again,

15
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,180
all rituals have to start over,

16
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,220
and we'll waste a few hours.

17
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,300
Understood.

18
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,100
Bring the light.

19
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,940
All concubines, bring the light.

20
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,340
Oh no.

21
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,020
It's only 9 p.m.,

22
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,900
and the ceremony is about to end.

23
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,620
I need to find a way to delay it.

Who is it? Who!

How dare you

38
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,020
burn me with fire?

39
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,060
What are you waiting for?

40
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,060
Get me changed.

Her Majesty, he's missing.

50
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:12,940
What?

51
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,140
He's missing?

52
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,779
Who'd dare to kidnap someone in Fengyi Palace.

53
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,940
This was left behind.

Search!

55
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,860
Even if you have to overturn

56
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,580
the whole Imperial City,

57
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,820

Xiao Duo asked me to stall Her Majesty.

61
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,460
With that, something so major

62
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,659
happened in Fengyi Palace.

64

Judging from the situation,

65
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,180
the person who did it might still be in the palace.

66
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,620
Once he falls into the hands of Her Majesty

67
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,500

161

He doesn't look like

He doesn't look trustworthy at all.

At times like this,

174
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,890
you can take a gamble,

175
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,620
and try to believe

176
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,800
the only card that can help you

177
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,610
turn the tables.

178
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,080
Can I trust you?

179
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,950
I promise Your Highness

180
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,210
I will protect you.

181
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,320
I trust you. I'll go with you.

182
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,200
There's no time to lose.

183
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,170
We have to go now.

184
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,770
Let's go. Why are we still standing around?

185
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,320
Let's go.

186
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,740
Your Majesty.

187
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,790
We haven't searched this place yet.

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,260
Don't show yourself.

189
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:17,870
Take him to hide.

190
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,040
Leave the rest to me.

191
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:20,470
Go.

192
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,040
Your Majesty.

193
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,360
How dare you! Who dares to disturb Her Majesty.

194
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,830
I...

195
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,130
I-I am Bu Yinlou.

196
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,560
Your Highness,

197
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,820
she is Consort Dowager Duan

198
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,330
who recently got promoted.

199
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,700
Why are you here

200
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,720
instead of being at the funeral?

201
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:57,680
I...

202
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,240
I don't know anything.

203
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,340
Where is he?

204
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,690
Tell me the truth.

205
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,540
I don't have much patience.

206
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,770
If you don't want to tell me,

207
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,990
I have plenty of ways

208
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,000
to tear your mouth open.

209
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:12,510
Yilan,

210
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,940
tell her the rules in the palace.

211
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,740
Yes.

212
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,340
I confess.

213
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,810
I confess.

214
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,080
I accidentally

215
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,260
set your dress on fire.

216
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,020
I shouldn't have...

217
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,240
I shouldn't...

218
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,290
I shouldn't have fell asleep.

219
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,930
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

220
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,400
What did you say?

221
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,710
It was you.

222
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,310
I don't have time

223
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,530
to argue with you.

224
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,260
Guards, search!

225
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,560
Your Highness, you...

226
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,610
You're forgiving me?

227
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,090
You are really a good person.

228
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,100
How about

229
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,700
going elsewhere to search?

230
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,670
There's really no one here.

231
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,520
Didn't you hear me?

232
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,200
Search!

233
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,840
No one is here, Your Highness.

234
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,080
I know I'm wrong, Your Highness.

235
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,760
I shouldn't have

236
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,480
playing cards during the mourning period.

237
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,780
I won't do it again.

238
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,140
Empress Rong'an.

239
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,200
The Queen of Phoenix.

240
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,550
Skills, fighting for favor in the harem.

241
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,910
What are you talking about?

242
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,790
How dare you!

243
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,680
How dare you make a Madiao based on Her Highness?

244
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,490
I'm just earning some lose change

245
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,630
with this card.

246
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,770
If I don't come up with new ideas,

247
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,820
the sisters

248
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,290
will go play Madiao elsewhere.

249
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:30,790
I...

250
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,600
I just want to make a living.

251
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,480
Make a living?

252
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,120
What are you talking about?

253
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,670
Is the palace treating you badly?

254
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,790
Your Highness, you have no idea.

255
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,910
When His Majesty

256
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,790
was seriously ill,

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,430
the superintendents have been

258
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,770
giving us less and less allowance.

259
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,990
This month's allowance

260
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,840
is half less than last month's.

261
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,760
Life's

262
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,270
been difficult.

263
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,280
Shut up!

264
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,560
Your Majesty.

265
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,320
No one's here.

266
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,150
Did he go east?

267
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:02,710
Let's go.

268
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,930
Your Highness, how serious

269
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,150
would the sentence be?

270
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,780
Can I get a lighter sentence?

271
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,500
He escaped so fast.

272
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,560
He has no regard for my life at all.

273
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,940
It's all thanks to Consort Dowager Duan

274
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,740
for distracting the Empress.

275
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,660
Otherwise,

276
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,220
I won't be able to escape tonight.

277
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,400
She's dead meat for sure then.

278
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,630
I heard that she lit the Empress's

279
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,350
dress on fire in the mourning hall.

280
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,990
It was quite a scene.

281
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,760
If Her Majesty can't find him,

282
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,610
I think she will be punished.

283
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,510
She's but a delicate girl,

284
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,020
poor her...

285
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,830
Fortunately, it looks like it has nothing to do with you.

286
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,640
If Prince Fu pursues it,

287
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,570
it won't be your fault.

288
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,520
I remember Princess Hede

289
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,200
will be returning to the palace with Empress Dowager tonight.

290
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,540
Have they entered the city?

291
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,310
No.

292
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,340
Let's go to the city gate.

293
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,620
Aren't we going to Prince Fu's Mansion?

294
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,090
Why are we going to the city gate?

295
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,530
To welcome Princess Hede to the palace.

296
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,330
I didn't think we wouldn't be able to find the intruder

297
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,800
after combing the entire palace.

298
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:38,640
Your Highness,

299
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,610
could they have escaped?

300
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,730
I've set up various traps.

301
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,500
He has to bring along a kid too.

302
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,760
Can they have escaped

303
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,060
right under my nose?

304
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,490
Right under my nose?

305
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,560
Where did we lose track of the intruder

306
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,200
when we were searching just now?

307
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,600
Your Highness, it was Xiecui Garden.

308
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:08,790
We must've been deceived

309
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,180
by that girl.

310
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:12,910
To Xiecui Garden!

311
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,410
Yes.

312
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,640
Your Highness.

313
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,070
Let's talk it out.

314
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,500
Let's not get physical.

315
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,010
Shut up!

316
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,870
How dare you lie to me!

317
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,210
You're courting death!

318
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,670
[Princess Hede, Murong Wanwan]

319
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,390
Greetings, Princess Hede.

320
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,170
No wonder it's so lively here.

321
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,440
It's you, sister-in-law.

322
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,330
You are the Imperial Concubine,

323
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,890
how can you act so recklessly.

324
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,150
Even if Empress Dowager dotes on you,

325
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,630
it's still inappropriate.

326
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,350
Please forgive me.

327
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,280
Empress Dowager heard

328
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,580
something serious happened here,

329
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,380
that's why she asked me

330
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,900
pass a message.

331
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,700
I was in a hurry

332
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,170
so I took action.

333
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,400
What decree does Mother have?

334
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,040
It's nothing big.

335
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,180
She just likes to nag.

336
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,320
Empress Dowager said

337
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,870
she's just been studying Buddhism in Tanxi Temple

338
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,340
these few years,

339
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,980
and Imperial City

340
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,490
is all in chaos.

341
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,680
For something as important as a mourning,

342
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,320
we haven't mourned for enough time,

343
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,370
and Shangqiong Palace is already

344
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,800
in shambles.

345
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,780
This is

346
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,420
highly inappropriate.

347
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,440
Please forgive me.

348
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,830
It's not directed to you.

349
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,230
You're in charge of the Imperial Harem and you're busy with official affairs.

350
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,820
Empress Dowager will understand.

351
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,460
But other concubines

352
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,720
are not like you.

353
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,030
Empress Dowager values the ancestral system the most.

354
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,920
She doesn't like lazy people.

355
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,100
So she ordered me

356
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,980
to bring those who don't follow the rules

357
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,710
to Shouhe Palace for a lecture.

358
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,210
You are Consort Dowager Duan?

359
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,390
Come back with me to receive punishment.

360
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,369
The Empress Dowager has been waiting for a while now.

361
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,839
I shan't talk too much to you.

362
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,440
Sister-in-law,

363
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,339
you should go back to Shangyin Palace to mourn.

364
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,190
Don't make Empress Dowager worry.

365
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,040
Leave now.

366
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,200
Your Majesty,

367
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,510
I'll get going then.

368
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,420
Your Highness.

369
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
You guys go out and guard.

370
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,430
Don't let anyone come in.

371
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,360
Yes.

372
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,020
This is not the way to Shouhe Palace.

373
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
You lied to the Empress.

374
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,420
You came to save me?

375
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,980
We've never met before.

376
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,280
Why would I save you?

377
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,360
Because you were entrusted by Chief Xiao.

378
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,700
Why him?

379
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,340
The only big shot I know

380
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,940
in the Imperial City is him.

381
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,220
Chief Xiao always offends people,

382
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,690
it's rare to see him save someone.

383
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,290
Even I'm curious,

384
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,390
what is your relationship with him?

385
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,670
Princess, you misunderstood.

386
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,770
I have no relationship with him.

387
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,730
He saved my life

388
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,200
before.

389
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,890
This is the second time.

390
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,740
You still say you have no relationship with him?

391
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,300
Two different things. Him saving me

392
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,400
has nothing to do with me as a person.

393
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,780
If you want to know the reason,

394
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,300
you should ask him.

395
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,900
Do you think you're smart?

396
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,340
Aren't you afraid that I would get angry

397
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,550
and kill you?

398
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,030
You won't kill me.

399
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,970
Why not?

400
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,830
Because you think I'm interesting.

401
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,630
You like me?

402
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,920
Yes, I do like you.

403
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,300
How did you know?

404
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,360
I didn't know just now,

405
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,920
but I know now.

406
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,580
Bu Yinlou,

407
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,260
you're interesting.

408
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,560
My nickname is Wanwan.

409
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,070
From now on,

410
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,540
just call me Wanwan.

411
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,230
Thank you for saving me today.

412
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,620
No problem.

413
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,390
I don't get along with the Empress.

414
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,950
You making her so angry today

415
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,300
vents my anger too.

416
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,610
It just a coincidence.

417
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,960
It's late,

418
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,760
thank you for saving me today.

419
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,070
I will definitely pay you a visit one day.

420
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:52,990
Wait.

421
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,430
You're wrong about one thing.

422
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,520
I don't have the guts

423
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,950
to send a false order.

424
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,130
You have to act out the whole play.

425
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,070
I've really requested an imperial decree to arrest you.

426
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,160
I came here

427
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,220
just to talk to you.

428
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,270
Let's go.

429
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,200
Let's go to Shouhe Palace and get punished.

430
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,780
Do I really have to be punished?

431
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,250
[Prince Fu’s Residence]

432
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,610
Greetings, Your Highness.

433
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,970
Chief Xiao, sister Yinlou once said

434
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,820
just live life simply.

435
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,880
What will happen to me in the future?

436
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,680
Can I live life simply too?

437
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,280
Didn't His Highness say

438
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,660
you will trust me in the future?

439
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,600
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

440
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,490
I'm not afraid.

441
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,330
Come.

442
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,810
Your Highness, come with me.

443
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,980
[Prince Fu’s Residence]

444
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,500
Cao Chun'ang.

445
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,110
As for Prince Rong,

446
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,200
we can make no mistake.

447
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,220
Tell Qilang to lead an elite team

448
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,180
to guard the Prince Fu's residence.

449
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,860
I will personally visit every single

450
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,290
official in the court.

451
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,260
I must let them know

452
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,650
the Empress and Prince of Nanyuan

453
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,160
are no longer in the lead,

454
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,440
and now Prince Fu is of their command.

455
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,360
Yes.

456
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,830
[Prince Fu’s Residence]

457
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,720
Prince Rong is in Prince Fu's ransion?

458
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,570
Where did this useless Prince Fu

459
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,540
appear from?

460
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,820
Go get Xiao Duo for me.

461
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,090
I’ve asked someone to invite him.

462
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,180
Chief Xiao went to

463
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,940
various official mansions this morning.

464
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,620
I don't know what he said.

465
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,430
But now,

466
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,030
there are some negative rumors going around,

467
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,250
saying that the Grand Secretariat

468
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,180
wants Prince Fu to be the regent.

469
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,590
Impossible.

470
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,980
Why would Xiao Duo betray me?

471
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,400
Greetings, Your Majesty.

472
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,000
Yan Sunlang,

473
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,770
your master isn't here

474
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,580
yet you dare to come.

475
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,430
No matter how powerful Chief Xiao is,

476
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,740
he’s still a servant.

477
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,880
He doesn't deserve to be called a master.

478
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,190
You are the real master.

479
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,620
Chief Xiao doesn't know

480
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,620
his place.

481
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:32,840
But I do.

482
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,440
Today,

483
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,550
I have something important to tell

484
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,710
Her Highness.

485
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,600
I've checked Zhaoding Bureau's

486
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,240
deployment record.

487
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,040
Quite a few good fighters

488
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,230
have been transferred to Prince Fu’s Mansion.

489
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,150
Chief Xiao

490
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,870
must have colluded with Prince Fu

491
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,130
since a while ago.

492
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,520
That little Consort Dowager

493
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,200
was originally a Tribute Lady.

494
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,260
But on the day of her death,

495
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,570
Chief Xiao saved her

496
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,120
and brought her out.

497
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,560
They colluded to trick you, Your Highness.

498
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,640
Rise.

499
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,350
Yes.

500
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,370
You're from Zhaoding Bureau.

501
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,520
Why are you telling me this?

502
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,080
Although I'm in the Zhaoding Bureau,

503
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,090
I’m always on your side.

504
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,740
Chief Xiao is unloyal

505
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,500
and disrespects you.

506
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,560
I can't watch this.

507
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,160
I'm willing to abandon the dark for the bright.

508
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,060
I believe you won't treat

509
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,790
my loyalty poorly.

510
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,870
If everything is as you said,

511
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,150
the chief position of Zhaoding Bureau

512
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,120
will surely be yours.

513
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,030
I'm willing to do anything for you.

514
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,330
You may leave.

515
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,380
Yes.

516
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,660
Tell them

517
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,760
to retract all the spies

518
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,730
with Prince Fu.

519
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,670
Don't let Zhaoding Bureau find any evidence.

520

Contact the Prince of Nanyuan immediately.

According to the spy,

Her Majesty has sent a message to the Prince of Nanyuan.

Send a letter to Yuwen Liangshi.

Tell him that Zhaoding Bureau and the Grand Secretariat

in return for nothing.

573

Let me take a look.

That’s not what Chief means.

why are you stopping him?

646
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,480
Chief Xiao said this firmly before,

saying that he will help Prince Fu get power.

648

00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,810
This Xiao Duo..

693
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,330
I told him it's best to not owe each other anything.

694
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,140
After all, I still owe him a life.

695
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,400
I have no choice.

696
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,590
But it's late at night,

697
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,470
why do we have to meet

698
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,980
at such a dark place?

699
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,400
Do you like it?

700
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:13,970
Who are you?

701
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,170
Did I scare you?

702
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,430
Sorry, I...

703
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,180
I am

704
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,500
Murong Gaogong.

705
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,260
Murong?

706
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

707
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,300
Don't stand on ceremony.

708
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,060
Since you are here,

709
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,440
I won't bother you.

710
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,290
I...

711
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,060
I came to see you.

712
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,730
Isn’t it Xiao Duo who asked to meet me?

713
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,320
Why is Prince Fu here instead?

714
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,340
I made this lantern

715
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,140
by myself.

716
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,740
It's for you.

717
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,920
Do you like it?

718
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,360
It's beautiful.

719
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,760
But I can't accept it for nothing.

720
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,850
I can't accept it.

721
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,040
Of course you can.

722
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,760
You being safe

723
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,770
is the biggest blessing to me.

724
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,960
On the day of burial,

725
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,060
I got so worried

726
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,490
when I heard you were going to be a Tribute Lady.

727
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,250
I searched for help high and low but to no avail.

728
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,640
Fortunately,

729
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,700
Chief Xiao was willing to help me.

730
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,790
Otherwise...

731
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,610
Otherwise, I'm really afraid

732
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,170
I'll never see you again.

733
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,370
Xiao Duo saved me

734
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,800
under the order of Prince Fu.

735
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,990
Sounds like Prince Fu

736
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,130
is asking me to appreciate his kindness.

737
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,490
Why is it so complicated?

738
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,780
I am very grateful towards Prince Fu

739
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,460
for having saved me.

740
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,950
But we've never met,

741
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,090
why would I be...

742
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:54,900
We have met before.

743
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,490
We have.

744
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,130
It was a few years ago,

745
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,780
when I went for a lesson at Official Bu's residence.

746
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,270
I need more details.

747
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,870
There are many students who comes to my residence

748
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,830
for lessons.

749
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,679
How would I know who you are?

750
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,600
Prince Fu!

751
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,739
I do remember.

752
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,880
Of course I'd remember you.

753
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:19,630
Well...

754
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,159
You...

755
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,460
Are you...

756
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,060
the one I owe money to because of a card game?

757
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,710
No.

758
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,909
The one who got kick into the pond by me?

759
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,830
No.

760
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,860
The one I secretly

761
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,420
dismantled the cartwheels of?

762
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,170
No.

763
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,139
None of those!

764
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,400
Back then, you were holding onto

765
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,989
a wooden lotus lantern just like this one.

766
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:44,580
Look.

767
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:45,840
Look.

768
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:48,489
Price Fu!

769
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:49,239
His Highness!

770
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,380
His Highness!

771
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,469
Send help!

772
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,070
Someone fell into the water.

773
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,700
His Highness!

774
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,680
Prince Fu.His Highness!

775
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,030
Slowly.

776
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,540
Slowly.

777
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,320
Wait.

778
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,660
Sir,

779
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,800
please hold this for me.

780
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,970
Forget it.

781
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,820
Hold him.

782
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,210
Your Highness...

783
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:22,720
Are you okay?

784
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:25,240
I...

785
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,500
I'll head back first.

786
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,420
Your Highness,

787
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,070
my men are all here.

788
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,700
Let them escort you back.

789
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:33,760
No need.

790
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,390
Eunuch Sun, aren't you leaving?

791
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,480
I have something

792
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,080
to ask Consort Dowager Duan.

793
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,720
Consort Dowager Duan.

794
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,610
You made Prince Fu fall into the water today.

795
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:02,400
Is it

796
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,750
something up your own sleeves

797
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,140
or under the instructions of others?

798
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,910
I didn't push him.

799
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:08,910
You didn't push him?

800
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,670
Did His Highness

801
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,720
fell in himself?

802
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,480
He really did.

803
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,450
Nonsense.

804
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,580
Prince Fu's residence

805
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,720
will not let go of what happened today

806
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,810
so easily.

807
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,690
Consort Dowager Duan,

808
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,370
you have to give us an explanation.

809
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,220
Give us an explanation.

810
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,280
Give us an explanation!

811
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,160
Give us an–

812
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:24,920
Eunuch Sun,

813
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,510
what are you trying to do?

814
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,980
Someone's acting wildly on your turf,

815
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,910
you have to discipline them!

816
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:34,740
Chief Xiao,

817
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,140
let me say something unpleasant.

818
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,440
His Highness

819
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,910
has a deal with you.

820
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,670
If it weren’t for Consort Dowager Duan,

821
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,520
His Highness wouldn’t help you.

822
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,300
This bastard Xiao Duo

823
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,150
did plan something to do with me.

824
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,670
Look at how

825
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,390
you're doing with this situation?

826
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,740
Who do you think

827
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,760
you are talking to?

828
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,470
You...

829
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,990
Yes.

830
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,050
I went overboard.

831
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,650
But Consort Dowager Duan

832
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,790
put His Highness is in danger,

833
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,800
this is not a trivial matter!

834
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,310
Then make it a trivial matter.

835
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:09,770
You...

836
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,160
This…

837
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,490
Chief Xiao,

838
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,050
you saw it just now!

839
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,990
The palace is holding a ritual.

840
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,590
It's not good for anyone to make a scene now.

841
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,480
If Her Majesty finds out,

842
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,080
even I won't be able to clean this situation up.

843
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,290
By then,

844
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,650
I'm afraid just your life

845
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,750
won't be enough.

846
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,840
You...

847
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:30,520
This...

848
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,530
Fine.

849
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,260
Fine then!

850
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,150
I know now

851
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,960
how powerful you are.

852
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,680
I didn’t push him.

853
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,550
What a nice fabric texture.

854
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,550
Look.

855
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,770
They've left.

856
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:03,910
I shall leave too.

857
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,520
Do you know the way?

858
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,040
Follow me.

859
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,400
What are you doing?

860
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,480
Just tell me what you want to say.

861
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,780
You've been

862
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,830
staring at me.

863
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:37,760
You're staring a hole

864
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,020
through me.

865
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:41,960
Fine.

866
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,430
Since you said so,

867
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,160
I won't stand on ceremony.

868
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,560
I think it's about enough,

869
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,730
just spare my life.

870
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,880
You sound like

871
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,440
I'm going to do something to you.

872
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,910
Aren't you?

873
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,170
You're going to give me to Prince Fu

874
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,090
to please him.

875
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,860
I'll tell you clearly.

876
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,990
You've overestimated me.

877
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,910
I'm not

878
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,090
sensible enough

879
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,220
to please him.

880
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,800
I see.

881
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,150
Understood.

882
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,790
What do you understand?

883
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,600
Even I don't understand.

884
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,360
What are you doing?

885
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:23,910
What are you doing?

886
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:26,900
What are you trying to do>

887
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,380
I misunderstood.

888
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,140
I thought you have taken a liking to Prince Fu.

889
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,820
It's my fault.

890
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:51,040
Actually, I didn't mean it that way.

891
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,860
You helped me again just now

892
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,950
so I'll let it go.

893
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,100
We can just

894
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,490
let it go.

895
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,150
We can't just let it go.

896
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:04,900
I should

897
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,750
apologize to you.

898
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,890
How should I apologize?

899
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,990
According to the rules,

900
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,500
you're have to guard the mausoleum.

901
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,880
Why don't we wait for Prince Rong

902
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,020
become the heir?

903
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,450
I will help you then

904
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:16,920
and find a way

905
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,720
to send you to Prince Fu's Mansion

906
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,490
so that you won't have to suffer for the rest of your life.

907
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,290
So you're still

908
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,890
trying to use me?

909
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:24,310
Your Highness.

910
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,900
I'm trying to help you

911
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,120
out of my kindness.

912
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,130
Do you have to

913
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,430
be so serious?

914
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,990
I'm going to be

915
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:31,740
honest with you.

916
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,170
Prince Fu is only willing to

917
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,600
cooperate with me

918
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,650
because of you.

919
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,000
At this point of time,

920
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:38,840
you and I

921
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,940
are already on the same boat.

922
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,240
We won't be able to leave it.

923
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,170
Why don't you pick

924
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,140
one of these two choices I've thought for you.

925
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,440
Either

926
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,410
you accept Prince Fu,

927
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:54,880
and help him ascend to power

928
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,020
by pandering to him.

929
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,320
By then, we will really be

930
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,200
on one boat.

931
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,460
Or...

932
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,140
I don't mind killing you personally

933
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,460
without having Prince Fu know.

934
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,560
Don't.

935
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,130
There are so many people here.

936
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,510
It's not

937
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,860
a good place to kill people.

938
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,280
Well...

939
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,500
It could seem like there's no one around here.

940
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,100
But you're a big shot,

941
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,690
there might be someone watching you

942
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,530
in the dark.

943
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,330
It's just

944
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:31,340
for your sake.

945
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,320
A wise man submits to fate.

946
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,490
As for the choice you want to make,

947
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,960
think carefully before you answer.

948
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,450
Is there

949
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,720
a third way?

950
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,370
Look how unwilling you are.

951
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,140
I heard that you're an illegitimate child.

952
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,290
I guess you've never

953
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,670
wealthy nor in power.

954
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,270
Once you have tasted the greatness of

955
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,360
the abundance of wealth

956
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,080
and having people at your command,

957
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,590
you will understand

958
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
my kindness.

959
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,660
Impossible.

960
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,680
I'm not that kind of person.

961
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,600
You are.

962
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:08,800
You are the first woman

963
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,810
to have opened this.

964
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,440
A golden emblem.

965
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,340
An ivory incense burner.

966
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,950
A pair of vases.

967
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,860
Four golden cups with a lotus flower base.

968
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,670
A golden plated jade pedant.

969
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,150
A crown filled with jade and gold.

970
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,540
Ten gold-inlaid rings.

971
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,990
I've seen a lot of things in my life.

972
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,960
This is

973
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,100
is nothing worth mentioning.

974
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,580
Everything has a reason,

975
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,880
these are but nothing.

976
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:46,810
These are nothing!

977
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,910
Are you satisfied?

978
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,230
Just so-so.

979
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,200
Then why don't you ask them to stop?

980
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,660
Four pairs of gold-inlaid jewels.

981
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,380
Yunnan jade.

982
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:04,910
Her Highness is now the Great Consort.

983
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,170
According to the rules,

984
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,430
you shouldn't be staying in the Xiecui Garden.

985
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,450
When the Imperial City has settled down,

986
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,000
I'll arrange for you

987
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,760
to move to a suitable palace.

988
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,820
When you live a luxurious life in a spacious area,

989
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:15,660
you will also be more energetic.

990
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,180
As long as you listen to my arrangements,

991
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,830
you'll be able to live a luxurious life.

992
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:23,470
I'm sick of it.

993
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,990
The taste of wealth

994
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,630
does get boring.

995
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:29,180
It's tasteless.

996
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,790
Leave. Leave.

997
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,720
Mistress.

998
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:45,850
Mistress.
