00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,340
So I was right.

348
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,140
There are many stories like this

349
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,180
in the novels Wan Wan lent me.

350
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,820
What was the point of hiding it from you?

351
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,660
So you knew you shouldn't have hid it from me?

352
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,180
What did the Prince of Nanyuan

353
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,300
do to your brother?

354
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,180
Six years ago,

355
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,820
he was killed by the Prince of Nanyuan.

356
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,140
Duo was still working in the palace then.

357
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,380
That day, he went out to get supplies.

358
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,420
He hadn't returned to the palace

359
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,620
even after dawn broke.

360
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,380
I heard about it, so I went to look for him.

361
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,540
I searched the whole day, but I couldn't find him.

362
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,700

[Imperial City, Ruyi Alley]

00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,860
That carriage

365
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,020
carried the Prince of Nanyuan's emblem.

366
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,700
I didn't bother with it then.

367
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,260
Duo, Duo.

368
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,010
When I found Duo,

369
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,820
he was already dead.

370
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,860
His hands were grasped tight

371
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,300
around a silk cord.

372
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,140
The material of that silk cord was luxurious,

373
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,620
it didn't belong to him.

374
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,180
It must have been the murderer's.

375
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,260
After that, I investigated.

376
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:35,900
That day,

377
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,340
only the Prince of Nanyuan's carriage

378
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,580
had entered Ruyi Alley.

379
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,140
Why didn't you report it to the magistrates?

380
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,620
I did.

381
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,820
But the magistrate,

382
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,980
seeing that he was a nobleman,

383
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,500
kicked me out.

384
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,140
I thought about assassination.

385
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,860
But he's heavily guarded,

386
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,940
I couldn't get close to him.

387
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,900
I just wanted justice,

388
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,180
but there were no ways at all

389
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,620
of getting it.

390
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,740
I had no choice

391
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,900
but to take a risk.

392
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,300
I used Duo's identity

393
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,340
to enter the Imperial City.

394
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,100
From then on,

395
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,340
I was Xiao Duo.

eager to please his master.

Are you trying to take my position?

Foul acts abound in the Imperial City.

Masters trample on servants.

409
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,580
Servants, too, trample on servants.

If I wanted to avenge Duo,

414
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,140
I had to live

00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,540
I understand now.

520
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,580
I’ve been waiting for Duo for so many years.

521
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,900
I'm happy that

522
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,020
I've gotten closure.

523
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,300
Don't worry, you saved my life.

524
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,500
And you're ensuring I will live out the rest of my life in comfort.

525
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,860
I have no reason to make things difficult for myself.

526
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,140
I will keep this a secret

527
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,060
for as long as I live.

528
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,060
Six years ago, on the seventh day of the sixth month,

529
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,810
he was going to come.

530
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,940
It's just that something happened.

531
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,220
He didn't let you down.

532
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,260
Thank you.

533
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,740
Duo and I

534
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,740
are not meant to be together.

535
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,300
I hope you and your beloved

536
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,450
can be together forever.

537
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,100
Unlike us.

538
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,020
Let's go.

539
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,900
Godfather. As you ordered,

540
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,060
we sent someone to keep an eye on Mingding Tower.

541
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,340
The Prince of Nanyuan's people

542
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,700
really went to kill him.

543
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,610
Let's go.

544
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,660
Why was Zhuo Ying poisoned?

545
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,420
I switched out

546
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,900
the snow mugwort.

547
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,340
What poison?

548
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,760
Tell me.

549
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,740
Did you do it?

550
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,540
So it was you who made the swap.

551
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,780
Did you switch it out

552
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,020
for a tonic

553
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,300
just to torture me?

554
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,460
Don't worry. She's fine.

555
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,660
But

556
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,700
you're not.

557
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,900
What exactly do you want?

558
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,420
I want information.

559
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:04,780
I found

560
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,980
something interesting.

561
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,460
In the Prince of Nanyuan's residence,

562
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,660
the money they make from trading salt

563
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,100
flows into ten different banks

564
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,660
in West Shu.

565
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,860
After passing through a few ledgers,

566
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,100
they eventually enter

567
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,260
the biggest iron mine in West Shu.

568
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,100
Tell me.

569
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,740
Is the Prince of Nanyuan

570
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,460
illicitly forging weapons for the Shu Army?

571
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,740
I don't know anything

572
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,860
about what you just said.

573
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,060
Think about it carefully.

574
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
If you still don't know,

575
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,420
I won't hesitate to

576
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,900
torture you half to death,

577
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,100
before sending you to the Prince of Nanyuan.

578
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,020
I think the Prince of Nanyuan

579
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,740
would be very willing to accept you.

580
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,580
If I tell you,

581
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,300
the Prince of Nanyuan would all the more not let me off.

582
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,620
It would be a fate worse than death.

583
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,620
Do you think

584
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,180
I will let you off?

585
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,500
This is good.

586
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,780
I'll fit it over your head,

587
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,100
and hook it on your eyes, ears,

588
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,020
nose, and tongue.

589
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,500
I won't need much strength

590
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,620
to put you in agony.

591
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,180
But

592
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,140
you won't be able to make a sound.

593
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,220
You won't even be able to see

594
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,860
how it's torturing you.

595
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,190
-The more...
-Fine.

596
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,380
I'll talk.

597
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,940
I have only one request.

598
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,860
I want to bring Zhuo Ying away.

599
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,860
Impossible.

600
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,940
Do you think I'll let her off?

601
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,140
If you still won't talk,

602
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,020
I'll torture her too.

603
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,980
Don't hurt her.

604
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,180
I'll talk.

605
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:00,820
I'll talk.

606
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,340
I only know

607
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,380
the Prince of Nanyuan

608
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,140
has searched all over West Shu

609
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,180
for the best ironworkers,

610
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,620
and are keeping them in the mines.

611
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,220
Every few months,

612
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,420
he sends food and clothing

613
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,420
to the Shu army.

614
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,740
But there was once

615
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,820
I accidentally saw

616
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,700
that it wasn't food and clothing in the carriages,

617
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,620
but newly forged weapons.

618
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,220
Qilang.

619
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,300
Chief.

620
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,260
Make a trip to the mines

621
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,700
and find those ironworkers.

622
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,740
I want solid evidence.

623
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,060
Yes.

624
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,540
If Zhuoying

625
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,700
knew who you really were,

626
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,940
she won't let you off.

627
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,860
I won't let you get away with this!

628
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:51,780
Zhuo Ying?

629
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,180
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

630
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,580
Let go of me! I won't let him off!

631
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,740
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

632
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,180
It's fine that you switched out the poison.

633
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:00,860
Why did you

634
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,020
switch it out for a tonic?

635
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,220
What were you trying to do?

636
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:03,580
Calm down.

637
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,060
Zhuo Ying,

638
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,420
I wanted to help you.

639
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,020
You said that

640
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,420
if he does you wrong,

641
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,740
you will make him cry.

642
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,420
Were you making him cry?

643
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,420
You made me cry!

644
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,020
I cried! I wailed!

645
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:14,700
I didn't know

646
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,940
you would drink it.

647
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,380
And you.

648
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,020
Why did you

649
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,260
abduct my cousin?

650
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,140
And why are you

651
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,290
threatening him?

652
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,900
Do you have some fetish?

653
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,420
Release him immediately.

654
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,900
All of you, leave!

655
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,940
He doesn't like me.

656
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,420
If I asked him nicely,

657
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,620
he would never tell me

658
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,420
what I wanted to know.

659
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,290
Zhuo Ying,

660
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,540
tell me.

661
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,300
Is he holding you against your will?

662
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,340
No. Really.

663
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,660
You found out everything you wanted.

664
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,940
Release him now.

665
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,260
He knows too much.

666
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,100
It's time to send him on his way.

667
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,060
What do you mean?

[Dream Cloud Pavilion]

669
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,340
So you meant it literally?

670
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,659
What did you think it was?

671
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,620
The Prince of Nanyuan wants to silence him.

672
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,260
He must leave West Shu.

673
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,860
Don't worry. I've made

674
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,739
thorough arrangements.

675
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:31,179
As for his indenture,

676
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:31,780
I've sent someone

677
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,540
to steal it from Mingding Tower.

678
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,780
It's in the carriage.

679
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:39,780
Why did you help me?

680
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,179
I didn't help you.

681
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,460
It's my Zhuo Ying

682
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,620
who is on your side.

683
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,940
What can I do?

684
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,460
Well, what's done is done.

685
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,900
You should leave now.

I'm leaving.

I cannot be by her side anymore,

00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,650
so take good care of her for me.

Your Highness, a letter from West Shu.

715
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,130
[Consort Dowager Duan was poisoned by accident]

716
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:35,310
[Xiao Duo summons all famous doctors to treat Great Consort. He stayed in her room for the whole night.]

717
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,140
What happened?

718
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,780
Let me ask you.

719
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,740
What kind of person

720
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,900
would Xiao Duo care about?

721
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,660
Chief Xiao works for Your Highness.

722
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,180
I dare not say anything.

723
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,940
According to the letter,

724
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,620
Consort Dowager Duan was poisoned.

725
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,940
To treat her,

726
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,700
Xiao Duo got all the famous physicians in the city.

727
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,420
He even waited on her in her room

728
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,580
the whole night.

729
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,460
When he served me,

730
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,300
he never slept in my palace.

731
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,500
Why does he treat us so differently?

732
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,220
He's scared.

733
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,940
He's scared she'll die.

734
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,300
He's has always been arrogant and domineering.

735
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,500
He's never been scared of anything,

736
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,260
but he's scared she'll die.

737
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,860
Xiao Duo.

738
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,580
You broke my heart.

739
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,020
I will make you pay for it.

740
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,220
You must pay for this.

741
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:49,780
Your Highness.

742
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,980
Have you heard about Consort Dowager Duan?

743
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,860
Didn't they say that

744
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,810
Consort Dowager Duan went to West Shu for the wedding?

745
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,180
A distant relative of mine from West Shu said

746
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,820
a Consort Dowager came to Jinguan City,

747
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,660
and suddenly got poisoned.

748
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,420
It must be Consort Dowager Duan.

749
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,780
Are you sure?

750
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,900
How is she now?

751
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,380
Is she safe?

752
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,620
Eunuch Sun,

753
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,980
I only know that

754
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,860
Chief Xiao got all the famous physicians in the city

755
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,740
to treat Her Highness.

756
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,620
It was a big deal,

757
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,620
so her condition must have been precarious.

758
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,060
But I really don't know

759
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,140
whether Her Highness is safe.

760
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,820
If you're lying,

761
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,980
I'll have you beheaded.

762
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,680
Let's go.

763
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,980
These are all the memorials

764
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,700
from today?

765
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,620
Your Majesty.

766
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,980
The most important matters

767
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,260
that need your personal attention

768
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,340
are all here.

769
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,380
As for the trivial matters,

770
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,580
the Supervising Secretary of the Six Ministries

771
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,380
has already sent them to the Zhaoding Bureau for review.

772
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,260
Didn't I pass an order?

773
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,840
I want to see all the memorials,

774
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,220
even if they have been sent for review.

775
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,300
Perhaps the Supervising Secretary

776
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,180
was used to the way it was done,

777
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:20,980
and made a mistake.

778
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,780
I'll go and remind him.

779
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:24,580
Yes.

780
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:29,690
Your Majesty.

781
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,620
Your Majesty!

782
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,700
Bad news!

783
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,620
Something happened in West Shu.

784
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,100
Her Highness is poisoned.

785
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,940
She's poisoned?

786
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,220
Pass my order.

787
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,740
I'll go to West Shu immediately.

788
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,060
Yes.

789
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,620
Godfather,

790
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,980
how much spicy chicken have you cooked?

791
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,620
Do you have something against the chicken?

792
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,940
It's still a little lacking.

793
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,060
I need more practice.

794
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:31,740
It's close.

795
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,220
I wonder if

796
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,260
Zhuo Ying will like this.

797
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,040
Since you met Godmother,

798
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,100
you've learned a lot.

799
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:44,860
Should I

800
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,820
also learn something?

801
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,560
Tong Yun.

802
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,220
Do you like spicy chicken?

803
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:02,500
What chicken?

804
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,660
You came at the right time.

805
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,380
Look.

806
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,420
On the map of the Shu Army grounds,

807
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,380
there is a side path

808
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,620
that leads to the mine.

809
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,540
What if Yuwen Liangshi

810
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,180
send the men from Shu Army

811
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,100
to move the witnesses from the mines

812
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,090
before your people get there?

813
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,140
It's a serious crime to deploy troops without permission.

814
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,660
Yuwen Liangshi would not

815
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,940
openly oppose the court.

816
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,220
This time, the spicy chicken is authentic.

817
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:33,540
Try it.

818
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,500
I'm talking about something important.

819
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,420
What do you mean, spicy chicken?

820
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:37,940
Spicy chicken?

821
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,740
How many times have you cooked this?

822
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,740
I told you.

823
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,940
It was good the first few times

824
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,140
you made it

825
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,220
Why must you be so perfectionistic?

826
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,260
Of course I must seek perfection,

827
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,300
I forgot to bring chopsticks.

828
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,020
Hand.

829
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:01,980
Godfather.

830
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,020
I just remembered

831
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,260
it's that time of the month

832
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,580
again.

833
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:13,860
You eat first.

834
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,980
That time of the month?

835
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,610
For what?

836
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,340
Godfather, don't deny it.

837
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,780
I've counted them.

838
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,260
You've been delaying the medicine for a long time,

839
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,100
and still haven't taken it.

840
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,500
Do you want to die?

841
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,980
If you delay it any longer,

842
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,740
the consequences will be dire.

843
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,060
I must watch you

844
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:46,570
take it

845
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,460
even if it kills me.

846
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,260
I said no.

847
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,820
Godfather.

848
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,460
What medicine is it?

849
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,220
No wonder Cao Chun'ang mentioned spicy chicken.

850
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,820
This is so delicious!

851
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,820
It's my chicken!
