[Episode 28]

4
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,920
You have an older brother

5
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,009
who looks very similar to you.

6
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:47,009
But he suddenly disappeared six years ago.

7
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,530
So,

8
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,800
I thought of a story.

9
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,650
Do you want to hear it?

10
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,970
There was a pair of twins

11
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,170
and the younger twin entered the palace as a eunuch.

12
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,940
For some reason he disappeared

13
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,160
six years ago.

14
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,360
After the older twin found out,

15
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,850
he took on his brother's identity

16
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,040
and entered the Imperial City.

17
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,930
You are that older twin.

18
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,490
You are not Xiao Duo.

19
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,650
You told me previously

20
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,170
that you were a eunuch.

21
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,760
There's no evidence that you are involved with Consort Duan.

22
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,120
His Majesty wouldn't believe it.

23
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,240
But now,

24
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,410
you pretended to be a eunuch

25
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,810
and seduced a royal concubine.

26
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,920
Chief Xiao,

27
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,570
you yourself are walking proof.

28
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,450
What do you want?

29
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,050
I want you to kill Bu Yinlou

30
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,880
with your own hands.

31
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,490
Mistress,

32
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,370
you've been staring at this for three whole days.

33
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,170
I have something

34
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,370
that I don't know if I should say.

35
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,740
How is an ant and a piece of pastry

36
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,329
worth staring at?

37
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,210
People outside are kicking up a fuss

38
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:51,930
to execute you.

39
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,400
Are you not worried?

40
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,290
Look at this ant.

41
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,440
Its leg is trapped under the pastry.

42
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,360
Do you think it's panicking?

43
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,280
Yes.

44
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,050
It's the same for me too.

45
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,000
Why isn’t Xiao Duo here yet?

46
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,560
Mistress,

47
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,050
do you think something happened?

48
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,570
No, he will definitely come.

49
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,020
Your Highness, he's here.

50
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,450
Only Consort Duan

51
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,720
shall remain here.

52
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,240
The rest can leave.

53
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,250
What are you going to do to my mistress?

54
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,690
Let's go!

55
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,680
Xiao Duo.

56
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,960
Consort Duan is waiting for you

57
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,570
to explain the purpose of your visit.

58
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,890
What is this?

59
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,210
Xiao Duo.

60
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,210
I want you to tell her yourself.

61
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,090
This is...

62
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,250
Poisoned wine.

63
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:24,960
It's poisoned wine?

64
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,810
The color...

65
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,730
looks pretty nice.

66
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,210
You don't think it's fake, do you?

67
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,140
I personally prepared this for you by hand.

68
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,010
It's as real as it can be.

69
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,770
I gave him two choices.

70
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,620
Either he makes you

71
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,330
drink this wine personally,

72
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,960
making it seem like you committed suicide in fear tonight.

73
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,090
Or,

74
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,060
I'll expose him for pretending to be a eunuch

75
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,600
and he'll be punished for deceiving the emperor.

76
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,570
If you live, he dies.

77
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,250
If he lives,

78
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,400
you die.

79
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,880
Didn't you say

80
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,810
my life

81
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,530
is much more important than yours?

82
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,460
You know why I entered the palace.

83
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,000
Now that I'm so close to my goal,

84
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,090
I can't give up.

85
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,240
I'm sorry.

Xiao Duo.

101
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,040
I never want to see you again.

102
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,370
In this life,

103
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,690
in the next life,

104
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,120
and the following life,

105
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,370
stay away from me

106
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,370
as far as you can.

107
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,800
Yinlou.

108
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,170
This bitch is finally dead.

109
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,040
Xiao Duo,

110
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,050
don't you like her a lot?

111
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,280
Didn't you say you could give up

112
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,680
everything for her?

113
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,860
There is no such thing as

114
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,730
unwavering love in this world.

115
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,280
When life and death are at stake,

116
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,290
and you have to choose what benefits you most,

117
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,610
you'll end up protecting yourself

118
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,480
and giving her up.

119
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,000
This is why

120
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,530
you and I are the same kind.

121
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,610
Let go.

122
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,360
Let go of her!

123
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,650
Without you by my side serving me,

124
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,010
my hair is never combed properly,

125
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,560
and my makeup doesn't go on smoothly.

126
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,600
Come here.

127
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,170
Don't just stand there. Come here.

128
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,480
I forgot already.

129
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,770
When did you

130
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,850
do my hair before?

131
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,690
It feels like it's been a long time.

132
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,570
But I will always remember

133
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,440
the first time you did my hair for me.

134
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,360
Just like now,

135
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,890
I was sitting in front of the bronze mirror

136
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,480
and looking at you.

137
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,880
Thinking back to that time,

138
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,730
you were really clumsy then,

139
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,730
and you didn't know anything.

140
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,960
You couldn't even distinguish hair oil from fragrance powder,

141
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,480
and your technique was awkward.

142
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,210
Back then,

143
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,280
you were holding up my hair with both hands,

144
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,500
unsure whether to keep holding it,

145
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,760
or to put it down.

146
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,530
Although the hairstyle that you would do for me

147
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,920
was not as complicated as what the maids would do,

148
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,890
but it was simple and natural,

149
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,720
which I really liked.

150
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,410
Every time I recall that time,

151
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,960
I always think,

152
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,210
for the rest of my life,

153
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,200
I only want you

154
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,640
to do my hair.

155
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,200
Now my wish

156
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,640
has finally come true.

157
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,960
Are you satisfied

158
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,360
with your makeup, Your Highness?

159
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,800
With you serving me by my side,

160
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,570
of course I'm satisfied.

161
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,280
I'm glad you like it.

162
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,090
After all, this rouge

163
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,940
was what I specially sourced

164
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,160
from Qiongshui Pavilion.

165
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,610
It's really strange.

166
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,600
How could Your Highness possibly

167
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,680
have the antidote to such a rare poison?

168
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,570
How dare you set me up?

169
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,810
Chief Xiao,

170
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,360
what’s going on?

171
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,880
Your Majesty,

172
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,560
the case of the fox demon wasn't caused by any demons,

173
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,170
but it was Her Highness Rong'an

174
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,960
who sent palace maids to wander around at night.

175
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,370
They applied poisoned rouge

176
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,810
that had thorn apple mixed into it.

177
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,650
Anyone who inhales the rouge

178
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,880
will hallucinate and die of heart palpitations.

179
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,360
All this was planned

180
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,200
just to frame Consort Duan.

181
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,680
What evidence do you have?

182
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,720
Your Majesty.

183
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,370
This is the statement of the rouge shop's owner.

184
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,690
He identified Her Highness Rong'an

185
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,760
as the real mastermind behind it.

186
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,850
We have a witness.

187
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,090
This is the antidote we found

188
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,210
in Changqing Palace.

189
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,600
As a lady residing deep in the palace,

190
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,970
how would Her Highness possibly have

191
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,290
the antidote to such a special poison?

192
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,600
Unless,

193
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,210
she is the culprit.

194
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,920
We have both a witness and physical evidence to prove it.

195
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,450
Empress Rong'an

196
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,200
caused chaos in the palace

197
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,880
and harmed the people.

198
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,810
From now on, she will be imprisoned in Changqing Palace,

199
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,160
and executed at a later date.

200
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,280
Follow me out.

201
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,360
Yes.

202
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,960
Get someone to guard Changqing Palace.

203
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,810
Don't let Rong'an have the chance to talk.

204
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,760
Got it.

[Quiet Residence]

206
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,370
Chief Xiao.

207
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,560
Since you solved the case,

208
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,650
I should reward you.

209
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,810
This is my duty as Your Majesty's loyal servant,

210
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:25,800
I don't need a reward.

211
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,480
Fine.

212
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,290
But I also heard that

213
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,280
you gave Consort Duan

214
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,560
poisoned wine.

215
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,570
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

216
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,170
I had no choice but to do this.

217
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,050
Her Highness Rong'an

218
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,330
harbors a deep grudge against Consort Duan.

219
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,010
If we didn't make that risky move,

220
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:43,980
Her Highness Rong'an

221
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,640
would probably not have let down her guard

222
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,610
and given herself away.

223
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,120
If...

224
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,640
Consort Duan wasn't lucky enough to be saved,

225
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,260
you...

226
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,730
harming my concubine's life.

227
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,640
Do you think

228
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,850
you would still be able to

229
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,050
kneel here in one piece?

230
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,530
I deserve death.

231
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,760
But solving the case within three days

232
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,400
was what Your Majesty personally ordered.

233
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,530
Your Majesty's order

234
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,290
is my top priority.

235
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,440
As for what the process involves,

236
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,840
and what happens to Consort Duan,

237
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,800
those were not my foremost considerations.

What? Denghuo?

00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,930
Yes, Denghuo.

242
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,120
How unconventional.

243
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,930
What you meant by your words earlier was that

244
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,720
you only did it for me?

245
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,520
You only did it for me.

246
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,760
So if I ask you to go and die,

247
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,320
you will also go and die obediently?

Enough.

Her Highness has woken up.

It's just that she hasn't uttered a single word.

272
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,610
Maybe she was wronged and went through suffering,

273

is also highly dangerous for her.

such a big risk

292

then Rong'an is the culprit.

you can make me drink a cup of poisoned wine too.

00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,650
Are you heartbroken?

346
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,560
You cried, right?

347
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,370
Praise me!

348
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,090
Praise me hard.

349
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,200
So you already guessed it.

350
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,410
I already knew it

351
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,650
when you gave me the poisoned wine.

352
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,410
I trust you.

353
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,800
You won't harm me.

354
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,770
I don't know if I should say you're clever,

355
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,490
or if I should say you're foolish.

356
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,210
You're the fool.

357
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,490
I'm the fool, I'm the fool, I'm the biggest fool of all.

358
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,050
You have to keep me under your thumb

359
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,650
for the rest of our lives.

360
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,130
Otherwise, it'd be a waste of

361
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,210
your intelligence and wit.

362
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,170
I'll think about it.

363
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,290
I heard

364
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,300
you lost your position as

365
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,840
Chief Eunuch of Zhaoding Bureau.

366
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,970
With this nasty and hateful look of yours,

367
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,930
in the future,

368
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,090
I guess you can only lie low and

369
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:50,800
live meekly then?

370
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes.

371
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,450
I've completely lost my status and power

372
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,600
and have nothing now.

373
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,770
From now on,

374
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,290
I can only rely on Your Highness to take care of me.

375
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,360
Fine, I'll take care of you.

376
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,410
But,

377
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,530
have you offended many people?

378
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,800
Are they people that I can go against?

379
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,530
Why don't you seem

380
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,010
anxious at all?

381
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,290
Those Zhaoding Guards

382
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,360
have been with me for so many years.

383
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,370
They're loyal to me,

384
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,130
not to the title of Chief Eunuch.

385
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,420
Even if His Majesty

386
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,600
has taken away my title,

387
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,140
the underlying powers within Zhaoding Bureau

388
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,890
and its complex spy intelligence reports

389
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,530
are all under my control.

390
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,010
People can't get me that easily.

391
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,850
You're indeed my man.

392
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,960
There's something

393
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,250
I still don't understand.

394
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,640
What is it?

395
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,770
If Empress Rong'an

396
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,580
is really the real culprit

397
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,450
who killed your brother,

398
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,770
then after she lost power,

399
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:51,730
she's nothing but a useless chess piece

400
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,090
to Prince of Nanyuan.

401
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,680
Does the Prince of Nanyuan

402
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,120
need to hide it from you?

403
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,610
He's probably just dreaming that

404
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,560
Rong'an can still help him turn the tables.

405
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,770
Godfather, Godmother.

406
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,730
Bad news!

407
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,080
Just stand right there and say it!

408
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,410
Tongyun is in serious trouble.

409
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,690
What happened to Tongyun?

410
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,130
His Majesty ordered

411
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,210
for all the people who are involved in the fox demon case

412
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,200
to be met with severe sentences.

413
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,520
Didn't Tongyun frame you?

414
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,370
The Court of Judicial Review believes

415
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,840
she is Her Highness Rong'an's accomplice,

416
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,040
and sentenced her to exile.

417
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,080
No.

418
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,360
Tongyun can't be exiled.

419
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,840
Don't panic.

420
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,120
I already have a plan in mind.

421
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,840
Get out!

422
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,080
What are you doing?

423
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,160
I'm really sentenced to exile?

424
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,770
These were His Majesty's own words.

425
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,050
Do you think he was just kidding?

426
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,450
Isn't there anyone who came to see me

427
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,450
for the last time?

428
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,200
Where is my mistress?

429
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,000
T-then what about Cao Chun'ang?

430
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,080
Cao Chun'ang is holding a wedding today.

431
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,460
You think he'll come to

432
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,690
a place with such bad luck?

433
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,050
Holding a wedding?

434
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,050
Fine, exile it is then.

435
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,810
Wait.

436
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,800
What's the rush?

437
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,450
Being exiled will be so hard.

438
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,760
Don't go.

439
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,730
Us few,

440
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,930
will send you

441
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:40,960
to where you should go.

442
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,410
Where am I?

443
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,620
D-don't tell me

444
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,520
I got sold off?

445
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:02,970
A bestowed marriage?

446
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,320
That's right.

447
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,690
I asked the Empress Dowager

448
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,410
to issue a decree for Cao Chun'ang,

449
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,660
saying that he and Tongyun

450
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,610
have had feelings for each other since long ago.

451
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,170
He made a contribution this time

452
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,120
solving the fox demon case.

453
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,170
He was willing to use his reward to make up for Tongyun's mistake.

454
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,850
So the Empress Dowager pardoned Tongyun

455
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,560
and even granted them marriage.

456
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,880
Although...

457
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,130
it's a good thing to have saved Tongyun,

458
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,900
but is it too presumptuous

459
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,250
to do that to them?

460
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,650
Will Cao Chun'ang and Tongyun

461
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,920
get angry?

462
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,080
I don't know if Tongyun will be angry.

463
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,650
But Cao Chun'ang definitely won’t be.

464
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,530
Right.

465
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,570
He definitely won't be.

466
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,210
I thought I was the only one

467
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,450
who figured it out.

468
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,760
Turns out everyone already knew too.

469
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,160
What should I do?

470
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:07,890
Tongyun.

471
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,600
Tongyun.

472
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,690
Cao Chun'ang!

473
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,080
Didn't you go get married?

474
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,330
Don't be angry.

475
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,410
This is just a tactic to save you.

476
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,770
The wedding was held in Chief Xiao's residence.

477
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,810
It’s just to put on a show for outsiders.

478
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,600
Don't worry.

479
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,530
I won't let you show your face in public

480
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,520
and ruin your reputation.

481
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,170
Midway,

482
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,480
I brought you here.

483
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,090
Once everything blows over,

484
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,850
things between us

485
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,050
will go back to how it used to be.

486
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,770
I won't hold up your future.

487
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,960
I just came in to see you.

488
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,240
You look so beautiful

489
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,850
in a wedding dress.

490
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,360
I've thought about how you might look

491
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,650
wearing this so many times.

492
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:01,960
Actually,

493
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,640
I've thought about more things too.

494
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:04,920
I've thought about how

495
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,570
we can leave the Imperial City when the time comes

496
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,120
together with Godfather and Godmother

497
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,040
and live an ordinary life.

498
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,560
You won't be bullied by the noble ladies in the court,

499
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,880
nor have to be afraid anymore.

500
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,650
After all these years,

501
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,600
I've also accumulated some savings.

502
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,650
We can open a restaurant.

503
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,800
I'll do all the work.

504
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,130
Just sit there and be the cashier.

505
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,730
Sell whatever you want.

506
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,610
And you can close shop

507
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,370
whenever you want.

508
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,600
We can live happily every day,

509
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,080
and we won't have to worry anymore.

510
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,000
I know

511
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,320
I'm being delusional.

512
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,880
I won't think about it anymore.

513
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,440
I'm leaving.

514
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,600
Cao Chun'ang,

515
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,930
I haven't finished talking yet!

516
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,650
Cao Chun'ang!

517
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,090
Stop right there!

518
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,770
Turn around.

519
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,930
Turn around!

520
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,930
I want to sit in the restaurant and be the cashier.

521
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,490
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

522
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,400
I...

523
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,850
Cao Chun'ang.

524
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,120
I have feelings for you too.

525
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,410
What did you say?

526
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,420
You're not allowed to deny

527
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,330
what you said before.

528
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,450
Now that we're married,

529
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,930
if you dare to run away again,

530
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,410
I'll break your legs.

531
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,000
How about you slap me a couple of times?

532
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,450
Come on.

533
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,240
Slap me hard.

534
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,290
Let me know I'm not dreaming.

535
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,280
Come on, slap me.

536
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,250
It's real.

537
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,840
Can you do it again?

538
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,970
Just listen to me from now on.

539
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,040
Let's live a good life.

540
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,940
After you two leave the palace,

541
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,720
quickly go through the rites and get married.

542
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,440
How many days have you been married?

543
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,370
You're only here to see me now.

544
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,200
Forget it.

545
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,450
You only care about your husband now.

546
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,050
You don't care about me anymore.

547
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,090
Mistress.

548
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,940
Although His Majesty

549
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,600
allowed others to visit you,

550
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,730
but look,

551
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,370
how is this a place

552
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,060
where just anyone can

553
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,130
come in like that?

554
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,410
What's wrong, Mistress?

555
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,770
Look, the fish is dead.

556
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,240
Don't be too upset.

557
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,490
This kind of fish looks beautiful,

558
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,400
but is actually extremely fierce,

559
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,850
and always fights the other fish for food.

560
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,650
This time, I guess

561
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,410
it got bitten by a stronger fish this time.

562
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,600
It dying might not be a bad thing.

563
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,120
Once this kind of fierce fish dies,

564
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,760
the pond will regain its peace won't it?

565
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,600
Will it really be peaceful after it dies?

566
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,490
This pond didn't

567
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,640
become dangerous because of it.

568
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,730
Clearly this pond was already

569
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,130
full of dangers from the start.

570
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,530
How is this pond

571
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,690
full of dangers?

572
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,720
Wasn't it always like this?

573
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,250
These fish

574
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,730
should have been living freely

575
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,370
in the rivers and sea,

576
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,160
but were instead kept here by people.

577
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,360
They think this small pond

578
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,240
is all there is to their world.

579
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,880
Humans take care of them well.

580
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,720
As long as you give them some food,

581
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,730
you can make them work to make people happy,

582
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,140
and make them

583
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,160
fight to their deaths.

584
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,080
Fighting with their own kind,

585
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,360
they end up wasting the prime of their lives

586
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,840
on living a pathetic

587
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,770
and cruel life.

588
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,240
How ridiculous.

589
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,250
I wonder

590
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,170
when this will end.

591
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,010
Who will be

592
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,530
the next one?

593
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,600
You're here, Chief Xiao.

594
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,200
I'm here under His Majesty’s order

595
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,440
to send you off.

596
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,250
Chief Xiao.

597
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,000
I...

598
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,200
have one last hairpin left to put in my hair.

599
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,840
Can you help me

600
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,330
finish off my hair for the last time?

601
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,290
You’re so clever, Chief Xiao.

602
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,370
It's only been a few days,

603
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,090
and you managed to do away with

604
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,850
all the capable people around me.

605
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,480
I lost and you won.

606
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,320
From now on, you can rest assured.

607
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,340
No one will be able to

608
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,000
reveal your secret anymore.

609
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,730
I've never

610
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,239
lost once in my life.

611
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,699
Who knew I'd lose so terribly

612
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:51,760
in your hands?

613
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,320
Not everything you want

614
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,560
can be gained through scheming.

615
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,570
But I only

616
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,410
know these methods.

617
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,960
I don't know other methods.

618
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,770
Those are all others' methods.

619
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,730
Even if I observe them,

620
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,650
I still don't know how to do it.

621
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,370
Wait.

622
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,020
I have another question

623
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,840
to ask you.

624
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,890
On the seventh day of the sixth lunar month six years ago,

625
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,610
you killed a young man

626
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,720
in Ruyi Alley.

627
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,770
Why did you do that?

628
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,650
Six years ago, at Ruyi Alley.

629
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,200
Why are both you and Bu Yinlou

630
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,920
asking about this?

631
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,970
I'm sorry.

632
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,130
Your Royal Highness.

633
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,810
I didn't mean to offend you.

634
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,040
Please forgive me.

635
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,370
So this young boy is...

636
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,130
He is the real Xiao Duo.

637
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,730
Xiao Duo.

638
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,970
So you and Bu Yinlou

639
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,160
plotted all this

640
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,080
so as to avenge your brother.

641
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,130
Yes, you are not Xiao Duo.

642
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,450
You are not.

643
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,960
What are you doing?

644
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,970
You think you won?

645
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,650
You thought you can take revenge now?

646
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,680
Looks like you've just lost completely.

647
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,730
Let me tell you.

648
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,360
When your brother died that night,

649
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,690
I was there.

650
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,800
But I'm not the murderer.

651
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,080
Do you want to know who it is?

652
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,970
Do you want to know

653
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,370
who the real murderer is?

654
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,760
I'll tell you now.

655
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,760
Something is wrong.

656
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,970
Why would Rong'an, a woman,

657
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,650
be wearing

658
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,040
a man's silk pendant?

659
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,200
Was she really

660
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,400
the only one in the carriage?

661
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,600
Mother, you weaved the silk wrong.

662
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,650
Father wore that silk pendant

663
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,960
several times,

664
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,410
but after that I never saw him wear it again.

665
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,960
He said he lost it.

666
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,680
It's the silk pendant Mother made.

667
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,160
The real murderer is...

668
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,810
He's Bu Yinlou's biological father,

669
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,730
Bu Yulu.

670
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,570
I'm sorry.

671
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,650
Your Royal Highness.

672
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,370
I didn't mean to offend you.

673
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,760
Please forgive me.

674
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,530
Please spare my life, Your Highness.

675
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,400
Your Highness!

676
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,320
Your Highness!

677
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,720
Please spare my life!

678
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,170
Please!

679
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,280
Please!

680
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,960
Do you think I'll believe you?

681
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,530
At this point,

682
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,920
you still want to set me and Yinlou up.

683
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,360
I set you up?

684
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,200
You still don't believe me now.

685
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,730
Finally...

686
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,760
You can finally

687
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,170
hug me.

688
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,810
If Father is really the murderer,

689
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,530
how should I face Xiao Duo?

690
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,410
No.

691
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,570
I must confirm this

692
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,240
personally.

693
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,130
Old Master.

694
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,440
Consort Duan sent someone

695
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,850
asking you to go over to Deer's Reed Residence.

696
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,680
It's already this late.

697
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,400
What would she be looking for me for?

698
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,260
[Deer's Reed Residence]

699
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:32,800
Yinlou.

700
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,770
Did His Majesty know

701
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,160
that you called me over here?

702
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,040
There's no special occasion

703
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,410
or celebration today.

704
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,200
You're a concubine.

705
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,970
If you summon an official from your maiden family,

706
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,250
His Majesty will think

707
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,440
I'm here to abuse power for personal gain.

708
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,090
Did something happen with

709
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,880
His Majesty?

710
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,250
Father,

711
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,480
besides your family and future,

712
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,130
have you ever been concerned

713
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,080
about other things?

714
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,330
What kind of tone are you

715
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,720
using to talk to me now?

716
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,240
On the seventh day of the sixth lunar month six years ago,

717
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,290
did you go to Ruyi Alley?

718
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,800
Ruyi Alley?

719
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,560
Do you remember this silk pendant?

720
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,560
My mother made it by hand.

721
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,690
It's yours.
