[Episode 34]

4
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,120
What's wrong?

5
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,000
With that slow speed, are you shopping by the street?

6
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,240
If you had been any later,

7
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,690
we would have become the memorial tablets

8
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,520
together with the dog.

9
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,770
You came too early.

10
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,890
At this critical moment,

11
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,730
His Majesty fetched Zhuo Ying

12
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,770
back to Deer's Reed Residence.

13
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,040
I'm afraid something happened.

14
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,730
I've already transferred out

15
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,930
Zhaoding Guards in advance.

16
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,850
You meet Tongyun

17
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,480
and Qilang immediately.

18
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,500
Wait for my order.

19
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:36,960
Yes.

20
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,090
Cut the crap.

21
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,170
We are escaping now.

22
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,650
Yes, honey.

23
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,079
Sneak into the capital immediately

24
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,450
and inquire about Godfather.

25
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,079
He

26
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,890
disobeys the orders.

27
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,410
OK. When Godfather comes out,

28
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,720
I'll tell on you.

29
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,600
Who are you?

30
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,120
That's my dragon robe

31
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,490
and my dragon throne.

32
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,370
But everything you have now

33
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,720
originally

34
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,640
doesn't belong to you.

35
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,130
Your Majesty.

36
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,490
You've been drinking too many herbal soups

37
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,890
in the past few days.

38
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,930
How about

39
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,050
asking Imperial Kitchen

40
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,570
to reduce the servings?

41
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,570
Shut up.

42
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,600
Did she reflect on herself?

43
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,600
Baozhu told me

44
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,409
since Her Highness

45
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:58,440
returned from Prison,

46
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,650
she intermittently drifted off to sleep

47
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,690
for more than twenty hours before waking up.

48
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,010
After she woke up,

49
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,200
she didn't mention Chief Xiao

50
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,800
or make a scene.

51
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,890
I think she knows she should do as you wish.

52
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,890
If she had figured it out earlier,

53
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,800
she wouldn't have come this far.

54
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,280
Go to Fengyi Palace.

55
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,130
Let's go to Fengyi Palace.

56
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,880
Do you still have the mood to eat?

57
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,640
Of course I have to eat when I'm hungry.

58
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,930
I thought

59
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,650
you love Xiao Duo very much.

60
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,840
In the end,

61
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,880
you live like usual.

62
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,400
You

63
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,360
are so heartless.

64
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,240
Not a big deal.

65
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,520
I just follow

66
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,450
what you wish.

67
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,840
You are being hypocritical.

68
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,800
I have disbanded the Zhaoding Bureau

69
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,290
and confined Princess Hede.

70
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,450
I'd like to see

71
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,970
what else

72
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,970
you can come up with.

73
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,730
Whether I follow your words or not,

74
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,690
you are not satisfied.

75
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,520
What else do you want me to do?

76
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,890
A bitch who betrayed me

77
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,080
has no right to live comfortably.

78
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,440
Murong Gaogong.

79
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,720
I don't owe you anything.

80
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,520
We have never loved each other.

81
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,730
How could you say betrayal?

82
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,850
I love you so much that I have become so humble.

83
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,850
I've done everything for you.

84
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,730
I've offended the world for you.

85
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,570
I've done everything a man could do

86
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,410
to a woman.

87
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,840
In the end,

88
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,280
you say you don't owe me.

89
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,320
Of course you owe me.

90
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,080
You think you are affectionate

91
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,490
and wronged.

92
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,770
I am sick

93
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,890
of your wishful thinking.

94
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,409
How many days

95
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,400
have you and I spent together?

96
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,360
Do you know me?

97
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,570
What do I like?

98
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,450
What do I love to read?

99
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,450
What do I love to play with?

100
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,240
What do I hate?

101
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,130
What do I loathe?

102
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,770
You know nothing about me.

103
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,880
How can you love so deeply?

104
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,210
You don't care

105
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,290
what kind of person I am.

106
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,530
You only care about

107
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,290
the person you met

108
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,040
during your childhood.

109
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,760
Have you ever lived a real life?

110
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,530
Do you know

111
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,640
what you want?

112
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,210
Poor you.

113
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,280
You're obsessed with love.

114
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,290
You don't dare to admit

115
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,480
what you want.

116
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,890
You want power.

117
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,370
In the name of loving me,

118
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,960
you walked towards the pursuit of power.

119
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,840
You are very happy.

120
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,289
But every step you take

121
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,450
will expose your inability.

122
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,840
That's why you love me more.

123
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,010
Only possessing what you couldn't get

124
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,090
can prove

125
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,840
your dignity of being superior,

126
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,250
and that

127
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,760
you're not an incompetent person.

128
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,570
Because these

129
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,440
don't belong to you.

130
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,090
You...

131
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,120
If it weren't for you,

132
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,840
I wouldn't have been forced by Xiao Duo

133
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,050
and got involved in this mess in the Imperial City.

134
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,930
I wouldn't have ascended to the throne

135
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,730
and been criticized

136
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,650
and wronged.

137
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,960
If it weren't for you,

138
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,000
I wouldn't have killed

139
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,880
my nephew on my own.

140
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,930
Now,

141
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,010
he keeps haunting me

142
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,170
in my dream day and night.

143
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,690
All my sufferings

144
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,890
are because of you.

145
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,040
Murong Gaogong.

146
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,360
Every step you take

147
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,440
is your choice.

148
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,810
You don't spare yourself,

149
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,240
but you drag me to hell.

150
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,530
Listen.

151
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,240
Screw you!

152
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,160
Get out!

153
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,920
Get out!

154
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,530
Get out!

155
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,360
All of you, get out!

156
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,170
Leave now.

157
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,720
I wanted you to be my Empress.

158
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,600
You should obey me, love me,

159
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,080
and be grateful to me,

160
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,320
treat me as your only master.

161
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,240
Not only did you not,

162
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,540
you even fooled around

163
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,860
with Xiao Duo in an unrestrained manner.

164
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,250
You bitch!

165
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,720
You can insist on me.

166
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,570
Why can't I

167
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,240
like Xiao Duo?

168
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,760
Ridiculous.

169
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,840
How can it be the same?

170
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,160
I'm a man.

171
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,360
I am the Emperor.

172
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,090
After all,

173
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,770
it's all about the consciousness of superiority and inferiority.

174
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,360
In your eyes, I'm lowly.

175
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,810
I'm a woman, an object.

176
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,730
You're superior.

177
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,450
I don't deserve to be compared with you.

178
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,130
My will is not worth mentioning.

179
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,410
You forced me

180
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,370
and insulted me with your power.

181
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,250
You made me cautious

182
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,160
day and night.

183
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,000
I've tried my best not to hate you.

184
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,050
For what reason did you ask me to love you?

185
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,400
For what reason did you ask me to

186
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,610
be grateful

187
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,040
for your doings?

188
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,130
Do you really think

189
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,850
I can't bear to kill you?

190
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,400
Kill me.

191
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,200
Do you dare?

192
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,890
You dare not.

193
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,360
You tried so hard

194
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,330
to appoint me as the Empress.

195
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,050
If I die at Fengyi Palace

196
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,760
before the Coronation ceremony,

197
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,210
your prestige as the Emperor

198
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,170
will be ruined at once.

199
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,010
You must be careful.

200
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,920
Don't beat me till death.

201
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,320
Other women

202
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,540
obey their husbands

203
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,340
and rely on authority.

204
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,020
But you,

205
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,010
only you!

206
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,020
You are rebellious

207
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,130
and stubborn.

208
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,080
What are you fighting for?

209
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,330
Just because of

210
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,770
the love affair between men and women?

211
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,330
Do you think

212
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,330
I only fight for love?

213
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,000
You are a man,

214
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,240
a royal heir,

215
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,570
and a king.

216
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,400
The rules of this world

217
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,650
should revolve around you

218
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,570
and please you.

219
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,290
Even when you are down and out,

220
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,800
you still have a choice.

221
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,100
You don't understand

222
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,100
the feeling you couldn't say

223
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,890
"I don't wish" or "I don't want"

224
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,250
since childhood.

225
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,610
You don't understand

226
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,080
what I'm fighting for.

227
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,210
Then tell me.

228
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,930
What don't you want?

229
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,370
And what do you want?

230
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,400
I don't want to be trapped in the Imperial City.

231
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,650
I don't want to be

232
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,840
anyone's puppet.

233
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,090
I just want to be

234
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,400
a living person.

235
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,760
Think about what I think, love what I love,

236
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,370
and hate what I hate.

237
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,120
Shut up!

238
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,170
I don't want to listen to your nonsense anymore.

239
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,770
Murong Gaogong.

240
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,850
Actually, our story

241
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,640
could have another storyline.

242
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,610
Let me tell you.

243
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,320
Let's assume that time goes back to the beginning of your reign.

244
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,010
I chose to listen to you

245
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:41,930
and obey you,

246
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,560
be your obedient, gentle

247
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,760
and sensible consort.

248
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,610
I might be in love with you

249
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,080
and give birth to a prince, it will be very blissful.

250
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,210
Then,

251
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,900
I would team up with Xiao Duo

252
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,370
to hold the Six Palaces under control and start a revolt.

253
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,970
At your unguarded moment,

254
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,930
we will kill you with a cup of wine containing Zhen's poison.

255
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,330
I will ask Xiao Duo

256
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,720
to announce our child as the new Emperor.

257
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,130
From then,

258
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,320
I would be the Empress Dowager.

259
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,000
I would own the world and rule the court.

260
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,490
I wouldn't care about the Three Fundamental Bonds and Five Constant Virtues anymore.

261
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,050
Everyone should only

262
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,680
obey my rules.

263
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,650
In this story,

264
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,160
I've been obedient.

265
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,240
Do you like it?

266
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,280
Are you crazy?

267
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,680
Xiao Duo turned you into

268
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,640
a crazy woman.

269
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,210
I've never

270
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,720
changed for anyone.

271
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,090
I've never been

272
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,570
the kind you imagine

273
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,650
who is obedient and sensible.

274
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,890
I didn't listen to you

275
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,490
because I pitied you

276
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,800
and didn't want to set you up.

277
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,690
But you kept forcing me

278
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,200
over and over again.

279
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,240
I

280
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,880
have a good idea.

281
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,810
At the Coronation ceremony,

282
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,730
when you and I become

283
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,890
the noblest husband and wife in the world,

284
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,090
I...

285
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,010
I will dismember Xiao Duo with five horses

286
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,610
as the best gift

287
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,530
for the Empress.

288
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,730
I'm

289
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,010
not kidding.

290
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,160
Three days later, at noon.

291
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,010
Time for the meal.

292
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,650
He was a formidable man who could turn a country upside down.

293
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,410
But now he ended up like this.

294
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,570
What a pity.

295
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,760
You touched the Emperor's woman.

296
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,570
You deserve it.

297
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,680
Let's go.

298
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,650
Zhuo Ying,

299
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,880
wait for me.

300
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,960
[Fengyi Palace]

301
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,040
Your Highness.

302
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,530
This is the phoenix coronet and robe sent by the Imperial Household Bureau.

303
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,250
Please try it.

304
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,090
Why is it red?

305
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,250
It's for the Coronation ceremony,

306
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,240
It should be red.

307
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,680
No.

308
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,120
It should be white.

309
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,080
White?

310
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,800
Yesterday,

311
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,920
didn't I wear white?

312
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,320
Yesterday?

313
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,440
The burial of Tribute Lady.

314
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,240
Isn't it yesterday?

315
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,240
Your Highness, you must be mistaken.

316
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,930
On the crossbeam of the tower,

317
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,490
there are numerous white ribbons,

318
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,640
countless white circles,

319
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,880
and pairs of women's feet

320
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,840
kicking

321
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,520
and kicking.

322
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,600
Their kicks make the white ribbon

323
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,170
flutter and flutter.

324
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,490
Your Highness, stop it.

325
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,730
They said

326
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,810
everything now

327
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,290
was just my imagination.

328
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,840
Actually, I was already dead

329
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,650
on the day of burial.

330
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,040
I saw Xiao Duo from the rope circle.

331
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,290
He was the last person

332
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,410
in my memory.

333
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,610
We never crossed paths.

334
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,520
He just sent me off.

335
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,360
Who are they?

336
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,970
They.

337
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,690
And they.

338
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,000
And they.

339
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,040
Your Highness.

340
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,200
I'll get the imperial physician for you.

341
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,840
This Imperial City

342
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,000
was carved with gold and jade

343
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,130
but buried human bones in the marble steps

344
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,360
and paved the way with blood.

345
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,690
It will tear my beloved and me into pieces

346
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,170
and devour us.

347
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,760
Let it be, no matter the Empress

348
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,370
or honor.

349
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,240
They are all jokes.

350
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,770

00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,240
so we hid here after that.

525
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,680
Zhaoding Guards

526
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,980
are so arrogant in normal times.

527
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,560
How is it?

528
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,760
You can't live without me at this critical moment, right?

529
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,530
What are you talking about?

530
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,890
Can't live without whom?

531
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,260
I think you owe some punches.

532
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,280
It hurts.

533
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,100
Raising you and the fugitives

534
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,770
together with the dog,

535
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm already having a headache.

536
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,280
Now you bring back

537
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,760
the chief of the fugitives.

538
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,770
Master, we are all acquaintances.

539
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,640
Give me some face.

540
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:51,720
No.

541
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,130
All the alleys

542
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,730
are covered with his wanted notice.

543
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,650
I won't get involved in this mess.

544
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,560
All of you, leave.

545
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,520
Thank you, Miss Meng.

546
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

547
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,770
I'll leave with my men.

548
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,010
Don't go.

549
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:08,850
There are Imperial Army outside.

00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,690
Where can you go?

551

Your Highness.

552
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,160
Are you worried about me?

553
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,300
Our relationship

554
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,680
seems not so harmonious.

555
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,360
I'm not.

556

who will go to the palace to save Wan Wan?

558
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,730
What's wrong with her?

559
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,840
She was locked up

560
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,010
by her Emperor brother.

561
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,690
Besides you,

562
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,240
I couldn't find other helpers.

563
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,560
Don't you want to save my junior?

564
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,090
How about we work together?

565
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,330
I don't think so.

566
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,170
Are you looking down on me?

567

Let me tell you.

573
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,320
two pairs of lovers separated forever?

take less of those nutritious soups.

What did you say?

603
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,250
I said...

604
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,680
The Zhaoding Bureau is good at covering up their tracks,

605
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,000
and their influence is widespread.

606
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,010
Now that Chief Xiao has escaped,

00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,170
I’m afraid it'll be hard to apprehend him.

Then we'll let him fall into a trap.

The Coronation ceremony?

It will be heavily guarded by the Imperial Army.

616
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:42,130
Chief Xiao knows that.

617
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,080
W- Will he really come?

618
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,570

come back in one piece.

698
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,330
Okay, I promise you.

699
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,770
Goodness me.

700
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,320
Are you all rushing

701
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,040
to die?

702
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,440
If you're done drinking, go ahead.

703
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,410
Thank you, Miss Meng.

704
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,130
You're welcome.

705
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,810
I put it all on your tab.

706
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,440
Did I say I would give one to you?

707
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,320
Thank you, Master.

708
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,600
Denghuo.

709
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,530
It's Xiao Duo.

710
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,120
Go!
