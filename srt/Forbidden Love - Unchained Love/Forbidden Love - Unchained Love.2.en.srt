But we can't change

61
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,580
the set name list.

but she didn't die.

64
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,020
This is against the rules.

65
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,540
If the Grand Secretariat asks about it,

66
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,500
I won't be able to take responsibility.

You took bribes

71
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,500
and traded with the names on the list.

72
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:49,060
How dare you talk to me about rules?

73
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,060
Remove her from the list.

74

the late emperor's journey to being a deity would be lonely

83

85
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,100
shouldn't we fulfill

He's leaving just like this?

127
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,300
Why did he leave without finishing his sentence?

128
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,500

Did we save the wrong person?

Do you really think she's stupid?

135
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,300
Think about the white ribbon that was strangling her.

136

There's something wrong with it?

137

are scared of him.

Someone so powerful has your back,

why didn't you tell me

154
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,220
earlier on?

155
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,820
I was worried about you for nothing.

156
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,420

I wouldn't have gone to the tower

158
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,820
for nothing.

159
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,100
I have nothing to do with him.

160
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,780
Think I'm this gullible?

161
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,820
If you don't know him, why would he save you?

162
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,180
Do you know

163
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,340
who got me back?

164

174

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,180
to rank above her.

176
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,780
What a feat.

177
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,580
Zhenshun Consort Dowager Duan.

178
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,660
What a beautiful name.

179
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,580
Zhenshun Consort Dowager Duan?

180
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,700
Me?

181
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,180
Why does it sound so bad?

182
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,340
She has only been in the palace for three months.

183
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,620
Not to mention being favored,

184
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,020
the late emperor

185
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,980
hasn't even met her.

186
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,100
She must've played some tricks.

187
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,210
Be it she's pretending to be dumb

188
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,460
or acting indifferent,

189
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,260
I don't care.

190
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,500
But I'm afraid Prince Fu's feelings for her is true.

191
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Otherwise, why would a grounded Imperial Disciple

192
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,780
go through all this trouble

193
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,420
to save a mere lady?

194
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,020
If I can control her,

195
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,540
Prince Fu will be at my disposal.

196
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,660
Find a proper position

197
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,020
and make her a Great Consort.

198
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,060
Since ancient times,

199
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,540
there hasn't been a living person who has a posthumous name.

200
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,050
Lady Bu

201
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,380
is so lucky.

202
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,220
What should her posthumous name be?

203
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,940
Zhenshun Consort Dowager Duan.

204
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,100
That sounds good.

205
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,620
Why was I

206
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,500
appointed as Zhenshun Consort Dowager Duan for no reason?

207
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,340
Are you hot, Your Highness?

208
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,900
No. Is Chief Xiao hot?

209
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,020
How about I fan you?

210
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,100
No need to trouble you, Your Highness.

211
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,900
It's no trouble at all.

212
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,700
You saved my life. It's the least I can do.

213
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,900
Thank you, Your Highness. I'm not hot.

214
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,180
You're not hot?

215
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,100
I am.

216
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,180
He's not saying anything,

217
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,220
what's his motive?

218
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,420
So pretentious and full of flattery.

219
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,740
Come, give me a hand.

220
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,060
This is Pear with Rock Sugar

221
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,860
made by the Imperial Kitchen.

222
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,140
It's good for your throat.

223
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,740
You don't like pear soup?

224
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,500
Why is he making me

225
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,740
drink pear soup for no reason?

226
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,260
I like it.

227
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,260
I like it a lot.

228
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,820
Please enjoy.

229
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,060
Do you need me

230
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,180
to feed you?

231
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,090
No need.

232
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,300
I'll do it myself.

233
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,220
I heard that since you entered the palace,

234
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,780
His Majesty has never visited you.

235
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,540
I'm useless.

236
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,060
All I did was eat

237
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,300
even my waist is a round thicker now.

238
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,060
What do you mean?

239
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,780
What's wrong with his lips?

240
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,180
He wants me so openly.

241
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,660
Has he taken a liking to me?

242
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,100
I really can't do this.

243
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,860
I...

244
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,340
I don't have many strengths,

245
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,300
but have many shortcomings.

246
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,220
Look.

247
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,730
I snore and kick the blanket when I sleep,

248
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,020
I don't even know how to wash clothes, make clothes,

249
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,780
or mend clothes.

250
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,180
I would even lose nine out of ten card games.

251
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,180
I'm really not suitable

252
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,020
for living together with.

253
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,860
If you really want to get married,

254
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,660
why don't you go out

255
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,100
and check other places?

256
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,620
Get married?

257
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,580
You, me?

258
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,770
Chief Xiao, Chief Xiao.

259
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,860
It’s a misunderstanding.

260
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,540
It's a misunderstanding.

261
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:27,860
It's all a misunderstanding.

262
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,540
I knew it.

263
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,940
Chief Xiao,

264
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,900
you saved me from danger.

265
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,020
You're a good person.

266
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,260
Bad people can't be

267
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,260
so good-looking.

268
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,380
With this face,

269
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,620
would you do something like this?

270
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,570
Of course not! Tong Yun,

271
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,620
who made up this rumor?

272
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,860
Don't let them in

273
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,770
in the future.

274
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,460
Chief Xiao,

275
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,580
I can’t repay you for saving my life.

276
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,940
From now on,

277
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,820
we are sisters.

278
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,620
Sisters?

279
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,940
Wrong word.

280
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,340
Good friends... Good friends.

281
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,340
Everything aside,

282
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,420
we are strangers no more.

283
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,100
Since you don't treat me as an outsider,

284
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,500
I would like to

285
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,100
to borrow something from you.

286
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,260
What do you mean by borrow?

287
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,100
Just take whatever you like.

288
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,300
This hairpin

289
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,180
doesn't look like it's from the palace.

290
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,260
You brought it from the Bu's residence, right?

291
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,860
I will borrow it.

292
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,340
Chief Xiao,

293
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,900
if you like this,

294
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,940
just take it.

295
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,660
Don't worry.

296
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,580
I'm a tight-lipped,

297
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,860
I will never gossip about it.

298
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,060
If there's anything else you like,

299
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,380
take whatever you want.

300
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,780
Tong Yun,

301
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,580
pack the things in my box

302
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,500
and pass them to Chief Xiao.

303
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,140
You should keep those for yourself.

304
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,300
If people find out,

305
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,260
they'll think I've robbed you.

306
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,740
Yes.

307
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,220
Chief Xiao, you're right.

308
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,740
We’d better keep a low profile.

309
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,300
If you like anything,

310
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,100
just tell me.

311
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,260
It's not convenient for you,

312
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,420
but it's convenient for me.

313
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,980
Mistress, what's wrong with you?

314
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,140
Look at him.

315
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,060
He's so scary.

316
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,700
It's okay.

317
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,300
You seemed

318
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,740
quite calm just now.

319
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,620
Didn't you pretend to be close to him,

320
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,860
and tried to be sisters with him?

321
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,140
You believed that?

322
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,860
In order to save my life,

323
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,250
I have to put up a strong act.

324
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,340
But

325
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,980
I think you two look quite close.

326
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,780
You call that close?

327
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,260
That's called a near-death experience!

328
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,140
He saved my life

329
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,140
for no reason,

330
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,620
and is treating me so well.

331
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,340
For one,

332
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,740
he's not after me for my beauty.

333
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,860
And secondly,

334
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,980
he's not after me for my intelligence.

335
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,620
Let me ask you,

336
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,820
what else

337
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,980
is there left on me?

338
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,500
Nothing.

339
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,420
Exactly.

340
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,020
I'm poor and dumb.

341
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,940
Would you believe me

342
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,020
if I say he's just being generous?

343
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,940
I'm afraid the things he wants

344
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,540
can kill me too.

345
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,500
What should we do?

346
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:58,820
What should we do?

347
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,620
Since we can't avoid it,

you shouldn't take it too much.

521
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,260
I'm meeting the Empress tomorrow.

522
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,500
It's better to be careful.

523
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,220
I can't make any mistakes.

524
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,300
How would you make any mistake?

525
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,140
Your disguise

526
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,380
is so real.

527
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,500
No flaws at all.

528
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,980
Didn't Consort Dowager Duan say

529
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,580
she wants to be your sister?

530
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,060
I'm just worried

531
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,740
that it might actually become real...

532
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,660
Do you think

533
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,140
this medicine will really affect your...

534

Have some tea.

535
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,900
From now on,

536
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,820
we are sisters.

537
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,340
After Her Highness heard that Chief Xiao is

538
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,580
[Empress Rong'an's servant, Yilan]

539
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,380
coming to Fengyi Palace,

540
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,370
she was very happy

541
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,620
and asked me

542
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,980
to wait at the door since morning.

543
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,820
Chief Xiao, it's late.

544
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,820
You should leave now

545
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,140
if you want to see Her Highness.

546

Yes.

549
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,980
You're so thoughtful.

550

It's late,

00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,020
and you're still here to greet me?

552
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,700
I just made an incense.

553
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,260
Smell it. Does it smell good?

554
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,260
Your Highness, incense-making skills are excellent,

555
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,660
it is absolutely refreshing.

556

But these days,

559

the embroiderers of the Royal Clothing Service

560
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,380
are in a hurry to make mourning clothes for each palace.

561
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,460
Prince Rong is growing very quickly,

562
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,340
the embroidery girls have to measure him

563
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,140
to find out what size he wears.

564
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,460
I have no choice

565
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,060
but to come and disturb you.

566
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,700
You are my servant.

567
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,500
Why do you care about Prince Rong?

568
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,860
Do you know

569
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,890
my size?

570
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:31,730
Why don't you

571
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,060
measure

572
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,500
my clothing size?

573
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,660
Of course,

574
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,260
I know it by heart.

575
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,860
But I really don't know

576
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,700
Prince Rong's size.

but to see Prince Rong.

00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,300
Fair enough.

After all,

583

Prince Rong is the future emperor.

584

is asleep.

No need to be so polite.

693
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,220
I'll leave it to you then.

694
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,860
Just like this?

695
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,500
Don't you want to

696
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,820
trial me first?

697
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,330
No need.

698
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,620
Your Highness is brave and resourceful.

699
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,460
You will succeed.

00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:31,940
Tonight,

no matter what it takes,

702
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,100
you must stall the Empress in Shangyin Palace

703
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,260
until past nine.

704
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:38,780
Why...

705
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,100
Why do I have to stall the Empress?

706
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,140
Does your neck still hurt?

707
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,220
I'll do it!

708
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,780
It's just stalling the Empress,

709
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,180
I'll stall her until the end of the world

710
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:48,780
and beyond.

711
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,180
Thank you, Your Highness.

712
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,180
Godfather, you're really getting

713
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,140
Consort Dowager Duan to do this?

714
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,980
Didn't you not trust her?

715
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,980
It doesn't matter if I trust her.

716
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,060
If she wants to live,

717
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,180
she knows what to do.

718
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,180
She tried so hard

719
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,660
to get on the boat of Prince Fu.

720
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,900
Think she can just keep to herself from now on?

free lunch in this world.

724
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,580
If Her Majesty finds out,

725
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,740
she will die.

726
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,900
It'd be hard to explain to Prince Fu.

727
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,420
It can be troublesome...

728
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,620
Let's just wish her good luck then.

how important the ceremony is.

735
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,580
Looking at this with my own eyes,

736
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,340
isn't that a lie?

737
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,860
Think about it, the late Emperor

738
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,220
was so powerful when he was alive.

739
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,410
All the concubines wanted a piece of him.

740

Now that he's gone,

Mistress,

745
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,460
you're taking pity on the late Emperor.

746
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,460
You're so kind.

747
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,940
Not really.

748
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,740
It's just that

Mistress,

752
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,220
do you think what we were tasked can be done?

753
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,380
How about trying to just

754
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,540
gloss it over?

755
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,260
Look at her.

756
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,860
Do you think she's someone

757
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,180
