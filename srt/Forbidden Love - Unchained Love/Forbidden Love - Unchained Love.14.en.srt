Miss, why are you back so late?

she missed you terribly.

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,660
it's your father who's not letting you in.

81
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,900
He said

82
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,540
he wants to talk to Her Highness

83
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,580
in private.

84
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,260
Maybe he thinks

85
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,980
you don't deserve to listen in.

86
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,620
You've gone too far!

87
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,020
This is nothing.

89
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,620
there might be worse things coming to you.

90
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,020
Calm down.

91
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,940
Chief Xiao,

92
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,460
must you stay here?

93
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,260
After what has happened,

94
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,060
I dare not leave Her Highness' side.

95
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,060
If you have anything to say,

96
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,620
just say it.

97
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,780
I know

98
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,260
you have been bearing a grudge.

99
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,820
Yinlou, for my sake,

100
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,940
let this go.

101
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,460
Father, you've misunderstood.

102
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,420
I have always had nothing but respect

103
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,299
for Mother and you.

104
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,140
I listened

105
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,539
to whatever you said.

106
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,620
You said my mother had recovered,

107
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,100
didn't I believe you then?

108
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,820
Well...

109
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,580
You know?

110
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,180
I didn't tell you

111
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,340
because I didn't want you to be sad.

112
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,900
Back then,

113
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,980
she went there

114
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,970
because she took things too hard.

115
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,020
Why was she taking things too hard?

116
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,020
Because when the imperial edict

117
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,500
was passed to all the aristocratic families,

118
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,060
the Bu family had to send a daughter into the palace.

119
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,860
It should have been the legitimate daughter.

120
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,340
But your wife saw that

121
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,500
the late Emperor was old

122
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,780
and nearing the end of his life,

123
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,540
so in order to protect her own daughter's future,

124
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,060
she threatened me with my mother's life

125
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,580
to force me to enter the palace instead.

126
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,620
How could my mother not take it too hard?

127
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,700
Yinlou.

128
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,140
You and your mother have suffered,

129
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,610
I feel pained for you too.

130
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,820
But if it wasn't for that,

131
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,420
you wouldn't be so lucky today.

132
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,100
If your mother knew,

133
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,900
she would be happy for you.

134
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,500
We are

135

family.

136
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,380
If this matter gets out of hand,

137
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,980
it won't do our family any good.

138
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:20,780
Yinlou,

139
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,180
let your mother

140
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,930
off the hook.

141
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,460
This isn't the first time Mother

142
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,220
has tried to take my life.

143
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,300
What do you mean?

144
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,500
Where did you

145
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,780
hear this from?

146
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,020
What a coincidence.

147
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,140
Your wife bribed a concubine at the mausoleum

148
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,100
to assassinate Her Highness.

149
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,340
The Zhaoding Bureau has the case files ready,

150
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,500
we just haven't had the chance to present it to His Majesty.

151
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,020
Do you want to take a look?

152
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,700
If we include this case,

153
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,540
how serious is her crime?

154
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,020
It's not serious.

155
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,500
You might be sent into exile and have your property seized

156
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,660
or

157
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,380
the whole family might be executed.

Chief Xiao.

159
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,060
But I'm a member of the Bu family too.

160
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,460
Your Highness.

161
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,340
You are Consort Dowager Duan.

162
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,770
I have failed to discipline my household.

163
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,340
This is my crime.

164
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,060
Your Highness.

165
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,740
If you have to punish her,

166
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,340
then punish me

167
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,140
as well.

168
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,220
What are you doing?

169
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,180
This isn't up to me either.

170
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,020
How about I ask Chief Xiao instead?

171
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,700
Chief Xiao.

172
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,980
How about we let this slide?

173
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,020
Your Highness.

174
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,500
This is no longer

175
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,460
your family's private matter.

176
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,940
It concerns the dignity of the royal family.

177
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,300
If I don't report it,

178
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,820
I would have committed a crime of decepetion towards His Majesty.

179
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,140
That's true.

180
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,020
This is rather troublesome.

181
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,140
How about this?

182
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,900
We'll report this together with the case at the mausoleum.

183
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,940
Our whole family will plead guilty.

184
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,340
We are family,

185
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,940
we should share weal and woe.

186
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,300
If word gets out,

187
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,740
everyone will praise you

188
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,460
for being a good head of the family,

189
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,780
and protecting the Bu's good name.

190
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,900
Father, this would be good for your reputation too.

191
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:23,900
How benevolent of Your Highness.

192
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,420
I'll return to the Zhaoding Bureau

193
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,860
to retrieve the case files for the mausoleum incident,

194
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,140
and present them together with today's matter

195
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,380
to His Majesty.

196
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,340
We're done here.

197
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,540
I'll leave now.

198
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,620
Father.

199
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,940
Take care.

200
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:52,940
Chief Xiao.

201
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,500
Chief Xiao.

202
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,180
Chief Xiao.

203
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,700
Please wait, Chief Xiao.

204
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,340
Chief Xiao.

205
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,460
My wife's lack of virtue

206
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,540
is a misfortune to this family.

207
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,260
I have decided to divorce her.

208
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,820
Tomorrow, I will send her

209
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,820
to the ancestral temple to repent for her actions.

210
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,820
Father.

211
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,300
What are you talking about?

212
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,660
How could you divorce Mother?

213
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,660
Don't worry.

214
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,340
I'll ask His Majesty

215
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,330
to delay your departure by a few days,

216
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,860
so that preparations can be made properly.

217
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,020
When you get married in West Shu,

218
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,100
your mother's wishes would be fulfilled too.

219
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,820
Father, I don't want to get married.

220
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,180
At this point,

221
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,260
I am too ashamed

222
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,460
to marry into the Nanyuan family.

223
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,020
They won't tolerate me either.

224
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,020
Grand Tutor Bu,

225
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,980
I have no restraint

226
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:48,900
when I do things.

227
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,700
If this happens again,

228
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,540
no matter what,

229
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,900
I will definitely

230
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,220
blow the matter up,

231
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,900
and make it a source of entertainment for Her Highness.

232
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,540
Your Highness.

233
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,500
Cao Chun'ang,

234
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,020
take good care of the Bu residence.

235
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,090
Yes.

236
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,060
Father.

237
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,680
What? You don't feel better?

238
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,900
If they've made you suffer,

239
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,770
just make them suffer extra in return.

240
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,540
If you want,

241
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,180
I can order the immediate execution

242
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,180
of the Bu family.

243
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,620
You're egging me on to murder my own family?

244
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,980
So what?

245
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,380
Apart from you, all of them

246
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,660
are rotten people.

247
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,020
Do you really still value

248
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,460
your relationship with your father,

249
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,380
after so much has happened?

250
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,020
If your father didn't turn a blind eye

251
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,500
to the rivalry between his wives,

252
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,540
your legitimate mother and legitimate sister

253
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,900
wouldn't be so arrogant.

254
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,060
I know.

255
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,180
My father

256
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,100
is a calculating person.

257
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,810
He acts only when there are benefits in it for him.

258
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,060
As long as he isn't harmed,

259
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,140
he doesn't care what happens to others.

260
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,780
I'm nothing to him.

261
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,420
However many doubts I had in the past,

262
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,220
I understand it now.

263
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,180
I don't feel any

264
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,500
filial love for him.

265
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,540
Then why are you sad?

266
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,940
I'm sad for my mother.

267
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,900
Mother, you're using the wrong thread.

268
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,500
Won't you undo it?

269
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,340
This is Father's birthday gift.

270
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,900
Let it be wrong.

271
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,780
Maybe it has been wrong from the very beginning.

272
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,250
There is no going back now.

273
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,060
Although she didn't say anything,

274
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,180
I knew

275
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,820
Father meant something to her.

276
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,540
After Father used that silk pendant

277
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,260
a few times,

278
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,690
he never did again.

279
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,020
He said he'd lost it.

280
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,580
My mother's feelings

281
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,020
were nothing

282
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,100
to him.

283
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,780
To him,

284
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,740
even her death

285
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:01,900
is as if he had merely lost

286
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,420
a useless tea set.

287
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,940
Do you hate him?

288
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,300
Even though he made her unable to live freely,

289
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,380
she couldn't hate him.

290
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,540
If she couldn't,

291
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,660
why should I?

292
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,260
After all,

293
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,540
in this life, he became my father,

294
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,579
and I became his daughter.

295
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,300
But neither of us asked each other

296
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,540
whether we were willing to.

297
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,060
Let's just keep pretending like

298
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,580
we have a cordial relationship.

299
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,900
After all, it's all the same to me

300
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,820
whether or not I have a home.

301
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,540
Who said that?

302
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,700
You have a home.

303
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,580

304
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,620
We're home.

[Xiao's Residence]

306
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,260
It's all because of the Bu family.

307
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,700
Her Highness' identity

308
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,700
has spread throughout the capital.

309
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,980
It's being discussed

310
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,540
in every teahouse and tavern, big and small.

311
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,780
This morning, at court,

312
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,260
several ignorant remonstrance officials

313
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,700
even criticized you for this matter.

314
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,900
Reprimanded me for what?

315
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,660
Tell me.

316
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,180
I dare not.

317
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,500
Let me tell you then.

318
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,500
They must have scolded me

319
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,380
for claiming the late Emperor's concubine for myself,

320
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,090
violating proper morality,

321
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,940
and lacking in virtue as an Emperor.

325
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,460
inform me that you were coming?

326
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,060
Greetings, Your Majesty.

327
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,940
No need.

328
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,300
How dare I ask you to greet me

329
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,980
when you have all these spirit talismans on you?

330

You don't understand.

called calligraphy.

333
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,220
Okay, let me take a look.

[Fearing negligence, one concludes with assiduity]

00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,540
when he advised the Emperor to be diligent.

349
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,740
Yinlou, do you also want to emulate a famous minister,

350
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,060
and advise me to be diligent?

351
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,620
Do you also think I have been negligent of my duties?

352
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,140
I don't want to emulate anyone

353
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,300
or advise anyone.

354
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,420
I only know that

355
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,220
that Emperor was an illustrious

356
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,300
and virtuous Emperor.

357
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,900
Your Majesty should be

358
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,740
a virtuous Emperor too.

359
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,780
Under your governance,

360
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,740
the world will be peaceful.

361
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,020
Future generations will praise you.

362
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,100
I didn't expect

363
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,180
you would be the one

364
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,580
who knows me best.

365
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,010
That's not true.

366
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,300
I only wrote a few words.

367
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,860
Since His Majesty likes it so much,

368
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,420
why don't you mount it

369
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,180
and gift it to me?

370
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:49,940
Your Majesty.

371
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,060
I just got word that you were here.

372
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,180
My apologies for not welcoming you.

373
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,850
It's fine. You came at the right time.

374
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,740
I have something to discuss with you.

375
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,500
You must already know

376
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,940
the situation at court.

377
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,980
Rumors are spreading.

378
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,660
What should we do?

379
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,460
Dealing with gossip is much like dealing with the river.

380
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,340
If the rivers are obstructed and flood, many people will be hurt.

381
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,620
It is the same with people.

382
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,540
Since the rumors can't be stopped,

383
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,180
in my opinion,

384
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,100
it's better to redirect them than to block them.

385
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,260
What does that mean?

386
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,380
The crux of redirecting the rumors

387
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,330
lies with Her Highness.

388
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,460
Everyone knows that

389
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,260
Your Majesty has an affair with Her Highness.

390
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,340
Why don't you let Her Highness

391
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,380
lie low in West Shu with me,

392
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,420
under the guise of escorting her sister to get married?

393
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,820
As time goes by,

394
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,700
the rumours will die down.

395
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,660
She isn't going anywhere.

396
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,220
His Majesty bears the Mandate of Heaven

397
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,580
to be a benevolent ruler of the world.

398
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,740
Like a piece of jade covered in dust,

399
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,380
it will be bad if your good name were tainted, as you will lose the trust of the people.

400
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,460
This would be endlessly detrimental.

401
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,700
I don't want to emulate anyone,

402
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,860
or advise anyone.

403
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,940
I only know that

404
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,660
that Emperor was an illustrious

405
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,740
and virtuous emperor.

406
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,420
Your Majesty should be

407
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,340
a virtuous Emperor too.

408
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,300
Under your governance,

409
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,100
the world will be peaceful.

410
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,300
Future generations will praise you.

411
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,420
Fine.

412
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,060
It has been tough on her

413
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,260
these past few days.

414
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,020
I'll take it as she has gone out to relax.

415
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,180
But remember,

416
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,340
bring her safely

417
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,540
back to me.

418
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

419
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,500
One more thing.

420
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,420
Even Yinlou has advised me to work hard.

421
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,180
It looks like I've been neglecting my duties for too long.

422
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,100
I've gone overboard.

423
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,380
I don't want Yinlou to look down on me.

424
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,420
So from now on,

425
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,420
Zhaoding Bureau should submit reviewed memorials

426
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,620
to Shangqiong Palace.

427
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,500
I want to read them

428
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,980
one by one.

429
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,020
Yes.

430
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,250
"Fearing negligence,

431
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,100
one begins with careful consideration and concludes with assiduity."

432
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,900
You're asking me to use this sentence

433
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,740
to persuade His Majesty to be diligent in governance?

434
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:47,820
What does this have to do

435
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,060
with me leaving the capital?

436
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,300
What matters is not persuading him to be diligent,

437
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,740
but that this sentence

438
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,900
was said as advice to an illustrious Emperor.

439
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,580
All Emperors wish

440
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,700
to go down in history as virtuous rulers.

441
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,460
So you only need to

442
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,340
flatter him

443
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,060
for me to take the opportunity

444
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,620
to persuade him to send you out of the capital in order to quell gossip.

445
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,180
It's a double-pronged solution.

446
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,140
I see.

447
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,060
I am the stain

448
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,780
on His Majesty's reputation.

449
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,340
If he wants to protect his reputation,

450
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,340
he must send me out of the capital.

451
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,660
That's right.

452
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,340
Impressive!

453
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,980
You're good at reading people.

454
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,700
But

455
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,380
isn't advising His Majesty to be diligent in governance

456
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,860
an indirect way of

457
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,020
saying that he's lazy?

458
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,860
Wouldn't it anger him?

459
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,500
Should I say something else?

460
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,100
No, that's exactly what you have to say.

461
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:43,980
His Majesty has started to

462
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,330
become wary of me,

463
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,100
and is thinking about curbng my power.

464
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,380
But he can't

465
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,700
bring this up to me outright.

466
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,010
You persuading him to be diligent

467
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,900
will give him an opening

468
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,420
to reorganize the court.

469
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,980
That's exactly what he wants.

470
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,460
He won't hesitate to use you as an excuse

471
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,820
to bring this up.

472
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,180
Besides,

473
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,610
if His Majesty is diligent,

474
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,700
it's a good thing

475
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,300
for the country, and for the people.

476
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,020
Since you know His Majesty

477
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,140
has begun distrusting you,

478
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,340
can you afford to leave the capital now?

479
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,780
What if something happens at the capital

480
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,140
when you leave?

481
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,500
Besides,

482
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,420
it's not like you won't come back.

483
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,540
Not necessarily.

484
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,980
Perhaps

485
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,220
I really won't come back.

486
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,500
Stop joking.

487
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,130
You're leaving soon.

488
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,420
If His Majesty

489
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,900
doesn't come to see me soon,

490
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,980
I won't be able to leave.

491
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,220
Tomorrow morning at court,

492
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,540
His Majesty will be criticized by the remonstrance officials.

493
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,380
I saw the memorials

494
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,820
when they were reviewed by the Zhaoding Bureau.

495
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,260
Their words are unrestrained and agitated.

496
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,180
His Majesty

497
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,220
will be furious.

498
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,380
When that happens,

499
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,300
he will have nowhere to vent his anger.

500
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,740
He will come to see you.

501
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,560
[Mission]

502
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,460
If you don't want to enter the palace,

503
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,900
rumors are a great opportunity.

504
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,780
It's an opportunity to go with the flow

505
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,700
and let it bring you

506
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,970
[Accomplished]

507
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,500
to West Shu with me.

508
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,440
[Mission accomplished]

509
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,660
Mistress,

510
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,340
do you really plan to go to West Shu

511
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,300
with Chief Xiao?

512
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,860
I thought

513
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,300
you wanted to take this opportunity

514
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,540
to beg Chief Xiao to help you escape?

515
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,180
Tongyun,

516
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,350
you are getting very bold.

517
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,100
You might dare do that, but I don't.

518
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,980
There is no one you're attached to

519
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,380
in the capital anymore.

520
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,660
What are you afraid of?

521
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,860
Chief Xiao is taking me to West Shu

522
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,340
on His Majesty’s orders.

523
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,380
If we run away,

524
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,460
what will he do?

525
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,900
How is he to report back?

526
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,300
Besides,

527
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,060
going to West Shu

528
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,300
isn't bad either.

529
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,020
I haven't been back in many years.

530
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,540
My cousin's family is there too.

531
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,500
When my mother was alive,

532
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,700
she talked about them a lot.

533
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,940
It's just as well that I can go back and visit them.

534
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,020
Your Highness was so proud

535
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,580
a few days ago.

536
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,940
Why are you so downtrodden now?

537
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,460
You look like you're fleeing the capital to take refuge.

538
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,210
I heard His Majesty has grown tired of you.

539
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,500
Now, it seems that's true.

540
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,980
Of course.

541
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,380
Why do you know everything?

542
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,700
There isn't even enough of my luggages

543
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,140
on this ship.

544
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,620
You're just an illegitimate daughter,

545
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,700
who are you to get on?

546
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,940
Throw her luggage off!

547
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,580
What are you doing?

548
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,660
What are you doing?

549
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,020
My bag!

550
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,860
What are you doing?

551
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,220
What are you doing?

552
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:16,780
Let go!

553
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,820
Bu Yinlou!

554
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,860
How dare you throw my stuff?

555
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,940
How dare you hit me?

556
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,900
I was so focused on hitting your mother last time,

557
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,330
I forgot to hit you.

558
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,900
I'll make it up to you this time.

559
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,380
You...

560
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,100
Hit her back!

561
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,020
Who dares?

562
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,580
Who dares?

563
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,420
Since Miss Bu

564
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,540
is unhappy with the big ship,

565
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,660
we'll get her another one.

566
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:57,740
Cao Chun'ang.

567
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,100
Take her to the small ship at the back.

568
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,860
This one is for Her Highness.

569
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,620
Please.

570
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,610
Thank you.

571
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,220
But

572
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,180
isn't the small ship yours?

573
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,260
If they go there,

574
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,620
where will you go?

575
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,380
I'll take this ship with you,

576
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,100
of course.

577
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,380
Our rooms

578
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,260
are so close together.

579
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,500
There are only two rooms on this ship.

580
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,340
It's a good thing they are near each other.

581
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,580
This way, if there's anything you need,

582
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,140
it'll be convenient for me to serve you.

583
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,900
I- I don't sleep well at night.

584
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,860
I'm scared I will disturb you.

585
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,860
That’s a problem.

586
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,460
How about this?

587
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,540
If you're not sleeping well at night,

588
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,370
I'll knock on the wall,

589
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,900
and disturb you back.

590
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,740
How about

591
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,140
I move to another room...

592
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,420
This one it is then.

593
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,090
This government ship

594
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,900
has over ten rooms in total.

595
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,340
Are there really only those two rooms?

596
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,500
Shush.

597
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,140
Godfather,

598
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,380
tell me the truth.

599
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,620
Do you

600
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,180
have feelings for Her Highness?

601
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,620
So what if I do?

602
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,940
I beg you.

603
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,660
Please behave yourself.

604
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,700
Are you afraid that others

605
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,300
won't notice?

606
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,500
What is your status?

607
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,540
What is her status?

608
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,540
She is His Majesty's woman.

609
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,380
Even if you have feelings for her,

610
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,860
you must try your hardest to hide it away.

611
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,740
Otherwise, not only will you harm her,

612
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,220
you will also harm yourself.

613
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,420
Yinlou.

614
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,820
Greetings, Princess.

615
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,340
Wan Wan.

616
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,020
Wan Wan.

617
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,850
Let me see you off.

618
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,860
These are all for you, eat them the way.

619
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:01,860
Thank you.

620
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,260
Where is the Young Prince?

621
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,260
Don't bring him up.

622
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,900
His Majesty put him under house arrest.

623
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,090
It's hard even for me

624
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,380
to see him now.

625
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,860
Why was he put under house arrest?

626
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,620
Ever since the Lantern Festival,

627
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,260
His Majesty has been getting more wary

628
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,220
of the Prince of Nanyuan.

629
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,860
He's even been getting more cautious

630
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,060
of the Young Prince.

631
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,780
All of a sudden, he issued the edict.

632
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,940
What do his brother's actions

633
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,260
have to do with him?

634
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,300
Nobility yesterday,

635
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,540
prisoner today.

636
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,980
That is imperial power.

637
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,740
Nobility yesterday, prisoner today.

638
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:38,820
What is your status?

639
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,900
What is her status?

640
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,700
She is His Majesty's woman.

641
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,580
Even if you have feelings for her,

642
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,060
you must try your hardest to hide it away.

643
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,940
Otherwise, not only will you harm her,

644
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,540
you will also harm yourself.

645
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,260
It's time to set sail.

646
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,300
Thank you for seeing us off.

647
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,180
Wan Wan, in this life,

648
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,700
there are some people

649
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,820
you only get to meet once.

650
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,340
The past and the future

651
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,140
are unpredictable,

652
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,980
so all the more you must cherish them.

653
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,860
The Young Prince

654
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,139
is very sensitive.

655
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,620
He cries when he's sad.

656
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,060
You should visit him often.

657
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,219
I see.

658
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,340
You should get going.

659
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,620
Take care.

660
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,380
Take care.

661
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,820
Your Majesty.

662
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,180
They're gone?

663
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,220
Yes.

664
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,580
At this moment,

665
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,740
the government ship should have already left

666
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,900
the capital region.

667
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,780
Archery

668
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,980
is an essential skill for an Emperor.

669
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,380
But I've never learned it.

670
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,260
From now on, I'll learn all those skills one by one.

671
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,100
I'll learn diligently.

672
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,180
I want to learn

673
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,380
how to be a good Emperor.

674
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:17,860
Yes.

675
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,300
By the time Yinlou comes back,

676
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,300
I will have become

677
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,460
a true ruler of a prosperous land.

678
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,780
No one will dare

679
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,660
criticize my actions

680
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,900
anymore.

681
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:38,900
Again.

691
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,260
♫ Are all I can think about ♫

692
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,720
♫ The years are bustling with activity ♫

693
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,210
♫ But I have been mesmerized ♫

694
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,640
♫ The way you look ♫

695
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,030
♫ The smoke and rain in your eyes ♫

696
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,120
♫ Render mandarin ducks shy ♫

697
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,280
♫ The dragon is joined by the phoenix in his dance ♫

698
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,950
♫ The couple of pearl and jade traverses the world ♫

699
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,970
♫ I wish lovers can be freed from their longing ♫

700
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,790
♫ And meet by the magpie bridge ♫

701
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,700
Mistress,

702
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,660
your seasickness is so serious.

703
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,940
Take this medicine.

704
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,620
No, it’s bitter.

705
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,140
Then I’ll ask Chief Xiao

706
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:39,940
for some candied fruits.

707
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,220
No.

708
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,660
It's not a big deal.

709
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,340
If he knows,

710
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,020
he'll worry about me again.

711
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,210
I know very well

712
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,700
that he likes me.

713
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,540
I can't pretend I don't know,

714
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,860
and neither can I try to talk him out of it.

715
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,580
It's a tough place to be in.

716
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,020
Mistress...

717
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,540
Your seasickness is really quite serious.

718
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,100
It's made you go from imagining things to fantasizing.

719
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,500
He really likes me!

720
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,260
You're seasick?

721
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,580
Why didn't you tell me?

722
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,660
I don't want it. It's bitter.

723
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,660
It's sweet.

724
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,580
It's really sweet?

725
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,130
I asked the kitchen

726
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,220
to grind candied fruit into a powder.

727
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,620
It takes a while for the medicine to take effect.

728
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,210
If you press on the jiuwei acupoint, the vomiting will stop.

729
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,540
You'll feel better.

730
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,420
What acupoint?

731
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,700
Come on, do it for me.

732
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,140
I'd better ask Tongyun to come.

733
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,700
No need. You do it.

734
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,180
The location of this acupoint

735
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,340
is not convenient.

736
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,100
It's just an acupoint.

737
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,140
What's so inconvenient about it?

738
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,420
Come on.

739
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,420
What are you doing?

740
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,540
The jiuwei acupoint is 7 fingers above the belly button.

741
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,620
Why is it there?

742
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,380
It hurts.

743
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,380
It hurts.

744
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,820
I'll be gentle.

745
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,020
Does it still hurt?

746
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,340
Yes.

747
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,460
It hurts badly.

748
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,340
You shouldn't press on this acupoint for too long.

749
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,420
I'll take my leave.

750
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:17,540
[Tanxi Temple]

751
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,420
Incense is the best thing

752
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,340
in the world.

753
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,330
Meditation, playing the zither, sacrificial rites.

754
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,140
All of them

755
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,490
need incense as an accompaniment.

756
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,700
At first, I didn't see

757
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,850
what was so great about it.

758
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,220
Now,

759
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,620
I'm getting addicted to it.

760
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,260
In the past,

761
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,460
I was too heavy-handed.

762
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,580
I didn't know to plan before I acted,

763
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,940
or to practice restraint.

764
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,620
It was Xiao Duo

765
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,220
who taught me those things.

766
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,740
This sachet of incense

767
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,020
will give its user nightmares every night,

768
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,460
and disturb their frame of mind.

769
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,500
Eunuch Zhang, who serves the Empress Dowager,

770
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,500
is indebted to me.

771
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,420
Pass this to him.

772
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,090
Tell him to send it to Shangqiong Palace as soon as possible.

773
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,980
Yes, I understand.

774
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,100
Who is it?

775
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,740
Uncle.

776
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:00,780
Uncle.
