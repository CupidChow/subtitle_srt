172
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,780
In your opinion then,

173
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,740
what should we do?

174
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,410
Hand over the powers of reviewing memorials immediately.

175
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,620
We'll ask the Empress Dowager

176
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,100
to appoint regent ministers

177
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,940
to assist the young Emperor.

178
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,260
His Majesty has only just passed,

179
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
and the Grand Secretary already cannot wait to appropriate the powers of regency,

180
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,500
How immense your loyalty is.

181
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:33,780
Right.

182
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,580
The Grand Secretary has always been concerned with state affairs.

183
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,420
On the 15th of last month,

184
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,100
the Grand Secretary held a birthday celebration.

185
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,340
It so happens that the six judges presiding over the

186
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,540
Spring Imperial Examinations this year

187
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,540
were invited.

188
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,780
You ordered the courtesans

189
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:47,780
to slip them

190
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,620
a name list of prospective scholars.

191
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,900
Xiao Duo.

192
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,500
I, Zhou Chengde, am a Grand Secretary.

193
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,140
How dare your Zhaoding Bureau

194
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,140
insert your minions

195
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,940
into my residence?

196
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,540
You're just a eunuch.

197
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,810
What right do you have?

198
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:24,940
My lord.

199
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,180
I was personally appointed by His Majesty

200
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,540
as Seal-holding Chief of the Zhaoding Bureau.

201
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,220
I command the Inner Court

202
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,700
and supervise the officials of the Outer Court.

203
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,300
I act on authority granted by the Emperor

204
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,860
and wield imperial vermilion ink.

205
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,020
I am His Majesty's eyes,

206
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,420
and I am his hands.

207
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,260
Do you think

208
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,340
I am not qualified?

209
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,140
Guards!

210
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,500
Grand Secretary Zhou Chengde

211
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,100
engaged in bribery and fraud,

212
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,420
and used his power for personal gain.

213
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,500
Throw him into the imperial prison immediately.

214
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,500
What an egregious violation of the laws! The state is falling to ruin!

215
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,300
The state is falling to ruin!

216
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,050
[Lady Zhang Yujin]

217
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,580
Beauty Li, give me a break.

218
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,180
Your crying is annoying.

219
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,140
I'm scared. Aren't you scared?

220
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,410
What are you scared of?

221
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,460
In no time at all,

222
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,500
I will get out.

223
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,100
Sir, Her Majesty the Empress said

224
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,500
her niece, Lady Zhang,

225
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,140
will be in your care.

226
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,860
This is your reward.

227
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,220
Lady Zhang.

228
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,460
Lady Zhang.

229
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,460
Lady Zhang,

230
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,060
someone made a mistake.

231
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,660
You are not on the list of tribute ladies.

232
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,100
You may go back.

233
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,980
Thank you, Eunuch Yan.

234
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,860
Lady Zhang.

235
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,780
Lady Zhang!

236
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,620
Sister Zhang, I beg you.

237
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,180
Please bring me with you!

238
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:38,620
Move!

239
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,900
Lady Zhang!

240
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,580
What do you think you're doing?

241
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,610
You don't come from a good family

242
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,460
and couldn't bear a child.

243
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,140
This is your wretched destiny.

244
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,260
Who can you blame?

245
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,980
Tomorrow at noon,

246
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,300
you will enter the Pagoda as sacrifices.

247
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,300
Once you enter Futu Pagoda,

248
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,420
there is no getting out.

249
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,060
Are you all...

250
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,020
aware?

251
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,620
Sir, sir.

252
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,460
Sir.

253
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,100
Is this enough?

254
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,220
Sir! Sir!

255
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,020
Sir! Sir!

256
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,140
Please look at what I have.

257
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,380
Sir, look at mine.

258
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,420
Yinlou.

259
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,420
These eunuchs in Zhaoding Bureau

260
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,980
want money in exchange for our lives.

261
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,420
I have no money or connections.

262
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,300
But you're different.

263
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,940
Your father is the Grand Tutor.

264
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,620
Your family

265
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,020
will come to save you.

266
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,900
I beg you,

267
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,580
please help me.

268
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,060
If my father really cared,

269
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:45,810
he wouldn't have let me

270
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,100
enter the palace on behalf of my legitimate sister.

271
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,140
My mother and sister

272
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,620
are waiting for me at home.

273
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,020
I really don't want to die.

274
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,500
I still want to eat

275
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,380
my mother's osmanthus fish.

276
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,500
What did we do wrong?

277
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,060
Why do we have to die?

278
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,340
We won't die.

279
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,420
You don't have to comfort me.

280
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,260
I promise you

281
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,500
we won't die.

282
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,260
There's no way.

283
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,460
Let go of me!

284
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,100
Let go of me!

285
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,940
What do you want to do to my mother?

286
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,260
Mother! Mother!

287

[Fengyi Palace]

288
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,740
I remember when you first entered the palace,

289
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,930
you liked wearing crimson dresses.

290
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,620
How His Majesty

291
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,900
adored you.

292
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,500
Other than you,

293
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,740
no one was allowed to wear crimson.

294
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,660
But no matter how bright the color,

295
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,690
there will come a day when it becomes inappropriate.

296

[Empress Rong'an]

297
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,620
His Majesty loved you so much,

298
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,820
why don't you go keep him company?

299
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,460
You can leave these white robes

300
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,300
for me.

301
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,450
Listen.

302
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,500
From now on,

your son

304
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,380
can only call me "Mother,"

305

and only kneel for me.

00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,290
Come on!

311
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,099
How dare you...

312
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,460
This way, Your Highness.

313
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,620
Didn't Your Highness

314
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,580
make an agreement with me?

315
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,580
As long as we support Prince Rong's

ascension to the throne,

317

even if His Majesty is gone,

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,500
as long as I'm here,

319
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,020
you will remain the head of the Six Palaces？

320
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,500
Why are you in such a hurry?

321
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,260
I just can't stand watching

322
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,500
that wench Shao

323

I dare not disrespect you.

329

You are my servant.

330

Do you dare

331

disobey my orders?

332
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,420
His Majesty just passed,

333
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,300
there are countless pairs of eyes at court

334
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,220
scrutinizing Fengyi Palace.

335
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,340
It takes only one misstep...

336
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,490
It's not a big deal for me to lose my life,

337
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,620
but to stain your reputation would be dire.

338

Noble Consort Shao is dead.

339

When Prince Rong ascends the throne,

340
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,100
I will become the Empress Dowager.

341
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,860
When the Prince of Nanyuan comes to the capital to act as regent,

342
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,020
with his position in court,

343

Of course I have to rely on him.

He's in charge of everything at Zhaoding Bureau.

Should we send someone to intercept and kill him?

Yuwen Liangshi has always been cautious.

407

When he was in Western Shu,

408
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,460
he lived in seclusion and was heavily guarded.

409

he will only be more careful.

Instead of taking action rashly,

414

it's better to wait for him to enter our territory,

415

after he enters the capital.

421
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,220
If the Prince of Nanyuan wants to be the regent,

422

he will have to rely on Prince Rong.

I can lure him into a trap.

But now Prince Rong

426
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,660

Greetings, Your Highness.

515
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,660
I want to ask you...

516
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,500
ask you to help me...

517
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,380
help me save someone.

518
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,630
[Xiecui Garden]

519
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,060
Move! Hurry!

520
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,490
What's going on?

521
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,100
Who checked the vegetables?

522
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:34,780
Please calm down.

523
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,060
I checked the dishes,

524
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,380
they were not poisoned.

525
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,260
What's wrong with them?

526
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,140
This...

527
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,220
I'm afraid she's infected with dysentary.

528
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,180
Sir, what should we do?

529
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,340
Why don't we call an imperial physician?

530
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,180
What imperial physician?

531
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,460
We must not blow this matter up.

532
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,020
It must not be suspected to be caused

533
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,700
by uncleanliness in the food.

534
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,540
If Chief Xiao finds out,

535
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,100
we’ll all be in trouble.

536
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,660
What should we do?

537
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,860
Remove them

538
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,140
from the namelist of tribute ladies.

539
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,300
Send them to the Imperial Mausoleum immediately.

540
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,380
No one can find out.

541
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,620
If they die halfway,

542
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,820
bury them on the spot.

543
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:09,860
Yes.

544
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,340
Go.

545
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,580
Guards!

546
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,180
It hurts!

547
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,300
Take him away.

548
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,810
Take him out! Hurry!

549
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,380
Eunuch Yan.

550
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,380
Lady Bu.

551
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,330
Please leave Bu Yinlou.

552
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,460
I want to see her.

553
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,540
Yes.

554
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,620
Although you're a baseborn child,

555
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,180
I watched you grow up.

556
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,220
Seeing you suffer,

557
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,380
my heart aches for you too.

558
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:09,560
[Madam Bu]

559
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,940
Your father knows

560
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,700
you have to be a tribute lady.

561
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,940
He worries so much that he can't eat

562
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,540
nor sleep.

563
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,740
How hard it is for him.

564
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,300
It's not that your father doesn't want to save you.

565
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,500
It's that we can't break

566
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,820
the rules of the palace.

567
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,860
How can the rules be graver

568
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,260
than the life of their own daughter?

569
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,860
Look at them.

570
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,500
Dialogue: 0,0:30:19.61,0:30:20.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Which family hasn't spent some money

571
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,300
to get it done?

572
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,700
Those eunuchs in the Zhaoding Bureau are greedy.

573
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,540
They don't care

574
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,860
about the rules.

575
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,260
Others can bribe the Bureau

576
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,060
but our Old Master cannot.

577
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,660
The Zhaoding Bureau and the Grand Secretariat

578
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,540
are locked in a fierce tension.

579
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,500
I heard even Grand Secretary Zhou

580
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,740
has been imprisoned.

581
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,500
Although your father is close

582
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,220
with the Grand Secretariat,

583
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,140
if at this time the Bureau

584
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,260
gets hold of incriminating information on him,

585
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,740
he could lose his life.

586
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,570
Mother,

587
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,860
what do you want me to do?

588
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,060
Yinlou,

589
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,900
for the Bu family to have

590
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,300
a tribute lady like you,

591
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:16,940
is a glory

592
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,219
that other families can only dream of.

593
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,659
I know you're a good child.

594
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,020
Your birth mother is not in good health,

595
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,659
you know that.

596
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,500
I think

597
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,100
you should be sensible,

598
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,100
let her live out her life

599
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,980
without worry.

600
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,699
Right?

601
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,100
How about

602
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,500
you go and serve the late emperor?

603
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,620
There are many things to do at the residence.

604
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,500
I'll go back first.

605
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,500
Remember. Be good.

606
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,340
Madam, where are you going?

607
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,300
Why are you leaving?

608
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,420
Mistress...

609
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:10,620
Madam.

610
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:11,780
This one.

611
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,980
Lady Bu

612
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,860
has fallen seriously ill.

613
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,860
According to the rules,

614
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,380
she cannot be a tribute lady.

615
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,100
I heard that Eunuch Yan

616
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,540
wants to purchase some properties in the capital.

617
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,660
What a coincidence.

618
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,980
My nephew is looking to let go of

619
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,100
a few restaurants, all in prime locations.

620
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,300
Eunuch Yan, why don't you take a look?

621
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,220
Madam.

622
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,060
this child has always been healthy.

623
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:45,460
Yes.

624
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,380
What serious illness?

625
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,770
It must be because she is about to go

626
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,450
serve the late emperor.

627
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,020
She cannot conceal her loyalty to the Emperor,

628
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,700
so she's having an emotional response.

629
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,180
Yes.

630
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,540
The Bu family has been loyal for generations.

631
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,690
Please ensure the fulfilment

632
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,300
of the loyalty of our family.

633
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,900
Madam and I

634
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,780
are old friends.

635
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,700
Naturally, I will share your burden.

636
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,330
Other families are clamoring

637
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,340
to redeem their daughters.

638
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:23,580
Sir.

639
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,020
What does Madam Bu mean by this?

640
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,020
This woman

641
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,500
is very scheming.

642
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,700
She's not a legitimate daughter.

643
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,340
What's there to feel sorry for?

644
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,060
As the family

645
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,980
to a tribute lady,

646
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,300
the men in the family

647
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,220
may be promoted to an official position.

648
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,500
A concubine's daughter dies

649
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,340
for a legitimate son to gain power.

650
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,620
Isn't it worth it?

651
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,780
It is.

652
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,140
What do you say, Chief Xiao?

653
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,380
His Highness asked me

654
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,740
to save a tribute lady.

655
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:03,740
Yes.

656
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,540
She is innocent and fragile,

657
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,620
and naive to the ways of the world.

658
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,940
And she and I...

659
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,620
We are very close.

660
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,820
I can't bear to see her

661
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,020
meet such an end.

662
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,260
Your Highness, you can't say that.

663
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,620
If people find out,

664
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,700
it’s a serious crime of debauchery.

665
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,540
Chief Xiao can't take this kind of risk.

666
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,260
Eunuch Cao,

667
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,900
how could you

668
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,090
speak disrespectfully to His Highness?

669
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,060
It's no matter.

670
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,780
Everyone in the capital knows

671
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,100
that your position

672
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,220
is second only to the Emperor.

673
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,020
You command all matters of the palace,

674
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,540
big or small.

675
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,980
I believe

676
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,500
this won’t be difficult for you.

677
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,340
Princess Hede is now

678
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,300
a favorite of the Empress Dowager.

679
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,060
She is of the same mother as His Highness,

680
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:54,900
and you are related by blood.

681
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,700
Why didn't you tell her directly?

682
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,420
Wanwan.

683
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,380
She is all the way at Tanxi Temple

684
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,660
praying with the Empress Dowager.

685
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,220
She's too far away to help.

686
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,540
And the Empress has sent troops

687
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,300
to confine all members of the Imperial Clan.

Look at me.

689
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,660
Everyone in the Murong family

690
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,820
has been placed under house arrest.

Chief Xiao,

693
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,180
there's no one who can help me.

695
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,700
What a pity.

696
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,140
This tea is rare.

697

Delicate nourishment by the soil, rain, and dew

698
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,660
can only produce a modicum of it.

699
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,660
I think everything in the world

700
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,820
is just like tea.

701
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,540
Obtaining what one desires

702
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,940
comes at a price.

Yes.

What do you want in exchange?

707
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,540
As long as it's within my abilities,

708
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,740
I can offer anything.

709

One condition.

I agree.

711

You're not asking what the condition is

712
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,020
before agreeing?

713

Aren't you afraid that afterwards

714

I won’t regret it.

Mistress, I was wrong.

You told me to stay in the room

Noble Lady Cao lost three taels of silver to me.

And

I saved four or five taels of silver
