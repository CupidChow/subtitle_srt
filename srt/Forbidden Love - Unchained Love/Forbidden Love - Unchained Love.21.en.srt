His Majesty didn't even think about

00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,070
the contributions you had

7
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,970
contributed to the military power for him,

00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:53,920

so many people.

10

Isn't he afraid that you would betray him?

11
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,430
He's trying to give me a wake up call.

12
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,060
His visit this time is strange.

13
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,740
I didn't report

about Her Highness's poisoning.

15
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,260

while you're been in West Shu?

39

undoubtedly I am happy.

41
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,750

they didn't cross the line,

83

But you

160

I can't afford to lose you.

In the past, my family was at rock bottom

164

It's nothing but snow around us,

170

and we cannot see the end.

171

As I walked,

172
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,020
I suddenly realised Duo that was beside me

173

When I look back,

175
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,690
there was only vast snow.

176
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,560
I'm afraid...

177
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,040
I'm afraid you will

178
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,600
leave me just like Duo did,

179
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,240
and disappear forever.

180
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,430
Don't curse me.

181
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,990
Have you agreed?

182
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,680
I agree.

183
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,350
His Majesty ordered for me to leave today.

184
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,560
The carriage is already outside.

185
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,820
Don't be worried about things going around here,

186
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,250
I'll get things prepared.

187
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,300
I will leave people here

188
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,600
to protect you.

189
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,650
Remember,

190
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,420
get off at Mount Yan.

191
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,680
That's the only chance I can get

192
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,390
to take you away.

193
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:59,410
I'll keep that in mind.

194
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,860
You must be careful.

195
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,420
I'll go now.

196
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,270
Godfather, what are you looking at?

197
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,960
Nothing. Let's leave the city.

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,760
Mistress,

199
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,310
are you really going to

200
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,540
elope with Chief Xiao.

201
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,370
Then why are you still trying to

202
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,090
please His Majesty with this stewed soup?

203
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,950
I feel uneasy.

204
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,550
I need to try getting something

205
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,520
out of His Majesty.

206
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,100
Your Majesty.

207
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,530
Xiao Duo left?

208
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,470
Yes, he has left.

209
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,240
I sent him away myself.

210
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,180
When will Yu Zun arrive at Jinguan City?

211
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,590
Yu Zun is already here.

212
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,470
He's already here?

213
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,820
Why didn't he come to see me then?

214
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,300
Yu Zun said

215
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,860
it's not safe around His Majesty

216
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,920
and he's cleaning up his mansion for you now.

217
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,860
[Consort Jing's trusted subordinate, Yu Zun]

218
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,310
Command Yu Zun

219
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,670
to take over as the commander of the Imperial Force immediately.

220
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,860
On the way back from West Shu,

221
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,290
let him lead a troop

222
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,590
to defend along the way.

223
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,020
Elite soldiers should be on duty

224
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,240
especially when we're crossing Mount Yanguo.

225
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,760
If Consort Duan wants to escape,

226
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,240
that would be the best place.

227
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,840
I don't care who that man is.

228
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,860
and who it is helping him,

229
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,130
as long as he dares to take Consort Dowager Duan away,

230
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,600
I

231
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,910
will kill him

232
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,590
and make sure he dies on the spot.

233
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,370
Yes.

234
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:42,680
This...

235
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,530
Why did you bring it back, Mistress?

236
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,410
Your Highness.

237
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,070
Your Highness.

238
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,850
Eunuch Sun,

239
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,700
it's late.

240
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,500
What can I do for you?

241
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,390
Sorry to disturb you.

242
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,280
Please forgive me.

243
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,260
I'm delivering a message on His Majesty's command.

244
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,740
Your Highness should return to the capital immediately.

245
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,790
Please pack your things

246
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,570
and set out immediately.

247
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,150
Understood.

248
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,790
Thank you, Eunuch Sun.

249
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:30,850
Mistress.

250
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,770
What happened

251
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,120
exactly?

252
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,220
Why do you look so pale?

253
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,480
Look at these bugs.

254
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,120
Are they stupid?

255
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,690
They're drawn to the flame like the moth are.

256
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,040
Look at what happens to them.

257
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,830
Mistress, what happened to you?

258
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,220
Why not you tell me about it?

259
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,670
I remember a historical book

260
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,720
I read when I was young.

261
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,970
Is this the time

262
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,210
you should still thinking about books?

263
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,610
I was young then.

264
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,030
I sneaked into

265
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,470
in my father's study to read.

266
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:23,850
There was a book

267
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,080
I couldn't understand a few words on,

268
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,770
so I asked my father.

269
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,120
Not only did he not tell me,

270
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,760
he even smacked me.

271
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,780
This book

272
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,090
was about Queen Dowager Zhao and Lao Ai.

273
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,230
What Ai?

274
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,480
Lao Ai is a fake eunuch.

275
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,440
He came into contact with the late emperor's mother,

276
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,330
Queen Dowager Zhao,

277
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,770
and fell in love.

278
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,450
In the end, he infuriated the late emperor,

279
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,670
causing him to end up

280
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,140
in a horrible death.

281
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,710
Are you worried that Chief Xiao will also...

282
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:05,810
I didn’t understand it before.

283
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,829
Now I understand.

284
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,880
It's full of words.

285
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,240
But it's actually

286
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,550
just conveying one thing.

287
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,730
"One shall not violate the divine powers,

288
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,380
those who violate shall die."

289
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,500
I don't want him to die.

290
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,660
He has been protecting me.

291
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,670
From now on,

292
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,660
I'll be the one to protect him.

293
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:47,390
It's not easy to be an emperor,

294
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,310
it's even harder to be an official.

295
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,130
Your Majesty, Her Highness is here.

296

Yes, Your Majesty.

312
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,690
It's time to depart.

313
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:29,660
Yes.

♫Duke of Zhou's loyalty is now known to the world♫

318
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,270
Godfather,

319
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,950
have you ever thought

320
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,090
there is no turning back

321
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,560
once you get to this position.

322
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,660
All these years,

323
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,140
you've offended so many nobles.

324
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,400
How many people

325
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,330
want you to lose power

326
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,680
and kill you.

327
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,310
Once you lose

328
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,940
your identity as the Chief Eunuch of Zhaoding Bureau,

329
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:43,780
I’m afraid will be

330
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,080
the day you die.

331
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,350
I know.

332
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,960
Just tell me the truth.

333
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,390
How confident are you?

334
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,050
Not very.

335
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,030
This is probably the risk

336
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,510
I am the most unsure of.

337
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,840
You don't plan to leave unscathed.

338
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,000
Even if I can't leave unscathed,

339
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,980
I have to fight for her freedom.

340
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,510
Even if

341
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,230
she won't be with me in the future,

342
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,080
she can live a good life.

343
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,020
I've given the order.

344
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,400
On the books,

345
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,580
you all didn't come with me today,

346
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,260
and have nothing to do with this.

347
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,490
If anything happens,

348
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,010
you have to live for me.

349
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,210
Are you crazy?

350
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,570
They're here.

351
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,320
[Commander of the Imperial Army, Yu Zun]

352
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,690
No matter who that man is,

353
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,660
and who it is helping him,

354
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,060
as long as he dares to take Consort Dowager Duan away,

355
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:49,900
I

356
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,960
will kill him

357
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,230
and make sure he dies on the spot.

358
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,490
I have to act on my own

359
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,680
yet again.

360
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,280
Zhuo Ying.

361
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,450
Chief!

362
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:23,590
-Chief! -Godfather!

363
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:24,710
Godfather!

364
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,180
Chief!

365
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,110
She’s gone.

366
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,580
She won't come back.

367
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,500
Let go of me!

368
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,040
The carriage is bumpy,

369
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,800
sit closer to me.

370
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,120
I saw your expression just now...

371
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,420
You want to get off?

372
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,700
What for?

373
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,880
It's in the wilderness,

374
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,060
it's dangerous.

375
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,690
How is it dangerous?

376
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,380
The Imperial Army are on the the front and back carriages.

377
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,520
Get off if you want.

378
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,710
The Imperial Army?

379
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:42,840
Are you getting off?

380
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,680
Yinlou,

381
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,320
I'm very happy today.

382
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,880
Listen.

383
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,770
No matter what happened before,

384
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:56,950
I will not hold you accountable.

385
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,210
From now on,

386
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,260
you can only have me

387
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,280
in your heart.

388
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,970
The only person you can rely on

389
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,940
is me.

390
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,120
Good.

391
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,140
Very good.

392
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,660
Fang Jiang!

393
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,320
Fang Jiang!

394
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,760
Mistress, what's wrong?

395
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,670
Did you have a nightmare?

396
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,790
Where am I?

397
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,310
You are confused.

398
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,330
We're back at the palace.

399
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,850
This is Yongze Palace.

400
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,660
His Majesty granted it to you.

401
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,000
After so many twists and turns,

402
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,520
I still came back.

403
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,700
Xiao Duo is so petty,

404
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,600
he must hate me to the core now.

405
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,300
But it's good that he hates me.

406
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,070
From now on,

407
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,370
he won't have to

408
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,510
be bogged down by me.

409
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,740
He can go back to being

410
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,500
that arrogant

411
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,220
and insufferable Chief Xiao.

412
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,160
You can cry if you want.

413
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,720
I've closed the doors and windows,

414
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,480
no one will hear you.

415
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:11,890
Why would I cry?

416
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,410
In the past,

417
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,930
I had designs on him.

418
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,280
After going to West Shu together,

419
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,100
I made him mine.

420
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,460
I'm already pretty proud of myself.

421
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,150
I'm glad you've thought it through.

422
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,580
Now that we've returned to the palace,

423
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,220
let bygones be bygones.

424
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,570
Treat it like a dream,

425
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,330
and forget about it.

426
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,770
Let's live in peace from now on.

427
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,350
I can't live in peace.

428
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,840
I have something else I have to do.

429
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,860
What is it?

430
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,450
I promised him

431
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,400
I will be behind him

432
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,680
in doing what he wants to do,

433
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,860
and finding the person he wants to find.

434
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,010
I can't do that anymore.

435
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,110
The only thing I can do

436
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,800
is to find the person he wants to find,

437
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,390
and do

438
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,240
what he's been wanting to do for him.

439
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,380
That's a murder case.

440
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,060
Why are you getting involved?

441
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,490
The Zhaoding Bureau investigated for years,

442
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,840
but couldn't find anything.

443
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,960
You're just a woman.

444
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,020
What can you do?

445
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,550
That's because their angle was wrong

446
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,680
from the beginning.

447
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,000
If I take a step back,

448
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,270
and analyze this all over again,

449
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,710
It's not necessarily impossible.

450
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,000
Six years ago,

451
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,720
Xiao Duo saw

452
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,450
the Prince of Nanyuan's carriage

453
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,500
leave Ruyi Alley.

454
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,370
But why didn't the timing match up

455
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,130
with the Prince of Nanyuan's return?

456
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,470
Maybe Chief Xiao was too sad,

457
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,590
and remembered it wrongly.

458
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:03,990
Impossible.

459
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,210
Xiao Duo is a meticulous person.

460
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,300
Besides,

461
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,280
it's related to his brother's death.

462
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,750
He can't be mistaken.

463
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,120
You suspect the Prince of Nanyuan was lying?

464
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,810
Xiao Duo verified his statement,

465
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,690
it's probably not a lie.

466
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,580
But sometimes,

467
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,530
even when someone

468
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,340
tells the truth,

469
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,440
he does not tell the whole truth.

470
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,900
Then, it's not really true.

471
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,680
So is it true or false?

472
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,130
The Prince of Nanyuan didn't kill him.

473
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,210
But I'm afraid

474
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,440
he didn't tell the whole truth.

475
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,210
What if

476
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,720
more than one carriage

477
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,070
entered the Prince of Nanyuan's residence that year?

478
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,050
You mean to say,

479
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,690
what the Prince of Nanyuan left out

480
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,250
was that someone had been with him?

481
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,830
Xiao Duo weakened

482
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,490
his influence in the palace considerably.

483
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,420
If that person

484
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,760
is the last card up the Prince's sleeve,

485
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,360
it stands to reason

486
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,450
that he'll want to keep this a secret.

487
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,760
Six years ago, the Prince of Nanyuan came to the capital

488
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,270
and met with that person in secret.

489
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,410
But to prevent the late Emperor from getting suspicious,

490
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,840
the Prince used his carriage

491
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,270
to cover up their identity.

492
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,650
On the day of the incident,

493
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,420
the Prince of Nanyuan got on the carriage

494
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,300
and left first.

495
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,730
After he left,

496
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,690
that person

497
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,790
got on another carriage.

498
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,820
[Nan]

499
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,350
Who is that person?

500
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,830
Now, the Prince of Nanyuan's

501
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,260
supporters in the capital

502
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,770
have all scattered.

503
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,830
There's no way to investigate right now.

504
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:48,940
However,

505
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,800
there's another way in.

506
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,140
What is it?

507
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,280
Empress Rong'an.

508
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,850
Empress Rong'an and the Prince of Nanyuan

509
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:59,860
have been allies for a long time.

510
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:00,990
I'm afraid she's the only person who knows

511
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,300
who the Prince of Nanyuan

512
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,310
was meeting with.

513
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,660
You two have been at odds for a long time.

514
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,430
You'll be lucky if she doesn't make trouble for you.

515
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,770
Are you going to

516
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:10,990
cosy up to her?

517
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,170
I'll use some money

518
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,690
to get close to the people around her first.

519
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,710
Fortunately, I had the foresight

520
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,180
to extort those ten crates of gold and silver

521
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,190
from Bu Yinge

522
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,910
and Xiao Duo.

523
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,390
I've been saving them up.

524
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,490
Where's my money?

525
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,510
I've used them as rewards.

526
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,480
To whom?

527
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,870
As soon as you returned,

528
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,720
people from every palace came to greet you.

529
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,680
I couldn't embarrass you,

530
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,080
so I had to reward them.

531
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,750
After all, this time round,

532
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,690
you've become a phoenix.

533
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,610
Mistress.

534
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,290
No wonder everyone wants

535
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,420
a high rank.

536
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,440
There's so much fanfare around you now.

537
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,660
I gave out rewards from Zhengnan Gate

538
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,670
all the way to Yongze Palace.

539
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,890
But it was a really long way,

540
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,520
we don't have enough money.

541
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:03,870
You...

542
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,140
You wench!

543
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,380
Do you think my money

544
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,660
fell from trees?

545
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,890
Yes.

546
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,420
I didn't expect

547
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,730
my first step in the investigation

548
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,790
to be hampered by a lack of money.

549
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,120
Why don't we save up more?

550
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,800
Forget it.

551
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,850
I'll think of another way.

552
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,390
Mistress.

553
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,870
Actually, I think

554
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,050
you don’t have to trouble yourself.

555
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,070
Chief Xiao is so smart.

556
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:40,870
If you can think of it,

557
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,420
I'm sure he can too.

558
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,950
Besides, he is well-connected.

559
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,190
He'll figure this out.

560
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,500
If you were to do it,

561
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,140
it wouldn't just be dangerous,

562
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,660
it might even be a waste of time.

563
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,970
Tongyun.

564
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,820
Why don't you understand?

565
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,610
There are some things I do

566
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,380
not because I'm best positioned to,

567
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,140
but because I can't live with myself if I don't.

568
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:01,520
From the moment

569
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,660
I got on the carriage back to the capital,

570
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,440
he was just the Chief of the Zhaoding Bureau,

571
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,950
and I was just a concubine in the Inner Court.

572
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,740
There is nothing between us

573
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,880
anymore.

574
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,740
I can't be with him anymore.

575
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,880
I might even have to forget about

576
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,350
everything that had happened between us in the past.

577
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,640
This is the last thing

578
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,950
I can do for him.

579
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,790
It is the only remaining connection

580
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,930
between us.

581
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,650
Mistress.

582
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,220
Your Highness.

583
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,730
Congratulations, Your Highness.

584
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,700
His Majesty has spoken.

585
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,600
He'll be coming to Yongze Palace today.

586
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,060
Eunuch Sun.

587
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,540
I'm slow-witted.

588
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,090
I don't understand.

589
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,700
What does His Majesty mean?

590
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,560
What don't you understand?

591
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:04,820
Your Highness.

592
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,300
His Majesty is going to sleep here tonight.

593
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,429
Please forgive me for saying this,

594
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,570
but you must see how much

595
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,139
His Majesty cares for you.

596
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,370
Don't act impetuously

597
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,429
and let him down.

598
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,560
I won't disturb you anymore.

599
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,370
Take the time to prepare,

600
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,560
put some thought into it.

601
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,699
If you make His Majesty happy,

602
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,050
you will benefit too.

603
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,000
I'll take my leave.

604
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,470
Mistress.

605
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:02,990
I know Yinlou is back,

606
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,460
I'm going to see her at Yongze Palace.

607
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,060
I have something important to report.

608
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:06,850
Young Prince Yuwen

609
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,200
heard about the incident in West Shu.

610
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,500
He's gotten in big trouble.

611
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,750
What happened to my brother?

612
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,240
You won't tell me?

613
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,220
I must return to West Shu today,

614
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,150
even if it kills me!

615
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,560
Yuwen Liangxu!

616
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,660
He's badly injured,

617
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,260
why aren't you calling for an imperial physician?

618
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,630
On His Majesty's orders,

619
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,860
no one is allowed to enter or leave these premises.

620
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,870
Please understand.

621
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,790
You must leave at once.

622
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,660
Brother,

623
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,200
Yuwen Liangchen is badly injured.

624
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,250
Retract your orders immediately,

625
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,310
and send an imperial physician to treat him!

626
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,350
You are acting in contempt of the Emperor.

627
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:17,870
Do you still remember

628
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,590
that you're a Princess?

629
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,410
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

630
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,380
I've heard about the trouble

631
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,230
with Yuwen Liangxu.

632
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,040
He dared disobey an imperial order,

633
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,350
and injure soldiers of my Imperial Army.

634
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,820
In the future,

635
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,920
he might even turn to harm me.

636
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,660
He wants to die,

637
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,480
so why should I stop him?

638
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,440
Brother,

639
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,600
you need to keep him as a hostage

640
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,460
to keep the Prince of Nanyuan in check.

641
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,760
He can't die.

642
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,450
Yuwen Liangshi is no longer a threat to me.

643
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,210
What do I have to worry about?

644
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,430
As for you,

645
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,490
I've warned you many times

646
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,660
not to get too close

647
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,710
to Yuwen Liangxu.

648
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,480
You only pretended to oblige,

649
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,320
and now you have acted in contempt because of him.

650
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,370
This is a disgrace

651
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,730
the royal family!

652
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,500
Sun Taiqing.

653
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,910
Yes.

654
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,760
Effective immediately, Princess Hede

655
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,670
is not to set foot in Shangqiong Palace without my permission.

656
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,030
Yes.

657
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,670
Mistress, you've already returned to the palace.

658
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,510
Sooner or later,

659
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,440
you will have to sleep with His Majesty.

660
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,610
All my life,

661
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:41,450
everything about me

662
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,840
has been controlled by others.

663
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,390
They wanted me enter the palace on Bu Yinge's behalf,

664
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,100
so I did.

665
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,590
They made me a human sacrifice for the late Emperor,

666
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,830
so I must die.

667
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,100
They tell me to sleep with someone I don't love,

668
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,420
so I must lie down obediently.

669
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,660
Why?

670
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:52,830
Why should I be

671
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,510
at the mercy of others?

672
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,700
I can't accept it! I can't take it lying down either!

673
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,010
Yinlou.

674
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,690
Wan Wan.

675
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,150
The Young Prince is quite impressive.

676
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,410
Yinlou,

677
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,760
I know I shouldn't be

678
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,850
asking you for help.

679
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,530
If it weren't an emergency,

680
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,550
I wouldn't be asking you either.

681
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,610
You're the only one who can help him now.

682
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,020
Okay, I'll help you.

683
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,580
But, do me a favor in return.

684
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:30,830
Mistress.

685
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,350
You're in trouble yourself,

686
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,700
how can you find it in yourself to help the Princess?

687
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,300
It's worth it.

688
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,850
In this palace,

689
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,450
I'm the only one

690
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,710
she can count on.

691
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,560
She's the only one

692
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,190
I can count on as well.

693
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,140
His Majesty has arrived.

694
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,130
Greetings, Your Majesty.

695
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,850
This way, please.

696
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,430
I didn't know what you like.

697
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,650
I hope you don't mind

698
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,500
what I've prepared.

699
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,340
Steamed egg?

700
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,610
I remember

701
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,000
when my mother was still alive,

702
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,470
she made a bowl of steamed egg for me

703
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,980
every day

704
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,280
Once,

705
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,880
she mistook sugar for salt,

706
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,720
and made a sweet bowl.

707
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,970
I liked it so much when I ate it.

708
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,280
After that, I kept asking her

709
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,450
to make sweet steamed egg.

710
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,640
Since you like it,

711
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,900
have a taste.

712
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,750
It's sweet?

713
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,680
It's embarrassing.

714
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,570
Actually, I had someone's help

715
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,830
making this.

716
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,440
Wan Wan.

717
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,030
Brother.

718
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,480
I was just thinking

719
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,240
about what a coincidence this was.

720
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,770
It turns out someone with an ulterior motive

721
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,990
made use of this

722
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,300
bowl of steamed egg.

723
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,240
I know I'm in the wrong.

724
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,050
You've always been smart

725
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,020
and you've always been crafty.

726
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,280
You're also very good

727
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,210
at using your craftiness

728
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,640
to get what you want.

729
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,570
But I didn't expect

730
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,290
you would use your tricks on me.

731
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,560
How dare you make use of our kinship

732
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,200
to plot against me?

733
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,280
Your Majesty.

734
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,590
You said she used you

735
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,890
to get what she wanted?

736
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,480
You are right.

737
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,580
What she wants most

738
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,100
is for you to be happy.

739
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,150
You've made me very unhappy

740
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,090
by using this against me.

741
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,280
But I remember

742
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,960
when we were young,

743
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,560
whenever I was bullied,

744
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,490
you used these tricks to help me,

745
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,680
time and time again.

746
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,680
Sit down. Eat with me.

747
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:38,980
Okay.

748
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,710
I'm touched you still remember

749
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,800
about the steamed egg.

750
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,920
How can I forget?

751
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,580
At that time,

752
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,850
I even threw a tantrum at you.

753
00:41:59,230 --> 00:41:59,810
Yes.

754
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:02,460
You said you didn't like sweet food,

755
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,600
and insisted Mother made it salty again.

756
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,620
And it wasn't just that.

757
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,590
You sneaked into the kitchen

758
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,360
and changed all the sugar into salt.

759
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,300
Look at you.

760
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,560
People say kinship ties run weak in the royal family,

761
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,620
but I don't think so.

762
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,680
Only our loved ones

763
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,110
can remember the little details

764
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,960
about what we've been through together.

765
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,680
I have a sister too.

766
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,950
It's just that we're not close.

767
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,130
Your Majesty, it's great

768
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,150
that you are so close to the Princess.

769
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:38,710
Look at you,

770
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,850
you've become so haggard.

771
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,910
Is it because of Yuwen Liangxu?

772
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,840
Forget it.

773
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,180
He's not capable of making any serious trouble.

774
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,780
I'll retract my order.

775
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,120
You can

776
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,560
go to the Imperial Hospital

777
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,400
to find a physician.

778
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,910
Get him the treatment he needs.

779
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,850
Thank you, Your Majesty.

780
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,150
Thank you, Yinlou.

781
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,360
This girl...

782
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,720
She got what she needed from me and ran away.

783
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,060
Seriously.
