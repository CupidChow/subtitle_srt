Forget it.

5
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,770
I can't convince you.

6
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,050
You should

7
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:51,780
eat more

8
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,050
while you still can.

00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,320
If something happens in the future,

10
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,330
you might not even get to eat

11
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,170

12
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,120
It's well-marinaded.

I'll let him try it.

14
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,520
I'm Rong Bao, the steward of the Prince of Nanyuan's Residence.

00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,680
Greetings, Eunuch Cao.

16
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,650
His Highness

17

empathizes with Chief Xiao's difficulty

18
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,120
in being alone and away from home,

19
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,050
without a woman to take care of him.

20
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,890
So he has specially

21
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,880
bestowed Chief Xiao a few beauties

22
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,850
to wait on him.

23
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,370
Damn eunuch!

24
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,760
Isn't it enough that he seduced you?

25
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,490
Now, he wants beauties.

26
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,800
Don't worry about it.

27
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,450
We

28
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,090

29
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,140
Chief Xiao is a decent man,

30
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,290
he won't accept them.

31
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,250
Let's go and take a look.

32
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,850
The Prince of Nanyuan bestowed beauties on me?

33
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,770
Yes.

34
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,560
A group of charming beauties,

35
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,970
some plump and some slender,

36
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,210
each beautiful in her own way.

37
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,730
He probably thinks at least one of them

38
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,120
is to your liking.

39
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,130

00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,090
I'll chase them away now.

42
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,210
There's no need.

43
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,520
Keep them.

44
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,720
Let's go.

45
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,850
If he wants to plant spies around me,

46
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,920

50
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,440
Put them to good use.

51

Damn eunuch!

52

Isn't it enough that he seduced me?

53
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,940
What does he need beauties for?

54
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,810
What does he need beauties for?

55
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,890
Exactly.

56
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,930
You're finally seeing him

57
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,079
for who he really is.

58
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,930
It's fine, Mistress.

59
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,970
We can take this opportunity-

60
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,329
I'll wreck his house.

61
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,930
Don't stop me.

62
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,490
-to break up with him.

63
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,850
It took me a long time to pick this out.

64
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,920
I bought this too.

65
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,880
I decorated this whole room,

66
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,090
I can't bear to wreck it.

67
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,529
Who are you?

68
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,320
Why are you in Chief Xiao's room?

69
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,490
I...

70
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,170
I’m the same as you.

71
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,440
Do you think we're fools?

72
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,450
I didn't push that hard,

73
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,409
she fell down herself.

74
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,480
It's not your fault.

75
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,330
It's my own fault.

76
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,680
She was just impulsive,

77
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,640
don't misunderstand her.

78
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,370
It really wasn't me.

79
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,560
Get up!

80
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,800

Why make things difficult for other women?

83
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,410
That's right.

84
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,170
Besides,

85
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,010
she-

86
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,530
No, I really didn't.

87
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,530
Later,

88
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,450
break her arm.

89
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,330
She was obviously framed by Her Highness.

90
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,410
So what?

91
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,600
Actually,

92
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,960
it really has nothing to do with her.

93
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,440
It's just that

94
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,130
Master likes to paint.

95
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,400
What does this have to do with painting?

96
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,080
Master paints

97
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,080
not on paper or silk,

98
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,880
but

99
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,880
the skin of beauties.

100
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,409
What skin?

101
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,159
Master likes to soak thin whips

102
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,560
in oil,

103
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,770
to lash people with.

104
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,520
Again,

105
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,480
and again.

106
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,970
When fair skin

107
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,600
seeps blood,

108
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,890
it becomes a painting of plum blossoms in snow.

109
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,720
Don't talk nonsense.

110
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,370
Yes.

111
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,480
Every night, whoever serves Master

112
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,040
will receive a painting in reward.

113

Sisters,

114
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,400
do you want to look at it?

115
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,560
Right, it's rather gruesome.

116
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,130
You'd better not look.

117
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,600
I've heard that

118

Chief Xiao of the Zhaoding Bureau

119
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,090
is ruthless by nature.

120
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,010
Could what she said be true?

121
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,170
I feel happy

122
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,730

123
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,280
It's good that you're here.

124
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,050
From now on, I will no longer have Master's favor

125
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,840
all to myself.

126
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,320
Actually,

127
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,250
there used to be more of us

128
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,080
serving Master.

129
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,530
Unfortunately,

130

Where are they?

132
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,240
Master gave them too many paintings,

133

they couldn't stand it.

134
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,650

135

to the dog.

136
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,050

He has sharp ears,

142
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,480
don't call him here.

143

Do you know why

144
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,480
he's called Eunuch Ba?

145
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,480
No.

146
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,570

147
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,400
have been lost to him.

How about this?

154

I'll hold him off.

You go first. Don't worry about me.

Your Highness has scared away

179
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,490
all of the Prince of Nanyuan's spies.

180
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,360
You are too considerate of me.

181
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,250
You knew they were spies,

182
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,160
but you still dared to keep them around you?

183
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,440
How arrogant!

184
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,890
But now,

185
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,490
there are no beauties left.

186
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,400
You'll have to compensate me, right?

187
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,650
I think

188
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,040
this one is not bad.

189
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,360
Go away.

190
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,690
Don't come into my room.

191
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,210
This is my room.

192
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,110
[Shangqiong Palace]

193
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,980
Your Majesty.

194
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,250
Chief Xiao

195
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,730
sent a message from West Shu saying that

196
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,450
the Prince of Nanyuan is colluding with gangs

197
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,920
to sell salt.

198
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,130
The magistrates have seized

199
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,680
their contact point.

200
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,340
Although we didn't get concrete evidence

201
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,080
on the Prince of Nanyuan,

202
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,960
Chief Xiao suspects

203
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,040
this has something to do with the West Shu army

204
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,960
illicitly forging weapons.

205
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,930
Chief Xiao has requested

206
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,490
to extend his stay in West Shu

207
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,760
for further investigation.

208
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,130
Approved.

209
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,610
Pass my order to him.

210
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,890
No matter what it takes,

211
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,410
I must confiscate

212
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,820
the military power Yuwen Liangshi holds

213
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,800
in West Shu.

214
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,770
Yes.

215
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,060
Your Majesty

216
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,330
is becoming more and more decisive.

217
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,330
I was reading Han Feizi today.

218
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,760
"The affairs are spread throughout the lands, but their crux lies in the center.

219
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,410
When a sage king grasps the crux, all the lands will obey him."

220
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,240
Power over the world

221
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,060
should be held

222
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,480
in my hands alone.

223
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,600
The Prince of Nanyuan covets the throne

224
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,770
and conducts his armies imprudently.

225
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,090
He ought to give up his power

226
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,490
to make way for my rule.

227
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,880
In the future,

228
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,360
when Yinlou sees what I have achieved,

229
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,330
she will be happy.

230
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,360
It's your turn.

231
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,250
It's not easy for you to sneak in

232
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,360
to see me.

233
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,000
Why aren't you looking at me?

234
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,570
I'm sorry.

235
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,840
I just think

236
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,780
my brother

237
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,000
is changing more and more.

238
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,720
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

239
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,810
I'm not sure.

240
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,480
But

241
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,200
it won't be a good thing for your brother.

242
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,140
Let them worry about

243
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,360
these complicated matters of the state.

244
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,770
Since we can't do anything about them,

245
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,320
why worry in vain?

246
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,770
My brother sent Xiao Duo to West Shu.

247
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,320
Aren't you worried about your brother?

248
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,770
My brother

249
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,080
isn't easy to deal with.

250
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,090
He and Xiao Duo

251
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,600
are well-matched.

252
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,410
Two forces are in battle,

253
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,690
and neither wishes to give in.

254
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,850
What should we do next?

255
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,520
Ridiculous!

256
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,530
How dare Xiao Duo

257
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,730
send back the women I bestowed on him?

258
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,290
He's too arrogant!

259
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,640
I will not allow the things

260
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,000
that I have gifted to be returned.

261
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:28,850
Rong Bao,

262
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,210
use wedding preparations as an excuse

263
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,040
to sound out Xiao Duo.

264
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,200
Yes.

265
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,130
A pair of golden phoenix bracelets.

266
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,850
A pair of golden phoenix bracelets.

267
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,370
A set of golden crown jewels.

268
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,040
A set of golden crown jewels.

269
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,250
A pair of gold ruyis.

270
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,490
A pair of gold ruyis.

271
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,700
Jaden bracelets.

272
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,890
Continue taking inventory here.

273
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,570
I'm stepping out for some fresh air.

274
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,890
Young Miss Bu's marriage

275
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,810
is too troublesome for you.

276
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,680
You work too hard making all these arrangements.

277
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,300
What does all these gold and jade,

278
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,290
and taking inventory,

279
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,970
have to do with you?

280
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,040
It's too bad,

281
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,640
this is my task.

282
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,010
Otherwise,

283
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,330
I wouldn't be here in the first place.

284
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,180
Besides, I'm a Consort Dowager.

285
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,090
Given my status,

286
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,570
I have to preside over the wedding.

287
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,650
If I don't, who will?

288
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,810
Let's follow the rules.

289
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,890
We will do what we have to,

290
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,930
that's all.

291
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,770
Mistress, look.

292
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,900
Why is there a pair of

293
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,890
men's shoes?

294
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,010
Bu Yin'ge made those for the groom.

295
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,130
Other than the Han,

296
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,130
many other tribes gather here at West Shu.

297
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,090
Their customs have been syncretized.

298
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,520
The wedding customs here

299
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,810
dictate that before a woman gets married,

300
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,090
she has to personally

301
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,280
make a pair of shoes for the groom.

302
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,770
On the wedding day,

303
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,850
the groom needs to wear those new shoes.

304
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,930
This symbolizes the lasting companionship between the couple.

305
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,200
It's so ugly.

306
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,810
She has the chance

307
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,400
to make a pair of shoes for her groom.

308
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,480
I'm afraid

309
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,200
you will never get to.

310
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,480
Stand up.

311
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,160
Take it off.

312
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,210
Take it off.

313
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,450
What are you doing?

314
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,800
Put it on.

315
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,010
Sit down.

316
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,280
What are you doing?

317
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,120
Taking off your boots.

318
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,010
I'll make you a new pair,

319
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:27,970
so that you can wear them in alternation.

320
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,400
Are you making shoes for me?

321
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,240
It's a pity that I don't have a model.

322
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,930
If I draw one using your boots,

323
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,090
I'm afraid they won't fit.

324
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,770
Now that your boots are off,

325
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,520
I can take measurements and cut a pattern out by hand.

326
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,800
This way, they will fit well.

327
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,490
I don't need any official boots.

328
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,840
Can you make me a pair of Cloud-soaring Shoes?

329
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,490
They're comfortable to wear at home.

330
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,010
Why don't you want boots?

331
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,570
I can do better

332
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,450
than the Caps and Kerchiefs Service.

333
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,880
It's hard to make boots.

334
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,290
What if you hurt yourself?

335
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,330
Don't worry about it.

336
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,020
The ones you get outside

337
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,850
are not as meticulous as mine.

338
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:17,920
What?

339
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,040
In the past, has no one

340
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,080
made boots for you before?

341
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,920
Except my mother,

342
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,600
you're the first.

343
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,890
What about you?

344
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,410
You're look familiar with this.

345
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,410
It mustn't be the first time

346
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,680
you're making shoes for others.

347
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,640
Of course not.

348
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,770
Who did you make them for?

349
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,960
There are too many people.

350
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,840
Who are they?

351
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,040
Your cousin?

352
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,320
My mother

353
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,680
didn't like using my father's money.

354
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,050
So I often made things

355
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,160
to sell

356
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,440
to earn some pocket money.

357
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,089
Boots sell well,

358
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,640
they bring in a lot.

359
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:07,540
The two of us

360
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,290
worked together

361
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,079
and sold a lot.

362
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,040
You're the first person I have made shoes for of my own accord.

363
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,400
Well,

364
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,960
let's make just one more pair.

365
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,530
Don't do it again in the future.

366
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:46,760
I have money.

369
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,760
Steward Rong is waiting.

370
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
He wants to discuss

371
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,040
the ceremonials with you.

372
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,130
Godfather!

373
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:53,560
Godfather.

374
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,130
That's all I have

375
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,010
about the ceremonials.

376
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,490
What do you think?

377
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:17,970
Godfather.

378
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,360
Godfather.

379
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,210
Let's do it this way.

380
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,210
Yes.

381
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,400
One more thing.

382
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,000
According to the customs of Shu,

383
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,250
the bride must make a new pair of shoes

384
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,610
for the groom.

385
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,000
Has the Concubine gotten them ready?

386
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,280
The bride must make new shoes for the groom?

387
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,120
Yes.

388
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,610
When he wears the shoes she made,

389
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,210
the couple will be able to

390
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,840
stay together forever.

391
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,620
Consort Dowager Duan

392
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,480
has been managing these affairs.

393
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,090
You can check with her about this.

394
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:57,930
Yes.

395
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,600
Godfather.

396
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,260
You should at least try

397
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,160
to hide that you have designs

398
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,560
on Her Highness.

399
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,050
Your Highness.

400
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,780
I really couldn’t

401
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,480
find any women

402
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,920
around Chief Xiao.

403
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,200
Chief Xiao has been acting strange lately too.

404
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,450
He keeps smiling at me for no reason.

405
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,890
It’s creepy.

Consort Dowager Duan

407
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,090

I'm afraid

456
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,520
it will be disadvantageous

458
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,610
I'm aware.

There's news from Qilang.

460
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,800
I will head to the Shu Army camp tomorrow.

461
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,120
I'll leave Her Highness in your care.

Yes.

Bad news.

467
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,970
The Concubine is throwing a tantrum in the wedding room.

468
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,480
The maids can't stop her.

469
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,280
Have you had enough?

470
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,570
If not, I'll ask someone to buy more.

471
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,000
You can smash them for fun.

472
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,690
I suffered so much to come all the way here.

473
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,960
But now, you're leaving me hanging in the wedding room.

474
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,240
The servants keep watch on me

475
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,850
as if I were a prisoner.

476
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,890
Do I have any dignity left?

477
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,610

478
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,770
if you don't like the residence,

479
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,680
you can have it your way.

480
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,330
I'll arrange for a ship

481
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,650
to send you back to the capital tonight.

482
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,600
No.

483
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,410
I'm afraid you won't be able to board

484
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,040
the ship back to the capital.

485
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,420
If you so much as step out of

486
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,640
Jinguan City's gates,

487
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,620
Xiao Duo will detain you

488
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,840
for resisting the imperial decree.

489
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,680
I heard

490
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,240
you've offended him before.

491
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,800
If he wants to kill you,

492
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,650
this is a good opportunity.

493
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,080
I'm the daughter of the Grand Tutor,

494
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,240
and the new concubine of the Prince of Nanyuan.

the most.

499
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,840
How dare you

500
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,930
put on airs in front of me?

501
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,730
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

502
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,210
I'm still useful to you.

503
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,850
Please spare me.

504
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,920
What can you do for me?

505
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,690
I know

506
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,120
you don’t get along with Chief Xiao.

507
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,520
I

508
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,290
know his secret.

509
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,610
I’ll help you deal with him.

510
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,160
Go on.

511
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,560
Chief Xiao and Consort Dowager Duan

512
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,760
are having an affair.

513
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,890
Looks like

514
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,250
you still don’t know the rules.

515
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,930
You have a bad relationship with Consort Dowager Duan.

516
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,720
You think I don’t know that?

517
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,050
Your Highness.

518
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,970
I'm telling the truth.

519
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,160
I didn't lie.

520
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,800
She really has an affair with Xiao Duo.

521
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,680
Others may not know,

522
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,120
but my family does.

523
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,250
After Bu Yinlou left the Imperial Mausoleum,

524
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,370
she has been living at his residence.

525
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,760
They spend all of their time together,

526
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,480
there must be something going on between them.

527
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,450
Bu Yinlou was merely going to get married

528
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,210
on my behalf,

529
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,690
but Xiao Duo was so anxious,

530
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,240
he wanted to take our whole family's lives.

531
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,400
When we left the capital, he put me up in the small ship,

532
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,690
just so he could use be on the same ship

533
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:07,810
as Bu Yinlou.

534
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,560
Xiao Duo is powerful.

535
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,890
If they weren't having an affair,

536
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,450
Bu Yinlou isn't important enough

537
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,040
for him to serve her so attentively.

538
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,760
On the night the bandits attacked,

539
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,850
I saw from afar

540
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,450
that Xiao Duo took an arrow

541
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,240
for Bu Yinlou.

00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,650
That sister of mine

543
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,360
jumped into the river with him without hesitation.

than Consort Dowager Duan?

553

554
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,240
better be true.

invited me to visit the Prince of Nanyuan's residence.

Yes.

561

I think

562
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,410
she might have something sisterly

Do you think the Prince of Nanyuan's residence

00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,970
will be unable to protect Her Highess?

590
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,720
Or does Chief Xiao

not respect our Prince

if we don't inform Chief Xiao about this,

598
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,490

00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:16,980
I asked someone

693
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,320
to buy them early in the morning.

694
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,800
Here.

695
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,080
Try it. It smells so good.

696
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,600
I can do it myself.

697
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,010
Don't stand on ceremony.

698
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,360
We're family.

699
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,320
Don't choke.

700
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,840
Have some bird's nest.

701
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,450
It's hot.

702
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,930
Let me blow on it for you.

703
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,400
What is she doing?

704
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,690
Here.

705
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,610
Have a sip.

706
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,360
Well,

707
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,770
I've eaten and we've met.

708
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,450
It's about time I leave.

709
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,400
Sister.

710
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,760
I'm scared

711
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,170
because I'm married so far away.

712
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,730
I don't know when

713
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:05,850
I can see my maiden family next.

714
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,680
Although we

715
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,400
are not that close,

716
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,680
but we are still related by blood.

717
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,560
Won't you keep me company?

718
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,250
How should I keep you company?

719
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,480
Play cards with me.

720
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,050
She wants me to stay that bad?

721
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,640
There must be something up her sleeves.

722
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,730
Even if the Bu Yinge wants to harm me,

723
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,680
there's no reason for her to make such a scene.

724
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,000
Is it the Prince of Nanyuan's idea?

725
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,970
He wants to use me to plot against Xiao Duo.

726
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,080
What is he thinking?

727
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,680
White Dragon.

728
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,760
Sister,

729
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:51,850
I've been

730
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,210
worried about you.

731
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,920
That Chief Xiao

732
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,970
is not a good person.

733
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,280
From what I see,

734
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,800
you look pretty close to him.

735
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,880
This is it.

736
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,960
I won.

737
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,520
I'm just seeking justice for you.

738
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,570
Do you know what

739
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,540
he says outside?

740
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,010
What does he say?

741
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,170
He said you're just a Consort Dowager.

742
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,200
How could he serve you?

743
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,740
If not for your relationship

744
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,760
with His Majesty,

745
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,730
he wouldn't care so much about you.

746
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,400
You can help him relax and play around a little,

747
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,480
so you're pretty smart.

748
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,000
He's just a servant.

749
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,570
How dare he!

750
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,890
That damn servant!

751
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,360
You have no idea.

752
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,320
I've put up with him enough.

753
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,330
You have no idea

754
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,570
how he acts normally.

755
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,320
He's so arrogant.

756
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,400
This is how he looks at people.

757
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,610
That arrogance.

758
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,450
He doesn't treat anyone as a human.

759
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,890
Is he the master or am I the master?

760
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,370
Come on, let's play. Ignore him.

761
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,210
But aren't you

762
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,400
close to him?

763
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,040
Who doesn't know to pretend a little?

764
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,520
My life is not easy either.

765
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,880
That damn servant was born in a foxhole.

766
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,650
He's very cunning.

767
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,330
If it weren't for his high position,

768
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,920
who would want to fawn on him?

769
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,010
Looks like

770
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,530
you're living a comfortable life,

771

How about I just

773
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,600
stay here for good?

774
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,970
So I don't have to go back

775
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,560
and be bullied by that servant.

776
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,440
But...

777
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,980

Why don't we stay up all night to play?

want to tell me?

796

Nothing.

Why don't we play another game?

798
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,370
Mahjong is great.

799
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,330

00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,340
"Mahjong is

801

00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,130
Of course I had to make the first step,

866
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,560
and get her all topsy turvy.

867
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,330
Mistress, you're amazing.

868
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,250
Cao Chun'ang,

869
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,970
hold the money well.

870
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:01,130
[Mengyun Pavilion]

871
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,400
Every piece here

872
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,170
is my wisdom.

873
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,170
Later on,

874
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,000
I will give each of you a few.

875
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,930
Just for good luck.

876
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:07,980
I guarantee that you all will

877
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,810
get promoted and get rich,

878
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:11,080
and turn your luck around.

879
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,410
Thank you, Your Highness.

880
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,440
Thank you for the silver.

881
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,440
Where is Xiao Duo?

882
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,210
Godfather is asleep.

883
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,330
Asleep?

884
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:26,810
Fine.

885
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,920
I'll tell him tomorrow.

886
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:28,850
Let's go.

887
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:30,980
Your Highness,

888
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,360
rest early.
