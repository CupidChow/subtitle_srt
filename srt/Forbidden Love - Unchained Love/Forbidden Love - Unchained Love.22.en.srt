4
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,200
Yinlou, thank you.

5
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,009
I know you're helping me

6
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:43,450
reconcile with Wan Wan.

7
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,240
I'm happy

8
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,770
you're so considerate of me.

9
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,330
Of course

10
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,640
I'm considerate of Your Majesty.

11
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,250
In my heart,

12
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,960
you're just like the Princess.

13
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,100
You're like

14
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,450
a sibling to me.

15
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,810
Sibling?

16

Yes.

You have treated me very well,

18
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,000
I can't even begin to repay your kindness.

19

I am the late Emperor's concubine,

but I have entered the Inner Court.

21

go to serve the Empress Dowager.

For the rest of my days,

I will pray for blessings for Your Majesty.

You'd rather devote yourself to the Buddha

Do you really

43

not want to do this?

44
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,820

What kind of bad idea is that?

Don't you know it's a crime

49

for a palace maid to ask for something like this?

00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,300
How could I

51

Don't even think about it.

This is a secret medicine of the Inner Court

that I got from Wan Wan.

62
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,519
Once ingested,

63
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,450
it will make sores grow all over my face.

64
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,760
The best thing is that

My brother has always loved you,

69
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,409
so much so that he can disregard public opinion for you.

Do you really not know

73
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:39,840
if I feel anything for him?

74
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,890

in a tough spot.

82
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,240
But I'm also human,

83
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm selfish too.

84
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,600
I'm not asking you for a favor,

85
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,610
I'm making a deal with you.

86
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,040
It's up to you whether you agree or not.

87
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,120
Fine, I promise you.

88
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,760
I've heard that Noble Consort Shao

89
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,930
used this medicine

90
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,970
in the years

91
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,170
she fought for favor.

92
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,920
She raised quite a ruckus in the Inner Court,

93
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,330
it was very chaotic.

94
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,400
You want to raise a ruckus in the Inner Court?

95
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,050
I'm raising a ruckus on myself.

96
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,480
When my face is full of sores,

97
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,610
no one

98
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,200
will be willing to lay hands on me.

99
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,450
Others used it to compete for favor,

100
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,720
but you want to use it to avoid favor.

101
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,690
Why are you so hard on yourself?

102
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,520
Is this being hard on myself?

103
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,690
To be manipulated like an object,

104
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,970
and to become a shadow of my former self,

105
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,120
is to be hard on myself.

106
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,570
In the past, I might have put up with it.

107
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,370
But now,

108
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,010
I've met the best person for me.

109
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,400
I have been loved, cherished,

110
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,409
and happy.

111
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,090
I cannot go back

112
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,520
to living the way I did.

113
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,159
Mistress.

114
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,409
You know very well

115
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:59,810
you can have nothing

116
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,130
to do with Chief Xiao.

117
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,840
You must plan

118
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,570
for your future.

119
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,560
Just accept your fate.

120
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,240
At this point,

121
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,650
whether I can have him or not,

122
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,760
I won't accept my fate.

123
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,880
I've been married once,

124
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,520
and he'll be the only one I marry.

125
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,690
That's enough.

126
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,560
I wonder if this medicine works.

127
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,010
I'll down it.

128
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,650
Stop it.

129
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,080
His Majesty has arrived.

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,970
How long do you want me to wait?

131
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,560
Your Majesty.

132
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,080
Why don't you eat something first?

133
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,250
Do you think

134
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,770
I'm in the mood to eat right now?

135
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,200
I'm a little nervous,

136
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,080
I want to have a drink to calm the nerves.

137
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,410
Tongyun, pour some wine.

138
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,250
Mistress, let's not drink.

139
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,120
Give me the wine.

140
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,730
I offended Your Majesty just now.

141
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,920
Let me make a toast to you.

142
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,600
Forget it.

143
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,880
Pour some for me as well.

144
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,600
I'll drink with you.

145
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,450
We'll forget about the unhappy things.

146
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,570
Go ahead.

147
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,290
You...

148
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,450
Look at me.

149
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,330
You're nervous?

150
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,840
You must be thirsty.

151
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,290
Here, drink it.

152
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,890
Yes.

153
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,049
Drink!

154
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,680
Your Majesty!

155
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,400
Your Majesty!

156
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,520
It's all my fault,

157
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,960
it has nothing to do with my mistress!

158
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,890
What's in the wine?

159
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,360
The wine...

160
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,730
I...

161
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,160
The wine is...

162
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,360
Fine, don't say it if you don't want to.

163
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,170
Don't.

164
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,400
Finish this flask.

165
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,520
Drink!

166
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,810
Your Majesty.

167
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,580
There is indeed something in the wine.

168

Mistress!

170
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,360
But it's not poison.

171
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,320
It's a strong drug

172
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,610
that can damage one's appearance.

173
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,960
A strong drug-

174
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,770
A strong drug that can damage one's appearance?

175
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,490
Okay.

176
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,400
I'll deal with her first.

177
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,730
Drag her out and flog her thirty times,

178
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,050
then send her to the Dyeing Workshop!

179
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,250
-Yes. Drag her out. -Your Majesty!

180
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,810
-Please spare my life! -Your Majesty!

181
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,600
Hurry up.

182
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,210
-Your Majesty! -Master!

183
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,560
Tongyun!

184
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,090
Bu Yinlou.

185
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,210
I've never fallen in love with anyone.

186
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,130
You're the only one.

187
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,360
My unrequited love for you keeps me up at night.

188
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,970
I've always given you

189
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,090
everything you've wanted.

190
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,330
Your willfulness,

191
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,520
your immaturity,

192
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,000
I've tolerated it all.

193
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,410
Even when you got yourself involved

194
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,560
with other men,

195
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,920
I've never blamed you.

196
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,120
What about you?

197
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,210
How did you treat me?

198
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,490
How dare you ruin your face

199
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,560
to keep your chastity for that man?

200
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,210
What do you take me for?

201
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,280
What do you take me for?

202
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,560
Your Majesty! No!

203
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,000
Your Majesty!

204
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,290
Don't touch me!

205
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,600
No!

206
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,770
Don't touch me!

207
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,930
Don't touch me!

208
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,320
Your Majesty!

209
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,800
Don't make me hate you!

210
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,840
Your Majesty!

211
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,250
Your Majesty, what happened?

212
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:19,890
Yinlou.

213
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,440
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

214
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,720
This-

215
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,250
Get out!

216
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,680
Get out!

217
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,440
You- You want to avoid me,

218
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,920
so you're forcing me to punish you.

219
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,600
Fine!

220
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,490
Pass my order and announce to the world that

221
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,020
Bu Yinlou has served me well,

222
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,090
and pleased me deeply.

223
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,490
She will be conferred the title of Consort Duan.

224
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,680
Your Majesty.

225
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,330
Bringing Her Highness to the palace

226
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,130
has already created

227
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,570
much gossip in the court.

228
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,560
If this goes public,

229
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,180
it—

230
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,900
I want everyone

231
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,000
in the whole world to know

232
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,120
that you, Bu Yinlou, are mine!

233
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,800
You will belong to me forever!

234

If you return to the capital,

241
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,200
you'll be defying imperial decree.

242
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,480

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,130

How is his injury?

00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,050
It's okay.

293
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,450
The bleeding has stopped. I can see that.

295
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,800
He's burning up.

296
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,690
Of course I know that,

297
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,210
I'm asking you what to do now.

298
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,720
Take medicine.

299
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,160
Ruolan, bring the imperial physician to get the medicine.

300
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,400
Yes.

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,370
I'm sorry.

305
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,840
I can't do anything.

306
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,240
I'm sorry.

Mistress.

308
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,490
I've sent the imperial physician away.

309
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,250
You shouldn't

310
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,730
fall for the prince.

311
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,800
Now, the Prince of Nanyuan has fallen,

312
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,079
and he's imprisoned in West Shu.

313
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,319
The Yuwen clan is destined to decline.

314
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,200
But you are the Princess,

315
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,119
you have your responsibilities.

316
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,280
His Majesty might bestow you

317
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,609
a marriage to a minister, a general,

318
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,690
or an aristocrat.

319
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,220
He might even send you to a neighboring state

320
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,250
to form a marriage alliance,

321
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,960
in order to protect the peace of the Great Ye.

322
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,650
But he will never

323
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,720
marry you to him.

324
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,640
I understand.

325
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,160
But just once, I want to be reckless.

326
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,010
Just this once.

327
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,130
But everything

328
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,220
wants to call me to my senses.

329
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,770
I don't want to hear this from you too.

330
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,450
Mistress.

331
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,440
You have been

332
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,810
reckless enough for him.

333
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,420
If His Majesty finds out

334
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,370
you gave that medicine

335
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,770
to Her Highness of Yongze Palace,

336
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,560
what will you do?

337
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,800
I'm already at the end of my rope.

338
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,720
Liangxu is innocent,

339
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,760
so I must save him.

340
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,890
Yinlou is innocent,

341
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,850
so I must help her.

342
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:10,930
What about my brother?

343
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,240
I don't even know whether doing this

344
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,560
is right

345
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,770
or wrong.

346
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,490
Your Highness.

347
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,570
Yesterday, there was news from Yongze Palace

348
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,600
saying that the Bu Yinlou had been conferred the title of Consort.

349
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,040
Strangely, though,

350
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,680
someone saw that

351
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,640
His Majesty looked rather pale.

352
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,920
There was even an injury on his head.

353
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,210
It seems that

354
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,080
she really is Murong Gaogong's beloved.

355
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,490
We can't damage our relationship with His Majesty

356
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,630
because of this.

357
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,720
They'd better be passionate

358
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,490
and fired up for each other.

359
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,080
Let's go.

360
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,050
We'll add some fuel

361
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,570
to the embers of His Majesty's passion.

362
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,200
Your Majesty.

363
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,720
Your Majesty.

364
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,490
The discussion hasn't ended yet,

365
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,130
you shouldn't dimiss the court

366
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,090
just like that.

367
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,090
What's there to discuss?

368
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,690
I made Yinlou my consort.

369
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,300
They're all latching onto this

370
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,240
and refusing to let off.

371
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,480
They're all trying to make things difficult for me!

372
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:40,960
Even Yinlou-

373
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,530
Even Yinlou is making things difficult for me!

374
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,530
Why is there not a single thing,

375
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,400
or a single person,

376
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,880
that can go my way?

377
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,250
Your Majesty.

378
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,330
Have some tea. Calm down.

379
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,810
Your Majesty.

380
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,960
With all due respect,

381
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,570
it's fine if you

382
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,090
keep her Highness

383
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,330
in the palace secretly.

384
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,650
But now that it's exposed,

385
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,440
it's a source of trouble.

386
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,920
It even seems that

387
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,490
she doesn't want to accept your kindness.

388
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,850
I've done so much for her.

389
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,010
Why is she not satisfied?

390
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,690
How can she not accept me?

391
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,050
That man.

392
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,080
It must be because that man.

393
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,450
Tell Yu Zun

394
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,490
to find that man.

395
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,560
I want him alive.

396
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,720
Empress Rong'an seeks an audience.

397
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,120
I heard Your Majesty likes lanterns.

398
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,240
This bone sculpture lantern is exquisite and unique,

399
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,440
so I have come specially to present it to you.

400
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,440
I haven't touched these toys for a long time.

401
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,160
You should take it back.

402
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,010
There's a story about this lantern.

403
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,730
Your Majesty, why don't you listen to it?

404
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,000
Many years ago, in the mountain,

405
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,440
there was a clever little fox.

406
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,320
On snowy nights,

407
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,370
it will light a lantern

408
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,480
to illuminate the way home

409
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,400
for those passing by.

410
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,690
A young master who loved tales of the strange

411
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,840
came in search of it.

412
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,560
He wanted to own

413
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,960
this fox that could light lanterns.

414
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,210
So he set a trap

415
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,760
and caught the little fox.

416
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,570
He fed it

417
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,890
the best meat,

418
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,330
and let it sleep in the best silks.

419
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,690
But no matter how well he treated it,

420
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,090
that little fox

421
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,280
was ungrateful.

422
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,330
Not only did it refuse to light lanterns for him,

423
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,610
it even bared its fangs at him

424
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,040
and kept trying to escape back into the mountain.

425
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,250
The young master was very angry.

426
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,890
Your Majesty.

427
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,920
Do you know

428
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,210
what he did?

429
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,920
He probably locked it up

430
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,400
and kept doing as he did.

431
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,320
No.

432
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,330
From then on,

433
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,770
he starved the little fox,

434
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,040
and whipped it every day.

435
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,360
The fox's leg was broken,

436
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,730
so it couldn't escape anymore.

437
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,280
It didn't have the strength to light lanterns anymore either.

438
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,240
Then, that young master

439
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,610
killed the little fox.

440
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,160
He skinned it,

441
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,610
pared away its flesh,

442
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,080
and made a lantern with its bones.

443
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,560
From then on,

444
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,640
the little fox

445
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,040
could light lanterns only for him.

446
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,720
Surely you didn't come all the way here

447
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,770
just to tell me

448
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,720
a story?

449
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,200
I just want to tell Your Majesty

450
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,160
that no matter how well you treat someone,

451
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,520
she will never obey you.

452
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,850
Only by letting her know pain

453
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:58,920
and suffering,

454
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,330
will she be tamed,

455
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,250
and become yours.

456
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,450
How dare you plant spies around me?

457
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,090
I only happened to find out,

458
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,520
and wanted to share Your Majesty's burden.

459
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,050
You're kind enough to show favor to Bu Yinlou,

460
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,730
but she doesn't know what's good for her.

461
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,850
You must teach her a lesson,

462
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,690
let her know that without you,

463
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,280
she's nothing.

464
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,240
I'm willing to help Your Majesty

465
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,680
with this.

466
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,090
Fine, tell me.

467
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,450
How will you help me?

468
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,970
Bu Yinlou defied Your Majesty.

469
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,600
Don't keep her in the palace,

470
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,920
send her to the royal's family's marginal residence.

471
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,890
It's deserted there,

472
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,450
and Your Majesty can send someone to watch her.

473
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,730
Cut her off from all information

474
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,080
from the outside.

475
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,490
She is but

476
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,040
a delicate girl,

477
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,490
how can she stand

478
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,930
that kind of loneliness?

479
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,770
As for the rest,

480
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,290
leave it to me.

481
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,850
I will make her obey you.

482
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,280
Tell me.

483
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,800
What do you want

484
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,080
in exchange?

485
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,090
Xiao Duo.

486
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,080
I only want Xiao Duo.

487
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,680
Just scare her.

488
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,490
Don't go too far.

489
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

490
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,320
You may leave.

491
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,960
I'll take my leave.

492
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,120
Your Majesty.

493
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,930
Empress Rong'an

494
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,730
colluded with Prince of Nanyuan

495
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,770
against you.

496
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,410
Now, you're handing Chief Xiao to her

497
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,610
to make a deal.

498
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,640
If Chief Xiao joins hands with her

499
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,210
when he returns to the palace,

500
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,200
it'll be rather disadvantageous to you.

501
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,980
She's just a woman sequestered in the Inner Court

502
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,730
who has already lost her power.

503
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,480
What threat is she of to me?

504
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,010
I'm not concerned about her

505
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,130
in the slightest.

506
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,850
Just send a few people

507
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,360
to keep an eye on Changqing Palace.

508
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,760
If she really...

509
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,840
can change Yinlou's mind,

510
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,570
what's wrong with

511
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,050
sending a servant like Xiao Duo to wait on her?

512
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,170
Yes.

513
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,200
The lady of the Bu clan is virtuous

514
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,880
and elegant.

515
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,290
She will hereby be invested as Consort Duan,

516
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:54,250
and move into the royal family's Deer's Reed Residence.

517
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,360
Your Highness.

518
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,330
I'm Suhuai, Head Maidservant of Deer's Reed Residence.

519
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,310
[Head of Deer's Reed Residence, Suhuai]

520
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,810
Greetings, Consort Duan.

521
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,200
Let's go.

522
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,000
Chief. Everything is ready,

523
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,170
we can go now.

524
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,080
Godfather, you can't go.

525
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,760
If His Majesty finds out,

526
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,410
you will be executed.

527
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,490
The capital will only know that

528
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,560
I'm recuperating in West Shu.

529
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,300
No one will notice

530
00:26:59,300 --> 00:26:59,960
if you all keep a low profile here.

531
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,160
Staying till today

532
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,800
is the limit of my patience.

533
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,650
I must go back to see her.

534
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,770
But she may not want to see you.

535
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,570
I didn't dare to report

536
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,920
news from the capital to you.

537
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,320
She served His Majesty in bed at the beginning of the month.

538
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,970
The next day, His Majesty

539
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,410
ordered the Court of the Imperial Clan put her on the royal genealogy

540
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,130
as Consort Duan.

541
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,530
Bu Yinlou.

542
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,200
Why didn't you trust me?

543
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,080
Why?

544
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,200
Why?

545
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,220
Has no one made boots

546
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,130
for you before?

547
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:26,970
Other than my mother,

548
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,800
you're the first.

549
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,360
[Imperial City, Deer's Reed Residence]

550
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,350
[Heart Pure as Snow]

551
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,280
I wonder how Tongyun is doing.

552
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,080
Will she be okay?

553
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,130
Now that we've left the Imperial City,

554
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,060
when can I

555
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,010
get close to Empress Rong'an?

556
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,570
What should I do

557
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,720
about all of this?

558
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:00,960
This won't do.

559
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,600
I have to find a way out.

560
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,970
[Permeating Fragrance]

561
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,850
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

562
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,640
I'm going out for a walk.

563
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,120
His Majesty has ordered

564
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,460
that you must not leave

565
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,480
Deer's Reed Residence.

566
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,480
Sister Suhuai.

567
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,410
I know

568
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,760
His Majesty's orders.

569
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,360
But these things can be flexible.

570
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,050
My personal maidservant made a mistake

571
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,050
and was flogged for it.

572
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,890
Now she's been demoted to the Dyeing Workshop.

573
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,330
I want to visit her.

574
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,780
Please make an exception.

575
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,600
Your Highness, don't worry.

576
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,690
That maid

577
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,250
merely suffered some minor injuries.

578
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,450
She's very hardy.

579
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,570
She will recover in a few days.

580
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,570
Well,

581
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,400
I'll take a walk in here.

582
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,600
This is okay, right?

583
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:57,880
Go ahead, Your Highness.

584
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,690
Go do your work,

585
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,800
don't worry about me.

586
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,850
Your Highness, His Majesty has ordered

587
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,210
that we must stick close to you.

588
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,400
Wherever you go,

589
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
we must go.

590
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,450
If we lose you,

591
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,290
we will also

592
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,640
lose our lowly lives.

593
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,680
Please have mercy on us.

594
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,330
Please have mercy on us.

595
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,650
Have you all practiced this?

596
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,680
It's really lively here at Deer's Reed Residence.

597
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,210
Consort Dowager Duan.

598
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,720
I should call you Consort Duan now.

599
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,730
Why are you so happy?

600
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,410
Of course I'm happy.

601
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,640
I don't know

602
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,840
a single person around here.

603
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,890
It's not easy to see

604
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,000
a familiar face, like Your Majesty's.

605
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,000
Familiar?

606
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,090
I've been here

607
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,160
for a while now,

608
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,080
but you haven't greeted me yet.

609
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,570
Your Majesty, you've misunderstood me.

610
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,090
I wanted to greet you,

611
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,730
but then I reconsidered.

612
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,250
Now that the Emperor has changed,

613
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,360
how should I address you?

614
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,810
Isn't it inappropriate to still address you

615
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,560
as I would an Empress?

616
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,480
Your Highness,

617
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,560
what was your maiden clan's name again?

618
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,040
Her Highness's surname is Zhao.

619
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,290
Your Highness, Zhao.

620
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,610
Your Senior Highness, Zhao.

621
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,810
Greetings, Your Senior Highness, Zhao.

622
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:57,440
How dare you!

623
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,090
I was wrong.

624
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,450
It's my fault.

625
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,460
Your Highness, please calm down.

626
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:03,960
Kneel down!

627
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,320
I'll kneel. The ground is cool.

628
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,050
Stop acting innocent

629
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,130
in front of me.

630
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,040
How could someone of your calibre

631
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,450
get Xiao Duo

632
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,560
so smitten?

633
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,170
I hate people

634
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,570
who touch my things.

635
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,760
Let me warn you.

636
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,570
Keep your head down

637
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,320
and act as you should, Consort Duan.

638
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,690
If you do,

639
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,810
I can put a good word in for you

640
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,600
with His Majesty.

641
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,370
Got it?

642
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,130
Today, I will

643
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,920
teach you a lesson.

644
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,090
Your Highness.

645
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,960
Consort Duan is not in good health.

646
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,050
If she gets hurt,

647
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,730
His Majesty will punish us.

648
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,690
I'm teaching her how to behave,

649
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,050
on behalf of His Majesty.

650
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,210
How dare you stop me?

651
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,930
Do you want to lose your pitiful life?

652
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,410
Get lost!

653
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,250
Yes.

654
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,160
How dare you!

655
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,160
Let go of Her Majesty!

656
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,970
If my hands tremble,

657
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,080
and hurt you,

658
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,330
that'll be too bad.

659
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,610
Don't move!

660
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,560
Let's talk.

661
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,480
-Yilan. -Let's go.

662
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,810
Yilan, go get help!

663
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:13,360
-Guards! -Go!

664
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,490
Guards!

665
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,040
Your Highness!

666
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,160
Don't move.

667
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,170
Don't move.

668
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,960
Are you crazy?

669
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,010
I am the Empress!

670
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,050
How dare you hurt me?

671
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,360
Do you know how serious a crime this is?

672
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,240
Don't move.

673
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,930
You used to be the Empress.

674
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:33,010
But things have changed.

675
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,640
Think about it, is there still a place for you

676
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,240
in the Imperial City?

677
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,200
Your Majesty.

678
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,490
Doesn't this sound awkward?

679
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,210
His Majesty personally invested me as Consort Duan,

680
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,650
it's a legitimate title.

681
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,160
You and I are not on equal footing.

682
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,410
If we were to compare,

683
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,690
is your rank really higher than mine?

684
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,650
What do you want?

685
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,920
I have something

686
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,920
I want to ask you.

687
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,170
Your Majesty.

688
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,960
Your Majesty, I've gotten the guards.

689
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,360
Don't move.

690
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,090
Consort Duan took me hostage,

691
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,449
she's up to no good. Take her down!

692
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,320
Don't move.

693
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:23,610
Your Highness.

694
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,420
Blood!

695
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,360
What are you doing?

696
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,080
Blood!

697
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,080
Your Highness.

698
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,090
Your Majesty.

699
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,370
You came with such fanfare

700
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,920
to Deer's Reed Residence.

701
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,840
His Majesty must know about this.

702
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,650
How serious a crime is it

703
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,239
to assault a concubine?

704
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,770
Will you be

705
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,760
consigned to a temple again?

706
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,040
If you go in again,

707
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,560
can you get out?

708
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,449
How dare you threaten me?

709
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,210
Empress Rong'an.

710
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,480
There is a visible injury on Consort Duan.

711
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,050
If His Majesty finds out,

712
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,360
he won't let you off easily.

713
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,010
Blood!

714
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:01,520
Your Highness.

715
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,890
I feel dizzy.

716
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:03,540
Your Highness.

717
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,570
How dare you!

718
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,560
I won't let this slide!

719
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:08,610
Let's go!

720
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,850
Your Majesty.

721
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:10,900
Safe journey.

722
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,530
Help!

723
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,680
We need help!

724
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:13,810
Your Highness!

725
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,600
Over here!

726
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,770
Quick, help Her Highness.

727
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,920
It hurts so much.

728
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,160
Empress Rong'an.

729
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,570
Empress Rong'an.

730
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,280
Consort Duan was just impulsive.

731
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,770
Please don't hold it

732
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,840
against her.

733
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,410
It was tough on you just now.

734
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,410
This is for you,

735
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,800
a token of my apology.

736
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,370
My apologies,

737
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,600
I dare not accept your reward.

738
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,600
After all,

739
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,490
it was His Majesty who wanted to punish Consort Duan.

740
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,820
I didn't expect

741
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,210
to implicate all of you servants.

742
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,500
I know

743
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,810
you understand this.

744
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,290
You came to plead with me

745
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,680
because you're afraid Consort Duan will be implicated,

746
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,610
and make life tougher for you.

747
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,130
You should

748
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,810
put some thought into this yourself.

749
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,130
If His Majesty

750
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,960
valued Consort Duan that much,

751
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,280
would he send me here to teach her a lesson?

752
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,120
He even sent you

753
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,400
to keep watch over her.

754
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,290
How is this different from detaining a criminal?

755
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,410
She offended His Majesty,

756
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,330
so her prospects are limited.

757
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,970
You look like a smart person.

758
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,650
You know who you should obey in the future

759
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,930
to survive.

760
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,480
Right?

761
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,610
I'll do as you say.

762
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,210
These bandits are really troublesome.

763
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,010
We attacked them

764
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,080
so many times,

765
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,880
but we still haven't captured their leader.

766
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,890
How many days have we wasted?

767
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,850
Stop talking.

768
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:05,680
He's here.

769
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,450
Now.

770
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,160
The bandit leader has been captured.

771
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,010
We will return to the capital immediately.

772
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,410
[Deer's Reed Residence]

773
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,690
Your Highness, it's time to eat.

774
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,170
Leave it there.

775
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:55,760
Yes.

776
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,730
I won't let this slide!

777
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:16,720
Let's go!

778
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,920
Your Highness is really interesting.

779
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,050
There's no bait on the hook,

780
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,330
how can you catch a fish on it?

781
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:43,920
None of your business.

782
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:46,930
You may leave.

783
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:48,920
Yes.

784
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,490
It took the bait, didn't it?

785
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,770
You'd better not let go.

786
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,800
How was it?

787
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,200
Consort Duan ate it all,

788
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,320
but there is nothing wrong

789
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,290
with her at all.

790
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,570
How is that possible?

791
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,720
This medicine is damaging to the heart and lungs.

792
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,610
Anyone

793
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,730
would fall severely ill.

794
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,250
Perhaps Consort Duan

795
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,490
is exceptionally hardy,

796
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,450
and a single dose wasn't enough.

797
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,090
Give her more then.

798
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,680
Three meals a day,

799
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,530
plus snacks and supper.

800
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,010
It will definitely work then.

801
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,760
Yes.

802
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,560
How am I worthy

803
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,720
of Rong'an's concern for me?
