00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,120
Your Majesty.

6
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,690
Don't be angry with Her Highness.

7
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,770
Who said I'm angry?

8
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,850
Does a cruel woman

9
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,200
deserve my anger?

10
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,930
Yes, you're the Emperor.

11
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,160
You don't have to get angry

12
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,729
at an ignorant girl.

13
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,090
You've been restless,

14
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,400
day and night,

15
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,560
but it isn't because of Her Highness.

16
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,000
Shush!

17
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,360
Do you think Deer's Reed Residence

18
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,920
is equipped with iceboxes and iced desserts?

19
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,480
Do you think she's angry

20
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,079
that I sent her there?

21
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,850
Tell me,

22
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,930
should I visit her?

23
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:50,770
Your Majesty, it's her fault

24
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,530
that she angered you.

25
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,090
No matter how wronged she feels,

26
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,530
she deserves it.

27
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,320
How can someone like you

28
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,170
humble yourself

29
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,170
by giving in to a concubine?

30
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,530
If people find out,

31
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,160
it'll be embarrassing.

32
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,570
You

33
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,610
should pay more attention

34
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,720
to affairs of the court.

35
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,440
That makes sense.

36
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:13,840
That makes sense.

37
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,130
But I've still decided

38
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,970
to go to Deer's Reed Residence and send her some

39
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,410
food and clothing for the summer.

40
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,490
Go and make the preparations.

41
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,170
Your Majesty-

42
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,410
I'll go in disguise.

43
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,890
I'll be looking from the outside, I won't go in.

44
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,770
No one will find out.

45
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,329
I'll go get it done now.

46
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,970
Wait.

47
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,680
Go to my private treasury and pick carefully.

48
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,810
Go now.

49
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,329
Yes.

50
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,490
That's it. Go now.

51
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,650
After wasting all these poison,

52
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,810
Rong'an should be coming in person soon.

53
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,290
I have a feeling

54
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,320
that it'll be today.

55
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,690
Chief, I just received word

56
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,529
that His Majesty sent Her Highness

57
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,930
out of the palace,

58
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,959
to Deer's Reed Residence.

59
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,810
His Majesty hasn't

60
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,050
visited her in a long time.

61
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,120
I think Her Highness

62
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,800
must have lost favor.

63
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,130
You all return to the Zhaoding Bureau first.

64
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,050
Godfather, you aren't reporting back to the palace?

65
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:35,700
Are you going to

66
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,730
Deer's Reed Residence?

67
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,130
I must see her.

68
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,610
Cherries for sale!

69
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,800
Big and red cherries.

70
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,210
Have a look.

71
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,050
Cherries.

72
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,250
Hurry up.

73
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,450
Hurry up, everyone.

74
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,000
Consort Duan

75
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,800
is such an enigma.

76
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,560
She was sent to this isolated place

77
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,730
right after being conferred the title of Consort.

78
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,970
His Majesty didn't visit her for a long time.

79
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,890
I thought she had lost favour,

80
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,960
but it turns out

81
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,730
His Majesty does have her on his mind.

82
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,930
Every single one of these rewards

83
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,330
is a rare treasure.

84
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,840
I've seen her from a distance,

85
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,090
she's not a great beauty.

86
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,320
You have no idea.

87
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,120
She's a crafty one.

88
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,370
I've heard that

89
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,730
Consort Duan

90
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,090
is extremely good in bed.

91
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,210
She has plenty of tricks

92
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,080
to capture His Majesty's heart and soul.

93
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,920
Why isn't she coming yet?

94
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,720
If she doesn't come,

95
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,680
I'm a dog.

96
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,800
Has someone from the Imperial City come?

97
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,410
Your Highness.

98
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,280
Show them in, quickly.

99
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,730
Your Highness, how did you know?

100
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,530
His Majesty has bestowed many rewards on us.

101
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,010
Eunuch Sun is right outside,

102
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,280
waiting for your reply.

103
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,370
I'll ask him to come in.

104
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,570
What is he doing here?

105
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,760
Ask Eunuch Sun to go back.

106
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:35,530
Also,

107
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,370
ask him to take all those things back.

108
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,330
Are those really the things I need?

109
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,050
Yes.

110
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,250
I wonder

111
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,520
what Xiao Duo is doing now.

112
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,120
West Shu is so far away,

113
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,760
when can he return to the capital?

114
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,930
Forget it.

115
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,720
Why should he come back?

116
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,410
He won't want to see me

117
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,370
ever again.

118
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:10,970
I didn't get off the carriage

119
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,160
to leave with him.

120
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,960
There are so many people around,

121
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,330
are you really going in?

122
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,560
There's no one out there

123
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,730
with the ability

124
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,440
to detect my presence if I don't want them to.

125
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,320
Look.

126
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,280
His Majesty is here,

127
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,360
and he's brought so many rewards.

128
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,170
Losing favor is out of the question.

129
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,720
Qilang was talking nonsense.

130
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,970
She's clearly deeply favored by His Majesty.

132
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,240
I don't think you can go in today.

Let's go back.

134
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,890
If His Majesty

135
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,850
finds out about any of this,

136
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,290
she will die.

137
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,050
We'll return to the Zhaoding Bureau.

138
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,400

Godfather.

140
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,000
You must report to the palace.

141
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,370
Your Majesty, I'm here to report back.

142
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:09,750
Come here.

143
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,050
Your Majesty,

144
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,920
I didn't manage to see Consort Duan.

145
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,600
She wouldn't even see you?

146
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,280
Yes, she made me to wait outside.

147
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,000
She also asked

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,080
to have all these rewards returned.

149
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,250
What she said was,

150
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,370
"Are those really the things I need?"

151
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,610
Fine.

152
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,080
If she wants to stay in that

153
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,250
far-flung place,

154
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,360
let her have her fill!

155
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,330
Let's return.

156
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:42,720
Yes.

157
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,280
Back to the palace.

158

[Deer's Reed Residence]

159
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,520
What is it?

160
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,920
Your Majesty, I just received news.

161
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,770
Chief Xiao has purged the bandits, and traveled day and night

162
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,490
to make his way back.

163
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,080
He has arrived in the capital today.

164
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,800
Why didn't he come to report back to me?

165
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,450
Where is he now?

166
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,000
Zhaoding Bureau.

167
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,050
This Xiao Duo

168
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,570
is getting more and more arrogant,

169
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,050
and without respect for me.

170
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:18,970
Your Majesty.

171
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,620
Lord Bu

172
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,490
seeks an audience with you.

173
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,810
He's outside the palace,

174
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,530
and has been waiting for quite a while.

175
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,560
No. I'll see him during court tomorrow.

176
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,530
I've told him that.

177
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,090
But Lord Bu said

178
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,610
it's a serious matter,

179
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,530
that other officials dare not report.

180
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,010
Only he dares disturb Your Majesty with it.

181
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,760
Fine. Summon him in.

182
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,930
Yes.

183
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,730
Summoning Lord Bu.

184
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,250
Greetings, Your Majesty.

185
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,800
Please rise.

186
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,970
What brings you here?

187
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,680
Rumors are rife amongst the common people.

188
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,400
They're all calling Xiao Duo

189
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,600
is the "True Emperor."

190
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,850
This rumor

191
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,800
has been spreading for over a month.

192
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,800
Everyone knows in the streets and alleys

193
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,840
know of it.

194
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,600
Some are even panegyrizing his meritorious deeds.

195
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,280
I think the rumor

196
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,330
was spread by Xiao Duo himself.

197
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,290
This man is much too ambitious,

198
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,250
Your Majesty must not condone him.

199
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,720
The officials are all afraid of Xiao Duo,

200
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,930
so no one dares speak of the rumor.

201
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,650
Why are you the only one

202
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,600
who dares to report it to me?

203
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,450
Xiao Duo is powerful,

204
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,930
but I believe

205
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,000
only Your Majesty is the true ruler of the Great Ye,

206
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,720
and the true owner of this Imperial City.

207
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,130
I will stop at nothing

208
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,600
to serve Your Majesty.

209
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,770
Even if it costs me my life,

210
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,450
I am not afraid.

211
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,210
You are a righteous and loyal man.

212
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,960
As for that Xiao Duo,

213
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,450
he is a sharp blade

214
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,560
in the Hall of Imperial Supremacy.

215
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,010
He hangs over the ministers' heads,

216
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,730
but he hangs over mine too.

217
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,080
Lord Bu,

218
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,450
are you willing to

219
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,560
sheath this sharp blade for the sake of the Great Ye?

220
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,120
I will give it my all

221
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,970
for Your Majesty.

222
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,680
Good.

223
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,220
It is inappropriate for the Zhaoding Bureau

224
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,880
to wield as much power as it does.

225
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,490
Conversely, the Court of Judicial Review

226
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,080
has become a leisurely office.

227
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,000
It is improper for things to go on like this.

228
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,680
I hereby invest Bu Yulu

229
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,530
as the Chief Minister of the Court of Judicial Review,

230
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,840
effective immediately,

231
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

232
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,890
Your Majesty,

233
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,280
Lord Bu has been sent out of the palace.

234
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,930
The order of investiture

235
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,880
has been issued to the Six Ministries.

236
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,680
But with all due respect,

237
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,250
everyone in the court knows

238
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,770
Lord Bu is rather ineffectual,

239
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,120
and he isn't an able official.

240
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,210
Why does Your Majesty want to use him?

241
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,090
I don't want an able official,

242
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,640
but an obedient dog

243
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,480
to carve up Xiao Duo’s power.

244
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,240
Rulers and their kingdoms fall

245
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,090
when great ministers are too formidable,

246
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,130
and officials are too powerful.

247
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,720
To me, Xiao Duo is precisely

248
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,090
too formidable

249
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,770
and too powerful.

250
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,570
He has rendered me

251
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,890
a useless accessory.

252
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,650
Perhaps, not too long later,

253
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,690
I and my kingdom will fall.

254
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,210
I was wrong

255
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,360
about the reason

256
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,720
Yinlou refuses to accept me.

257
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,600
In her eyes,

258
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,680
I'm just an Emperor in name.

259
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,400
In reality, I am not as powerful as Xiao Duo.

260
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,730
How could she fall for me

261
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,450
and rely on me with peace of mind?

262
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,920
That is why in the future,

263
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,130
I will command

264
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,650
this throne thoroughly.

265
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,640
Your Majesty, this is the way you should be.

266
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,080
Ask Yu Zun to go to the Zhaoding Bureau,

267
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,530
and summon Xiao Duo to meet with me.

268
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,640
Yes.

269
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,630
[Zhaoding Bureau]

270
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,210
Godfather.

271
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,580
You're going to be late

272
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,840
for your audience with His Majesty.

273
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,890
You can't delay it any longer.

274
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,960
Send one of our able men to bring this to her.

275
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,650
You're still thinking about

276
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,290
giving her cherries at this juncture?

277
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,010
Chief.

278
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,280
Chief.

279
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,450
We have trouble.

280
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,970
While we were away from the capital,

281
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,570
rumors started spreading among the people,

282
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,800
calling you the "True Emperor."

283
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,770
The "True Emperor"?

284
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,650
This crime is enough

285
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,480
to have me executed many times over.

286
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,770
It seems that someone in the capital

287
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,760
is trying to stir up trouble.

288
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:28,850
Yes.

289
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:29,970
Look,

290
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,250
you can't even save yourself now.

291
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,080
You need to stop

292
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,370
wasting your energy on others.

293
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,720
Go to the palace now.

294
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,240
After what happened,

295
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,410
you have to at least

296
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,000
try explaining yourself to His Majesty.

297
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,610
Chief.

298
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,600
Someone from the palace is here.

299
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,290
Chief Xiao, your reputation precedes you.

300
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,850
I haven’t had time to report to you.

301
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,120
This is Yu Zun,

302
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,000
the new Commander-general of the Imperial Army.

303
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,840
What brings you here today,

304
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,840
Commander Yu?

305
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,850
I am here to pass His Majesty's order

306
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,010
to summon Chief Xiao to the palace.

307
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,560
Greetings, Your Majesty.

308
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,800
Rise.

309
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,220
[Hall of Imperial Supremacy]

310
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,370
Thank you, Your Majesty.

311
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,600
Thank you for welcoming me back in person,

312
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,240
Your Majesty.

313
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,170
I heard you arrived early in the morning.

314
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,920
Why didn't you report back to the palace?

315
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,640
Your Majesty,

316
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,050
I was in a hurry to come back

317
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,320
to report back to you.

318
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,650
I traveled hastily,

319
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,920
and disheveled myself.

320
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,800
I dared not offend you with my appearance,

321
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,930
so I went back to the Zhaoding Bureau

322
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,120
to wash up.

323
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,850
As such, I delayed returning to the palace.

324
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,640
Please punish me.

325
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,520
Chief Xiao is a pillar of our country.

326
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,560
You pacified the Prince of Nanyuan's rebellion,

327
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,880
and exterminated the bandits.

328

331
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,130
Recently, the commoners

332
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,610
have given you a sobriquet,

333
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,170
"True Emperor."

334
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,720
It seems rather well-deserved.

335
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,090
I am Your Majesty's loyal servant.

336
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,100
This rumor must have been

337
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,720
spread by someone with an ulterior motive.

338
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,290
Please allow me to

339

conduct a thorough investigation

340

into the source of this rumor,

341

and return peace of mind to you.

342

There's no need to investigate.

You're the one I trust the most,

344

why would I believe such slanderous words?

345
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,360
It's just that the Zhaoding Bureau is too prominent,

346
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,640
and attracts unwanted attention.

347
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,920
This is all because

348
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,890
of your powers of reviewing memorials.

349
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,770
I think

350
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,800
you had better surrender that duty.

351
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,440
However,

352
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,730
you're still in charge of the Zhaoding Bureau,

353
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,760
and you must continue

354
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,050
to supervise the actions of the court officials

355
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,760
on my behalf.

356
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,250
I am at your command.

357
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,050
You must be tired from this trip.

358
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,400
I can’t bear

359
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,930
to trouble you all the time.

360
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,810
How about this?

361
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,560
Take a rest.

362
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,170
From now on,

363
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,609
the Court of Judicial Review

364
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,010
will take over the Zhaoding Bureau's cases.

365
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,250
They will share your burden.

366
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:28,930
Thank you for your consideration, Your Majesty.

367
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,770
The position of Chief Minister

368
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,080
has been vacant for a long time.

369
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,200
May I ask who will be filling it?

370
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,490
I can ensure the handover goes smoothly

371
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,040
if I had an idea.

372
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,280
This person actually has a connection

373
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,050
with Chief Xiao.

374
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,480
He is Consort Duan's father,

375
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,800
Lord Bu Yulu.

376
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,720
There's something

377
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,970
I almost forgot.

378
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,130
Ever since Empress Rong'an

379
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,680
moved from Fengyi Palace to Changqing Palace,

380
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,240
she has been dissatisfied with the servants around her.

381
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,570
The Empress Dowager is also

382
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,760
constantly nagging at me.

383
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,120
Since you're idle,

384
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
go and serve her.

385
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,320
You don’t have to come back to Shangqiong Palace with me.

386
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,290
Anyway, you can go now, since you have nothing to do.

387
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,680
Sister-in-law is waiting.

388
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,890
Yes, Your Majesty.

389
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,010
Farewell, Your Majesty.

390
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,410
Godfather.

391
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,930
The Zhaoding Bureau and the Great Ye have a symbotic relationship.

392
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,850
Now, complications have arisen.

393
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,290
What does this all mean?

394
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,650
Why would His Majesty suddenly

395
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,410
promote an incompetent man like Bu Yulu?

396
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,370
His Majesty is suspicious of me,

397
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,760
but he needs me.

398
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,130
It doesn't matter

399
00:18:59,130 --> 00:18:59,730
if Bu Yulu is incompetent.

400
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,450
He just wants someone obedient

401
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,560
to carve up my power.

402
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,010
It happened all of a sudden,

403
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,480
so I was caught off guard.

404
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,050
This half-baked Emperor

405
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,010
is finally getting the hang of things.

406
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,890
How can you be calm?

407
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,530
His Majesty

408
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,960
has transferred you to Changqing Palace.

409
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,610
He's not only demoting you,

410
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,770
but humiliating you.

411
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,360
It's merely a dirty trick.

412
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,770
If you really think I'll roll over,

413
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,840
that'll be too naive.

414
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,490
It's interesting to see

415
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,080
that he's willing to humble himself

416
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,920
and join hands with Rong'an.

417
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,120
What is he after?

418
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,490
You can go back first.

419
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,250
Your servant, Xiao Duo, is back.

420
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,040
Greetings, Your Majesty.

421
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,410
Duo.

422
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,480
Come here.

423
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,170
I'll stay right here,

424
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,320
it's the same.

425
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,330
You don't even want to

426
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,600
patronize me anymore?

427
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,200
How disappointing.

428
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,640
You've misunderstood.

429
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,240
If you opened me up,

430
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,370
you would find that I'm cold-blooded.

431
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,730
I disappoint many people,

432
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,810
you're not the only one.

433
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,480
Ah Duo, I know

434
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,130
His Majesty took away your power.

435
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,360
If you're unhappy,

436
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,480
I will help you

437
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,360
return to your original position.

438
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,210
You only have to return to my side.

439
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,920
I'm afraid Your Majesty is very ill.

440
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,210
It's time to get an imperial physician.

441
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,410
The one who is in trouble

442
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,400
is not me,

443
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,010
but you.

444
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:03,730
What?

445
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,440
You lost your power,

446
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,220
and even begged for your old dog back.

447
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:08,850
Xiao Duo,

448
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,640
why don't you understand

449
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,250
my heart?

450
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,730
Back then,

451
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,560
I was neglected by the late Emperor

452
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,680
and bullied by Noble Consort Shao.

453
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,000
I even wanted to die.

454
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,410
I remember

455
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,530
you came to Fengyi Palace then

456
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,280
to serve incense for me.

457
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,640
That was the first time I saw you.

458
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,890
You said a lot to me,

459
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,520
and reminded me that humanity exists

460
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,330
in the Imperial City.

461
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,240
Have you forgotten?

462
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,570
We were in the same boat.

463
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,090
Duo.

464
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,720
It's cold in the palace.

465
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,880
Let's keep each other warm, shall we?

466
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,210
Your Highness, are you mistaken?

467
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,000
When I first joined the Zhaoding Bureau,

468
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,880
you forced me to work for you

469
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,090
and help you win favor.

470
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,170
You forced me

471
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,450
to deal with not only the late Emperor,

472
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,880
but also you, and the previous Chief.

473
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,530
If I made a single misstep, I would have died horribly.

474
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,210
It would be generous

475
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,120
not to call us enemies.

476
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,890
How could we be friends?

477
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,210
No.

478
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,730
It's not like that.

479
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,400
It's not like that. You're lying to me.

480
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,450
It's all because of Bu Yinlou.

481
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,170
She forced you to be heartless to me.

482
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,360
Since you don't like

483
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,290
my service,

484
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,570
I'll take my leave now.

485
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,610
Xiao Duo.

486
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,400
Duo.

487
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,690
Xiao Duo.

488
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,240
Duo.

489
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,770
What's so good about that woman?

490
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,520
No matter how well you treat her,

491
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,450
she will only treat you as a stepping stone

492
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,290
into His Majesty's bed.

493
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,280
She is his woman.

494
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,690
If she really cared about you,

495
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,610
she would have sacrificed her life

496
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,370
and given up riches for you.

497
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,450
But she didn't.

498
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,720
In her eyes,

499
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,040
you're only a tool,

500
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,280
to be abandoned when the time comes.

501
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,570
She is now

502
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,490
Murong Gaogong's woman.

503
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,810
She has nothing

504
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,560
to do with you anymore.

505
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:31,940
Duo.

506
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,670
[Imperial City, Deer's Reed Residence]

507
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,760
It's him.

508
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,930
He's back.

509
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,680
Why did he give me cherries?

510
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,680
He hasn't given up yet?

511
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,760
I must be overthinking this.

512
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,890
He's so narrow-minded,

513
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,520
there's no need to provoke him.

514
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,720
Maybe

515
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,730
someone from the palace sent it.

516
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,650
Father.

517
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,840
I've known since you were little that

518
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,450
although you're a woman,

519
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,050
you would achieve great things.

520
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,800
As expected,

521
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,520
my Yinlou

522
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,640
is now a mistress of the palace.

523
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,840
His Majesty issued a ban.

524
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,570
It mustn't have been easy

525
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,690
for Father to get in here.

526
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,280
His Majesty is merciful.

527
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,200
He made me the Chief Minister of the Court of Judicial Review.

528
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,840
Although my rank has decreased,

529
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,970
I now hold

530
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,600
a position with real power.

531
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,760
It's the same,

532
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,170
being a minister and a concubine.

533
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,890
We need to know

534
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,210
who the real master of the Imperial City is.

535
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,490
You must be obedient.

536
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,040
What do you mean?

537
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,490
Do I have to say it out loud?

538
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,050
Be more thoughtful when you're in His Majesty's bed,

539
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,640
and use some feminine tricks.

540
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,170
If you make him happy,

541
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,020
you wouldn't be trapped

542
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,130
in a place like this anymore.

543
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,690
I like this place.

544
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,040
Silly girl.

545
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,520
You're too unambitious.

546
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,850
I know when you went to West Shu,

547
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,370
you got involved with that

548
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,360
useless nephew of your mother's.

549
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,040
That's exactly why

550
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,120
His Majesty is unhappy with you.

551
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,290
Do you think

552
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,490
you can do whatever you want,

553
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,080
because Xiao Duo is backing you?

554
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,330
He's just a servant.

555
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,610
Let me tell you.

556
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,930
Xiao Duo is back.

557
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,410
His good days

558
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,760
are behind him now.

559
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,090
Do you know His Majesty promoted me

560
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,210
just so I can check his power?

561
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,640
Now, he has

562
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,010
surrended his powers of reviewing memorials

563
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,250
and his power is weakened.

564
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,530
His Majesty has sent him to Changqing Palace

565
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,880
to serve Empress Rong'an.

566
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,040
He'll fall from power soon.

567
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,010
Once I get something on him,

568
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,450
I will take him down.

569
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,120
Xiao Duo has completely lost

570
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,050
His Majesty's trust.

571
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,400
So you must never

572
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,610
see him again.

573
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,450
Otherwise,

574
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,610
if His Majesty thinks

575
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,880
you're colluding with him,

576
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,400
you will implicate our family.

577
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,690
I understand.

578
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,400
I know

579
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,280
my Yinlou is intelligent.

580
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,600
I trust you.

581
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,640
Okay.

582
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,320
I'm leaving.

583
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,680
Goodbye, Father.

584
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,680
Go back now.

585
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,130
Zhuoying.

586
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,840
It's that bastard.

587
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,760
He's really back.

588
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,570
Zhuoying, I'm really back.

589
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,770
♫ Wind sweeps through the bottom of my heart ♫

590
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,130
Bu Yinlou, you must get a grip.

591
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,120
Don't let him get hurt because of you.

592
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,570
♫ Blowing ripples into our past ♫

593
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,150
♫ Sighing and lamenting ♫

594
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,500
♫ We can't escape parting ♫

595
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,440
You shouldn't be here.

596
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,250
I know.

597
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:04,970
♫ How can ripples form in a mirror ♫

598
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,360
But I couldn't stand it anymore,

599
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,880
and I didn't want to.

600
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,170
You're not willing to run away with me?

601
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,850
♫ The wind cannot dispel my loneliness ♫

602
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,050
I didn't get off the carriage

603
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:18,280
♫ But the sorrows and joys of this world ♫

604
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,420
at Yanguo Mountain that day.

605
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,280
Didn't you understand then?

606
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,560
I don't want to become fugitives with you.

607
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,440
Let's end it here.

608
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,880
♫ Look upon desolation and recklessness ♫

609
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,400
You must be saying this

610
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,570
because you're worried

611
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,060
♫ Not knowing when I can return ♫

612
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,720
His Majesty will harm me, right?

613
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,260
You-

614
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,400
I should thank you.

615
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:31,460
♫ How can we be calculating in this ephemeral world ♫

616
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,640
I was originally

617
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,010
just a Lady in Xiecui Garden.

618
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:28,920
Thanks to your protection,

619
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,970
I lived to this day,

620
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,250
and become a Consort.

621
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,710
♫ The wind has risen in the smoke and rain ♫

622
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,160
Why would you say that?

623
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,010
You don't want to enter the Inner Court.

624
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:46,150
♫ Even if the road ahead is rough ♫

625
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,960
I lied to you.

626
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:52,580
♫ The wind has risen, it's hard to continue  ♫

627
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,120
I don't believe you.

628
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,520
We've been through so much together.

629
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,970
You could possibly have faked

630
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,040
your care for me.

631
00:29:52,920 --> 00:30:00,410
♫ I'll pledge my life to you ♫

632
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,480
Those were just tricks to win you over.

633
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,450
Have you forgotten

634
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,640
how cautious I was with you

635
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,080
in the past?

636
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,580
I was scared of upsetting you,

637
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,400
and losing my life.

638
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,970
If I didn't try my best

639
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:05,960
to protect myself,

640
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,570
how could I have

641
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,970
gotten you

642
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,120
at my beck and call?

643
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,770
I knew you didn't like women.

644
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,040
But as a human,

645
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,020
how could you be free from

646
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,930
emotions and desires?

647
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,320
I seduced you on purpose.

648
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,370
I deliberately played tricks on you,

649
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,650
all the while pretending to be naive.

650
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,410
Do you know why

651
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,880
His Majesty came to West Shu?

652
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,240
That's because I asked my cousin

653
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,290
to send a letter to the capital,

654
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,520
using the Prince of Nanyuan's channels.

655
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,800
You lured him there on purpose?

656
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:46,720
Yes.

657
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,930
Because I wanted to get rid of you.

658
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,450
I wanted to return to the palace.

659
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,170
You knew I was scheming,

660
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,720
but you still allowed me to lead you on,

661
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,240
like a fool.

662
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,490
You've schemed and calculated for so long.

663
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,370
What exactly are you after?

664
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,450
Since I was young,

665
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,560
my life has been decided by others.

666
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,610
I entered the palace because they wanted me to.

667
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,880
I died because they made me a tribute lady.

668
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,530
I don't want to live like that anymore.

669
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,650
I don't want to die quietly,

670
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,200
like my mother did.

671
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,160
I want to become the Empress.

672
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,280
I want to climb to the top of the ladder.

673
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,160
I don't want others

674
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,880
to manipulate me ever again.

675
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,840
What about me?

676
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,800
What am I to you?

677
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,700
Didn't you like me,

678
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,400
not even a little bit?

679
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,130
I did.

680
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,400
But compared to what I really want,

681
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,480
my feelings for you

682
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,450
aren't worth a mention.

683
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,410
I see.

684
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,210
Let me help you.

685
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,240
You can use me

686
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,410
like you did before.

687
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,160
I'll continue to help you

688
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,170
to get what you want.

689
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,130
Xiao Duo,

690
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,890
are you going to lose your dignity

691
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,050
for a woman?

692
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,330
I don't want dignity.

693
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,400
If you want power, I'll fight for it for you.

694
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,450
I'll kill all those who get in your way.

695
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,890
You can make me do anything you want.

696
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,960
Treat me however you like,

697
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,370
I don't care.

698
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,690
I only want you.

699
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,040
Xiao Duo,

700
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,810
you can't even protect yourself now.

701
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,800
Don't drag me down with you.

702
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,640
Stop pestering me.

703
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,000
I know your secret,

704
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,080
so don't piss me off.

705
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,970
Are you threatening me?

706
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,260
You're threatening me

707
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,160
with the secret I told you in good faith?

708
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,210
Yes.

709
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,640
I am threatening you.

710
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,450
Didn't you say

711
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,170
you can do

712
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,050
anything I want you to do?

713
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,840
Listen carefully.

714
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,770
I want you to get lost.

715
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:03,920
Wait.

716
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,000
Actually, I hate sweet food.

734
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,170
I learned those

735
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,770
seductive dances

736
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,540
so I could

737
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,160
make you fall for me,

738
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,680
and not deny your feelings any longer.

739
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,640
I did it on purpose

740
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,370
that time my legitimate mother forced me to get married.

741
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,890
I already knew

742
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,200
my mother was dead,

743
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,210
but I played along

744
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,090
to beat them at their own game.

745
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,930
It's because you

746
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,840
have too much self-control.

747
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,720
If I didn't force your hand,

748
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,800
when would you have

749
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,680
opened your heart to me?

750
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,450
When would you have fallen for me?

751
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,810
That time we encountered the Prince of Nanyuan's assassins,

752
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,560
when I got shot and fell into the river,

753
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,840
you risked your life to save me.

754
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,120
I did that on purpose too.

755
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,760
You married me—

756
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,050
It was all to win your heart.

757
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,770
At first, I thought

758
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,010
you were a eunuch.

759
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,400
It was fine to get involved with you.

760
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,810
But it turns out you're a fake.

761
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,970
It's no longer worth it

762
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,120
to be involved with you.

763
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,640
Godfather,

764
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,890
did you secretly

765
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,850
go to Deer's Reed Residence?

766
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,210
If you're really that worried about Godmother,

767
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,450
I'll send more men

768
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,490
to scope out the situation.

769
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,490

773

From now on, no one is to

774
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,920
keep watch over her.

775
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,570

Suhuai sent a message.

saying many hurtful things

before kicking him out.

817
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,770
Chief Xiao is arrogant

You can rest assured now, Your Highness.

822
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,640
As long Bu Yinlou is still alive,

823
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,280
I cannot rest assured.

824
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,580
I drugged her

825
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,080
so many times,

826
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,490
but nothing happened to her at all.

827
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,200
Looks like

828
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,160
we'll have to step up our game.

829
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:45,620
Your Highness,

830
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,420
you're the only one who can enter Deer's Reed Residence

831
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,360
without being summoned.

832
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,240
It's fine

833
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,460
to mess around with Consort Duan.

834
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,300
But if we kill her,

835
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,190
you will be the first person

836
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,780
His Majesty suspects.

837
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,480
Then we'll lure her outside and kill her.

838

they've gone too far,

841
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,010
we mustn't take it lying down.

842
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,190
Chief.

843
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,980
Chief, are you listening?

844
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,050
Go on.

845
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,070
Lord Bu has gone too far.

846
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,580
Several of our

847
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,760
important cases

848
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,020
were taken away by the Court of Judicial Review.

849
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,030
He wants to make use of His Majesty

850
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,120
to climb up the ladder.

851
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,680
But he shouldn't

852
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,150
trample on you like this.

853
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,080
Why are you pulling at me?

854
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:46,730
Chief?

855
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,370
Now that they have Lord Bu backing them,

856
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,760
all those high-ranking officials

857
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,600
we offended in the past

858
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,730
are giving us a hard time.

859
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,200
Should we do something about Lord Bu?

860
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:54,960
What should we do?

861
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,100
The Chief has ordered us

862
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,540
to stand down.

863
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,800
That ragtag group

864
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,900
are of no threat to us.

865
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,520
Don't you have

866
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,730
anything else to report?

867
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:11,550
No.

868
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,440
Think again.

869
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,940
I see.

870
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,530
You want to ask about

871
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,890
our investigation into the murderer?

872
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:23,850
Yes.

873
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,660
We have no leads.

874
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:28,010
Should I send some men

875
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,100
to scout around in West Shu again?

876
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,860
There's no need.

877
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,630
His Majesty has his guard up against me right now.

878
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,850
It'll be hard for us

879
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,980
to get to Yuwen Liangshi.

880
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,500
I was blindsided then.

881
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,560
Thinking back,

882
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,700
the carriage that night

883
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,300
definitely belonged to the Prince of Nanyuan.

884
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,480
Even if Yuwen Liangshi was not the murderer,

885
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,460
he must be involved with the murderer.

886
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,480
Investigate the comings and goings

887
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,780
of all those in the capital with ties to him

888
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:52,790
on the day of the murder.

889
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,630
Got it.

890
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,280
No wonder you have been

891
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,620
looking at these records for hours.

892
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:58,500
Chief,

893
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,960
it turns out

894
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,730
you're holding your records

895
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,620
the wrong way around.

896
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,510
Chief She,

897
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,950
you do have a mouth,

898
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,840
but you don't have to use it to speak.

899
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,490
Regardless of whether I have a mouth, or use it to speak,

900
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,470
Chief is holding his records upside down.

901
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,890
Is anything wrong?

902
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,990
If you have any questions,

903
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:45,920
just ask.

904
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,600
I'll tell you everything I know.

905
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,750
Any news from Deer's Reed Residence?
