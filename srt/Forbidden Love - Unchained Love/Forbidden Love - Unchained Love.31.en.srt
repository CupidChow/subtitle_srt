[Unchained Love]

00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,880
[Episode 31]

4
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,500
You still can't let go

5
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,740
of the revenge?

6
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,740
I'm just thinking

7
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,620
Duo died because of power.

8
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,940
So I stepped into the Imperial City

9
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,060
to seize power.

10
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,700
I watched many people

11
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,220
die because of me.

12
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,900
Then,

13
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,020
the royalty with the greatest power

14
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,980
is suppressing me and urging me to die.

15
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,020
What is the justice

16
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,100
I'm seeking for?

17
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,380
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

18
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,780
To stop killing with killing.

19
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,970
Is this what I want?

20
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:54,460
A life for a life is a matter of course.

21
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,220
Isn't that how it should be?

22
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,540
There's no other way.

23
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,140
Anyway,

24
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,780
you are trapped here.

25
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,940
You mentioning these...

26
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,740
The construction of the mausoleum has been dragging on.

27
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,500
the Municipal Council wants to embarrass me.

28
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,340
Send a letter to the capital

29
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,060
and tell them

30
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,900
don't push the blame

31
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,340
on me.

32
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,860
Understood.

33
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,780
You're still not making your move?

34
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,700
Are you waiting for me to strike first?

35
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,540
Next,

36
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,100
you'd better say something I want to hear.

37
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,020
Such a huge scene.

38
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,780
Who sent them?

39
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,900
Bu Yulu.

40
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,020
He dares to assassinate me openly.

41
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,140
Something must have happened in the capital.

42
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,300
Oh no.

43
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,580
Qilang sent me a message

44
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,540
just now.

45
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,620
He said the Emperor went hunting

46
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,620
and allowed the Prince of Nanyuan to go with him.

47
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,700
He even ordered Bu Yulu

48
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,220
to take over the guarding of the battlefield.

49
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,860
Did something happen?

50
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,380
It probably already happened.

51
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,580
One more thing.

52
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,500
Godmother is there too.

53
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,340
Gather everyone

54
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,540
around here

55
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,540
to go to the battlefield.

56
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,740
If you leave the mausoleum...

57
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,460
I don't care.

58
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,780
You're disobeying the order.

59
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,380
Godfather.

60
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,380
His Majesty will find a way

61
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,100
to deal with you.

62
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,900
Young Prince?

63
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,740
Did the news leak?

64
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,860
It's just a battle between trapped animals.

65
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,140
Brother, stop it.

66
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:06,780
If you don't stop now,

67
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,220
there will be no turning back.

68
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:08,740
I have been waiting

69
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,620
for too long for this day to come.

70
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,340
If I don't succeed, I'll be benevolent

71
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,700
and never turn back.

72
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,700
As a member of the Yuwen family,

73
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,420
you should pick up your sword

74
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,580
and help me take down the Great Ye.

75
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,180
The country's foundation is shaken

76
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,900
and everyone is dying./

77
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,820
Is this your Great Ye?

78
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,580
Take him away.

79
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,700
Let go of me!

80
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,900
Brother!

81
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,180
the Lord Bu you trust

82
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,220
colluded with the Prince of Nanyuan.

83
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Now he is leading the rebels

84
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,060
to attack the battlefield.

85
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,180
Come here.

86
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:52,140
Brother.

87
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,659
look carefully.

88
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,540
This is the girl you adore.

89
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,659
She's also the spy

90
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,340
planted by Prince of Nanyuan and Bu Yulu.

91
00:06:58,659 --> 00:06:59,940
She stole the commander's seal from you

92
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,860
and transferred the Imperial Guards away.

93
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,860
That's why the rebels rushed in.

94
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,020
It has nothing to do with me.

95
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,900
It was Father and Prince of Nanyuan's order.

96
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,500
I was forced.

97
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,580
I'll kill you!

98
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,300
Your Majesty.

99
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,300
The rebels are outside now.

100
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,380
She is the concubine of Prince of Nanyuan,

101
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,220
and the legitimate daughter of the Bu family.

102
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,380
If you kill her now,

103
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:18,930
you will only give the rebels

104
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,180
a reason to charge in.

105
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,220
Are you also

106
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,500
setting traps for me just

107
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,020
like your good father.

108
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,620
I also wanted to tell you.

109
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,180
But I didn't have a chance.

110
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,810
Bu Yinlou warned you long ago.

111
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,620
It's just that

112
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,220
you were tricked by this woman

113
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:30,980
and refused to believe her.

114
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,659
Luckily, she told me in time

115
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,580
We deployed troops in time.

116
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,620
That's how we managed

117
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,860
to hold it off for a moment.

118
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,540
But I don't know

119
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,300
how long we can hold on for.

120
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,540
Drag this bitch out!

121
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,500
Punish her severely!

122
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,020
Yes.

123
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,900
I was wrong.

124
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,620
Stop dawdling and go to the hall.

125
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:54,860
Hurry.

126
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,060
Let's go.

127
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,700
Your Majesty, to the right.

128
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,780
Murong Gaogong is foolish.

129
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,180
Today,

130
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,060
I, Yuwen Liangshi,

131
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,860
will be rebelling

132
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,020
to restore our country.

133
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,860
Those inside, listen carefully.

134
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,500
Before noon tomorrow,

135
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,980
Murong Gaogong has to issue his own decree

136
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,700
to abdicate to position.

137
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,940
If you don't listen,

138
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,490
we will charge in

139
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,220
and kill everyone.

140
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,300
Attack! Attack!

141
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,300
Attack! Attack!

142
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,299
Attack! Attack!

143
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,370
Attack! Attack!

144
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,500
Attack! Attack!

145
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,900
Attack!

146
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,730
Your Majesty, why don't you issue an edict?

147
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,500
Edict?

148
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,780
What edict?

149
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,620
You want me to abdicate?

150
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,180
I'm the true Emperor.

151
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,100
How can I be held hostage by rebels?

152
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,620
You traitors!

153
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,620
Traitors!

154
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,340
Your Majesty!

155
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,100
Traitor!

156
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,060
Your Majesty!

157
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:24,740
Execute him on the spot!

158
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,980
Execute him on the spot!

159
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,860
Your Majesty.

160
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,180
Your Majesty.

161
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,100
I'm sorry then.

162
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:30,860
Go!

163
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,500
What are you doing?

164
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,060
What are you doing?

165
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,140
Are you rebelling?

166
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,260
Back down right now!

167
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,220
No!

168
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,740
Only by killing him

169
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,300
will the Prince of Nanyuan will let us go.

170
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:40,940
Yes.

171
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,780
Go! Kill him!

172
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,060
Fine, let me do it first.

173
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,460
Your Highness.

174
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,220
Yinlou,

175
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,540
what are you doing?

176
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,460
I'm going to kill Murong Gaogong of course.

177
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,140
After leaving this door,

178
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,850
the Prince of Nanyuan will change his stance

179
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,260
and become righteous,

180
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,660
and will kill me,

181
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,300
who killed the emperor.

182
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,700
In that case, he will naturally ascend to the throne.

183
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,780
Who

184
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,860
wants to be the traitor who killed the emperor?

185
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,260
Come on, I'll give it to you.

186
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:18,940
I dare not.

187
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,620
Then go back and stay there.

188
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,660
Leave now.

189
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,210
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

190
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,860
Please forgive me.

191
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,900
It's urgent.

192
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,980
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

193
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,580
Guards!

194
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,100
Charge out with me.

195
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:42,580
Yes.

196
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,740
Your Majesty, you can't do that.

197
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,140
You don't have many guards left.

198
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,140
The situation outside is unknown.

199
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:48,940
If we go out now,

200
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,620
it will be futile.

201
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,100
Should we just

202
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:51,940
stay here

203
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,020
and wait to die?

204
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,300
Your priority now

205
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,100
is to survive.

206
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,180
As long as you are alive,

207
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,380
the Prince of Nanyuan will always

208
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,260
be a rebel.

209
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,500
Fine, tell me.

210
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,660
What should we do?

211
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,780
The surrounding area is complicated.

212
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,300
But there may be a way out.

213
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,780
Wanwan, you are familiar with this place.

214
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,140
Is there any other way

215
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,980
to get out?

216
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,620
You stay here.

217
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,740
I'll go out and check.

218
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,980
You, follow me.

219
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,660
Yes.

220
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,300
I won't die.

221
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,420
I won't die here.

222
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,100
Can we get out of here?

223
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:10,940
How is it?

224
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,180
There is a secret door

225
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,340
with the fewest number of rebels guarding outside.

226
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,300
As they change shifts,

227
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,050
we might have a chance

228
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,740
to escape.

229
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,500
Okay.

230
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,620
Let's go.

231
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,540
The time is too short.

232
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,220
I'm afraid there aren't enough time for many people to leave.

233
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,220
Then hurry up

234
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,860
send His Majesty out first.

235
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,180
You can't be in danger.

236
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,260
Even if we escape from the palace,

237
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,060
there are many rebels along the way.

238
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,900
We know nothing about the enemy.

239
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,420
We don't know even know

240
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,740
if we can leave the palace alive.

241
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,500
Send someone out to ask for help.

242
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,700
The capital is over a thousand miles away from here.

243
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,740
We can't make it back

244
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,210
before noon.

245
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,220
We don't have to go to the capital.

246
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,060
Go to the imperial mausoleum to report to Chief Xiao.

247
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,100
The mausoleum is not far from here.

248
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,380
The Zhaoding Bureau

249
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,340
is scattered all over the country.

250
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,580
As long as we summon Chief Xiao

251
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,220
to bring Zhaoding Guards to save His Majesty

252
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,460
we can solve the problem.

253
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,740
I will never seek help from him.

254
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,380
Your Majesty,

255
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,980
you must have a better way then?

256
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,500
Brother,

257
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,900
listen to Yinlou.

258
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,220
Yuzun.

259
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,020
Sent someone to send an imperial edict to Yuzun.

260
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,060
He led the imperial army to the mausoleum.

261
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,700
Why did Commander Yu go to the mausoleum?

262
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,900
Because I gave him

263
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,900
a secret edict.

264
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:17,980
As long as Xiao Duo dares

265
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,460
step out of the imperial mausoleum,

266
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,180
kill him on the spot.

267
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:51,780
Godfather!

268
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,500
Kill him on the spot.

269
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,380
May I know what

270
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,260
did Chief Xiao commit?

271
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,660
The Zhaoding Bureau is overbearing,

272
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,660
causing chaos to Daye.

273
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,140
As the chief of Zhaoding Bureau,

274
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,580
he is the biggest sinner.

275
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,060
Is that so?

276
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,140
If the world

277
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,540
is peaceful,

278
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,970
why would there be a Zhaoding Bureaum,

279
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,650
and why would there be a Chief Xiao?

280
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,900
How dare you question me for a servant?

281
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,500
Yinlou, stop it.

282
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,420
The reason why Great Ye

283
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,860
promoted Chief Xiao to such a high position

284
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,700
is because the Great Ye needs him.

285
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,860
Chief Xiao has done

286
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,980
so many things for the Great Ye,

287
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,060
and is stained with blood

288
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,060
and cussed at.

289
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,570
You just established your country,

290
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,780
and you already can't tolerate him anymore?

291
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,980
Either he stays in the imperial mausoleum

292
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,260
and be at your disposal.

293
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,860
Or he disobeys your imperial edit

294
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,700
and give you a good reason

295
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,860
to kill him.

296
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,940
What a scheme.

297
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:51,500
What I want to do

298
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,500
has nothing to do with

299
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,660
you, a woman.

300
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,660
-Your Majesty. -Yinlou.

301
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,940
You are paranoid and arrogant.

302
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,580
You transferred Xiao Duo and trusted Prince of Nanyuan.

303
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,660
You're the one who caused this to us

304
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,580
and yourself.

305
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,420
That's why we're trapped here.

306
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,020
If Xiao Duo disobeys the order to leave the mausoleum,

307
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,020
and Yuzun goes after him,

308
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,020
where will your edict

309
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,090
will be sent to?

310
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,860
Find Yuzun.

311
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,060
Go arrange

312
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,660
for the edict to be delivered

313
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,420
to Yuzun.

314
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,060
Yes.

315
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,140
Wanwan, are you alright?

316
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:39,660
I’m fine.

317
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,220
All the people we sent out

318
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,700
have been caught by the rebels.

319
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,780
Why are you here?

320
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,580
I'm worried about you

321
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,540
so I followed you here.

322
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,460
Let me go out

323
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,260
with you.

324
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:47,900
Nonsense.

325
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,100
Go back. I'll go by myself.

326
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,260
Wait.

327
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,620
I have an idea.

328
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,020
Stop!

329
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:05,900
Stop!

330
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,540
Lord Bu.

331
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,100
Where is Murong Gaogong

332
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,020
hiding in the palace?

333
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:20,940
Lord Bu,

334
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,180
they said he's in the hall.

335
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,660
Kill all of them.

336
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,140
When we rush into the hall,

337
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,660
don't let anyone go alive.

338
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,100
Yes.

339
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,060
Lord Bu.

340
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,580
What should we do about

341
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,340
Consort Dowager Duan and Concubine Rong?

342
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,180
They have been with Murong Gaogong,

343
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,780
they can't be kept.

344
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,260
Kill them.

345
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:47,780
Go.

346
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:49,860
Hurry up.

347
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:15,740
Xiao Duo.

348
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:18,210
Xiao Duo.

349
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,890
Xiao Duo.

350
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,540
Xiao Duo.

351
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,609
Xiao Duo.

352
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,940
Xiao Duo.

353
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:34,940
Xiao Duo.

354
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,500
Xiao Duo.

355
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,580
Why are you here?

356
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,260
Chief Xiao,

357
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,690
I advise you not to act rashly.

358
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,700
Consort Dowager Duan.

359
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,300
Forgive me for not being able to greet you politely.

360
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,660
Are you just

361
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,660
putting on a show?

362
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,660
Let's go.

363
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,260
Yes.

364
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,500
The forest is surrounded by Imperial Army.

365
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,420
Cheif Xiao,

366
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,660
you won't be able to leave today.

367
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,100
The Prince of Nanyuan started a rebellion on the battlefield.

368
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,500
His Majesty is in critical condition.

369
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,460
I need to go to save His Majesty immediately.

370
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,860
Please let me go.

371
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,260
Chief Xiao has always been cunning

372
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,340
and eloquent.

373
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,940
I dare not accept it.

374
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,260
Whether it's true or not,

375
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,940
what you're betting on is His Majesty's life.

376
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,460
Can you afford it?

377
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,460
If you don’t believe me,

378
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,540
you can go with me.

379
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,500
Fine.

380
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,340
I can spare you for now,

381
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,700
but I can't let you go.

382
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,260
Unless I have an order,

383
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,060
I dare not believe it.

384
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,220
I have the emperor's edict.

385
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,020
His Majesty has an order.

386
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,060
The commander of the Imperial Force, Yuzun, receive the command.

387
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,940
Commander of the Imperial Force, Yuzun.

388
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,020
The Prince of Nanyuan has committed a rebellion.

389
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,380
I'm trapped in the battlefield.

390
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,420
Let's put everything aside and save His Majesty first.

391
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

392
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,100
Are we still going to fight?

393
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,340
What do you think?

394
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,300
No, we brought a whole bunch of things

395
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,580
while coming here.

396
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,380
It's heavy.

397
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,010
Why were you crying just now?

398
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,980
Wouldn't you cry if you lost your husband?

399
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,060
You scared me.

400
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,980
Why did you

401
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,380
leave the mausoleum for no reason?

402
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,580
I can't care anymore.

403
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,660
I'm afraid you'll die.

404
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,100
Why did you leave the battlefield

405
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,220
on your own?

406
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,100
Do you want to die?

407
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,620
I can't care either.

408
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,260
I'm afraid you'll die.

409
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,410
It's such a big hole.

410
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,420
How could you not get hurt?

411
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,540
It's all thanks do your blessings.

412
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,740
You always call me your Fish Immportal,

413
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,860
but actually,

414
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,100
you are my Fish Immortal.

415
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,860
My life

416
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,580
can't be without your blessing.

417
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,020
Fine.

418
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,090
All my blessings

419
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,460
will be used to save you.

420
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:14,620
Zhuo Ying,

421
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,260
you should know

422
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,580
this chaos

423
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,540
is a good chance for me to take you away.

424
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,580
We're not going to the battlefield anymore?

425
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,340
After all, I'm a selfish person.

426
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,140
I don't care

427
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,660
who is sitting on the throne.

428
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,260
I'll go if you want me to.

429
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,660
If you don't want me to go,

430
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,940
I'll take you away in the chaos.

431
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,540
I'm useless.

432
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,060
But I also know

433
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,740
there is no usurping the throne

434
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,220
that could avoid bleeding and casualties.

435
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,050
If the war continues,

436
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,220
from the nobles

437
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,900
to the people,

438
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,620
no one can survive.

439
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,460
That will only be

440
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,940
a more dangerous world.

441
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,020
Xiao Duo,

442
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,020
I'm also a selfish person.

443
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,420
I don't want to live

444
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,980
in such a world.

445
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,180
Let's go to the field.

446
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,500
Okay.

447
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,460
You planned to go

448
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,980
since the beginning, right?

449
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,660
You made it sound so nice but they're just nonsense.

450
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,100
His Majesty suspects

451
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,140
that you would ruin the country.

452
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,260
He's thinking too much.

453
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,500
He just doesn't believe

454
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,410
there'd be someone like you in this world,

455
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,090
even in chaotic times,

456
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,740
your heart is still loyal.

457
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,900
This place is not far from the field.

458
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,700
Wait for me here.

459
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,340
Qilang.

460
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,060
Leave some men to protect Her Highness.

461
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:40,780
Yes.

462
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,100
Be careful.

463
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,100
Let's go.

464
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:51,660
Let's go.

465
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,260
Young Prince!

466
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,100
Young Prince!

467
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,020
Young Prince!

468
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,260
Your Highness, it's past noon.

469
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,340
Since Murong Gaogong doesn't know what's good for him,

470
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,940
he shouldn't blame me

471
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,140
for being merciless to him.

472
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,500
Soldiers, listen up.

473
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,860
Follow me to charge into the palace.

474
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,460
Charge!

475
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,700
Charge!

476
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,530
Charge!

477
00:24:54,140 --> 00:25:01,060
-Charge! -Charge!

478
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,060
Chase them!

479
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,620
Murong Gaogong, it's your death day!

480
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,260
How could it be you?

481
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:22,780
Commander Yu,

482
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,940
take some men to go look for His Majesty.

483
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:24,780
I'll sort the rebels out.

484
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,140
Okay.

485
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,460
You deserve to die!

486
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,210
Get out of my way.

487
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,940
Today, the fate of the Yuwen clan

488
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,940
depends solely on this.

489
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,860
If you still regard me as your brother,

490
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,420
then kill her

491
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,380
and we shall capture Murong Gaogong together.

492
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,650
Father and Mother passed away early.

493
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,740
It was you who raised me.

494
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,020
I treat you like my father.

495
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,140
You were the one who taught me martial arts,

496
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,380
so that I could be able to protect

497
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,210
the people who are important to me.

498
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,940
Now that someone important to me

499
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,100
is right behind me,

500
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,220
I must protect her no matter what.

501
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,900
Even if it's you,

502
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,220
I won't let you hurt her.

503

521
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,910
♫ I'm tired of the moonlight ♫

522
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,700
♫ So I take sunset ♫

523
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:19,590
♫ as a sin ♫

524
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:24,300
♫Our previous life is still asleep, it's still conjecture♫

525
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,300
You can't stop me.

526
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,140
♫ My song of moonlight ♫

527
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,730
♫ Who will I sing it with ♫

528
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,360
♫ The candle is out ♫

529
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,710
♫ How do I cover my dried tears ♫

530
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:44,110
♫ It's my fault for being too harsh ♫

531
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,460
Fool.

532
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,420
No!

533
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,460
Liangxu.

534
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,460
Liangxu.

535
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,220
How are you?

536
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,860
Liangxu.

537
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,460
Liangxu.

538
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:23,940
It's okay.

539
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,370
I'm fine.

540
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,140
Brother.

541
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,730
Liangxu, Liangxu!

542
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,140
Godfather.

543
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,500
The rebels are under control.

544
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,380
Liangxu.

545
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,340
With my defeat today,

546
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,700
the Yuwen clan

547
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,980
will definitely be overthrown.

548
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,180
I'm willing to pay for my crimes with my life

549
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,020
in exchange for my brother,

550
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,420
Yuwen Liangxu's safety.

551
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,660
No, no.

552
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,740
Now the only one I can entrust this with

553
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,460
is you, Chief Xiao.

554
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,139
Please promise me.

555
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,219
Brother!

556
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:17,940
Liangxu!

557
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:21,580
Liangxu.

558
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,409
Brother!

559
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,620
Brother! Brother! 
 Liangxu.

560
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:38,980
Liangxu.

561
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,340
Liangxu.

562
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,940
Brother!

563
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:49,940
Brother...

564
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,340
Liangxu.

565
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,580
Brother!

566
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,860
Brother...

567
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,180
Liangxu.

568
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:17,740
Brother!

569
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,300
Liangxu.

570
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,900
Brother!

571
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:33,860
Brother...

572
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,460
Liangxu.

573
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,980
Brother!

574
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,060
Bu Yulu.

575
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,540
Lord Bu!

576
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,940
How capable of you.

577
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,740
You've been hiding in the court for so many years.

578
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,980
Once I ascended the throne,

579
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,500
you used the marriage of your head daughter

580
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,860
to get rid of my doubts towards you.

581
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,580
Then you used Yinlou to gain my trust,

582
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,140
suppress Xiao Duo,

583
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,900
and help Prince of Nanyuan enter the capital.

584
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,300
Every single move of yours was inconspicuous.

585
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,300
I take my hat off to you.

586
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,900
Aren't you the same?

587
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,540
We are the same.

588
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,140
In the Imperial City,

589
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,420
the dynamic between ruler and subject

590
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,580
is just

591
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,020
you making use of me,

592
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,860
and me making use of you.

593
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,460
What I gave you

594
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,340
is by no means less than what Yuwen Liangshi offered you.

595
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,300
If you surrender to me,

596
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,740
I'll confer you the title of Duke immediately.

597
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,140
Your Majesty.

598
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,140
I know what people like you

599
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,660
are like.

600
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,730
When you lose favor, you are completely useless.

601
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,340
Whenever you gain power,

602
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,780
you lose all self-control.

603
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,620
In your bones,

604
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,020
you're nothing but a coward.

605
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,860
You are incapable of protecting the country,

606
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,700
and yet you are wary of everyone around you.

607
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,300
In exchange for momentary benefits,

608
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,780
you can promise anything,

609
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,700
but you can also annul anything you've promised.

610
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,860
I don't trust you,

611
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,380
and I despise you too.

612
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:57,460
How dare you!

613
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:58,860
I...

614
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,060
I will tear you into pieces.

615
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,100
Your Majesty.

616
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,060
I'm afraid that may not be in the cards for you.

617
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,340
Be careful, Your Majesty.

618
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,420
Escort Murong Gaogong back.

619
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,860
So close.

620
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,940
I was so close.

621
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,300
Take him away.

622
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:10,900
Move.

623
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,100
Your Majesty!

624
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,690
Check over there.

625
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,540
Your Majesty!

626
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,380
Save His Majesty!

627
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,900
I've been planning for so many years.

628
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,020
I didn't expect that

629
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,140
you would foil my plans.

630
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,060
Xiao Duo, good for you.

631
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,060
But remember,

632
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,860
Murong Gaogong

633
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,660
already intended to kill you.

634
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,260
You will end up in a worse state than me.

635
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,180
Xiao Duo,

636
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,460
you can't kill me.

637
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,460
Time and time again,

638
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,090
you've stood up for Yinlou.

639
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,300
That shows that you've fallen for her.

640
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,220
I'm her father.

641
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,540
She listens to me the most.

642
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,580
If you want her,

643
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,780
I'll let her serve you

644
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,260
and be at your disposal.

645
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,020
Someone like you

646
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,220
doesn't deserve to be her father.

647
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,220
Xiao Duo,

648
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,540
if you kill me,

649
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,380
Yinlou,

650
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,460
Yinlou will never forgive you

651
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,740
for the rest of her life.

652
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,900
Lock Bu Yulu up in the prison

653
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,860
to await his punishment.

654
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,340
Why didn't you come in and stop me?

655
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,740
You won't kill him.

656
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,340
You are different from him.

657
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,260
You care about me.

658
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,300
You really have me under your thumb.

659
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,380
No.

660
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,460
I didn't go in

661
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,020
because I know

662
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,380
this would be the result.

663
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,300
But I don't know

664
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,500
how to face you.

665
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,660
I feel like

666
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,010
I can't be at ease.

667
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,620
I think I'm despicable.

668
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,700
I feel like

669
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,570
I'm using your feelings for me

670
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,340
to manipulate you.

671
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,740
I'm really sad.

672
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:47,700
Fang Jiang.

673
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,860
I'm really, really sad.

674
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:10,860
The reason why I didn't kill him

675
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,020
is not just because of you.

676
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,700
This is also my choice.

677
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,500
All this while I've been thinking,

678
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:19,700
what does the justice I've been seeking

679
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,860
actually look like?

680
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,140
I used to think

681
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,690
just killing the murderer

682
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,740
would be able to put an end to the killing.

683
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,060
Will there really be an end?

684
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:31,340
All these years,

685
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,380
countless people have died

686
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:33,900
at my hands.

687
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,660
What's the difference between

688
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,540
someone like Bu Yulu and me?

689
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:40,700
Then,

690
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,380
have you found the answer?

691
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,420
The justice I want

692
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,850
is not having people use their power and status

693
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,700
to ride above others,

694
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,980
and getting to decide who lives and who dies,

695
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,370
controlling the fates of others

696
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,380
for the sake of their own selfish desires.

697
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,260
Even if I'm guilty of it,

698
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:01,900
I hope the law will give these people

699
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,140
the punishment they deserve.

700
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,380
Zhuo Ying.

701
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,340
I hope that from now on with you,

702
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,380
I can be free of sins.

703
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,900
And that I can start afresh.

704
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,060
Um...

705
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:34,540
although what you are saying is quite touching,

706
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,620
but there are so many people here.

707
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:40,700
Maybe we should stop hugging.

708
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,580
What are you afraid of?

709
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,100
They dare not come over.

710
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:46,380
Even if I do something more daring,

711
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,180
what can they do?

712
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,620
Control yourself.

713
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:00,140
G- Godfather.

714
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,100
Commander Yu is here.

715
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,860
He says he has something important to discuss with you.

716
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,860
I'll go and handle the situation first.

717
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,100
I'll get Qilang to send you back.

718
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,140
Tonight, at a quarter to nine.

719
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,860
Chief Xiao,

720
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,900
Allow me to apologize for

721
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,380
offending you previously.

722
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,580
The situation is urgent now,

723
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,140
Chief Xiao, please help us out.

724
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,100
I will definitely repay you

725
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,100
for your kindness in the future.

726
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,500
Please don't be so formal with me,

727
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,020
I dare not accept it.

728
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:44,940
What happened?

729
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,780
His Majesty is seriously injured

730
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,860
and is unconscious.

731
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,260
I know this is no small matter,

732
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,380
and I dare not make a decision on my own.

733
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,860
I hope you can step forward

734
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:53,860
and make a decision.

735
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,380
We won't be able to keep the revolt at Weichang under wraps.

736
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,020
On top of that, if people find out

737
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,580
His Majesty is seriously injured,

738
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,500
I'm afraid it will cause

739
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,660
a bigger stir in the court.

740
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:07,530
We can't go back to the palace now.

741
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:09,060
Cao Chun'ang.

742
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,420
Summon a few trustworthy imperial doctors,

743
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,460
and send His Majesty immediately

744
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,780
to Deer's Reed Residence for treatment.

745
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,340
Remember,

746
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,980
make sure no word gets out.

747
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:16,740
Yes.
