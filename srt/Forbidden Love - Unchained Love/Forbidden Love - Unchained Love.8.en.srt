00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,220
I made a mountains and rivers painting.

347
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,700
I hope that you will accept it.

348
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,260
My daughter is young and ignorant.

349
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,180
In the future, I will have to trouble you

350
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,940
to keep an eye on her.

351
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,060
Grand Tutor Bu, you worry too much.

352
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,380
I will take good care of Her Highness.

353
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,660
Goodbye.

354
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,950
[Bu's Residence]

355
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,300
He's quite generous.

356
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,700
Your Highness.

357
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,570
Don't try to persuade me.

358
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,890
What an aristocratic family! What a father!

359
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,340
He's so shameless

360
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,620
while he's selling off his daughter.

361
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,760
He's fed all his conscience to the dogs!

362
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,980
Anyone can say that,

363
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,100
anyone except

364
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,620
him, a father.

365
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,200
No.

366
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,620
That's my money you were throwing away.

367
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:36,420
Didn't I

368
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,460
throw it in the carriage?

369
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,340
I'll pick it up after I have vented my frustrations.

370
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,300
I meant,

371
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,700
if you don't like it,

372
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,500
feel free to throw it away.

373
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,220
Don't worry about me.

374
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,620
I refuse.

375
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,060
It wasn't easy to get this out of him.

376
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,090
It's a waste if I don't take it.

377
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,420
Are you laughing at me?

378
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,700
I dare not.

379
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,900
You are laughing.

380
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,700
I was just thinking

381
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,740
that even though you seem to be

382
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,540
happy-go-lucky all the time,

383
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,460
you have your own share of hardships too.

384
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,740
I heard that you grew up with your mother

385
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,780
in West Shu.

386
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,340
It was only when you turned twelve,

387
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,500
that you were brought back to the Bu family in the capital.

388
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,540
All these years, you were neglected by your father,

389
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,700
and mistreated by your legitimate mother.

390
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,820
Your time in the Bu family

391
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,140
must have been tough.

392
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,100
Don't pick them up anymore.

393
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:39,500
You're right.

394
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,020
I shouldn't.

395
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,420
What's not mine

396
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,700
will never be mine.

397
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,540
I've been thinking

398
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,580
that although you are baseborn,

399
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,770
you are still from an aristocratic family.

400
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,100
It's a wealthy and carefree life.

401
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,620
Why do you have to conceal yourself,

402
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,260
and what's keeping you on your toes?

403
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,020
Now I understand.

404
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,740
Because there no one to protect you.

405
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,170
And you have a

406
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,420
sickly and helpless mother

407
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,020
who needs your protection.

408
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,700
In order to protect yourself

409
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,700
and the people you care about,

410
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,220
you had no choice but to raise your defenses

411
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:17,980
and guard against

412
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,860
those wicked people around you.

413
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,220
You said I am like the daylily,

414
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,300
but aren't you the same?

415
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,100
Well.

416
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,580
What a coincidence.

417
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,420
Stop the carriage.

418
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,740
I'm so fed up with

419
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,940
having to patronize you,

420
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,020
and going around in circles.

421
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,460
Let's get straight to the point.

422
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,940
You brought me here,

423
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,100
and said all of these.

424
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,540
What do you want?

425
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,140
Don't say you're trying to make me happy.

426
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,860
I'll misunderstand.

427
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,460
Do you really care about me?

428
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,700
How do you know that I don't?

429
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,060
Who do you think we are?

430
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,580
If I said I believe you,

431
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,700
would you believe me?

432
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,060
What?

433
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,060
Someone once told me

434
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,580
that cherries are sweet.

435
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,300
When you eat them, the bitterness in our hearts goes away.

436
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,100
Do you still feel bitter?

437
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,060
A little sour.

438
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,140
Sour?

439
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,700
I never know what's on your mind,

440
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,020
and you always fool with me.

441
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,740
I'm afraid of you. Don't you know that?

442
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,900
Then, let me apologize to you.

443
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:29,540
I promise you

444
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,620
I won't scare you again.

445
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,020
Actually,

446
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,660
you didn't do anything to me.

447
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,140
It's just that you suddenly

448
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,020
began treating me well.

449
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,410
What do you want from me?

450
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,940
Do you...

451
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,420
really...

452
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,860
want to be sisters?

453
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,780
This cherry tastes sour at first,

454
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,580
but-

455
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,100
After a while,

456
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,820
it's quite sweet.

457
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:22,980
Is it sweet?

458
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:27,860
Yes.

459
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,420
What do you want?

460
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,020
Chief Xiao,

461
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,780
in life,

462
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,060
we must make sacrifices.

463
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,380
Now, it seems

464
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,100
we can't return to the Mausoleum.

465
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,020
It's a beautiful night. How can we let it go to waste?

466
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,740
Why don't we

467
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,500
stay out?

468
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,740
Chief Xiao,

469
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:07,780
you understand what I'm saying,

470
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,340
right?

471
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:16,860
Let's go play.

472
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,500
Weren't you quite capable just now?

473
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,500
Why is it that you became weak

474
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,380
when it came to rowing?

475
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,260
I really don't know how to do this.

476
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,290
You're so arrogant about not knowing.

477
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,060
But it doesn't matter.

478
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,020
Let me teach you.

479
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,820
Move forward.

480
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:51,620
Make a circle.

481
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,060
It's not hard.

482
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,180
443.

483
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,380
444.

484
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,850
445.

485
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,900
Stop counting.

486
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,220
If it wasn't for your godfather,

487
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,780
would I have caught a cold in the rain?

488
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,140
Would I be sneezing?

489
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,380
446.

490
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,980
Why isn't Godfather back yet?

491
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,660
Why isn't Mistress back yet?

492
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,300
Wait.

493
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,260
What's up with your godfather?

494
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,260
Where did he take my mistress?

495
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,820
Doesn't he need to go back to the capital

496
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,780
to take care of state affairs?

497
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:53,860
Miss Tongyun,

498
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,940
you shouldn't say that.

499
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,380
My godfather set aside

500
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,820
all his important affairs,

501
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,900
just to mess around with who, exactly?

502
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,580
Don't speak ill of my mistress!

503
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,100
Apart from my godfather,

504
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:08,940
no one

505
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,660
has dared to hit me on the head.

506
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,620
You're brave.

507
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,260
Let's have a duel.

508
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,500
Sure.

509
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,610
Let's go.

510
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,260
No.

511
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,460
Yes.

512
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:31,860
Hurry up.

513
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,260
Hurry up.

514
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:46,900
Okay.

515
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,300
Turn it over.

516
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,540
Well,

517
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,340
thank you for today.

I have a gift for you.

A madiao card?

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,140
It's brand new,

Can't you tell

that I'm trying to flatter you?

I can't.

I like it.

I want to see your card.

538
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,940

really fluctuates.

It's a little embarrassing

in a game.

554
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,220
It's a useless card.

555
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:20,980
It doesn't stand a chance,

But it's against the rules

560
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,540
to not play a card that's in your hands.

561
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,260
I made the card,

so I decide the rules.

563
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,820
If I say it's useless,

then it is useless.

If I say it's a good card,

It can take on any card it comes across.

572
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,980
That's why its so empty,

They said-

00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,660
They said my mother was a concubine,

and that I didn't have a home.

621

they had no idea what they were talking about.

00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,340
Beauty Li.

691
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:49,820
Eunuch Liu.

692
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,780
Consort Dowager Duan has been infected.

693
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,220
She's asleep now.

694
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:56,860
You mustn't

695
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,700
disturb her.

696
00:37:59,060 --> 00:37:59,620
Eunuch Liu,

697
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:00,940
I beg you.

698
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,340
Please let me go.

699
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,300
I beg you.

700
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,060
Please spare me.

701
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:06,740
Take her away.

702
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:08,860
No!

703
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,820
No, Bu Yinlou.

704
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:11,980
Bu Yinlou!

705
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,700
Help me, Bu Yinlou!

706
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,180
Bu Yinlou!

707
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,370
Bitch!

708
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,730
If someone hadn't seen you

709
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,500
entering my room that day,

710
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,900
I still wouldn't know

711
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,420
who had hit me.

712
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,780
I treated you wholeheartedly,

713
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,220
but you conspired with Bu Yinlou

714
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,230
to make me suffer.

715
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,140
Do you want to die?

716
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,660
Do you really think

717
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,100
I'm afraid of her?

718
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,300
It's a long way from the Imperial City here.

719
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,780
Even if she has a backer,

720
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,460
who would come all the way to the Imperial Mausoleum

721
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,860
to stand up for her?

722
00:38:59,060 --> 00:38:59,740
Here,

723
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,140
I have the final say.

724
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,660
Didn't you scream?

725
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,700
Didn't you shout?

726
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,940
Your throat must hurt now.

727
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,980
Who came to save you?

728
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,900
Is she here?

729
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,900
Bitch!

730
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:18,860
Here.

731
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,940
Swallow

732
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,540
all these.

733
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,220
No.

734
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,660
Swallow it.

735
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,060
Sir,

736
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,300
Sir I know I was in the wrong.

737
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,460
Please, Sir.

738
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,580
I know I was in the wrong.

739
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,300
Please.

740
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,100
Please spare me.

741
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,900
Please.

742
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,740
Don't hurt your face.

743
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,980
Look at you now.

744
00:39:53,650 --> 00:40:01,910
You look like a flower that has fallen into mud.

745
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,010
[Silence Room]

746
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:21,780
Mistress.

747
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,060
What took you so long?

748
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,540
Something happened to Beauty Li.

749
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,500
Sister Li.

750
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,340
Sister Li.

751
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,970
Eunuch Liu.

752
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,740
Sister Li.

753
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,620
Mind your own business.

754
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,860
Don't ruin my future.

755
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,300
I've figured it out.

756
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,620
This is a good thing.

757
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,140
Instead of being inferior

758
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,460
and be trampled on by others,

759
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,980
It's better to trust

760
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,860
someone I can trust.

761
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,340
Eunuch Liu is despicable and shameless.

762
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,940
He's not a worthy source of support.

763
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,740
Then who is worthy of me?

764
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,540
You?

765
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,220
Tell me.

766
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,740
I begged you

767
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,020
outside your door last night.

768
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,420
Why didn't you open the door?

769
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,180
I didn't know

770
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,820
you came to me last night.

771
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,300
Last night, I—

772
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,180
I wasn't at the mausoleum.

773
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,340
You weren't at the mausoleum?

774
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,460
Where did you go?

775
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,540
I...

776
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,500
Leave.

777
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,850
Don't worry.

778
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,140
I won't slit my wrists

779
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,100
or bash my head into the wall.

780
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,580
I won't die.

781
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,740
Sister Li.
