00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

6
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,090
You look

7
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,020
much better these days.

8
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,340
It's been a long time

9
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,900
since I've been able to sleep so well.

10
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,329
Buddhist grounds

11
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,980
can indeed calm the senses.

12
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,500
Tanxi Temple has the protection of the Buddha,

13
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,020
and its sandalwood incense is very famous.

14
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,700
I heard that for the past few nights,

15
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,660
only half a stick was lit

16
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,220

17
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,340

Which monk has been serving the incense?

20
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,300
I want to see them

21
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,820
and reward them in person.

22
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,620

Rong'an, are you the one

27
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,460
who has been serving incense?

28
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,860
Your Majesty,

29
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,500
I was indeed the one serving incense

30
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,540
these past few days.

31
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,820
I learned that His Majesty was disturbed by nightmares,

32
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,700
so I was only doing my best

33
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,540
to pray for His Majesty and share his burden.

34
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,180
It seems that the monastic living here

35
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,620
has changed you a lot.

36
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,260
Your Majesty,

37
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,060
I used to be

38
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,460
easily swayed by external things,

39
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,700
and my heart was not at ease.

40
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,530
It was hard to act considerately back then.

41
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,020
Now my mind

42
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,660
is much clearer.

43
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,180
I just want to live at this quiet place

44
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,460
till the end of my days.

45
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,860
What are you talking about?

46
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,020
You didn't commit

47
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,460
any serious crime.

48
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,340
It was merely one of negligence.

49
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,980
It was Lady Zhang who gave birth to that unlucky child.

50
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,529
You've repented for your mistake.

51
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,660
How could you

52
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,860
continue staying here?

53
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,660
Come back to the palace with me.

54
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,340
It's inappropriate

55
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,700
for you to stay at Fengyi Palace now.

56
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,610
Why don't you move to Changqing Palace?

Eunuch Cao.

70

71

No woman

73

would like eunuchs.

74

Some maids in the palace

75
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,260
get married with eunuchs

76
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,460
and live their life together too.

What do I think?

80
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,020
It's hopeless.

81
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,580
A maid would only marry

82
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,300
an eunuch

83
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,500
when they are desperate.

84
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,660
They are lonely in the palace,

85
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,620
and there's nothing to look forward to.

86
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,700
It's just finding someone to back them up

87
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,140
to avoid being bullied.

88
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,060
Anyone who has a way out,

89
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,090
why would they do that?

90
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,540
And I heard that

91
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,180
some of those powerful eunuchs

92
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,700
are more powerful

93
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,780
than other men outside.

94
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,060
Many eunuchs in the palace

95
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,980
keep marrying people.

96
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,220
For example, Eunuch Liu,

97
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,060
does he regard women as human?

98
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,380
Anyway, it's not good for eunuchs

99
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,140
to marry.

100
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,060
I'm not talking about you.

101
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,260
Since you're not marrying,

102
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,740
you're a good eunuch.

103
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,580
Well...

104
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,980

105

What's the use?

107
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,420
You can't have children

108
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,340
and enjoy the happiness of a family

109
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,700
if you marry an eunuch.

110
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,570
You can't even have the normal joy

111

112

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,260
Why are you the one screaming?

179
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,580
You didn't even scream though it hurt,

180
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,060
so I screamed for you.

181
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,820
W-what should we do next?

182
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,860
I know, I know.

183
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,780
Hold it first.

184
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,260
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

185
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,100
Press it.

186
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,580
Don't worry.

187
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,580
It's okay.

188
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,780
It will be fine.

189
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,940
Don't worry. Wait.

190
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,980
I'll bandage it for you.

191
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,540
Bandage. Bandage.

192
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,780
Does it still hurt?

193
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,100
No.

194
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,660
That's good.

195
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,980
That's good.

196
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,580
Press it.

197
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:40,940
Blood.

198
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,820
Stop the bleeding. It will be fine as long as it stops.

199
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,700
Drink some water.

200
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,339
Be careful.

201
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,089
Here.

202
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,099
What is this?

203
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,339
Judging from the quality of this bottle,

204
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,290
it's delicate and glossy,

205
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,020
it's definitely no normal item.

206
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,700
What's inside?

207
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,180
I...I...

208
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,740
Medicine.

209
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:34,780
Medicine?

210
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,090
Yes.

211
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,740
How can the Chief of Zhaoding Bureau not carry

212
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,300
some medication that would

213
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,820
be able to bring a dead back to live.

214
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,620
Have two.

215
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:47,780
Here.

216
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:50,940
Have some water.

217
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,660
How is it?

218
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,860
Have some more.

219
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,580
Here.

220
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,420
Have some water.

221
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,380
How is it?

222
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,020
Those bandits didn't come after us.

223
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,020
Are we safe now?

224
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,860
Those bandits are not ordinary bandits.

225
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,140
I observed their skills,

226
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,380
they're not ordinary.

227
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,930
And this attack

228
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,220
was planned.

229
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,180
More suspiciously,

230
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,660
they don't want money,

231
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,380
and only want to kill me.

232
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,620
Looks like they're not water bandits,

233
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,260
but assasins.

234
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,740
Are they sent by the Prince of Nanyuan?

235
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,860
Most likely.

236
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,180
You came to West Shu under the imperial order.

237
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,060
He dares to go against the court openly?

238
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,220
It's exactly because I'm here on His Majesty's order,

239
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,940
he was afraid that I had an ulterior motive.

240
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,140
Because of His Majesty's order,

241
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,980
they don't dare to do anything to me openly.

242
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,020
But it doesn't stop them from trying to

243
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,100
kill me secretly.

244
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,460
But they underestimated me.

245
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,140
They sent

246
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,420
a bunch of losers.

247
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,260
If I were him,

248
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,220
Xiao Duo

249
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,540
would've been dead.

250
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,260
Enough.

251
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,340
Look at your state,

252
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,660
what's the point of comparing yourself

253
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,580
to them for things like this?

254
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Doesn't the Zhaoding Bureau

255
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,820
know everything about the world?

256
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,780
The Prince of Nanyuan tried to assassinate you.

257
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,940
You don't have a spy

258
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,300
that would inform you in advance?

259
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,740
Where did you hear that from?

260
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,700
The Zhaoding Bureau is not godly.

261
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,460
How could we know everything?

262
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,300
The Prince of Nanyuan has some tricks up his sleeves.

263
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,620
All these years,

264
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,700
none of the Secret Services

265
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,700
sent by the Zhaoding Bureau have survived.

266
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,700
I don't know

267
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,140
what he's doing at all.

268
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,380
Fine then.

269
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,540
You still seem pretty proud.

270
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,220
What should we do in such

271
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:48,860
an adverse situation?

272
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,980
Let's not go.

273
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,420
Don't worry.

274
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,100
As long as we

275
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,260
step into the territory of West Shu,

276
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,820
he won't be able to touch me easily.

277
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,900
If anything happens to me,

278
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,620
he won't be able to get away with it.

279
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,660
Let's go to West Shu now.

280
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,220
Let's go.

281
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,140
What's wrong? Let's go.

282
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,460
What's wrong?

283
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,620
Are you okay?

284
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,780
I'm badly injured.

285
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,860
I can't move.

286
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,420
Didn't you just eat

287
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,180
some extremely precious

288
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,180
and super nutritious pill?

289
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,500
So it's not the pill that could bring a dead back alive

290
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,780
like written in the books.

291
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,180
Not one that makes you invincible...

292
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,900
I'm human too.

293
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,620
If I'm injured, I have to rest too.

294
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,980
I think this place is quiet,

295
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,860
it should be a temporary fishermen residence.

296
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,140
It's not fishing season,

297
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,220
we should be fine

298
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,180
if we just hide away here.

299
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,540
Let's wait for Cao Chun'ang

300
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,900
and Qilang to find us.

301
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,500
Alright.

302
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,500
I'll listen to you.

303
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,810
It's just that

304
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,740
I feel sorry towards you.

305
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,220
Life is more important now that we are outside.

306
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,420
Nothing to feel sorry about.

307
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,860
Whatever it is, just tell me.

308
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,740
Are you cold?

309
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,140
Are you feeling better?

310
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,820
A little more.

311
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,940
It's warmer now.

312
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,060
When I was young,

313
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,460
my legitimate mother deducted my mother's money,

314
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,700
and we were always short of charcoal

315
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,060
and bedding at home.

316
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,540
It was so cold that I couldn't sleep.

317
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,730
My mother said

318
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,500
when I grow up,

319
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,460
there will be warm quilt

320
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,940
warm soup,

321
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,500
and snacks every night.

322
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,180
But now I think,

323
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,700
these don't even matter that much.

324
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,940
It's already

325
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,060
warm enough having you.

326
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,660
With Her Highness around,

327
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,020
I feel much warmer too.

328
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,620
Why are you calling me Her Highness again?

329
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,420
We are not in Imperial City now,

330
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,900
don't call me Her Highness.

331
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,660
I don't like it.

332
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,210
Change it back.

333
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,780
You can call me by my nickname.

334
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,580
My nickname is

335
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,900
is Zhuo Ying.

336
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,540
Zhuo Ying.

337
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,900
The water of Canglang River runs clear,

338
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,220
so clean I can wash my crown tassel.

339
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,140
What's your nickname?

340
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,940
Zhuo Ying.

341
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,740
Have you read

342
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,220
Zhuo Ying Collection?

343
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,060
Honor becomes prominent in the future,

344
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,060
and resentment is entangled in the past.

345
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,780
My name is Fang Jiang.

346
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,060
Fang Jiang.

347
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,420
Into the future.

348
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,060
Zhuo Ying.

349
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,940
Zhuo Ying.

350
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,100
What a coincidence,

351
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,780
it has the same pronunciation as my nickname.

352
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,260
Why are you laughing?

353
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,700
You're pulling my leg.

354
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,460
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

355
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,420
My hometown suffered locusts when I was young.

356
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,700
My family passed away one after another.

357
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,220
Only my brother and I were left.

358
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,540
So, no elders named me.

359
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,020
I'm sorry.

360
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,460
Zhuo Ying.

361
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,020
Is he trying to find a connection

362
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,100
between the two of us

363
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,220
through details like this?

364
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,940
I like Fang Jiang

365
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
as a nickname.

366
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,420
It sounds like

367
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,260
there's endless hope,

368
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,820
and an infinite future.

369
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,260
Just take this

370
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,140
as your nickname in the future.

371
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,860
People need nicknames.

372
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,020
For the person closest to you to call you by.

373
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,260
Zhuo Ying.

374
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,220
Fang Jiang.

407
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,100
A dream?

408
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,500
Bu Yinlou, how dare you.

409
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,940
How dare you have such a dream?

410
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,300
How dare you! Ridiculous!

411
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,580
You’re a Consort Dowager,

412
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,860
yet you're dreaming about Chief Xiao.

413
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,010
What am I even doing.

414
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
I'm blinded by beauty.

415
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,020
It's early in the morning.

416
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,300
Where is he?

417
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,140
Don't move.

418
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,060
You look pale.

419
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,180
You slept outside all night?

420
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,900
Why didn't you go in?

421
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,780
It's cooler outside.

422
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,260
Last night, did I...

423
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,020
No.

424
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:20,940
Snore when I sleep?

425
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,660
Tong Yun said

426
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,260
I don't sleep well,

427
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,180
and grind my teeth when I sleep.

428
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,420
I didn't believe her.

429
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,460
I'm sorry.

430
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,500
I'll go fishing

431
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,330
and make you fish soup

432
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,780
for your health.

433
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,780
What's wrong?

434
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,340
It occurred to me that

435
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,900
I don't know how to fish.

436
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,660
Well,

437
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,020
I have a question.

438
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,140
I don't know if I should ask.

439
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,940
It's been two hours.

440
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,820
Do you even know how to fish?

441
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,140
No.

442
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,180
Then why are you acting like you do.

443
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,060
I'm not.

444
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,500
I just look like I do.

445
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,700
Are you trying to

446
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,060
be smart with me?

447
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:30,940
How about

448
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,180
you put your face closer to the waters,

449
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,500
and see if you can

450
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,420
attract any

451
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,540
female fish that would

452
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,460
volunteer to take the bait.

453
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,540
That's a good idea.

454
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,260
This fish...

455
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,260
Is this fish really female?

456
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,500
Probably.

457
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,580
The devil who kills without blinking.

458
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
I didn't expect him to be so good

459
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,140
at killing fish too.

460
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,660
I'll teach you a lesson.

461
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,100
Nice.

462
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,580
That's it?

463
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,620
That's it.

464
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,100
Here.

465
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,020
As expected,

466
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,179
the soup I made painstakingly

467
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,219
is filled with sweetness.

468
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:42,980
The soup you made?

469
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,300
All you did was...

470
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,500
Thank you for cooking for me.

471
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:54,860
Thank you.

472
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,060
It's my duty.

473
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,860
Give me the spoon.

474
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,260
Save some fish for me.

475
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,220
Eat more.

476
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:44,860
Godfather.

477
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,060
Chief Xiao.

478
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:50,860
Godfather.

479
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,700
Mistress.

480
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,860
They don't seem

481
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,860
happy seeing us.

482
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,420
How about

483
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,020
we go back?

484
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,220
Chief Xiao, as for the Prince of Nanyuan...

485
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,340
Let's talk outside.

486
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,380
Let's not disturb Her Highness.

487
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,820
Mistress,

488
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,500
you've suffered.

489
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,260
I didn't suffer much.

490
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,410
How could you have not suffered?

491
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,980
Look at your face.

492
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,220
You do...look good.

493
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,380
You must be hungry.

494
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:43,810
No problem,

495
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,290
I got you some food–

496
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,260
Sorry.

497
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,140
I ate too much yesterday.

498
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,540
You are in the middle of nowhere,

499
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,100
what did you eat?

500
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,740
With Chief Xiao,

501
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,140
I really didn’t suffer much.

502
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,180
Don't worry.

503
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,660
I'm glad we found you.

504
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,460
How can you stay here?

505
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,620
Mistress, let's go now.

506
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,300
We're leaving already?

507
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,980
The men who were sent to West Shu

508
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,220
took the fake jade you gave

509
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,140
to set on their search,

510
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,300
and indeed had some discoveries.

511
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,860
Prince of Nanyuan

512
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,100
and a local pirate

513
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,180
have private connections.

514
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,420
The attacker that night

515
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,700
was not an ordinary water bandit.

516
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,500
They're most likely Prince of Nanyuan's assassins.

517
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,580
If I step into West Shu,

518
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,740
under his nose,

519
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,740
I'm afraid I won't be able to do much.

520
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,860
Why don't you just

521
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,060
assassinate the Prince of Nanyuan?

522
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,780
It was a narrow escape this time.

523
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,180
On top of that, it's a capital crime

524
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,500
to kill a royal, and you will be executed.

525
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,060
In the past,

526
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,260
we could clean up our traces

527
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,380
and wouldn't be afraid of anything.

528
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,460
But His Majesty has a grudge against you.

529
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,340
He might suspect you.

530
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,420
Even if you succeed,

531
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,410
you wouldn't be let off the hook so easily.

532
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,460
When I chose this path,

533
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,620
I never thought that I could live a long life.

534
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,060
Don't worry.

535
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,020
I will make arrangements.

536
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,580
This is my own doing,

537
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,220
and has nothing to do with any of you.

538
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,860
Even if His Majesty dislikes me,

539
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,660
he still needs Zhaoding Bureau

540
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,460
to work for him.

541
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,900
He won't make things difficult for you.

542
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,180
No.

543
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,140
Godfather,

544
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,180
I have something to say.

545
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,660
What about Her Majesty?

546
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:17,540
You tried everything

547
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,820
to bring her to Western Shu.

548
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,540
But you disappear halfway.

549
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,380
What about Her Highness?

550
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,060
What?

551
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,860
Why are you talking about Her Highness?

552
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,920
[Jinguan City, Prince of Nanyuan's Residence]

553
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:34,580
Your Highness.

554
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,540
The Zhaoding Bureau want to see you.

555
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,060
They said they were ambushed by the water bandits,

[Prince of Nanyuan, Yuwen Liangshi]

559
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,060
The Zhaoding Bureau has searched for days

560
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,940
but to no avail.

561
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:43,780
They came to

562
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,140
ask for backup.

563
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,380
Since the Zhaoding Bureau

564
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,620
has come to my doorstep for help,

565
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,940
how could I

566
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,180
ignore them?

567
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,700
Lend them our men,

568

but pass a secret order.

569
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,460
If they see Xiao Duo,

571
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,580
Yes.

572
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,980
You've been working hard lately.

573
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,460
I made some snow fungus soup

574
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,740
to relieve your fatigue.

575
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,620
All you think about is leaving the palace.

576
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,700
You're so obedient today. Something is wrong.

577
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,650
Tell me, what do you want from me?

578
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,180
A few days ago,

579
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,410
I read some novels,

580
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,620
and found them interesting.

581
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,680
I want to share them with you.

582
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,940
What the hell have you been reading now?

583
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,620
It says that there was an Emperor

584
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,980
who imitated Yao and Shun, and made great political achievements.

585
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,180
But when it came to dealing with

586
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,500
the family members of political enemies,

587
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,660
he was fond of collective punishmnet.

588
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,540
Someone in the story asked him,

589
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,140
“His family members are innocent,

590
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,500
why do you have to kill them all?"

591
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:43,980
Brother,

592
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,460
if it were you,

593
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,060
what would you say?

594
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,700
This Young Prince Yuwen

595
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,700

but in the palace,

599
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,850
there's still someone speaking on his behalf.

00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,380
Brother,

601
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,780
he's innocent.

602

You've locked him up for so long.

603
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,900
He can't leave the capital anyway.

604
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,410
You don't have to do this.

605

609
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,340

Why do you think

611
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,180
he's trying to get close to you?

612

I had nothing to read,

you can lay down the sword,
