Why are you sitting on the floor?

00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,580
Mistress.

8
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,820
Eunuch Liu took

00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,060
all our valuables.

10
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,340
Bastard!

11
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,860
What's wrong?

12
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,940
Why is it so hot?

13
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,180
Let's get you some rest.

14
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,620
Let's go.

15
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,940

16
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,780

17

Well,

23
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,650
what brings you here,

24
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,740
Consort Dowager Duan?

25
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,020
I...

26
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,980
I caught a cold after kicking off my blanket last night.

27
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,260
I wanted to get some cold medicine.

28
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,180
The eunuch in charge of the pharmacy

29
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,860
said that

30
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,540
I had to ask your permission first.

31
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,540
A while ago,

32
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,660
I injured myself.

33
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,420
The eunuch in charge of purchasing supplies

34
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,420
slacked off.

35
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,740
We are short of

36
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,820
all medicines for colds and heatiness.

37
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,980
Tell you what.

38
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,579
When we purchase some,

39
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,900
I will

40
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,210
inform you again.

41
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,500
That bastard!

42
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,540
How could he neglect his duty

43
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,940
while you were ill?

44
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:29,780
It will ruin

45
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,060
your reputation.

46
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,300
Eunuch Liu,

47
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,579
you sacrificed yourself

48
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,579
to protect the mausoleum.

49
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,100
I admire you.

50
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,620
This is a little something from me.

51
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,940
Please accept it.

52
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,980
I'm afraid this is against the rules.

53
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,260
I can't help you with this.

54
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,050
Don't stand on ceremony.

55
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,340
I said I can't help.

56
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,660
Don't stand on ceremony.

57
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,820
This engraving is...

58
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,820
Why is it stained with lipstick?

59
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,460
L- Let me swap it out for you.

60
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,180
No, no, no.

61
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,900
This ring belongs to Chief Xiao

62
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,460
of the Zhaoding Bureau.

63
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,860
Consort Dowager Duan and Chief Xiao...

64
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,140
So the person who helped you

65
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,980
was Chief Xiao.

66
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,180
You should have said so earlier!

67
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,180
Look at h- how

68
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,860
things have t- turned...

69
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,060
Eunuch Liu.

70
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,820
D- Don’t talk nonsense.

71
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,460
Chief Xiao doesn’t want others to know

72
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,980
about these kinds of things.

73
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,300
I understand.

74
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,340
It's too precious a gift,

75
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,220
I-

76
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,940
I can't accept it.

77
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,140
You said

78
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,700
you wanted some cold medicine.

79
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,220
I remember there's still some left

80
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,580
in the warehouse.

81
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,020
I'll go find it for you now.

82
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,900
I'll send it to you after I find it.

83
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,100
I'll send it over.

84
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,420
I'm sorry

85
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,570
I besmirched your good name.

86
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,900
Come on. Hurry up.

87
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,020
Put them back

88
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,340
wherever you took them from.

89
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,700
Be careful.

90
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,260
If anything goes wrong,

91
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,540
I'll skin you alive.

92
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,020
Your Highness,

93
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,460
please don't take it to heart.

94
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,580
In the future, if you need anything,

95
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,620
please come to me.

96
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,620
Come to me.

97
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,740
I can settle it for you.

98
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,820
Fragrant.

99
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,300
I'll take my leave first.

100
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,860
Let me know if there's anything you need.

101
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,860
Miss Tongyun.

102
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:37,620
Tongyun.

103
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,980
Here, take the medicine.

104
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,300
Mistress, you're amazing.

105
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,100
I'm relieved.

106
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,140
I'm almost recovered already.

107
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,780
Eunuch Liu

108
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,980
has gone too far.

109
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,940
This time,

110
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,500
I have to fleece him.

111
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,180
Hurry, drink the medicine.

112
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,220
Consort Dowager Duan’s accounts

113
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,060
are in a heavy deficit.

114
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,530
Why hasn’t Chief Xiao come to settle them for her?

115
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,580
Did she trick me?

116
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,820
But there was indeed a stain on the jade token.

117
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,900
I saw it very clearly.

118
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,780
If they weren't in a relationship,

119
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,500
how could Consort Dowager Duan’s lipstick

120
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,620
get on

121
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,900
Chief Xiao's personal ring?

122
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:34,620
Hot!

123
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,100
Are you trying to scald me?

124
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,260
Please forgive me.

125
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,659
I'll get you some cold water.

126
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,300
Enough.

127
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,900
Aren’t you close

128
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,050
with Consort Duan?

129
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,860
Go and sound her out.

130
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,940
See if there is really

131
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,540
something going on

132
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,260
between her and Chief Xiao.

133
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,940
Don't worry.

134
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,380
You will be rewarded.

135
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,660
Yes.

136
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,860
Sir, you called for me.

137
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,780
Are the dishes not to your liking?

138
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,740
There are no authentic Shu dishes here,

139
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,940
nothing suits my taste.

140
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,220
You must be joking.

141
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,100
We don't serve Shu cuisine here.

142
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,299
I wonder

143
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,340
what I can really do for you?

144
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,380
As I've said,

145
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,820
I want authentic Shu cuisine.

146
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,780
Wait a moment, Sir.

147
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,140
I’ll go prepare it.

148
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,100
Chief Xiao,

149
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,140
this jade really is useful.

150
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,380
We have followed your instructions,

151
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,780
and scoped out

152
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,060
all the suspicious locations.

153
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,540
We have a good idea of

154
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,380
all the contact points

155
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,860
the Prince of Nanyuan has set up in the capital.

156
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,180
Should we get rid of them?

157
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,500
There's no hurry.

158
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,060
Station some of our men

159
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,940
at all the contact points

160
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,580
we found today.

161
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,620
Wait for my instructions.

162
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,620
Got it.

163
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,620
Why the long face?

164
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,940
Take a good look.

165
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,450
These are all

166
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,500
account books

167
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,460
sent by Eunuch Liu from the Imperial Mausoleum.

168
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,100
Do you know how they got here?

169
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,460
Consort Dowager Duan.

170
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,740
She wants to be served with

171
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,660
good food and good drinks,

172
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,700
and she wants exotic treasures to play with.

173
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,460
See, she's too extravagant.

174
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,580
Eunuch Liu owes the Treasury

175
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,540
a lot of money.

176
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,100
He's asking you for it.

177
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,780
Didn't you say

178
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,660
you didn't reveal our identities?

179
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,500
How does he know

180
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,540
Consort Dowager Duan knows me?

181
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,180
I didn't reveal anything.

182
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,610
It's the Consort Dowager

183
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,180
who didn't stand on ceremony with you.

184
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,020
Eunuch Liu sounded

185
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,820
extremely lecherous in his letter.

186
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,260
He said shes's your-

187
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,380
Your-

188
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,500
My what?

189
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,580
He said she’s your lover.

190
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,740
Did Consort Dowager Duan really say that?

191
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,820
Who else could be so

192
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,740
shameless?

193
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,380
You can't let her off

194
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,420
this time.

195
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:31,740
I won't.

196
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,780
Don't help her again.

197
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,100
I won't.

198
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,460
Where are you going?

199
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,060
The mausoleum.

200
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,100
The mausoleum.

201
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,420
Wait.

202
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,300
Why are you still going to the mausoleum?

203
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,300
If she's throwing around

204
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,980
my name,

205
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,500
it means she's in trouble.

206
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,740
What troubles can she have?

207
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,380
I think she is the biggest trouble.

208
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,340
She's doing well.

209
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,980
Only I

210
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,020
am living a miserable life.

211
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,420
Mistress.

212
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,220
It's not sustainable

213
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,380
to keep lying to Eunuch Liu.

214
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,260
What should we do

215
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,180
if someone finds out?

216
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,860
Am I the one who said

217
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,140
there's something going on between us?

218
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,900
That's it then.

219
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,700
He's a pervert. He thinks everyone is like him.

220
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,780
He deserves to be tricked.

221
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,300
I'm not cheap enough

222
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,300
to sell myself to a eunuch.

223
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,540
[Hall of Peace]

224
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,620
It's almost noon.

225
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,220
Why isn't anyone here?

226
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,620
Let's not wait anymore.

227
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,740
Tongyun.

228
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,020
What dishes should we request

229
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,370
for lunch today?

230
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,660
I want crystal ham hocks.

231
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,340
Crystal ham hocks?

232
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,620
Guards!

233
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,420
Carve their hocks

234
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,700
from their bodies.

235
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,860
What?

236
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,980
This must be painted on.

237
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,740
How dare you lie to me?

238
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,780
You don't want to live anymore?

239
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,900
I’m not lying.

240
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,460
Chief Xiao stamped it personally.

241
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,580
It’s real.

242
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,500
If there is really something going on

243
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,620
between you and Chief Xiao,

244
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,500
I'm willing to

245
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,300
remove my head

246
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,980
for you to use as a football.

247
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,060
Mistress.

248
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,740
Eunuch Liu.

249
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,500
Let's talk calmly.

250
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,580
It's not nice

251
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,020
to get so agitated.

252
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,820
It's not nice?

253
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,900
Do you really take yourself as a mistress?

254
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,420
Let me tell you.

255
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,380
In the Imperial Mausoleum,

256
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,100
I

257
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,580
am the real master.

258
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,860
I'm not a mistress,

259
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,540
but I don't have a master either.

260
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,580
Hold them down!

261
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,500
Get off!

262
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,260
Beat her up!

263
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:24,820
Get off!

264
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,940
Mistress!

265
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,100
How dare you hit me?

266
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,140
Mistress!

267
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,100
Get off!

268
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,100
Stop it!

269
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,140
- Stop! -Get lost!

270
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,900
Get off! Get off!

271
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,740
Stop it!

272
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,700
You knaves!

273
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,500
How dare you bully Yinlou?

274
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,660
Flog him!

275
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,460
Flog him!

276
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,940
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

277
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,300
Your Majesty.

278
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,610
You shouldn't dirty your hands

279
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,260
with these kinds of scumbags.

280
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,940
Leave them to me.

281
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,300
Okay.

282
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,820
Cao Chun'ang, take them all away.

283
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,140
Take them away.

284
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,380
Chief Xiao.

285
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,220
Why brings you here?

286
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,450
Your Majesty,

287
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,460
I heard that the Chief of the Imperial Mausoleum

288
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,460
has been bullying the concubines.

289
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,420
I'm here to investigate.

290
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,780
This is...

291
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,460
This is all my fault.

292
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,330
I shouldn't have sent Yinlou

293
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,260
to the mausoleum.

294
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,580
Sun Taiqing.

295
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,180
Arrange for Consort Dowager Duan to return to the palace with me.

296
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,660
Yes.

297
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,820
Your Majesty.

298
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,620
You promised to let me go.

299
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,100
I...

300
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,100
I only promised...

301
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,060
I only promised to send you to the mausoleum.

302
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,740
I never said

303
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,780
I wouldn't take you back.

304
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,660
How can you—

305
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,660
Your Highness.

306
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,580
His Majesty's words are to be taken as royal decrees.

307
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,580
You only have to thank him.

308
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,300
Your Majesty.

309
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,940
Her Highness was frightened,

310
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,180
I think she hasn't fully recovered yet.

311
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,580
The view at the back mountain is good.

312
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,340
Why don't Your Majesty take a walk with Her Highness there?

313
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,100
Okay.

314
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,860
Okay, let's go.

315
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,580
Coming on a walk

316
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,180
makes me feel much better.

317
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,860
Right, Yinlou?

318
00:15:59,260 --> 00:15:59,860
Yes.

319
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,500
It's so nice.

320
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,060
It's—

321
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,860
Why are there graves everywhere?

322
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,820
Let's go somewhere else.

323
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,980
This cemetery is quite spacious.

324
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,380
Your Majesty, look.

325
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,620
It's a sunny day today.

326
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,780
It's a good day

327
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,780
for playing cards.

328
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,140
Tongyun, ask the rest to come.

329
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,620
We will set up a dozen tables.

330
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,820
Yes, Mistress.

331
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,100
What are your intentions

332
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,420
with these graves?

333
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,580
Chief Xiao,

334
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,900
you don’t understand.

335
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,700
Playing Mahjong near graves brings good luck.

336
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,300
As the saying goes, "Official titles and wealth come with coffins."

337
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,060
The opportunity must not be missed,

338
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,220
for it will never return.

339
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,540
Your Majesty.

340
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,900
You seldom come here.

341
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,500
Today,

342
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,260
we will make sure to play good hosts to you.

343
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:01,930
Nine circles.

344
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,220
How did you have another one?

345
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,339
Hit.

346
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,420
Twenty thousand.

347
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,020
Sixty thousand. Sixty thousand.

348
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:15,940
No, no, no.

349
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:16,900
South. South. South.

350
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,300
Kung. Kung. Kung.

351
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,740
You're too slow. Let me do it.

352
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,260
What are you doing?

353
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,900
Tongyun, this way.

354
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,339
Who's next?

355
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,339
Let me see.

356
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,380
Yes, yes. Pung.

357
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,970
Pung. Pung. Pung.

358
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,810
Sixty thousand.

359
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,900
Don't move.

360
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,700
Pung. Pung. Pung.

361
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,220
Fifty thousand. Pung.

362
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,700
No.

363
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,340
Self-draw!

364
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,780
Big! Big! Big!

365
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,420
Again. Again. Again.

366
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,700
I win.

367
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,580
Self-draw.

368
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,580
Come on. Shuffle the tiles.

369
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,020
Come on.

370
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,260
[Silence Room]

371
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,140
[Bu Yinlou]

372
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,060
Mistress, didn't you notice?

373
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,100
His Majesty

374
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,020
looked really upset.

375
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,260
Have you been possessed?

376
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,240
That sounds about right.

377
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,340
[Bu Yinlou]

378
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,340
It's my first time seeing someone

379
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,300
play cards so shamelessly.

380
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,220
What's the use of shame when it comes to playing cards?

381
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,700
I just want to have a good time.

382
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,060
Did I do my best?

383
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,540
Was I shameless enough?

384
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,220
How could this happen?

385
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,340
Tell me.

386
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,380
She's a refined lady

387
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,300
who was raised

388
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,020
with a good education.

389
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,860
How could she be

390
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,180
so coarse and vulgar,

391
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,580
as if she were a common woman?

392
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,140
Her Highness has a lively personality.

393
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,900
Maybe her life in the Imperial Mausoleum

394
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,010
has been too insipid.

395
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,660
She's been repressed for too long.

396
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,620
Your Majesty, don't be angry with her.

397
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,380
How could I be mad at her?

398
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,580
It's just...

399
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,380
It's too sudden.

400
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,140
Your Majesty,

401
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,620
there's something I must say.

402
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,970
Given Her Highness' deportment,

403
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,220
how could she gain the approval of the court officials in the future?

404
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,340
How could she establish herself in the Inner Court,

405
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,140
and serve by your side?

406
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,050
Your Majesty, don't worry.

407
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,500
I have an idea.

408
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,460
The sacrifice to the late Emperor will be held soon.

409
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Your Majesty only needs to issue an edict

410
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,220
commanding me to handle it.

411
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,340
I can take the chance

412
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,770
to bring Her Highness out of the Imperial Mausoleum.

413
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,060
and relocate her at a residence outside.

414
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,100
I will bring in some senior maids to teach her the rules.

415
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,140
It won't be difficult to learn

416
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,940
those rules on propriety and comportment.

417
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,660
Your Majesty.

418
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,580
This is a good idea.

419
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,180
This way...

420
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,300
This way...

421
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,260
Yinlou won't be able to

422
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,900
return to the palace anytime soon.

423
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,180
Your Majesty.

424
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,180
These days, the people of the court are on edge.

425
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,060
They are all waiting for an excuse to cause trouble.

426
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,460
If Her Highness returns rashly to the palace,

427
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,500
she'll be an easy target.

428
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,780
Only when we are well prepared,

429
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,700
can we truly

430
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,620
ensure her safety.

431
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:24,980
Okay.

432
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,340
Fine. I'll allow it.

433
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,460
But don't look for another residence.

434
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,660
Just send her to yours

435
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,900
to avoid any unforseen circumstances.

436
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,380
Her Highness's status in the future

437
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,580
will be extremely esteemed.

438
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,260
To send her to my residence,

439
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,380
might it not be too-

440
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,980
I only trust you

441
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,540
to handle Yinlou's affairs.

442
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,260
Don't refuse.

443
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

444
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,050
Your Majesty, slow down.

445
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,620
What did His Majesty say?

446
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,940
Will it work or not?

447
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,820
Tongyun, it’s cool outside.

448
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,780
Let’s go wait outside.

449
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:14,420
Let's go.

450
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:14,940
I don't feel hot.

451
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,660
-Let's go. -I don't feel hot.

452
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,980
I think you feel hot.

453
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,780
I don't.

454
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,500
Let me show you something interesting.

455
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,860
Oh no.

456
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,220
It's still a useless card.

457
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,020
Give me some time.

458
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,260
Give me some time.

459
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,020
The good days are over?

460
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,700
When

461
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,890
can I go back

462
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,380
to being a good-for-nothing?

463
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,020
As long as it's in my hands,

464
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,810
no card is useless.

465
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,380
What do you mean?

466
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,820
Please make yourself clear.

467
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,700
His Majesty

468
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,020
will not force you to return to the palace.

469
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,940
You're scaring me again.

470
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,940
You promised not to scare me.

471
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,060
I'll cry when I'm scared.

472
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,860
Yes, you will.

473
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,540
There's too much you will do.

474
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,980
You'll use my name

475
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,540
to make a show of your strength.

476
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,460
You know everything?

477
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,100
Isn't it just a matter of owing a heavy debt

478
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,940
to the Imperial Mausoleum?

479
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,820
And having a lover?

480
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,140
I was wrong.

481
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,740
You admit your wrongdoing too lightly.

482
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,780
But you have defiled

483
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,900
my chaste reputation.

484
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,060
How will you make it up to me?

485
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,020
Aside from me,

486
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,980
everything in this room belongs to you.

487
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,620
Take what you want.

488
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,260
In this whole room,

489
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,980
you are the most valuable thing.

490
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,380
Why don't you go home with me?

491
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,540
You mean...

492
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,900
I'm not going back to the palace?

493
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,460
I'm going to your house?

494
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,340
I pulled out all the stops

495
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,460
trying to convince His Majesty.

496
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,940
He's already back in the palace.

497
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,580
If you're unwilling,

498
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,940
I'll ask him to come back.

499
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,220
Don’t. I’m willing.

500
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,380
You’re kind, righteous,

501
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,260
and beautiful.

502
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,380
I'll pack my bags now.

503
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,330
I won’t delay a moment of your time.

504
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,780
Chief Xiao,

505
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,890
do you think it will be inconvenient

506
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,940
for me to go to your house?

507
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,020
You are not well-liked.

508
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,180
What if

509
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,620
someone makes a fuss about me leaving the mausoleum

510
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,540
to make trouble for you?

511
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,260
What should we do then?

512
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,500
Are you worried about me?

513
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,700
That's right.

514
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,300
The mausoleum sacrifice will be held soon.

515
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,020
The last step of the mausoleum sacrifice

516
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,540
is the parading of the royal robes.

517
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,100
As the Consort Dowager, you have an exalted status.

518
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,300
You must carry

519
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,340
the late Emperor's robes

520
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,420
out of the mausoleum, and into the Ancestral Temple.

521
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,620
As long as we leave the mausoleum,

522
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,610
everything will be fine.

523
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,260
As for who it is that comes back,

524
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,940
that is up to me.

525
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,140
I understand that.

526
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,340
But can I

527
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,660
not carry the late Emperor's robes?

528
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,090
You don't have to.

529
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,500
I'll bring you out directly then.

530
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,940
Weren't you worried that

531
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:51,930
I'm not well-liked?

532
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,300
If word gets out,

533
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,260
I'll just be remonstrated against.

534
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,780
I'll carry them.

535
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,980
They're just robes.

536
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,500
I'll make sure

537
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,660
to carry them well.

538
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,370
[Garden, Xiao's Residence]

539
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:40,780
Your Highness,

540
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,420
you've been watching the flowers

541
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,500
for four hours now.

542
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,260
Are they that beautiful?

543
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,820
"The meaning of 'shaoyao' is to be delicately elegant,

544
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,660
with a beautiful appearance.

545
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,500
This flower is delicate and beautiful,

546
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,980
thus, it is named 'shaoyao'."

547
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:00,900
What?

548
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,540
What appearance?

549
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,700
Because it is fragile and without structure,

550
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,660
it is also known as the "boneless flower."

551
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,860
I see.

552
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,140
You have a crush

553
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,660
on a pretty girl.

554
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,300
And whenever this pretty girl

555
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,700
sees Your Highness,

556
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,300
she becomes weak,

557
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,540
just like this boneless flower.

558
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,500
Right?

559
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,020
It is me who loses my bones

560
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,980
whenever I see her.

561
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:34,980
Chief,

562
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,500
someone with Chief Xiao's token

563
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,980
is here to see His Highness.

564
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,620
Chief Xiao's token?

565
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,620
Greetings, Princess Hede.

566
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,340
I shall take my leave.

567
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,900
Last time,

568
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,490
I was lucky to have won this piece of jade from you.

569
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,460
When I looked at it afterwards,

570
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,380
I realized it was of extraordinary quality.

571
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,020
It seems like a family heirloom.

572
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,660
It's inappropriate for me to take it away.

573
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,270
[Yuwen]

574
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,900
Have it back.

575
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,890
A- Are you here just to return the jade?

576
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,900
Yes.

577
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,180
This is too precious.

578
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,190
[Yuwen]

579
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,260
Next time, you mustn't

580
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,340
give it away so carelessly.

581
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,300
By the way, the flowers are nice.

582
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,060
They match your clothes.

583
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:05,490
[Bu's Residence]

584
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,180
I didn't expect Bu Yinlou

585
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,320
[Legitimate daughter of the Bu family, Bu Yin'ge]

586
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,900
to have the ability to get in His Majesty's favor.

587
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,060
She's really a bitch's daughter,

588
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,820
born to be a vixen.

589
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,780
My goodness.

590
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,140
My girl.

591
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,780
You can be angry,

592
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,780
but why would you ruin

593
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,140
the southern pearl your father gave you?

594
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,820
Mother, don't bother.

595
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,340
It's not important anymore.

596
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,500
Look how happy Father was

597
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,460
when he got back.

598
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,140
Back then,

599
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,260
the late Emperor was sickly,

600
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,540
so there were no prospects for me in the palace.

601
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,860
If not, how could she get to enter in my place?

602
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,860
If I were the one who went,

603
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,180
she would have nothing to do with it.

604
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,020
She was merely a Lady of the late Emperor.

605
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,900
His Majesty took an interest in her,

606
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:49,900
so he's keeping her outside

607
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,020
as a plaything.

608
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,900
He would never send her back to the palace

609
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,020
with a proper title.

610
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,220
Fisheyes are fisheyes after all.

611
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,780
They will never become pearls.

612
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,260
Our Young Miss is different.

613
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,060
You are captivating,

614
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,340
just like this southern pearl.

615
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,020
You thought you were smart

616
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,180
when you made her a tribute lady.

617
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,020
She must be holding a grudge.

618
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,260
If she tells on us

619
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:13,820
to His Majesty,

620
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,970
what would happen then?

621
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,820
I don't care.

622
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,260
Go look for her at the Imperial Mausoleum,

623
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,500
see how she is now.

624
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,100
Go now.

625
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,260
Alright, Young Miss.

626
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,980
Don't be angry. I'll go now.

627
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,260
-I'll be right there. -Hurry.

628
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,180
Be good.

629
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:26,940
Let's go.

630
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,940
Oh my god.

631
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,620
Have you heard?

632
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
Eunuch Liu was flogged to death by His Majesty.

633
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,460
Apparently, he offended Consort Dowager Duan.

634
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,300
No wonder.

635
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,420
No wonder the new Chief

636
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,340
assigned Beauty Li here to do tough chores

637
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,740
the moment he took the position.

638
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,540
She must have been implicated.

639
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,180
Beauty?

640
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,260
She was so eager to be a eunuch's lover,

641
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,540
her reputation is ruined.

642
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,980
She's worse than a servant now.

643
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,100
I heard that

644
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,420
she was the one

645
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,460
who blabbered to Eunuch Liu,

646
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,340
and got Consort Dowager Duan in trouble.

647
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,340
How could she have know that

648
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,020
the Consort Dowager was His Majesty's beloved?

649
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,060
Let alone Beauty Li,

650
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,740
whoever offends her will be doomed.

651
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,020
Exactly.

652
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,170
Sir,

653
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,220
I left some gifts

654
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,460
on the carriage.

655
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,740
I'll have to trouble you

656
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,420
to get them for me.

657
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,620
Yes.

658
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,580
Are you Beauty Li?

659
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,460
You are...

660
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,180
When your father was alive,

661
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,180
he served at the Hanlin Academy.

662
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,140
He was my husband's colleague.

663
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,820
Right,

664
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,140
our families used to be in contact.

665
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,900
We can be considered old friends, right?

666
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,580
Please enjoy.

667
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,380
I should have visited you earlier.

668
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,820
This is my first time meeting you,

669
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,220
but I can already feel a connection between us.

670
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,700
I've heard that

671
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,940
you are close with our Second Young Miss.

672
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,780
That's all in the past.

673
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,620
Not everyone

674
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,220
has the good fortune

675
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,340
to be friends with Consort Dowager Duan.

676
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,100
She's a little narrow-minded,

677
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,180
and hard to get along with.

678
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,660
I've heard that Eunuch Liu of the Imperial Mausoleum

679
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,620
offended her,

680
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,660
so he was flogged to death by His Majesty.

681
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,810
I've also heard that someone else

682
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,820
told on her to Eunuch Liu.

683
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,740
If she finds out about this,

684
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,100
that person wouldn't be able to live long either.

685
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,420
That's not true.

686
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,460
Eunuch Liu is dead.

687
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,860
Consort Dowager Duan

688
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,340
won't give others a hard time.

689
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,700
Even if she won't,

690
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,700
there are many people

691
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,420
who will do it on her behalf.

692
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,660
How dreadful.

693
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,700
As her mother,

694
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,340
I'm really worried that

695
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,340
she would push people into a corner,

696
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,300
and get herself hurt instead.

697
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,500
She's His Majesty's woman now.

698
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,770
No one would dare

699
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,740
do anything to harm her outright.

700
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,940
With her personality,

701
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,780
even His Majesty

702
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,700
won't be able to protect her.

703
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,010
Your Ladyship,

704
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,780
what are you worried about?

705
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,100
I've heard the mausoleum sacrifice is coming.

706
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,300
As the Consort Dowager,

707
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,660
she must

708
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,140
carry the late Emperor's robes out of the mausoleum.

709
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,900
But she is so clumsy.

710
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,860
If she drops the robes,

711
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,700
she would have committed

712
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,780
a crime of grave disrespect.

713
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,820
When that happens,

714
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,740
who could protect her?

715
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,210
Beauty Li,

716
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,740
you must help her.

717
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,280
[Hall of Peace]

718
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,740
The auspicious time has come.

719
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,220
The sacrificial rites will begin.

720
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,420
The royal robes, please.

721
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,100
Are you okay?

722
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,100
She tripped me.

723
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,180
Let's talk outside.

724
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,500
I'm going to kill you.

725
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,300
Take her away.

726
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:29,940
Yes.

727
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,740
Let go of me!

728
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,860
Let go of me!

729
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,180
Let go of me!

730
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,820
Why the panic?

731
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,500
It's only a small issue.

732
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,020
The Zhaoding Bureau will investigate it.

733
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,380
The rites must continue.

734
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,620
Don't miss the auspicious timing.

735
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,060
Sending off the royal robes.

736
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,700
It's not necessary.

737
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,340
It's not necessary.

738
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,580
On such a grand day,

739
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,300
it's not good to take a life.

740
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,820
Keep it.

741
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,420
She tried to assassinate you.

742
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,100
Yes, she's too bold.

743
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,140
We can't let her go.

744
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,700
I'll deal with her myself.

745
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,820
Now that I'm in your hands,

746
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,380
I have no more hope.

747
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,900
Do whatever you want.

748
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,460
Fine.

749
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,140
Alright.

750
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,660
I'm done.

751
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,820
You can tell me now.

752
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,540
What did I do to you,

753
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,900
that was so heinous?

754
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,460
Why did you have to kill me?

755
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,420
You forced my hand.

756
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,300
If I didn't kill you,

757
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,220
would you have let me off?

758
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,180
Are you crazy?

759
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,780
Why won't I let you off?

760
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,220
Stop pretending.

761
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,490
You've climbed the ladder.

762
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,620
Eunuch Liu died horrifically

763
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,500
because

764
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,100
he had offended you.

765
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,420
What about me?

766
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,260
Even if you wouldn't have done it yourself,

767
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,220
there are many people looking to please you

768
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,420
who would do it for you.

769
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,860
Do you know

770
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,340
how much I hate you?

771
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,860
Yes, you‘re formidable.

772
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,660
You're capable.

773
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,020
You have His Majesty as a backer.

774
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,100
What about me?

775
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,220
In order to survive,

776
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,580
I had to become a eunuch's lover,

777
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,700
and get trampled on.

778
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,860
My shame and dignity

779
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,730
have all been ruined.

780
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,180
But why?

781
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,380
Why do you get to be

782
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,500
so high and mighty?

783
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,940
Just because

784
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,340
I didn't get trampled on like you did,

785
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,020
I am in the wrong?

786
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,580
I owe you?

787
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,580
Yes, you owe me.

788
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,570
If you couldn't protect me,

789
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,860
from the very beginning,

790
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,260
you shouldn't have tried.

791
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,580
You shouldn't have told me that you would be there for me.

792
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,420
You shouldn't have made me trust you,

793
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,420
and unable to survive without you.

794
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,620
You abandoned me all of a sudden.

795
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,820
Why didn't you

796
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,770
come to save me then?

797
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,700
Why didn't you come?

798
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,420
You said

799
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,380
you were there for me.

800
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,820
You said that.

801
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,180
I'm sorry.

802
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,340
I'm not invincible.

803
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,340
I can't be there for you all the time.

804
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,330
Why make things so ugly?

805
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,820
I am

806
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,300
an extremely narrow-minded person.

807
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,620
Chief Xiao,

808
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,780
according to the rules of the Zhaoding Bureau,

809
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,580
what should happen next?

810
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,140
The 72 tortures of the imperial prison.

811
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,180
Lay them on her one by one.

812
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:14,980
No need.

813
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,100
I'll do it myself.

814
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,340
It's better for everyone.

815
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,220
What are you doing?

816
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,140
Bu Yinlou!

817
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,420
What are you doing?

818
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,420
You're on your own now.

819
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,020
What do you mean?

820
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,140
Taking out the trash.

821
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:44,260
You said it first.

822
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,780
I have a powerful backer now.

823
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,220
What am I supposed to do with trash,

824
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,620
other than get rid of it?

825
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,660
Go straight for three li.

826
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,940
Your mother and your younger sister

827
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,780
are waiting there for you.

828
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,260
Scram.

829
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,700
Bu Yinlou.

830
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,570
If you don't want to listen—

831
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,930
Beware of your legitimate mother.

832
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,420
Okay.

833
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,060
Thank you.

834
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,060
She wanted to kill you.

835
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,620
Why did you

836
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,140
spare her life?

837
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,700
Do you remember

838
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,500
the graveyard in the mausoleum?

839
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,420
Those belong to

840
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,020
concubines of lowly status.

841
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,700
I often wonder

842
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,300
what their names were.

843
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,340
What were they like when they were alive?

844
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,180
What did they like,

845
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,940
and what did they hate?

846
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,540
Who did they shed tears for?

847
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,780
Today,

848
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,180
does anyone still remember them?

849
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,260
I don't want to be

850
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,340
buried there someday, all by myself.

851
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,380
I don't want to become

852
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,100
one amongst countless bodies in that place.

853
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,300
I don't want any other woman

854
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,700
to be buried there ever again.

855
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,140
I hate this world.

856
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,690
I hate myself for being unable to do anything.

857
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,580
But at least

858
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,100
she can be free from now on.

859
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,540
This way, it feels as if

860
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,580
I have won too.

861
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,220
I'm here.

862
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,060
I will always be by your side.

863
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,340
Do you know?

864
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,340
Through this incident,

865
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,140
I've learned a lesson.

866
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,420
"I am here."

867
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,420
These three words

868
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,140
must not be said lightly.

869
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,740
No one knows what will happen

870
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,900
in the future.

871
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,420
You can't possibly

872
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,100
stay by my side forever.

873
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,700
I'm scared

874
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,660
that if I get used to you,

875
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,660
I will become like Li Pingru,

876
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,300
and become reliant on you.

877
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,420
If that happens,

878
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,300
I will never be able to

879
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,740
go on by myself ever again.

880
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,020
But as of right now,

881
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,500
I believe you will help me

882
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,940
with whatever I need.

883
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:51,900
Right?

884
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,180
What do you want to do?

885
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,260
Pick a fight with my legitimate mother.

886
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,100
I'm willing to join you

887
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,300
in picking a fight.

888
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,100
But before that,

889
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,420
you must go back with me.

890
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,100
There are many watchful eyes there,

891
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,290
so Your Highness will have to

892
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,500
to enter my residence

893
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,740
as a member of my clan.

894
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,180
This way, we won't arouse suspicion.

895
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,620
Don't worry.

896
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,860
Since it's in the name of your clan member,

897
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:19,620
then it'll be

898
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,420
inappropriate for you

899
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,940
to keep calling me "Your Highness."

900
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,820
Just call me by my name.

901
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,020
Okay.

902
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,860
Yinlou.

903
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:38,820
Why are you dressed like this?

904
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,020
Is the parade of the royal robes your parade,

905
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:41,980
or the late Emperor's?

906
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,500
Don't you like it?

907
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,700
What? I'm not dressed auspiciously enough?

908
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,460
Auspicious?

909
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,340
It's incredibly auspicious.

910
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,860
I'm afraid you might get a heatstroke.

911
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,380
Why don't you lose two pieces?

912
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,660
No. I like it this way.
