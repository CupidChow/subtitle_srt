You can’t give up on yourself

00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,780
Now,

350
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,100
the Lantern Festival is here again.

351
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,020
I had wanted to invite you

352
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,780
to go look at the lanterns together.

353
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,540
I thought as long as you agreed to it,

354
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,020
I could forget

355
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,380
all your mistakes.

356
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,220
Now,

357
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,100
it doesn't matter anymore.

358
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,180
Because I've already decided

359
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,340
to have you

360
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,220
stay by my side forever.

361
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:10,180
Seal the entrance to this tower.

362
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,860
Your Majesty.

363
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,260
If you seal up the tower,

364
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,340
Her Highness won't be able to live.

365
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,940
That way, she'll be able to stay

366
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,620
by my side forever.

367
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,820
We will never be apart

368
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,780
for eternity.

369
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,620
Yes.

370
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:55,940
Your Highness.

371
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,300
I'm sorry.

372
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,420
Seal the door!

373
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,060
What are you doing?

374
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:03,860
Why are you sealing the door?

375
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,460
Stop!

376
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,060
Stop!

377
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,420
Stop!

378
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,580
Stop! Don't close the door!

379
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Come back!

380
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,060
Let's go with this card.

381
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,450
I'll listen to you.

382
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,140
This one.

383
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,219
Brother,

384
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,460
it's a rare occasion today,

385
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:15,940
and it's also been a while

386
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,139
since things were so lively in the palace.

387
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,420
I put in a lot of effort.

388
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,300
I specially brought the lantern decorations

389
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:23,380
popular amongst the people into the palace.

390
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,300
Tonight, regardless of status,

391
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,020
everyone can enjoy the lanterns

392
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,900
and partake in the festive joy.

393
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:32,500
Thank you.

394
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,420
You can't see clearly outside.

395
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,420
Why don't you come with me

396
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,060
to enjoy the festivities together with everyone?

397
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,620
Brother.

398
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,500
Let's go.

399
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,100
Fish Immortal,

400
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,140
let me tell you the truth.

401
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,100
I never trusted you.

402
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,340
But let's strike a deal.

403
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,820
If you save my life,

404
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,580
I'll worship you properly from now on.

405
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,140
Zhuo Ying.

406
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,460
Zhuo Ying, are you there?

407
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,060
Xiao Duo, I'm here.

408
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,420
I'm here.

409
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,380
Step back a little.

410
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,300
Don't come near the door.

411
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,740
Xiao Duo.

412
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:07,900
Xiao Duo.

413
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,180
Zhuo Ying.

414
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,420
Zhuo Ying.

415
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,140
Are you okay?

416
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:12,900
Let's go.

417
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:15,860
Wait.

418
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:23,860
Let's go.

419
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,100
We escaped.

420
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,140
Of course.

421
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,500
Are you too happy to see your husband?

422
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,540
Let's leave, the place is on fire.

423
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,300
Hold on.

424
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,180
What are you doing?

425
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,340
This is Denghuo.

426
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,100
No matter how rich you are,

427
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,340
you can't just sacrifice it like that.

428
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,500
With you to spend my life with, I've already been reborn.

429
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,060
From now on,

430
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,180
the Chief of Zhaoding Bureau doesn't exist anymore,

431
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,380
so why would I still need Denghuo?

432
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,180
Carrying it with me will be more trouble.

433
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,180
It's time for me to put down this sword.

434
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,860
♫ I went around the black tiles and red walls ♫

435
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,040
♫ Ran into the wavering moonlight ♫

436
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,860
If you don't like it,

437
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,180
you can give it to me instead.

438
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:06,240
♫ Shining into the corridor of jade steps ♫

439
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,380
Why are you so impractical?

440
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,950
♫ You put brush on paper ♫

441
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,060
I'm rethinking my choice to live with you now.

442
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,460
♫ Writing, pausing, stalling, pressing ♫

443
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,700
Come on. I'll take you away.

444
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,530
♫ It's clear from your words ♫

445
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:18,590
♫ Depicting your emotions ♫

446
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,180
♫ The night is precious ♫

447
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,270
♫ and shining ♫

448
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,600
♫ Your words and poems of love ♫

449
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,570
♫ Are all I can think about ♫

450
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:30,670
♫ I only wish lovers can be freed from their longing ♫

451
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,900
♫ And meet by the magpie bridge ♫

452
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,380
This way.

453
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:43,980
Who's that?

454
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,820
I must have misheard.

455
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:54,740
Go over there.

456
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:55,660
Yes.

457
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,260
Let's go.

458
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,660
Yu Zun left just like that?

459
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,220
He let us go on purpose?

460
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,180
Is he possessed too?

461
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:20,940
Leave him alone. Let's go.

462
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,340
You two, stop right there.

463
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,260
Turn around.

464
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,020
I told you to turn around!

465
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,900
Take off your masks.

466
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,980
I asked you to take off your masks.

467
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,300
Brother, we've already given the order.

468
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,820
Everyone is enjoying the festivities tonight.

469
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,980
It's not good if you act all haughty and

470
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:46,780
make things difficult for them.

471
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,900
They look so familiar.

472
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,900
I told you to remove your masks,

473
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,220
why aren't you doing it?

474
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,460
Your Majesty!

475
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,100
Your Majesty!

476
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,460
Your Majesty, Futu Pagoda is on fire!

477
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,220
Fire!

478
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,140
Fire!

479
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,900
Why did it catch fire?

480
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,610
Fire!

481
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,020
Let's go help.

482
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,260
Hurry up! Hurry up!

483
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,060
Let's go.

484
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:39,540
Hurry!

485
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:39,980
I didn't expect that.

486
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,260
Fire!

487
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:41,900
Come help!

488
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:42,780
Why is there a fire?

489
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,420
Come, this way.

490
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,020
This Imperial City

491
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,900
is completely surrounded by palace walls.

492
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,860
It's like a prison made of riches and power.

493
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,020
We tried our best to break it,

494
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,430
♫ The falling petals in the wind are like a woman's troubled heart ♫

495
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,330
but our power is not enough

496
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,660
to change this world.

497
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:20,170
♫ Who are these troubles for ♫

498
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,180
We can only run.

499
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,220
Run to the place where the sun rises.

500
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,460
But...

501
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,970
♫ You say the willow trees ♫

502
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,820
Can we really escape?

503
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,650
♫ Symbolize not leaving ♫

504
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,940
If you don't try,

505
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,580
how would you know?

506
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,910
♫ Woe not ♫

507
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:43,940
Your Majesty!

508
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,210
Your Majesty.

509
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,580
We found Consort Duan's body.

510
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,060
Your Majesty!

511
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,100
Your Majesty.

512
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:31,940
Your Majesty!
