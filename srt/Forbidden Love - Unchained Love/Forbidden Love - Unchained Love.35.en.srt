00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,650
Eunuch Zhang!

177
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,040
To think that

178
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,090
after so many brushes with death,

179
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,170
after so many twists and turns,

180
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,400
I'll be back here again.

181
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,130
This tower has something against me.

182
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,570
The incident created by Yinlou

183
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,770
is spinning out of control.

184
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,920
The Great Ye cannot tolerate a crazy woman.

185
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,490
In the future,

186
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,000
her life will only get more difficult.

187
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,290
Qilang, Cao Chun'ang,

188
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:53,860
contact the undercover Zhaoding Guards

189
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,600
immediately.

190
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,450
Pass my order.

191
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,530
Spread the news that

192
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,850
Murong Gaogong

193
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,640
killed Prince Rong.

194
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,810
I want the whole of the Great Ye

195
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,920
to know about it.

196
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,170
Yes, Chief.

197
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,330
Why do you look so pale?

198
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,250
I've made arrangements

199
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,080
for all of our injured men.

200
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,010
What's wrong, Cao Chun'ang?

201
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:35,960
Cao Chun'ang?

202
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,640
Cao.

203
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,520
Cao Chun'ang?

204
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,520
Cao Chun'ang!

205
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,530
Cao Chun'ang!

206
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,290
Cao Chun'ang, what's wrong?

207
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:48,920
Cao Chun'ang!

208
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,360
Cao Chun'ang!

209
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,280
Cao Chun'ang!

210
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,110
[Sleeping in Snow]

211
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,850
Where is the doctor?

212
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,400
Why isn't he here yet?

213
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,760
Godfather.

214
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,690
Forget it.

215
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,410
It's too late.

216
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,800
I'm glad you're fine.

217
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,970
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

218
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,490
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

219
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,570
Don't cry.

220
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,240
If you cry,

221
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,450
my heart will hurt.

222
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,130
Okay.

223
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,120
I won't cry.

224
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:37,680
I won't cry.

225
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,440
What did you promise me?

226
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,530
You said you would bring him back

227
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,730
safe and sound.

228
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,520
Xiao Duo, what did you promise me?

229
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,280
Give him back! Xiao Duo!

230
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,250
Give him back to me.

231
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,560
Godfather.

232
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,970
She has a bad temper.

233
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,330
Don't hold it against her.

234
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,650
There's something

235
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,880
I didn't dare to tell you before,

236
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,040
but I want to be bold today.

237
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,370
Actually,

238
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,200
I really envy the Second Master

239
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,760
for having an older brother like you.

240
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,090
I call you Godfather,

241
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,650
but in my heart,

242
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,080
I have always regarded you as my older brother.

243
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,480
I know.

244
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,600
In my heart,

245
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,120
you've always been my younger brother.

246
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,680
Your son-

247
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,010
Actually,

248
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,800
other than you,

249
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,610
the person I'm most worried about

250
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,890
is this girl.

251
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,000
If I die,

252
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,360
you have to promise me-

253
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,610
You have to promise me

254
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,690
you will protect her for me.

255
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,370
Don't let her get bullied again.

256
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,050
Okay.

257
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,040
I promise you.

258
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,890
At the end of this life,

259
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,800
I have my brothers

260
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,570
and my wife with me.

261
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,400
My whole family is here.

262
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,160
It's

263
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,600
a happy ending.

264
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,490
Cao Chun'ang...

265
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,560
Cao Chun'ang, don't go.

266
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,800
Don’t leave me.

267
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,730
Cao Chun'ang, don't go.

268
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,160
Cao Chun'ang!

269
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,280
Don't leave me.

270
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,560
Get up. You're not dead.

271
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:28,640
I-

272
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,160
I-

273
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,600
I'm alive again.

274
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,570
No.

275
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,130
Does the Zhaoding Bureau not follow proper procedures

276
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,360
even when it comes to death?

277
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,360
You're thick-skinned. Your organs weren't injured.

278
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,210
Cao Chun'ang,

279
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,000
you bastard.

280
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,170
How could you get this wrong?

281
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,800
Don't you know

282
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,970
whether you're dead or not?

283
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:50,930
I-

284
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,720
I-

285
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,250
I'm inexperienced.

286
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:55,640
You-

287
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,970
I felt like

288
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,840
everyone was in such a somber mood today.

289
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,040
It seemed appropriate for someone to die.

290
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,400
I happened to get hit.

291
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,840
What a coincidence!

292
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,080
Did I

293
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,400
scold Chief Xiao just now?

294
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,210
You should have died instead.

295
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:21,830
I-

296
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,490
I'm a real man.

297
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,810
How could I cry

298
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,450
because of you?

299
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,090
I-

300
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,120
I'm going to strangle you!

301
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,450
Calm down.

302
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,400
You'll really kill him.

303
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,640
Calm down.

304
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,520
Well...

305
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,640
Godfather,

306
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,650
I'm fine.

307
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,880
Her Highness will be fine too.

308
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,250
That's right.

309
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,640
Even though we failed this time,

310
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,690
there will be another way.

311
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,850
We’ll save her.

312
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,080
Yes, Chief.

313
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,650
Don’t worry.

314
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,050
We can definitely save her.

315
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,000
Yes.

316
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,410
There must be a way.

317
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,480
At worst, I'll just break into the Imperial City.

318
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,810
Rebels!

319
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,360
All of them!

320
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,570
How dare mere commoners

321
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,650
criticize their Emperor?

322
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,450
Tell me.

323
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,490
Why haven't the rumors been stopped?

324
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,800
Why haven't they been stopped?

325
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,210
The deposed Empress spoke firmly

326
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,530
and incited the hearts of the people.

327
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,140
We should investigate the case thoroughly

328
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,050
and announce the truth to the world,

329
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,730
so as to clear Your Majesty's name.

330
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,610
Please investigate the death of Prince Rong.

331
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,280
Please investigate the death of Prince Rong.

332
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,360
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

333
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,160
Speak!

334
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,920
Go on!

335
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,120
Don't stop.

336
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,690
Go on.

337
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,370
Speak! I love to hear it!

338
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,640
Speak.

339
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:00,960
Your Majesty!

340
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,080
He's a tyrant!

341
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,400
He's a tyrant!

342
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,930
Stop it!

343
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,770
You bastard!

344
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,650
What have you done?

345
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,010
If my dog is disobedient,

346
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,720
should I just let him bark?

347
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,240
Murong Gaogong,

348
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,810
you are immoral and cruel!

349
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,890
You're not fit to be an Emperor!

350
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,440
I will issue a decree to depose you!

351
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,250
My mother is advanced in age,

352
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,130
and she is confused.

353
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,770
Send her back to Shouhe Palace immediately

354
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,890
and let her rest well.

355
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,680
From now on,

356
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,420
don't let this old woman

357
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,440
walk around anymore.

358
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,010
You-

359
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,330
Your Majesty!

360
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,480
-Empress Dowager! -Empress Dowager!

361
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,110
Alright.

362
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,610
Does anyone else have anything to report?

363
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,890
Is there?

364
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,200
Is there?

365
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,160
No?

366
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,480
Fine.

367
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,850
I see that all of you are coming to court

368
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,240
without anything important to discuss.

369
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,280
Alright.

370
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,210
Then you don't have to attend court anymore.

371
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,570
Send your memorials

372
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,640
to Shangqiong Palace instead.

373
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,720
Mother, rest well.

374
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,570
Your Majesty!

375
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,010
Your Majesty!

376
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,530
Physician! Hurry! Call for the imperial physician!

377
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:27,970
Physician!

378
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,130
Call for the imperial physician!

379
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,970
No, no, no.

380
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,810
Xiao Duo

381
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,480
won't give up.

382
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,880
He will come to assassinate me.

383
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,160
You.

384
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,210
Yes, you.

385
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,080
Dispatch troops to guard Shangqiong Palace.

386
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

387
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,650
Also, get them

388
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,800
to send me more tonic soup.

389
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,770
More.

390
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:06,690
Yes.

391
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,090
Your Majesty.

392
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,480
This...

393
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,890
Massacring the people,

394
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,330
killing court officials,

395
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,000
imprisoning the Empress Dowager, and doing away with the rules of the court...

396
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:19,640
You-

397
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,250
You will go down in history

398
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,800
as a tyrant.

399
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,290
What are you talking about?

400
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,440
Didn't I-

401
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,930
No, no.

402
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,120
Sun Taiqing taught me

403
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,330
I must make everyone

404
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,050
submit to me

405
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,370
and fear me.

406
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,760
He also said

407
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,130
all of this-

408
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,200
all of this is Heaven's will.

409
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,560
How could you say that?

410
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,800
He also told me

411
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,930
I must make everyone

412
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,640
bend to my will.

413
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,520
Those who disobey me

414
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,290
deserve to die.

415
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,330
Your Majesty.

416
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,120
I beg of you.

417
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,010
Please stop.

418
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,370
Don't make more mistakes.

419
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,040
How could you say that?

420
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,090
Those who disobey me deserve to die.

421
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,130
Yes.

422
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,410
Your Majesty.

423
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,680
Don't make more mistakes.

424
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:32,720
Those who disobey me

425
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,330
deserve to die.

426
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,960
That's right.

427
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,480
Sun Taiqing said

428
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,130
those who disobey me deserve to die.

429
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,200
It's Heaven's will.

430
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,690
Even Heaven's will

431
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,040
must bend to my will.

432
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,410
I...

433
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,570
was wrong.

434
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,050
Mistress, bad news.

435
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,370
His Majesty flew into a rage

436
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,320
in the Hall of Imperial Supremacy this morning

437
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,970
and killed a minister on the spot.

438
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,640
He even locked the Empress Dowager up.

439
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,130
Now the Empress Dowager

440
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,000
has taken ill.

441
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,330
He even killed Eunuch Sun.

442
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,090
How could this happen?

443
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,650
Why did he kill Eunuch Sun?

444
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,650
At the conferring ceremony,

445
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,330
Empress Bu went crazy

446
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,160
and brought up the death of Prince Rong.

447
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,370
Now, it's spreading like wildfire

448
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,480
all over the Great Ye.

449
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,850
They're all saying that it was His Majesty

450
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,250
who killed Prince Rong.

451
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,680
I heard

452
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,770
His Majesty massacred the people

453
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,400
to cover it up.

454
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,120
No one could stop him.

455
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,530
Then, in the morning, this happened.

456
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,250
What about Yinlou?

457
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,730
Is she okay?

458
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,170
Many people saw

459
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,450
her crazed state.

460
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,210
It can't be hidden anymore.

461
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,080
She's been locked up in Futu Pagoda.

462
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,040
Isn't that akin to deposing the Empress?

463
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,520
No.

464
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,930
I have to go take a look.

465
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,520
How many people are on duty today?

466
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,810
I didn't see many people

467
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,320
on my way here.

468
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,410
I heard that His Majesty

469
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,370
was afraid that Chief Xiao would come to assassinate him,

470
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,000
so he transferred most of the guards in the palace

471
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,290
to Shangqiong Palace.

472
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,560
Shangqiong Palace?

473
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,850
Ruolan, do me a favour.

474
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:30,920
It's time to eat.

475
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,770
I'm here

476
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,170
to watch you eat.

477
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,840
Your Highness, please eat.

478
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,730
How easy is is

479
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,760
for the dew on onions to dry.

480
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:09,449
Dried dew forms again the next morning.

481
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,320
When a person dies—

482
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,090
Bu Yinlou.

483
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,409
When will they come back?

484
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,610
I've been cornered

485
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,600
because of you.

486
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,050
Are you satisfied?

487
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,520
Why are you like this now?

488
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,000
Are you a human

489
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,719
or a ghost?

490
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,330
It doesn't matter.

491
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,210
I'm not afraid.

492
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,920
How easy it is

493
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,320
for the dew on onions to dry.

494
00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:02,610
Dried dew forms again the next morning

495
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,520
When a person dies...

496
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:16,070
[Sleeping in the Snow]

497
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,360
One more bite.

498
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,330
Go on.

499
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,770
Chief, as per your orders,

500
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,680
we've told our men outside

501
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,560
to pretend that you're on the run.

502
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,930
Murong Gaogong will never expect that

503
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,320
you're still in the capital.

504
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,530
Also,

505
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,370
I managed to get news regarding Her Highness.

506
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,170
She's locked up in the Futu Pagoda where she was imprisoned

507
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,010
back when she was supposed to be sacrificed.

508
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,210
Godfather,

509
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,370
are you really going to

510
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,800
storm into the Imperial City and take her away?

511
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,520
Focus on taking your medicine.

512
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,210
Right now, Murong Gaogong

513
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,400
is guarding the Imperial City closely.

514
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,520
If we want to take her away,

515
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,320
we need someone to help us from the inside.

516
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,730
But Chief,

517
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,610
we've already withdrawn all our men

518
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,600
from the Imperial City.

519
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,680
There's one more person!

520
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,720
My brother is tyrannical.

521
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,530
As his sister, I'm disheartened.

522
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,250
With Yinlou in trouble,

523
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,130
I'm willing to help you

524
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,680
devise a plan to save her.

525
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,120
If you trust me,

526
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,770
from now on, you can communicate with me

527
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,410
by burying your letters

528
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,960
under the 72nd brick from the left at Xihua Gate.

529
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,570
Ruolan will collect them.

530
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,690
Judging from your expression,

531
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,010
you must have something up your sleeve again.

532
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:41,410
Come on.

533
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,120
Burn it.

534
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,570
How can we burn Wan Wan's calligraphy?

535
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:46,960
Hey,

536
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,210
who are you ordering around?

537
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,610
Who does he think he is?

538
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,400
Does he still think he's the Chief?

539
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,170
You can't let this kind of people have their way.

540
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,400
Don't listen to him anymore.

541
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,780
Whoever listens to him is a bastard.

542
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,330
Hey bastard,

543
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,400
why don't you burn all of these too while you're at it?

544
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,200
Take your time.

545
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,840
You must have suffered here.

546
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,730
These are some daily necessities

547
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:00,530
that Miss Ruolan asked me

548
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,490
to bring over for you.

549
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,410
If you need anything else,

550
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,520
just let me know and I'll prepare it for you.

551
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,440
Thank you, Commander Yu.

552
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,000
How is my brother doing recently?

553
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,240
His Majesty is anxious and restless.

554
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,570
He can't sleep or eat well,

555
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,850
and his headaches are getting worse.

556
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,920
He goes to Futu Pagoda every day,

557
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,200
and always flies into a rage once he comes back.

558
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,660
Sometimes he thinks that

559
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,720
Her Highness has really gone crazy.

560
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:25,930
At other times,

561
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,440
he thinks Her Highness is tricking him.

562
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,400
Since we share the same blood,

563
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,770
I should stay

564
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,050
by his side.

565
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,680
I was too immature previously.

566
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,080
I've been thinking a lot these days.

567
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,050
What else is there

568
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,170
that runs thicker than blood?

569
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,160
Commander Yu,

570
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,380
I want to return to

571
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,040
my brother's side to be with him.

572
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,400
Maybe he will feel better if I do that.

573
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,010
Can you help me?

574
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,690
I'm not in a position of much power.

575
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,000
I'm afraid I won't be able to help you.

576
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:06,850
I understand.

577
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,080
My brother has always been suspicious.

578
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,210
If you speak on my behalf,

579
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,810
he will definitely suspect you.

580
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,650
I won't give you a hard time.

581
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,800
But,

582
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,600
I do have an idea in mind,

583
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,050
that won't make His Majesty suspect you.

584
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,170
[Shangqiong Palace]

585
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,440
Your Majesty.

586
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,050
Should I summon the imperial physician?

587
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,800
How can a perfectly normal person

588
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,090
become a madwoman?

589
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,720
Did I cause her to become like this?

590
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,720
No.

591
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,000
It was Xiao Duo.

592
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,090
Where is Xiao Duo? Have you found him?

593
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,690
There is news from northern border

594
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,560
saying that Chief Xiao may have been seen on the run there.

595
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:03,890
Northern border?

596
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,740
He escaped.

597
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,890
He abandoned Yinlou.

598
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,380
If Yinlou finds out,

599
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,810
she won't be able to continue pretending.

600
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,570
I'm going to go expose her,

601
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,580
and tell her.

602
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:18,050
Your Majesty.

603
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,700
I can't tell if Her Highness

604
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,090
has really gone mad or not.

605
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:23,930
But there is one person

606
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:24,980
who may be able to tell.

607
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:26,610
Who?

608
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,630
Princess Hede.

609
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,690
She and Her Highness are close like sisters,

610
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,620
and she knows Her Highness well.

611
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,460
Your Majesty,

612
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,690
you can ask her to test Her Highness.

613
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:38,750
Yes.

614
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,730
Summon Princess Hede.

615
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:43,920
Yes.

616
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,470
Open the door.

617
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,660
I know

618
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,680
you don't want to do this.

619
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,740
But remember,

620
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,300
you are not only my sister,

621
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,110
but you are also my subject.

622
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,120
It's not up to you to decide

623
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,430
whether you want to do what I ask of you.

624
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,200
Brother, don't worry.

625
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,020
I've been thinking a lot these days.

626
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,370
I've had enough of being locked up.

627
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,860
From now on, I will do whatever

628
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,900
you want me to do.

629
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:36,710
I won't betray you.

630
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,130
That's my good girl.

631
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,280
I'm very glad that you could

632
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,840
realize your mistakes.

633
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,320
When this matter is settled,

634
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,590
I'll release you from house arrest.

635
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

636
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,970
Okay, go on in.
