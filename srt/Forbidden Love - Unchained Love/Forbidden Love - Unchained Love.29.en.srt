4
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:44,000
Do you remember this silk pendant?

5
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,210
My mother made it by hand.

6
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,130
It's yours.

7
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,890
Six years ago,

8
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,440
it dropped at Ruyi Alley

9
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,650
and was held tightly in a young man's hand.

10
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,039
But that young man is dead.

11
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,160
He was killed.

12
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,440
Father,

13
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,840
tell me.

14
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,080
Did you kill him?

15
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,370
I don't even know

16
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,440
who you are talking about.

17
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,290
How did you know?

18
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,480
Who told you?

19
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,290
Did you kill him?

20
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,770
He saw something he shouldn't have.

21
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,650
It's not my fault.

22
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,760
It's really you.

23
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,329
Why did you kill him?

24
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:38,600
He's just a lowly person.

25
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,970
He saw what he shouldn't have.

26
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,210
So what if I killed him?

27
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:41,960
Father.

28
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,810
That was a human life.

29
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,880
He's not a blade of grass.

30
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,560
He had parents who raised him,

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,600
and family who cared about him.

32
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,770
When he becomes of age,

33
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,940
he may get married and have children,

34
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,210
and have a family.

35
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,860
Just because he happened to witness

36
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,040
your secret,

37
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,200
you killed him.

38
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,980
How are you any different

39
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,920
from a vicious criminal?

40
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,380
I only did this

41
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,240
for the Bu family.

42
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,290
Of course you did.

43
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,880
You killed him

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,450
because you were afraid others would find out

45
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,410
you were the secret card that

46
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,040
the Prince of Nanyuan kept in the capital.

47
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,200
Nonsense!

48
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,170
Since when have I

49
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,680
had dealings with the Prince of Nanyuan?

50
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,890
I thought it was strange at first.

51
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,380
You seemed to be trying to prevent Bu Yinge

52
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,490
from marrying the Prince of Nanyuan.

53
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,890
But in fact,

54
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,680
you were never really trying to prevent it.

55
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,490
All of this

56
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,380
was just a show you put on

57
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,450
for His Majesty.

58
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,410
So that you could make him believe

59
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,930
you have nothing going on

60
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,760
with the Prince of Nanyuan.

61
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,850
You've been working for him all this while.

62
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,410
Don't forget

63
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,850
you are my daughter.

64
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,810
You're also a Bu.

65
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,250
Both of us

66
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,090
will share the same glories and losses.

67
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,170
Now you're trying to

68
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,490
dig out the secret between

69
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,200
the Prince of Nanyuan and I from so many years ago.

70
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,960
What are you trying to do?

71
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,690
I want an answer.

72
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,970
I want to know

73
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,160
if you've ever even felt

74
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,200
a tinge of guilt?

75
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,250
But now I know

76
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,000
you've never.

77
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,620
You don't even remember

78
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,920
that such a person existed.

79
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,410
To you, people's lives

80
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,760
are just like grass.

81
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,280
Why should I feel guilty?

82
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,200
Yinlou.

83
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,020
You used to be

84
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,960
so well-behaved and obedient.

85
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,380
Why have you

86
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,610
become like this now?

87
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,040
You're wrong.

88
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,610
I've never changed.

89
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,600
You've just never

90
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,840
looked at me properly before.

91
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,650
I've never been well-behaved

92
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,800
nor obedient.

93
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,400
From now on,

94
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,450
I won't listen to you anymore.

95
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,440
Shut up!

96
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,240
You're just like your mother.

97
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,450
On the surface, you two seem well-behaved and obedient.

98
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,240
but actually,

99
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,730
your hearts are hard like stone.

100
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,330
If you didn't mention my mother, I was going to let it go.

101
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,320
But since you brought her up,

102
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,020
I might as well just

103
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,080
make it clear today.

104
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,330
You didn't care about her opinions

105
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,970
and forced her to be a mistress.

106
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,000
You thought you were being kind

107
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,920
to give her a title and make her your concubine.

108
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,360
You let her stay in the back courtyard of your house

109
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,930
for your legitimate wife to torture her.

110
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,800
Have you ever treated her like a human?

111
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,530
Have you ever treated anyone around you

112
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,360
like a human?

113
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,930
If she was really

114
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,210
as stubborn as stone,

115
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,290
she would have hidden a knife

116
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,240
under your pillow long ago,

117
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,420
and taken the chance to stab you in the heart

118
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,520
while you were asleep.

119
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,290
You...

120
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:40,890
This...

121
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,330
What's the rush?

122
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,850
I made the soup myself.

123
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,250
It's quite sweet.

124
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,120
Try it.

125
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,760
You're a rebel!

126
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,160
Why are you angry?

127
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,680
Ever since I was young,

128
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,090
you've never looked at me properly.

129
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,420
You treated me like a cat or dog

130
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,440
that you owned.

131
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,690
You ignored me, and used me.

132
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,970
You've been treating me like this,

133
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,930
but I have never vented my anger on you.

134
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,370
You...

135
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,250
What an unfilial daughter!

136
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,050
Hit me!

137
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,040
I am an imperial concubine.

138
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,370
You are a subject.

139
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,850
If you disrespect me,

140
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,200
you are disrespecting authority.

141
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,490
If you dare to hit me,

142
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,620
I'll salute you for your guts

143
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,440
to disrespect the imperial family's power!

144
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,820
There's finally a moment that

145
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,050
you're behaving like a human being.

146
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,410
Yinlou.

147
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm doing this for your own good.

148
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,900
If you really hate me

149
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,600
because of all these past bygones,

150
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,770
I can make it up to you.

151
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,290
Don't worry.

152
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,450
I will make sure I protect

153
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,400
your glory and status.

154
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,250
But you have to tell me

155
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,970
who was it that

156
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,280
asked you to trick me?

157
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,690
It's Xiao Duo?

158
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,250
How much does he know

159
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,960
about me and the Prince of Nanyuan?

160
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,210
How will he deal with me?

161
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,120
Father,

162
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,530
Have you had a heart?

163
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,760
Have you ever loved anyone?

164
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,960
Have I and my mother ever

165
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,780
had a place

166
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,090
in your heart?

167
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,320
You don't have to answer.

168
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,170
I don't want to know.

169
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,810
Leave.

170
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,010
Yinlou.

171
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,490
Don't worry.

172
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,880
Xiao Duo knows nothing.

173
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,160
But if you want to hurt him,

174
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,820
then our ties,

175
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,930
between you and me as father and daughter,

176
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,690
will end here.

177
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,720
Why are you here?

178
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,130
Where have you been?

179
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,410
The room was too stuffy.

180
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,490
I went to the courtyard to take a walk.

181
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,460
Your Majesty.

182
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,080
You've been showing both grace and authority these days.

183
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,740
The officials in the court are showing

184
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,810
more deference to you these days.

185
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,440
If Her Highness knows

186
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,960
you've been spending so much effort on her,

187
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,970
she'll surely be deeply touched.

188
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,330
Yinlou, I'm here to see you.

189
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,570
Yinlou?

190
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,120
Yinlou, I'm here to see you.

191
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,690
Your Majesty.

192
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,850
I'm not well,

193
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,730
I dare not face the Heavenly Emperor.

194
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,760
Fine. If you don't like it,

195
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,530
I won't look.

196
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,360
Yinlou.

197
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,730
why are you sweating so much?

198
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,210
It's my fault that my body isn't strong

199
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,090
and got poisoned by the wine.

200
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,130
The imperial physician said I should rest more.

201
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,600
You haven't recovered

202
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,890
and you were poisoned.

203
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,520
You also suffered a lot because of the fox demon case.

204
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,970
It's my fault.

205
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,970
I'll make it up to you.

206
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,300
I'm here today

207
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,840
to bring you good news.

208
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,820
No one in the court

209
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,360
dare to rebel against me anymore.

210
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,010
I've convinced Mother.

211
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,400
When you recover,

212
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,930
I'll take you to the palace.

213
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,360
In such hurry?

214
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,530
I

215
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,400
can't wait.

216
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,330
Your Majesty just said

217
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,410
you promise that you won't look at my sickly face,

218
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,360
and now you're going back on your word?

219
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,280
Apologies.

220
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,610
I haven't recovered.

221
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,080
I'm afraid I might offend Your Majesty

222
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,040
causing you to dislike me.

223
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,010
Fine.

224
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,650
I'll keep my word.

225
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,080
I'm not in a hurry.

226
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,330
You will

227
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,800
come back to my side soon anyway.

228
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,850
I will give you

229
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,570
everything.

230
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,090
I will make you the Empress

231
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,880
and my real wife.

232
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,010
You will stay by my side forever,

233
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,130
and work together with me,

234
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,360
and live and die together.

235
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,920
Look at me,

236
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,050
I just said I wouldn't look,

237
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,530
but I couldn't help looking at you.

238
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,340
All right.

239
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,170
I won't disturb you further then.

240
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,000
Yinlou, I'm looking forward to it.

241
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,890
I'm really looking forward to it.

242
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,560
Get well and enter the palace soon!

243
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,610
I'm leaving first.

244
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,200
Farewell, Your Majesty.

245
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,080
Get up.

246
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,930
That scared me.

247
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,810
He finally left.

248
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,880
Take me away.

249
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,000
Okay.

250
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,210
After everything is settled,

251
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,010
I'll take you away.

252
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,490
Six years ago, on the seventh day of June,

253
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,500
he went out on an invite

254
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,770
to attend a poetry meeting.

255
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,010
He got drunk that day

256
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,080
and went to the guest room to rest.

257
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,490
He didn't show up until it was almost over.

258
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,410
No one has seen him during this period.

259
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,360
The time he disappeared for

260
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,170
matches the time Second Master was killed.

261
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,060
I also compared

262
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,570
the dagger from the Bu Mansion

263
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,930
with the scar

264
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,360
from Second Master's corpse,

265
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,570
and they match perfectly.

266
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,490
Godfather,

267
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,610
are you really going to kill Bu Yulu?

268
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,490
Unlike Queen Rong'an, Bu Yulu

269
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,850
holds an important position,

270
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,220
and His Majesty values him.

271
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,840
If you touch him,

272
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,740
you're blatantly

273
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,920
going against His Majesty.

274
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,970
His Majesty has already been wary of you,

275
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,720
he won’t let you go.

276
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:27,930
Chief,

277
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,650
you're in a risky situation now.

278
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,570
If you kill Bu Yulu now,

279
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,540
you're practically

280
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,810
killing yourself.

281
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,680
Enough.

282
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,530
No matter how much we say, it's useless.

283
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,520
I'll say one more thing.

284
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,280
Bu Yulu is Godmother's biological father.

285
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,130
Even if you don't get along with him,

286
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,120
they are still related by blood.

287
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,800
If you kill him,

288
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,770
what should Godmother do?

289
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,570
Aren't you afraid that Godmother would

290
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,520
hate and resent you?

291
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,440
Can you still be together?

292
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,450
Leave.

00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,620
Why haven't I heard anything

296
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,680
from the opposite?

297
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,140
It's because of that damn person's

298
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,880
clinginess.

299
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,600
Something's wrong.

300
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,560
Something is very wrong.

301
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,740
Did he

302
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,610
find out something?

303
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,090
I'm going to pray to Buddha with devotion today.

304
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,360
No one is allowed to enter and disturb.

305
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,320
You may leave.

306
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,200
Yes.

to set an ambush on the Imperial Main Street.

313
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,480
I will personally bury him tomorrow.

your sister-in-law, I, have to do something that will wrong you...

It's my bad.

318

You can beat me or scold me in the future.

Just come into my dreams

I won't fight back or talk back.

What took you so long?

326
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,810
I was busy with the trivial things I have to deal with

327
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,440

Of course.

Such a small cup won't quench my thirst.

Why aren't you drunk yet?

I listened to you

353
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,770
and practiced my drinking. It did work.

You really did everything you can.

You'd go to such lengths

00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,370
He told me to inform you

520
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,570
that he left some men

521
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,600
in the Deer's Reed Residence,

522
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,929
and you should wait for him to return if anything.

523
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,489
Godfather,

524
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,840
the Municipal Council said

525
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,960
they are busy with work

526
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,050
and don't have time to welcome you.

527
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,570
I think they're doing this on purpose.

528
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,050
It's as expected.

529
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,409
His Majesty wants to suppress me.

530
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,560
These Imperial Capital officials

531
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,400
know how to read the room.

532
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,120
They won't be nice to me.

533
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,490
I wonder what's with His Majesty,

534
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,280
transferring you

535
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,680
out of the Imperial Capital suddenly.

536
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,410
How's the situation around Her Highness?

537
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,480
Don't worry.

538
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,850
As long as Her Highness

539
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,330
stays in Deer's Reed Residence,

540
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,280
nothing will go wrong.

541
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,610
You've deployed so many people

542
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,490
to protect Her Highness.

543
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,610
You even deployed

544
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,010
backup in the Imperial Capital.

545
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,610
What are you worried about?

546
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,480
I'm worried that

547
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,890
someone is deliberately

548
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,520
sending us out of the Capital Territory

549
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,450
with an ulterior motive.

550
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,090
The Prince of Nanyuan requested

551
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,640
to attend the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet

552
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,210
to ask for his forgiveness.

553
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,370
What do you think, Bu Qing?

554
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,450
Prince of Nanyuan has always been arrogant.

555
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,770
Now that he's willing

556
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,650
to bow down to His Majesty,

557
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,800
it shows

558
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,320
the power His Majesty holds today.

559
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,800
I think we should announce his visit to the Capital.

560
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,960
First, it'd show His Majesty's mercy.

561
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,210
Second,

562
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,410
we can also show the world

563
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,770
how someone as majestic as the Prince of Nanyuan

564
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,200
also bows down to the emperor.

565
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,160
Well said.

566
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,640
Well said.

567
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,730
During the Mid-Autumn Festival,

568
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,640
add the Prince of Nanyuan's name

569
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,120
on the list of invitees of Princes from various regions.

570
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,050
Your Majesty.

571
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,170
The Prince of Nanyuan is ambitious.

572
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,570
If he is allowed to enter the capital,

573
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,210
it might cause trouble.

574
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,250
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

575
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:31,040
The Prince of Nanyuan has lost his powers

576
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,770
and military power has been removed from him.

577
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,530
I heard that he has been

578
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,850
indulging in nothing but poetry and painting every day in West Shu.

579
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,920
This means his ambitions

580
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,360
has already been consumed.

581
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,050
A tiger without claws

582
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,370
is but a dog.

583
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,770
His Majesty is a dragon.

584
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,010
No real dragon

585
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,290
would be afraid of a dog.

586
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,650
Yuwen Liangshi is quite shrewd.

587
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,730
I'm afraid he's putting up a facade with ulterior motives.

588
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,130
Your Majesty, don't believe it so easily.

589
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,130
Since His Majesty ascended the throne,

590
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,810
the court has been under control.

591
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,130
The evil empress have been eradicated, and the corrupt officials gone.

592
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,810
Eunuch Sun, do you mean

593
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,370
His Majesty's authority

594
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:15,530
can't make the Prince of Nanyuan bow down to him?

595
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,250
Your Majesty.

596
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,210
I have made my decision.

597
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:21,920
No need for more discussion.

598
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,730
Let Prince of Nanyuan come to the capital.

599
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,320
Your Majesty is wise.

600
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,570
Yes.

601
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,250
[Clothes Shop]

602
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:32,970
No.

603
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,450
This is too plain.

604
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,290
What are these? No!

605
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,040
How about this one?

606
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,810
This is too plain. No.

607
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,530
My dear sir,

608
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,330
you've seen

609
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,450
72 sets of clothes.

610
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,330
What can make you satisfied?

611
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,290
I want something bright,

612
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,010
and shiny.

613
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,370
A girl asked me

614
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,530
to go to the theater to watch a show,

615
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,650
I have to dress well.

616
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,380
I have to outshine

617
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,410
the performers on stage.

618
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,330
I see.

619
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,010
I have some good stuff I kept at the back.

620
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:02,720
Good stuff?

621
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,250
Come to the VIP room with me.

622
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,560
It's just a little heavy.

623
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,850
Brother, what are you doing here?
Liangxu.

624
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,890
Why are you dressed so brightly?

625
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,490
And this headband.

626
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,890
It looks heavy. Take it off.

627
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,840
Brother, don't touch my crown.

628
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,450
You've lost weight.

629
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,530
I heard that a few days ago,

630
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,210
you were injured by the Imperial Guards.

631
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:49,820
I shouldn't have

632
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,960
left you in Mount Zhong

633
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,920
and let you suffer so much.

634
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,360
Brother.

635
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,170
Mount Zhong was in a dire state,

636
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,960
I stayed here willingly.

637
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,560
It's worth it for your safety.

638
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,370
You are much more important than I am.

639
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,370
Brother,

640
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,200
aren't you already summoned to the capital?

641
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,120
Why are you being so secretive

642
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,850
just to see me?

643
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,130
I came to the capital earlier in private.

644
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,410
There are so many people here.

645
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,010
What if someone finds out?

646
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,170
It's easier to hide in the bustling market.

647
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,300
My men are guarding outside.

648
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:20,840
It will be fine.

649
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,650
Liangxu, I'm here today

650
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,250
to take you away from the capital.

651
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,160
Brother.

652
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,930
I'm going against the imperial edict.

653
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,300
I've found a substitute for you

654
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:32,840
who'd stay in your stead.

655
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:33,890
It will just be a few days

656
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:34,760
and no one will find out.

657
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,240
After these few days pass,

658
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,420
the Murong family will have

659
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,240
no more say.

660
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,450
Brother, what do you mean?

661
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,000
It's time for the Murong family to return

662
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,600
the power that belongs to us.

663
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,450
Brother, are you going to rebel?

664
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,890
At the beginning of Ye,

665
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,370
if it weren't for our ancestors

666
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,600
who expanded their territory,

667
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,570
Murong's empire wouldn't exist.

668
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,370
The Murong family burned the bridges after succeeding

669
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,570
and drove us to Western Shu.

670
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,810
I have never forgiven them for that!

671
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,720
Now that I have everything prepared,

672
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,200
the capital will be in turmoil.

673
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,730
I have to send you

674
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,120
to a safe place for the time being.

675
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,360
Brother,

676
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,620
let's just stay in West Shu

677
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,740
and live a peaceful life.

678
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,400
Isn't that good?

679
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,690
What peace?

680
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,570
All these years, we may seem like a noble,

681
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,450
but we've been suppressed

682
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,610
by the Murong family.

683
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,810
I don't want peace that is temporary,

684
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,520
but a peace for you

685
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,450
and all of us from the Yuwen family

686
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,730
that will last for generations.

687
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,520
But Brother...

688
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,290
Enough, the carriage is outside.

689
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,440
Come with me now.

690
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,200
Brother, I can't go.

691
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,010
Why?

692
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,000
I...

693
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,930
Brother, I want to help you.

694
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,730
Although I'm not that useful

695
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,970
and won't be too much of help.

696
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,450
But you have just entered the capital,

697
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,160
His Majesty must still be quite wary of you.

698
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,050
With me around him,

699
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,610
he will be more at ease.

700
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,000
In that case, it will be easier

701
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,530
for you to do things in the dark.

702
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,370
No way!

703
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,250
Brother,

704
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,290
just let me stay.

705
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:13,450
We are brothers.

706
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,850
We should go through thick and thin together.

707
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,760
Besides,

708
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,730
I'm so useless.

709
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,180
It's the safest for me

710
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,210
to be just by your side.

711
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,130
You won't rest assured

712
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,720
if you leave me outside, right?

713
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,400
You're useless.

714

715
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,160
We're just watching a show,

716
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,690
why does he have to buy new clothes.

717
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:41,730
We're going to be late!

718
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,200
Is this the place?

Move!

722
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,010
It's Wan.

723
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,650
It's Princess Hede!

724
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,490
Brother, leave now.

725
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,210
Don't let her find out.

00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,570
Quick, go!

Where's my man?

Is someone trying to take you away?

Hold up, heroine.

730
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:19,720
Step aside.

731
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,610
It hurts.

What's wrong?

What are you wearing?

736
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,320
So flashy!

737
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:37,930
Don't you think

738
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,130
we match each other today?

739
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,360
What match?

Wanwan.
