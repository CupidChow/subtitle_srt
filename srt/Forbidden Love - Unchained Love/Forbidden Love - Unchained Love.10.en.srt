00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,620
Tell me.

179
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,820
What did the Prince of Nanyuan order you to do?

180
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,740
It has nothing to do with my brother.

181
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,620
I didn't come for you.

182
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,060
You tried every means

183
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,500
to sneak into Princess' carriage

184
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,980
to enter my mansion.

185
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,940
If you're not here for me,

186
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,700
are you here for the Princess?

187
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,380
How dare you!

188
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,060
How dare you

189
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,100
lay your finger on the royal family.

190
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,460
Qilang.

191
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,980
Chief.

192
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,260
Take him to the imperial prison.

193
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,700
No. Actually I...

194
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,700
I...

195
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,300
I-I like her.

196
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,020
Who?

197
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,860
I.

198
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,420
Who do you like?

199
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,660
Princess Hede.

200
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,820
Who?

201
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,300
Princess Hede.

202
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,740
Princess Hede?

203
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,820
I don't know him well.

204
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,740
Yuwen Liangxu.

205
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,660
Wanwan.

206
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,980
What are you talking about?

207
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,460
These days,

208
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,260
my head is filled with you.

209
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,300
Today, I took much efforts

210
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,700
got rid of the Zhaoding guards,

211
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,820
I just wanted to

212
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,100
see you.

213
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,100
It's all a misunderstanding.

214
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,060
Will I still get punished

215
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,460
for injuring His Highness.

216
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,340
No one dares to punish you here.

217
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,780
Your Highness.

218
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,660
I won't believe

219
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,340
what you're saying.

220
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,060
I'm telling the truth.

221
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,620
That day at the football court,

222
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,980
I was impressed

223
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,460
by your aura.

224
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,020
When you kick the ball,

225
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,740
your arms and legs,

226
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,970
are so strong!

227
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,500
This is the first time

228
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,820
I've ever seen a woman this strong

229
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,100
other my mother.

230
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,060
Strong?

231
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,580
You have no idea

232
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,730
when my mother punished

233
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,820
me and my brother,

234
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,780
she grabbed each of us

235
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,860
by either of her hands

236
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,100
and could hit us

237
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,900
for hours.

238
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,300
I didn't expect Wanwan

239
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,900
to be someone as strong too.

240
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,820
It's as expected of Western Shu.

241
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,740
Strong?

242
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:06,730
Well,

243
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,620
you even

244
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,540
returned my jade specially.

245
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,900
Actually, if you like it,

246
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,140
you can just keep it.

247
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,300
Our family heirloom

248
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,020
is supposed to be

249
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,900
for the person I love anyway.

250
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,060
I returned it for him.

251
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,900
Why did you return it for him?

252
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Why are you in his residence too?

253
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,220
Why are you looking for him?

254
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,380
Are you two close?

255
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,740
He is a eunuch.

256
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,180
He is also cunning.

257
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,540
Don't let him fool you.

258
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,220
Calm down.

259
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,100
His Highness

260
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,860
doesn't mean it that way.

261
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,300
He isn't doubting that

262
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,460
there’s something between you and Chief Xiao.

263
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,300
Shameless!

264
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,740
Your Highness.

265
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,780
I haven't finished yet.

266
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,260
-Wanwan. Wanwan.
-Your Highness.

267
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,340
Your life is more important.

268
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,100
Wanwan.

269
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,740
Your Highness.

270
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,340
Wan, I'm not finished.

271
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,300
Since there's nothing else,

272
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,460
I'm leaving.

273
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,710
[Clear Yellow River and Calm Seas]

274
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,260
Why are you looking at me?

275
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,900
I didn't mean to hit him.

276
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,060
If I knew he was His Highness,

277
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,180
I wouldn't have hit him.

278
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,460
Why did you provoke Princess?

279
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,060
His Highness talked bad about you.

280
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,860
You feel unfair for me?

281
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,180
Of course.

282
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,620
I like you the most.

283
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,300
If anyone bullies you,

284
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,380
I will teach them a lesson.

285
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,340
With your appearance,

286
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,780
and your bearing,

287
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,500
if you were an ordinary man,

288
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,900
you'd be a perfect match for the royal family.

289
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,100
You'd be a perfect match with Princess.

290
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,780
But you became an eunuch by accident.

291
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,620
Otherwise, would His Highness

292
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,340
even have a chance

293
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,580
in front of the Princess?

294
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,300
Actually,

295
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,540
it's not a big deal either.

296
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,380
There's a scholar in every line of work.

297
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,980
You are the best

298
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,340
in this line of work.

299
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,260
If there’s nothing else,

300
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,140
I'm leaving too.

301
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,660
Cao Chun'ang.

302
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,900
His Highness has been sent away?

303
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,300
Finally sent him away.

304
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,300
That guy was difficult to deal with.

305
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,460
Who is he?

306
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,579
Why is Chief Xiao so lenient towards him?

307
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,579
You don't know yet?

308
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,460
His brother is the Prince of Nanyuan.

309
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,780
He's

310
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,660
Chief Xiao's rival.

311
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,380
When Prince Rong was alive,

312
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,220
he joined forces with Queen Rong'an

313
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,180
and almost became the Prince Regent.

314
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,940
When you were locked up by the Empress,

315
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,340
Chief Xiao was after him.

316
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,100
If he didn’t rush back to save you,

317
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,700
he would have been arrested alive.

318
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,740
Anyway,

319
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,980
you should stay away from Prince Yuwen,

320
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,820
as far as possible.

321
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,140
If you can't guard against the Prince of Nanyuan,

322
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,060
or anything he does,

323
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,060
it'd be bad to get you involved.

324
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,060
No wonder he was

325
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,300
so upset at that time.

326
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,740
I did ruin his plan.

327
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,780
Princess Hede is here.

328
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,060
Brother.

329
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,900
Wanwan.

330
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,460
What makes you so happy?

331
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,740
Let me guess.

332
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,380
Is it because there are new ladies

333
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,580
entering the palace?

334
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,300
You must be happy

335
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,620
because there are so many beauties.

336
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,700
If possible,

337
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,860
I really don't want to take any concubines.

338
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,580
Because they are...

339
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,420
Because they are not

340
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,620
the person in my heart.

341
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,060
Let's not talk about this now.

342
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:36,900
Brother,

343
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,980
I just planted

344
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,820
some moutan peonies,

345
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,660
and they're finally blooming.

346
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,940
Let me show you them!

347
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,340
Moutan peonies?

348
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,540
You didn't use to like

349
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,020
these fancy flowers.

350
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,300
But instead liked

351
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,500
wild flowers?

352
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,660
Wild flowers are fun,

353
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,940
and I did plant some cotton roses.

354
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,700
Unfortunately they either died or withered.

355
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,420
Later,

356
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,500
I read in a novel

357
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,540
that the soil matters.

358
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,460
Seems like the soil in the palace

359
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,260
can only grow fancy flowers.

360
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,220
Wild flowers like cotton rose

361
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,940
can only grow freely

362
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,460
in the vast world.

363
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,900
You didn't want to take me to see flowers.

364
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,060
Tell me, what are you trying to say?

365
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,100
Have you ever thought that

366
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,220
some people may be cute,

367
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,980
just like cotton roses.

368
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,300
But they are not moutan peonies.

369
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,860
Perhaps,

370
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,660
they're not suitable for the Imperial City.

371
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,020
You saw Yinlou?

372
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,620
Did she tell you this?

373
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,300
It's just my opinion.

374
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,260
Wanwan's personal opinion?

375
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,820
Wanwan,

376
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,020
I've been your brother and sister for years.

377
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,380
It's fine that

378
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,100
others don't know me.

379
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,860
I didn't expect that even you don't know me.

380
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,900
Since young,

381
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,380
I didn't have my mother to protect me.

382
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,740
Even you, in order to protect yourself,

383
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,940
went with Empress Dowager and left me alone.

384
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,660
I

385
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,460
can only be a loser.

386
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,340
A loser who can only be useless

387
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,100
if I want to live.

388
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,860
But I can make lanterns.

389
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,580
I can only make lanterns.

390
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,420
I know

391
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,180
I'm not someone

392
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,180
to be an emperor.

393
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,140
I've never thought about

394
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,620
taking the throne either.

395
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,780
I did it for her.

396
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,140
To take step by step

397
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,980
to ascend to

398
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,420
the throne that didn't belong to me.

399
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,420
You don't understand at all.

400
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,780
You don't understand the Imperial City.

401
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,250
The Imperial City is too dark.

402
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,340
It's so dark that there is no light.

403
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,300
And she...

404
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,300
she is

405
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,020
the light in my heart.

406
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,780
I don't want much at all.

407
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,700
I just hope

408
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,020
she can light a lamp

409
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,100
for me every night.

410
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,220
Am I wrong?

411
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:33,970
Your Majesty.

412
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,340
You're not wrong.

413
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,100
You are the ruler of the world.

414
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,460
Her Highness is anything

415
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,180
His Majesty wants

416
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,900
her to be.

417
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,140
No one can judge whether His Majesty

418
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,900
is right or wrong

419
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,180
nor does anyone dares to judge you.

420
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,340
No one dares to judge me.

421
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,220
You are

422
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,580
just coaxing me.

423
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,180
Yes.

424
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,660
if you want me to be the emperor,

425
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,340
I'll be the emperor.

426
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,620
If you want me to endure the ridicule of the ministers,

427
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,660
I will.

428
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,900
You want me to select concubines,

429
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,300
I did it too.

430
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,340
I did whatever you want me to do.

431
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,140
So,

432
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,460
what else do you want from me?

433
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,980
Your Majesty.

434
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,420
You think too much.

435
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,540
No one is forcing you.

436
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,660
Princess,

437
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,260
tell His Majesty

438
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,420
that you will help him

439
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,340
send Her Highness into the palace.

440
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,900
I promise you.

441
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,580
Eunuch Sun,

442
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,780
Madam Chen has agreed

443
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,380
to what you ordered.

444
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,740
Then send Madam Chen

445
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,780
to Chief Xiao's residence.

446
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,460
But His Majesty hasn’t issued the decree.

447
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,940
If you act on your own,

448
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,140
will His Majesty be upset?

449
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,420
There's no need for His Majesty

450
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,620
to care about such a trivial matter.

451
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,460
As long as Consort Dowager Duan

452
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,140
can learn to be intelligent and elegant as soon as possible,

453
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,620
His Majesty will be happy.

454
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,680
[Xiao Residence]

455
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:34,860
Chief Xiao.

456
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,180
Our men have been arranged

457
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:36,980
to infiltrate

458
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,460
the Secret Service from Western Shu

459
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,260
we've found.

460
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,980
Everyone inside

461
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,700
will be under our control.

462
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,460
What should we do next?

463
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,380
Please send your orders.

464
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,580
Let's apprehend them.

465
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,180
I'll go there myself.

466
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,500
Yes.

467
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,140
Cao Chun'ang,

468
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,300
stay here.

469
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,580
If anything happens–

470
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,380
Don't worry.

471
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,780
You're only going to be away for a while,

472
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,740
what could happen?

473
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,420
With me here,

474
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,900
nothing will go wrong here.

475
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,980
Neither will anything go wrong with Her Highness.

476
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,660
Let me see you off.

477
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,740
Madam Chen.

478
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,620
Mistress.

479
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,140
This place is really nice.

480
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,740
What do you mean nice?

481
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,180
It's not good enough.

482
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,060
I want to have

483
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,900
a bookshelf there.

484
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,060
All filled with

485
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,180
novels.

486
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,260
You need to set up a table too.

487
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,370
One is not enough.

488
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,700
Three tables.

489
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,620
One is to play Madiao,

490
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,860
the other for Paigow,

491
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,180
and the other

492
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,460
for Mahjong.

493
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,100
Are there any snacks that Tong Yun likes?

494
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,420
No problem.

495
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,770
Eat whatever you want.

496
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,500
Can we go out and have fun?

497
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,580
Yes.

498
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,540
From the east market to the west market,

499
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,900
watch operas, have tea and drink wine,

500
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,660
we can go wherever we want.

501
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,820
Just ask Chief Xiao to take us there.

502
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,740
From now on,

503
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,900
we will only have good days.

504
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,380
Tong Yun,

505
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,020
don't you think that bed

506
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,060
is very near

507
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,540
the door?

508
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,100
Your Highness.

509
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:16,900
Cao Chun'ang.

510
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,460
Is Chief Xiao looking for me?

511
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:21,700
No.

512
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,740
Someone from the palace is here.

513
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,860
Cao Chun'ang.

514
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,820
What's going on?

515
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,220
This is Madam Chen.

516
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,300
She...

517
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,900
is His Majesty's birth mother,

518
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,220
Consort Jing's servant.

519
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,980
She's highly respected in the palace.

520
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,300
She's here to teach you etiquette.

521
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,700
Madam Chen has always been strict.

522
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,940
You should work harder.

523
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,700
Don't let her have anything on you

524
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,980
or you’ll suffer.

525
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,580
Where’s Chief Xiao?

526
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,060
Where is he?

527
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,660
He didn’t tell me this.

528
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,340
This is Lady Bu?

529
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,820
How dare you hide?

530
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,260
Madam Chen.

531
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:35,820
Madam Chen.

532
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,860
It's a misunderstanding.

533
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,380
That's all for today.

534
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,500
Clean this place up.

535
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,780
Don’t alert other strongholds.

536
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:15,900
Chief Xiao,

537
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,100
where are you going in such a hurry?

538
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,060
Home.

539
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,140
Godfather.

540
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,140
Something went wrong in the residence.

541
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,620
What is it?

542
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,860
After you left,

543
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,700
Madam Chen brought

544
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,500
a group of senior maids here.

545
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,220
I thought

546
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,140
it has your approval,

547
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,060
so I let them in.

548
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,180
But then I thought something's wrong,

549
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,180
since you would've told me,

550
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,740
so I sent you a letter.

551
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,810
Chief Xiao, Princess wants to see you.

552
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:50,330
[Imperial Garden]

553
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,970
Greetings, Princess Hede.

554
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,700
I'm sorry. I can't do anything

555
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,380
for what I promised you.

556
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,340
Maybe my brother

557
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,530
is too soft-hearted,

558
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,620
now that he's suddenly became an emperor,

559
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,660
it's so unreal.

560
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,500
I just realized that

561
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,860
he's not just

562
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,060
my brother anymore.

563
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,500
He is the king.

564
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,380
You and I are subjects.

565
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,620
If he's determined to do something,

566
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,740
even if we are reluctant to do it,

567
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,420
we can't do anything about it.

568
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,100
Even if you can't,

569
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,170
you don't have to rush

570
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,660
to set strict and complicated rules

571
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,100
on Her Highness.

572
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,540
No matter what,

573
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,100
I must thank you, Princess.

574
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,100
I will

575
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,460
visit the Imperial Court some day.

576
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,100
That doesn't sound like

577
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,380
something you'd say.

578
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,540
Three years ago,

579
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,180
Queen Rong'an bullied me as my mother died young,

580
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,460
and wanted to force me to marry into a political marriage.

581
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,820
You guided me on

582
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,940
how to please Empress Dowager

583
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,540
and win her favor.

584
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,980
From then on,

585
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,220
I got the protection from Empress Dowager

586
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,740
and went to Tan Xi Temple with her to pray.

587
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,140
That's how we got rid of the Queen.

588
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,660
You said

589
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,700
the flowers within the palace wall

590
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,820
has their own destiny.

591
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,020
No branches are allowed.

592
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,060
If you want to live,

593
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,060
you have to trim yourself

594
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,940
to be what the higher-ups would like.

595
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,330
This is the rule of staying in the Imperial City.

596
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,660
This is how you and I

597
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,100
lived till now.

598
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,210
If Yinlou wants to live,

599
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,780
she has to do the same.

600
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,980
I just can't bear it.

601
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,380
We are all trapped in the Imperial City.

602
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,980
What can you do

603
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,820
even if you hate to see it?

604
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,820
Meal etiquette

605
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,540
exists in the

606
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,180
the dining room.

607
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,980
You must learn well

608
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,100
about meal etiquettes.

609
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,940
As the saying goes, you have to ensure

610
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,450
your hands are clean when eating.

611
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,420
Don't eat in big mouthfuls, don't put food back down.

612
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,220
Don't drink too much, don't chew loudly.

613
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,380
Don't chew on bones.

614
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,180
This means, when you eat with someone,

615
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,380
you can't just eat.

616
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:30,980
Mistress.

617
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,620
If you can only see and not eat,

618
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,500
isn't it a disrespect to food?

619
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,600
The food that's about to be eaten can't be put back into the bowl.

620
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,380
Then why is he disrespecting me?

621
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,620
Who is?

622
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,300
You can't make a sound when chewing.

623
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,700
Xiao Duo. I treat him as a friend,

624
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,940
what does he take me for?

625
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,260
Fine.

626
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,180
Meal etiquette...

627
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,080
I'll show him...

628
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,580
Is very important.

629
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,220
How I can screw everything up.

630
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,340
As long as the food is displayed,

631
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,260
the main food is on the left,

632
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,140
the wine container is on the right.

633
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,580
The dessert is on the left,

634
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,580
the fruits on the right.

635
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,500
Dishes with bones is on the left,

636
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,860
and meat that has been sliced are on the right.

637
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,740
Mistress,

638
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,220
didn't you say you're going to screw it up?

639
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,360
Dried food...

640
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,620
Just wait.

641
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,620
should be on the left side.

642
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,740
Can I try some?

643
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,020
Sure.

644
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,260
Dry food is on the left.

645
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,340
And soup is on the right.

646
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,780
On the right?

647
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,060
If I don't study hard,

648
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,900
will I implicate Xiao Duo?

649
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,820
At this point,

650
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,980
I don't need to worry about him.

651
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,060
Whatever.

652
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,860
Put the barbecue on the left.

653
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,980
Put the seasoning on one side.

654
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,940
Wine and soup

655
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,700
shouldn't be in the same direction.

656
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,580
The mouth of the wine pot

657
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,420
points to the eaters.

658
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,820
When serving,

659
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,940
hold the tray with your left hand

660
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,660
and the edge with your right.

661
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,620
Didn't you say you'd just have a bite?

662
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,140
I couldn't help but have some more.

663
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,740
How about...

664
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,340
you have some too?

665
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,580
A rotten wood can't be carved.

666
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:46,940
Godfather,

667
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,580
don't blame yourself too much.

668
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,860
You should persuade Her Highness.

669
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,300
This is for her own good.

670
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,100
Madam Chen, you...

671
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,460
Stop chasing me!

672
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,380
Don't move.

673
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,220
It's not my fault.

674
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,660
You...

675
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,900
Stop hitting me.

676
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,180
Or you'll fall too.

677
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:07,840
Stop running.

678
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,260
It's not my fault.

679
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,620
-Stop chasing.
-Stop!

680
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,300
Chief Xiao, you’re finally here.

681
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,739
Don’t go, Madam Chen.

682
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,900
Madam Chen. Madam Chen.

683
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,500
What did Chief Xiao mean

684
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,100
just now?

685
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,100
Is he blaming me

686
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,380
for making Lady Bu suffer.

687
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,260
Don’t say that.

688
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,540
Lady Bu is gifted.

689
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,139
I really can't teach her.

690
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,139
I will leave something this important

691
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,260
to Chief Xiao.

692
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,179
I have let His Majesty down,

693
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:47,980
I'm going back to the palace now

694
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,659
to ask His Majesty for forgiveness.

695
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,380
Madam Chen.

696
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,020
Calm down.

697
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,500
Be careful.

698
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,980
Be gentle.

699
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,540
I asked the doctor

700
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,900
to prescribe some ointment for bruises.

701
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:26,900
Is it serious?

702
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:27,980
Let me see.

703
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,340
How dare you ask?

704
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,380
If it weren't for you,

705
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,700
would I have fallen?

706
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,620
Never mind.

707
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,900
I'll use the ointment.

708
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,220
Be on your way.

709
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,460
I've sent Madam Chen away.

710
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,900
Don't be angry.

711
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,300
You tried so hard to invite her here,

712
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,860
but I pissed her off.

713
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,860
You're not angry,

714
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,100
why should I be angry?

715
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,140
-You think it's me?
-Godfather.

716
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,100
Godfather!

717
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,460
Godfather.

718
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,020
His Majesty is here.

719
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,580
His Majesty looks unhappy.

720
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,940
I'm afraid Madam Chen complained.

721
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,540
You won't be implicated, will you?

722
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:04,820
Go back to your room.

723
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,580
Mistress.

724
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,660
His Majesty

725
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,900
is going to punish you.

726
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,660
What should we do now?

727
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,260
They all want me to listen to them.

728
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,780
Fine, I'll do as they say.

729
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,980
Greetings, Your Majesty.

730
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,180
Rise.

731
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,740
Your Majesty.

732
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,180
Your Majesty.

733
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:50,780
There are many rules in the palace.

734
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,220
When Her Highness first entered the palace,

735
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,740
the late Emperor was already sick.

736
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,980
The General Household Service didn't have the resources,

737
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,620
and Her Highness has little to no restrictions normally.

738
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,820
Now, for her to learn

739
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,620
in a short time,

740
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,260
it's normal that she can't master it.

741
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,490
I didn't tell Madam Chen

742
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,330
beforehand.

743
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,540
It’s my fault.

744
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
You misunderstood.

745
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,340
I’m not here to punish you.

746
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,740
I just knew

747
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,700
about this.

748
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,460
I took the liberty

749
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,100
to send Madam Chen here

750
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,020
and disturbed the peace in the residence.

751
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,410
Please forgive me.

752
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,420
This is nothing, Eunuch Sun.

753
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,180
I have no issues,

754
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,500
but Madam Chen's teachings are strict.

755
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,740
Her Highness must have suffered a lot.

756
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,580
She suffered?

757
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,900
How is she now?

758
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,260
I have to visit her.

759
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,540
Greetings, Your Majesty.

760
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,020
I didn't know Your Majesty was here.

761
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,180
Sorry for my negligence.

762
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,180
No, I came too suddenly.

763
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,020
Here.

764
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,300
I heard that

765
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,260
Madam Chen made you suffer.

766
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,940
I didn't send her here.

767
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,820
Are you mad at me?

768
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,140
His Majesty ordered Chief Xiao

769
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,500
to bring me here,

770
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,340
for me to

771
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,380
learn how to control myself,

772
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,020
and behave myself.

773
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,980
No matter who sent Madam Chen,

774
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,380
it's my duty.

775
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,220
There's no such thing as suffering.

776
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,020
It's already noon.

777
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,460
Would Your Majesty

778
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,700
like to have a meal with me in the Flower Garden?

779
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,260
Your Majesty.

780
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,740
What a coincidence,

781
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,540
Consort Dowager Duan is learning how to place dishes.

782
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:02,820
She can place them

783
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,780
for His Majesty.

784
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,340
Her Highness is a beginner,

785
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,500
I'm afraid she might make mistakes

786
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,620
and encumber Your Majesty.

787
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,700
It doesn't matter.

788
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,620
I don't care about the etiquette.

789
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,090
Yinlou,

790
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,460
would you

791
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,260
serve the dishes for me?

792
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

793
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,180
Your Majesty.

794
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,340
Wasn't she just

795
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,540
running up and down just now.

796
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,140
How did she become a different person so quickly.

797
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,420
She's pretending.

798
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,780
Her Highness is from a noble family after all.

799
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,100
Even if she's an illegitimate daughter,

800
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,580
she wouldn't be so rude and ignorant.

801
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,300
Yinlou.

802
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,140
Would've been better

803
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,860
if she's actually rude.

804
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,740
Serve the dishes.

805
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,180
Yinlou.

806
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,060
We don't have to

807
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,740
be so uptight.

808
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,700
Let's have the meal together.

809
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,820
Thank you, Your Majesty.

810
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,740
Madam Chen taught me,

811
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,100
it's against dignity

812
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,260
to eat with you.

813
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,300
This can't be overstepped.

814
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,500
Yinlou shall

815
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,100
just serve His Majesty.

816
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,900
I allow you to eat with me,

817
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,460
then that's not overstepping anymore.

818
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,820
It seems His Majesty doesn't like soup.

819
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,220
Let's change to other dishes.

820
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,860
Serve.

821
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,460
This soup

822
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,780
looks delicious.

823
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,810
You have a taste first.

824
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:44,860
Here.

825
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,740
Godfather.

826
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

827
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,460
Madam Chen has taught me,

828
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,860
that our hands should be clean when we eat.

829
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,260
My hands are sweaty,

830
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,500
it's impolite

831
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,500
for me to eat with you.

832
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:09,900
Serve the dishes.

833
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,780
Let's go.

834
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,020
Back to the palace.

835
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:02,820
[Xiao’s Mansion]

836
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,660
Chief Xiao, get up.

837
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,260
You have

838
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,220
always been sharp.

839
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,260
I admire you.

840
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,140
But there's something

841
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,180
I would like to

842
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,860
to remind you.

843
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:34,490
[Xiao's Residence]

844
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,300
Her Highness

845
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,540
is a lot more proper now.

846
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,580
His Majesty is of course happy.

847
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,980
It's just that between men and women,

848
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,500
sometimes, it shouldn't be this uptight.

849
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,380
What do you mean?

850
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,140
I'll show you the way.

851
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,860

852
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,740
The best brothel in the capital.
