00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,210
the places where the victims were found dead

174
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,160
are all near Deer's Reed Residence.

175
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,040
I'm afraid the murderer is targeting the royal family.

176
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,090
Please allow me to investigate thoroughly.

177
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,760
Didn't I say previously that

178
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,970
all of Zhaoding Bureau's criminal cases

179
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,250
should be transferred to the Court of Judicial Review to take care of?

180
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,880
Chief Xiao, you don't need to worry about this.

181
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,480
Your humble subject greets Your Majesty.

182
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,320
Please rise, Lord Bu.

183
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,360
You came at the right time.

184
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,610
Chief Xiao just told me

185
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,890
about the fox demon case.

186
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,250
This case has great implications.

187
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,450
You have to solve the case as soon as possible

188
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,530
or else even...

189
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,410
even Chief Xiao

190
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,680
will end up worrying about it too.

191
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,970
I will do my best

192
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,080
to put the people's hearts at ease.

193
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,090
Very well.

194
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,970
Earlier Chief Xiao said that

195
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,690
the culprit is targeting the royal family.

196
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,490
What are your thoughts on this?

197
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,560
Chief Xiao is used to

198
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,720
dealing with matters in the inner court

199
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,490
and might be thinking too much

200
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,850
into these trivial cases

201
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,850
happening outside the palace.

202
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,200
In my opinion,

203
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,850
this is just a trivial

204
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,370
murder case motivated by greed.

205
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,090
Saying that it's targeted at the royal family

206
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,600
is rather ridiculous.

207
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,450
But these murders

208
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,080
all coincidentally happened

209
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,890
near Deer's Reed Residence.

210
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,880
I've sent people to investigate along the way.

211
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,840
I believe the case will be solved very soon.

212
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,600
Good.

213
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,010
Chief Xiao, you've been working hard.

214
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,730
I heard that before the court meeting today,

215
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,050
you personally went to the crime scene

216
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,570
to check once more.

217
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,650
In that case,

218
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,930
could I request for you

219
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,250
to do a little more work?

220
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,650
Could you write up the details of the case,

221
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,610
summarize them into a report,

222
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,800
and submit it to the Court of Judicial Review today?

223
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,810
Certainly, Lord Bu.

224
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,610
Zhaoding Bureau will definitely

225
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,770
submit it in to the Court of Judicial Review within today.

226
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,920
Very well.

227
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,330
Oh look at me,

228
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,400
I'm ordering you around

229
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,200
and also taking the Bureau's rights to investigate.

230
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,960
Will you hold it against me?

231
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,640
But this is all

232
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,200
His Majesty's order.

233
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,730
Both of us

234
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,610
can only execute his orders.

235
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,040
You think too much, Lord Bu.

236
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,960
You and I are both the Emperor's subjects.

237
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,760
It's our duty to obey our master's orders.

238
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,520
Besides,

239
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,120
the Court of Judicial Review should be the one

240
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,600
dealing with these criminal cases in the first place.

241
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,890
It's just that when Great Ye was founded,

242
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,010
the Court of Judicial Review's Chief Minister then was a good-for-nothing.

243
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,600
That's why it was gradually handed over to Zhaoding Bureau.

244
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,880
It's only natural to return the rights back now.

245
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,400
After all, Lord Bu is not

246
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,730
such a useless person.

247
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,170
Am I right?

248
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,370
I still have a case to attend to.

249
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,050
I'll make a move first.

250
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,410
Take care, Lord Bu.

251
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,000
We gave him a stage

252
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,480
and he really took on the role.

253
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,370
Godfather.

254
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,920
Since His Majesty

255
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,200
doesn't want us to get involved,

256
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,640
then let's not.

257
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,880
Who cares.

258
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,900
Let His Majesty

259
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,330
favor the Court of Judicial Review.

260
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,850
Let's see when Bu Yulu will solve the case.

261
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,570
This case

262
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,560
is probably not as simple as it appears.

263
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,850
Chief.

264
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,810
Chief,

265
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,560
we have some new information

266
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,130
from the people we sent to Changqing Palace.

267
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,730
Mistress ordered you

268
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,570
to hide this box

269
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,920
in Consort Duan's room.

270
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:31,960
Take it.

271
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:32,970
Quickly.

272
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,410
You scared me.

273
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,170
After thinking about it,

274
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,520
I still feel like something is off.

275
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,080
You've become so quiet after coming back this time.

276
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,480
Is there something up?

277
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,650
Is there any secret

278
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,130
between you and Cao Chun'ang?

279
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,160
I heard that

280
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,560
he went to the Dyeing Workshop every day to look after you.

281
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,080
There's nothing of that sort.

282
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,560
I'm going back to work.

283
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,240
Tongyun,

284
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,090
if you have any troubles,

285
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,970
just tell me.

286
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,079
I'll help you.

287
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,480
We can chat any time too.

288
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,569
Mistress.

289
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:19,730
Actually...

290
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,200
What?

291
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,570
Nothing much.

292
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:53,220
[Deer's Reed Residence]

293
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,010
The Court of Judicial Review is under orders to investigate.

294
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:16,490
[Heart Pure as Snow]

295
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,840
Don't worry, Your Highness.

296
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,650
We're just doing a routine inspection.

297
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,530
It's just a formality.

298
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,090
I won't let these vulgar people

299
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,440
disturb you.

300
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,080
Father, you're on official business.

301
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,330
You can investigate as you like.

302
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,450
Okay.

303
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,640
My lord.

304
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,360
Under Her Highness' bed, we found...

305
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,730
We found...

306
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,410
How can you be so ill-mannered in front of Her Highness?

307
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,000
Open it and see what's inside.

308
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,930
Witchcraft?

309
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,690
This paper talisman

310
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,740
has all the names of the deceased victims

311
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,880
and their dates of birth written on it.

312
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,960
At this point,

313
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,840
what else do you have to say?

314
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,520
It has nothing to do with me.

315
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,610
I don't know

316
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,090
why that thing was in my room.

317
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,770
You're still trying to make excuses.

318
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,280
Come on, bring her in here.

319
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,730
I have verified that

320
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,410
she was the one who hid the paper talisman.

321
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,370
In order to seduce His Majesty,

322
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,810
and monopolize his favor,

323
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,970
you even kept a fox demon

324
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,410
and killed people.

325
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,600
Keeping a fox demon?

326
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,090
How could this be?

327
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,080
Yinlou,

328
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,730
how could you be so careless?

329
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,770
This case is a big one.

330
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,160
The entire Imperial City is watching.

331
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,850
His Majesty asked me to investigate this case.

332
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,400
But I didn't expect that

333
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,210
I'd end up investigating

334
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,650
my own daughter.

335
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,220
You're driving me

336
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,920
into a corner.

337
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,160
Come on!

338
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,240
Take the criminals away.

339
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,250
Yes.

340
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,730
I'll see who dares!

341
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,010
I apologize for being late.

342
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,490
With me around,

343
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,290
I won’t let Your Highness be wronged.

344
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,010
Chief Xiao,

345
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,720
you are obstructing my investigation.

346
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,690
Lord Bu, there's no problem with

347
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,780
you wanting to

348
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,640
act all impartial.

349
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,410
It's just that the prison

350
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,290
n the Court of Judicial Review

351
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,160
has all sorts of criminals in there.

352
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,930
You want Her Highness to go to

353
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,210
such a filthy place and be humiliated?

354
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,850
I'm afraid no one in the Court of Judicial Review

355
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,650
can take responsibility for that.

356
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,570
The Court of Judicial Review

357
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,690
is in charge of this case.

358
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,210
Who are you

359
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,480
to tell me what to do here?

360
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,280
I'm doing this for your sake, Lord Bu.

361
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,850
His Majesty

362
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,930
personally ordered for this case to be investigated.

363
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,760
Since Consort Duan is an imperial concubine,

364
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,130
this is a serious matter.

365
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,080
One careless move will incur the rage of the emperor.

366
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,610
If His Majesty asks about it,

367
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,000
how will you answer to it, Lord Bu?

368
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,010
So what do you think we should do?

369
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,800
In my opinion,

370
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,840
you should send Her Highness

371
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,210
to Zhaoding Bureau's prison.

372
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,560
The royal family is in charge of that place.

373
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,570
It is the most appropriate for Her Highness to be sent there.

374
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,360
I'll inform His Majesty.

375
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,410
If anything happens,

376
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,000
you don’t have to take any responsibility.

377
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,520
Fine.

378
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,200
The imperial prison will do.

379
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,490
Send Her Highness to the imperial prison for a quick visit.

380
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,360
I'll take care of the rest.

381
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,960
Lord Bu,

382
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,360
I’ll make a move first.

383
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,960
Tongyun, are you alright?

384
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,570
How could it be witchcraft?

385
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,560
Didn’t they say

386
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,370
they wouldn't harm my mistress' life?

387
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,090
Will my mistress be executed?

388
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,240
Cao Chun'ang,

389
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,020
go tell Chief Xiao now.

390
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,620
Tell him that my mistress didn't keep a fox demon.

391
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,400
She didn't kill anyone.

392
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,960
I was wrong. I was at fault.

393
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,770
Tong- Tongyun.

394
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,770
Let me finish.

395
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,730
Don’t be afraid.

396
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,120
With Chief Xiao around,

397
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,440
nothing will happen to Godmother.

398
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,170
You're right. With Chief Xiao around,

399
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,520
nothing will happen to Mistress.

400
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,370
Listen up carefully.

401
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,210
We must teach Consort Duan a good lesson today.

402
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,200
Yes.

403
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,980
What are they going to do to my mistress?

404
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,090
Tongyun, calm down.

405
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,090
Actually Her Highness...

406
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,970
Mistress!

407
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,890
Don't hurt my mistress!

408
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,170
You're putting all your weight on me.

409
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,850
Mistress, are you alright?

410
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,450
Your Highness, do you still want to play with this sword?

411
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,690
Why don't...you leave first?

412
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,530
Okay, let's go.

413
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,280
Mistress, I'm sorry.

414
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,730
I was the one who put you in this situation.

415
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,160
It was Queen Rong'an.

416
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,680
She forced me to frame you.

417
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,600
My family is in her hands.

418
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,730
I-

419
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,080
I know.

420
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,120
You know?

421
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,120
You're coming through a secret passageway.

422
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,450
Can you not be so bold?

423
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,290
No.

424
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,520
My men sent a message.

425
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,900
Rong'an secretly kidnapped

426
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,600
Tongyun's family.

427
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,560
She's probably going to force Tongyun to do it.

428
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,810
She already did it.

429
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,210
What do you think?

430
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,920
What about you?

431
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,840
Strike while the iron is hot.

432
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,650
And play along.

433
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,130
You saw through me so easily?

434
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,370
Don't be discouraged.

435
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,320
You didn't hide it too badly actually.

436
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,080
It's just that everything is written all over your face.

437
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,800
By the way,

438
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,240
don’t worry about your family.

439
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,730
Chief Xiao has already sent someone

440
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,000
to rescue your family.

441
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,130
Don't cry.

442
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,400
Mistress, I’m sorry.

443
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,930
It’s my fault.

444
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,000
Please punish me.

445
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,170
Why are you on your knees?

446
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,760
At first,

447
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,400
I was pretty mad at you.

448
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,850
There's nothing wrong with

449
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,000
wanting to protect your family.

450
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,210
But am I not

451
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:37,930
your family too?

452
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,690
Such a serious thing happened,

453
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,340
and you didn't even

454
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,200
think to discuss it with me?

455
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,330
You should be punished.

456
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,340
I've thought long and hard about

457
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:45,970
what harsh methods of punishment

458
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,120
I should use on you.

459
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,890
I'll confiscate your snacks.

460
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,170
I'll confiscate your pocket money.

461
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,850
And you're not allowed to eat supper.

462
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,210
But earlier,

463
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,300
I saw you

464
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,760
running here with tears brimming,

465
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,570
and even putting your life on the line to try and protect me.

466
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,960
That made my anger

467
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,200
subside completely.

468
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:13,980
But you nearly suffocated me to death

469
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,770
by squeezing me so tightly.

470
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,320
That made me quite annoyed.

471
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,060
Mistress, I'm sorry.

472
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,860
I was wrong.

473
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,890
It was my fault.

474
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,900
If it weren't for me,

475
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,080
you wouldn't be here squatting in prison.

476
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,530
Actually, squatting here in prison isn't too...

477
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,370
Your Highness.

478
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,520
Look.

479
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,240
Fresh fruits and snacks.

480
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,490
Sorry for the delay.

481
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,080
Please don't blame me.

482
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,810
The two guys with the swords earlier

483
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,040
are still waiting outside.

484
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,010
How about I call them in

485
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,400
and perform something for you again?

486
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,720
If it's not to your liking that's fine too.

487
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,560
How about

488
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,610
[Show List]

489
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,610
we call in someone to sing?

490
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,400
Or maybe lion dance?

491
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,330
By the way,

492
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,880
I heard that

493
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,160
a new opera theater

494
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,170
opened in the capital.

495
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,760
They're pretty good apparently.

496
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,130
Have a look and see which show you like.

497
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,770
You're supposed to be in prison now right?

498
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,010
Yes.

499
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,290
Are you sure it's appropriate to be

500
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,040
doing this in prison?

501
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,250
Enough.

502
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,370
Stop staying here.

503
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,160
Go back to your room.

504
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,640
There's someone still waiting for you.

505
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,720
I'll get going then.

506
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,140
You're back from

507
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,210
Godmother's so soon?

508
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,050
I thought

509
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,170
you'd have a bit more fun there.

510
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,050
You know everything?

511
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,090
Yes.

512
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,930
You ran away

513
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,810
before I could tell you.

514
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,760
Then why are you still here?

515
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,130
Waiting for you so we can eat together.

516
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,170
Here.

517
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,320
Have a seat.

518
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,240
You must be starving after all that happened today.

519
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,490
Even I'm hungry.

520
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,200
Here, eat it while it's still warm.

521
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,730
Even after I did this kind of thing,

522
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,050
My mistress isn't mad at me.

523
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,330
You're not mad at me either?

524
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,610
I am.

525
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,090
I was so angry.

526
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,730
I'm mad at you because

527
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,690
you didn't even tell me

528
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,970
after all this happened to you.

529
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,040
Empress Rong'an

530
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,000
threatened you with your family's lives

531
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,330
to frame Her Highness.

532
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:49,970
You must have felt

533
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,090
very helpless at that time.

534
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,480
It..

535
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,490
must have felt terrible for you.

536
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,610
If something like that happened to me,

537
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,050
I wouldn't have known what to do either.

538
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,320
It's all my fault.

539
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,400
I should have figured out that

540
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,680
something was up with you earlier.

541
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,360
Come on, eat.

542
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,700
Do I come across as

543
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,610
very untrustworthy to you?

544
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,090
I know, I'm not like Godfather.

545
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,770
I'm not as capable as him.

546
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,370
I entered the palace when I was very young.

547
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,800
I didn't study much.

548
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,480
So I don't really know much.

549
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,600
Indeed, I don't seem very reliable.

550
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,570
It's not like that.

551
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,880
You don't have to comfort me.

552
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,600
I know,

553
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,160
I'm a nobody.

554
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,210
But at least,

555
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,850
we are still good friends.

556
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,280
If you encounter any difficulties in the future,

557
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,490
don't keep it to yourself.

558
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,280
Talk to me more.

559
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,370
Seeing you

560
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,170
make yourself feel terrible,

561
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,160
makes me feel terrible too.

562
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,840
This hairpin you gave me last time...

563
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,370
I didn't mean to come across that way

564
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,400
with what I said earlier.

565
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,810
Don't feel burdened.

566
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,170
This is just my concern for you

567
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,530
as a friend.

568
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,850
You- you carry on eating first.

569
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,160
I have something on.

570
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,370
I'll head back first.

571
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,140
Cao Chun'ang,

572
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,410
listen to me finish...

573
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,440
I guess I'll tell you next time then.

574
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:09,240
[Zhaoding Bureau]

575
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,680
[The news that objects of sorcery being found at Deer's Reed Residence spread from Changqing Palace.]

576
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,730
[To the Chief]

577
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,010
Godfather,

578
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,130
haven't you

579
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,730
agreed with the Court of Judicial Review

580
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,320
to suppress the news and prevent others from knowing?

581
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,330
The news got out from Changqing Palace.

582
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,290
Then should we

583
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,560
approach some important ministers

584
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,650
and get them to shut people up?

585
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,480
There's no need.

586
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,290
Since Rong'an wants to make a big deal out of it,

587
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,810
let's help her

588
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,920
and make things even worse.

589
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,740
How dare they submit a petition asking me

590
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,130
to sentence my own consort to death?

591
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,600
I don't know how

592
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,130
all the officials in the court found out about

593
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,160
the whole fox demon saga in Deer's Reed Residence.

594
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,480
Lord Bu,

595
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,860
I order you to investigate this case thoroughly.

596
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,800
How is the investigation going?

597
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,120
Is there any evidence to prove Consort Duan's innocence?

598
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,240
Your Majesty,

599
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,320
I'm incompetent.

600
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,450
Incompetent, incompetent!

601
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,730
I entrusted you with this

602
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,170
so that you could deal with Xiao Duo.

603
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:31,760
Good on you!

604
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,370
Now you're even going to lose

605
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,210
your own daughter.

606
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,930
Your Majesty,

607
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,570
I originally wanted to

608
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,130
deal with the Deer's Reed Residence case

609
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,170
in a discreet manner.

610
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,500
But Chief Xiao

611
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,760
pressured me to send Consort Duan

612
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,840
into the imperial prison.

613
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,210
I'm afraid that was what

614
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,240
caused a stir,

615
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,840
which led to the news leaking out.

616
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,760
In my opinion,

617
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,810
Chief Xiao wants to take over

618
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,490
this case.

619
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,450
Xiao Duo doesn't want this case.

620
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,290
He wants to take back the investigation rights

621
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,440
that I took away from him.

622
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,440
Your Majesty.

623
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,280
Consort Duan is my own daughter.

624
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,480
My heart aches for her

625
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,690
even more than Your Majesty.

626
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:20,360
People say I'm taking advantage of her status

627
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,639
and relying on my daughter to curry favor.

628
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:25,210
But I only have

629
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,000
utmost sincerity towards Your Majesty.

630
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,770
I've already done my best

631
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,719
for Consort Duan.

632
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,730
My heart aches terribly today.

633
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,679
I'm ashamed both as a subject,

634
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,409
and as a father.

635
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,040
I deplore

636
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,719
Your Majesty to please punish me.

637
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,000
Punish you?

638
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,010
How can I punish you? Sentence you to death?

639
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:51,929
What's the use?

640
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,450
Forget it. Get up.

641
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,410
Queen Rong'an seeks an audience.

642
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,810
Greetings, Your Majesty.

643
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,770
What brings you here, imperial sister-in-law?

644
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,200
I heard that over a hundred court officials

645
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,360
submitted a joint petition

646
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,720
asking Your Majesty to sentence that demonic concubine to death,

647
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,200
in order to appease the people's resentment.

648
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,210
Rong'an.

649
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,770
Me being courteous to you before

650
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:26,940
doesn't mean I'll let you

651
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,530
pressure me into killing my own concubine.

652
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,440
What do you mean by this, Your Majesty?

653
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,570
Rong'an is doing this for the country.

654
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,050
Great Ye has always banned witchcraft.

655
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,120
That demonic concubine Bu Yinlou used evil magic

656
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,200
to lead the ruler astray

657
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,850
and harm the people.

658
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,120
She should be executed for her crimes.

659
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,650
The case has not been concluded yet.

660
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,280
How dare you talk nonsense here?

661
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,250
The Court of Judicial Review has already

662
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,360
found evidence of it in Deer's Reed Residence.

663
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,770
All evidence clearly points to her.

664
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,050
There is no doubt about it.

665
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,530
I deplore Your Majesty to issue a decree

666
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,080
to execute the demonic concubine.

667
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,210
How dare you

668
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,840
threaten me?

669
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,850
I dare not.

670
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,930
But the Empress Dowager

671
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,120
is extremely worried about Your Majesty.

672
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,000
If Shangqiong Palace doesn't issue the decree soon,

673
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,810
the Empress Dowager will start drafting

674
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,810
the decree to execute her.

675
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,120
Who else can take over this case?

676
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,960
Who else can take over this case?

677
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,720
Who else?

678
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,240
Right now,

679
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,850
I can't think of a suitable candidate.

680
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,700
Your Majesty, you...

681
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,400
Please allow me to take over this case.

682
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,170
Chief Xiao,

683
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,000
say it again for me.

684
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,250
I'm willing to share some of Your Majesty's worries

685
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,850
and take over the case from Lord Bu to thoroughly investigate.

686
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,130
But as you can see,

687
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,730
everyone in the court

688
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:55,890
including my imperial sister-in-law,

689
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,720
are kicking up a fuss about executing Consort Duan.

690
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,410
I can't buy much time for you.

691
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,300
If I can't solve the case

692
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,740
within three days,

693
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,250
you may behead me.

694
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,800
Fine.

695
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,650
I'll give you three days.

696
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,960
Zhaoding Bureau shall fully take over the case of the fox demon.

697
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,130
I thank your benevolence, Your Majesty.

698
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,010
Let's head out of the palace to the prison in the Court of Judicial Review.

699
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,890
Your Highness.

700
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,600
Consort Duan isn't in the Court of Judicial Review's prison.

701
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,930
Then where could she be?

702
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,360
I heard that after what happened at Deer's Reed Residence,

703
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,250
Chief Xiao insisted on sending Consort Duan

704
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,480
to the imperial prison.

705
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,130
Chief Xiao really knows how to protect people.

706
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,850
He's protecting her so well.

707
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,200
Your Highness.

708
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,050
The people we sent to Tongyun's hometown

709
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,730
are uncontactable too.

710
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,120
I'm afraid something is amiss.

711
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,360
It seems that

712
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,840
I was deceived.

713
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,640
Hurry and find someone to clean things up

714
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:15,800
to prevent Xiao Duo

715
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,280
from finding something to use against us.

716
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,400
Yes.

717
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,200
We found this type of rouge

718
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,120
in every victim's nose.

719
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,850
The rouge contains thorn apple.

720
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,090
Thorn apple?

721
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,610
Thorn apple causes people to have illusions.

722
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,810
If you inhale too much, it may lead to death.

723
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,040
Seems like they're just using sorcery as a cover.

724
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,960
There's no fox demon at all.

725
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,880
The thing that's killing people

726
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,760
is actually this poisonous rouge.

727
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,930
Search every single rouge shop in the capital.

728
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:55,690
Yes.

729

[Imperial City, Qiongshui Pavilion]

730
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,570
We searched every place

731
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,840
in the capital that is involved in

732
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,410
selling rouge.

733
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,930
We're only left with Qiongshui Pavilion here.

734
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:18,680
Search!

735

[Qiongshui Pavilion]

736
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:29,730
Search over there.

737
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,770
So many people here.

738
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:34,400
Something is going on.

739
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,450
Looks like there's no need to search.

740
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,810
All the evidence has been moved away.

741
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,680
All of the errand boys are dead in the backyard.

742
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,160
Only the owner's body

743
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,530
is yet to be found.

744
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,520
There are wheel tracks over there at the back.

745
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,760
He probably ran away.

746
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,890
Oh, you must be

747
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,400
the owner of Qiongshui Pavilion, right?

748
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,330
This way please.

749
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,170
Your Highness, our man at Qiongshui Pavilion

750
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,610
fell into the hands of Chief Xiao.

751
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,850
Seems like Xiao Duo

752
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,560
is determined to drive me into a corner.

753
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,200
But I didn't lose.

754
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,170
The rouge has been removed and destroyed.

755
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:42,890
Without any physical evidence,

756
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:43,890
he has no proof to back up his claims.

757
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,210
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

758
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,610
Yilan,

759

go get me all of Xiao Duo's

760

palace records and documents

761
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,240
from when he first entered the palace.

762
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,450
Yes.

763

[A Thousand Iridescent Clouds Gather]

764
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,680
The accomplice has already confessed

765
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,520
that it was all Queen Rong'an's doing.

766
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,640
Come with me to Changqing Palace

767
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,650
to arrest the evil queen at once.

768
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,850
Chief.

769
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,040
Chief.

770
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,210
There's someone from Changqing Palace

771
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,970
asking you to go over alone.

772
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,480
Perfect timing.

773
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,760
Your Highness.

774
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,080
We're already at this point.

775
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,640
I hope you didn't call me over

776
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,120
just to watch you do your makeup.

777
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,440
I've checked

778
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,570
the records and documents

779
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,010
since you entered the palace.

780
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,410
I found something interesting.

781
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,930
May I interest you in it?

782
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,280
You’ve been in the palace for eight years.

783
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,460
In the first two years,

784
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,930
you were working in the Wine and Food Bureau

785
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,480
as a lowly unknown eunuch.

786
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,840
Until six years ago,

787
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,170
somehow,

788
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,760
you suddenly became a completely different person.

789
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,610
You did everything you could

790
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,920
to join the Zhaoding Bureau.

791
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,360
Slowly you proved your abilities

792
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,530
and became the youngest

793
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,400
chief of Zhaoding Bureau.

794
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,860
You were the first to do this

795
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,520
since the founding of the Great Ye Empire.

796
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,400
Later I thought,

797
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,170
how could a person

798
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:44,120
change so drastically?

799
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,370
It's almost as if there were two different people.

800
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,600
So I went to check with

801
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,280
the old eunuch who brought you to the palace

802
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,960
and your old neighbors.

803
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,970
They told me

804
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,680
you have an older brother

805
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,640
who looks very similar to you.

806
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,730
But he suddenly disappeared six years ago.

807
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,050
So,

808
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,610
I thought of a story.

809
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,440
Do you want to hear it?
