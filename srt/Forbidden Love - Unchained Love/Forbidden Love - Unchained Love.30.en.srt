Prince of Nanyuan is here.

5
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,060
Greetings, Your Majesty.

6
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,860
Rise.

7
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,620
Thank you, Your Majesty.

8
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,380
I, Yuwen Liangshi,

9
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,410
would like to present a Mid-Autumn Festival gift to Your Majesty.

10
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,340
I heard that the Prince of Nanyuan

11
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,340
is good at calligraphy and martial arts,

12
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,740
and can use a sword to do calligraphy.

13
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,740
I wonder if we will

14
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,060
have the blessing to witness it today?

15
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,260
Lord Bu, this is not appropriate.

16
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,820
His Highness is an important figure.

17
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,500
How can you advocate entertainment?

18
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,900
Please grant me the sword, Your Majesty.

19
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,260
Give him the sword.

20
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,500
Your Majesty, be careful!

21
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,700
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

22
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,060
It's fine.

23
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,780
Rise.

24
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

25
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,220
I like this sword calligraphy very much.

26
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,340
You should be rewarded.

27
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,100
I'll give you what you want.

28
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,540
I know I have committed a serious crime,

29
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,860
I dare not ask for rewards

30
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,730
but I admire the dignity of the Emperor.

31
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,700
I heard that His Majesty likes riding and archery recently.

32
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,940
I would like to join for the Emperor and his subjects

33
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,420
to go hunting together.

34
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,100
I will do my best

35
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,220
to serve you,

36
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,980
and enjoy the grace of the Emperor.

37
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:08,900
Approved.

38
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,140
Your Majesty.

39
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,780
The defence of the surrounding area

40
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,690
have been under the jurisdiction of Zhaoding Bureau.

41
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,300
Do we have to follow the same this year?

42
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,260
Can't I do anything

43
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,300
without Zhaoding Bureau?

44
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,300
I spoke too much.

45
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,380
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

46
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,650

53

54
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,700
should be properly enjoyed

has been waiting at the door for a long time.

59

I told you that you don't like meeting outsiders.

60

But she refused to leave

61

if she can't see you.

since I married into the Prince's residence.

67
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,980
His Highness has many concubines,

68
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,780
and he only hits and scolds me all day.

69
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,659
I suffered too much.

70
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,180

71
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,260
the Prince of Nanyuan to enter the capital

72
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,780
can I come back.

73
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,060
The Prince of Nanyuan has come to the capital.

74

Go home and cry if you want.

76
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,420

78
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,180
Father is chasing me out too.

79
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,820
Not only does Father not dote on me,

80
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,780
but also forced me

81
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,260
to apologize to His Highness.

82
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,380

00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,010
So you want to stay with me?

88
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:23,660
Let go.

90
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,540
I was wrong.

91
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,620
I was immature

92
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,700
and petty.

93
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,660
But I was just being childish.

94

95
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,020
sisters are the closest to each other.

96
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,900
The world is too harsh on women.

97

Why do we have to make things difficult for each other.

I am missing a few dresses,

108
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,060
have you seen them?

109
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,180
Your Highness,

110
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,220
Concubine Rong said she left in a hurry

111
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,420
so she doesn't have enough clothes

112
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,700
and borrowed some of your old dresses.

113
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,780
She shamelessly moved into Deer's Reed residence

114
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,420
and is taking my clothes.

115
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,540
What is she trying to do?

116
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,580
Did Xiao Duo go to the mausoleum?

117
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,380
Yes.

118
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,940
If he doesn't listen to me,

119
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,980
we can't keep him alive.

120
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,820
Get a troop of elite soldiers

121
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,100
to keep an eye on Xiao Duo in the Imperial Mausoleum.

122
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,700
If he dares to step out of the mausoleum,

123
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,659
he will be executed

124
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,659
for disobeying the order.

125
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,380
Yes.

126
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,580
How is the hunting preparation going?

127
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,460
Your Majesty,

128
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,460
everything is ready.

129
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,220
Good.

130
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,780
Get Yinlou to accompany me.

131
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,780
Hunting is interesting,

132
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,740
I'm sure she'll like it.

133
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,340
Yes.

134
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,980
No, no.

135
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,980
She's not fully recovered.

136
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,220
I wonder if she can

137
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,220
take such a long journey.

138
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,970
I'd better ask her myself.

139
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,820
It's in the middle of the night,

140
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,299
why are we playing ring toss with fruits?

141
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,299
Your Highness, have a go.

142
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,220
I'll give it a try then.

143
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,740
One more.

144
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,220
One more.

145
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,700
Your Highness is amazing!

146
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,500
It's quite fun.

147
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,010
Let me get you a watermelon.

148
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

149
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,260
Your Highness said

150
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,940
you haven't fully recovered.

151
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,620
Now it seems

152
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,780
Her Highness has recovered

153
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,290
very well.

154
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,020
I'm still...

155
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,700
a little weak.

156
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,340
As long as you're recovered.

157
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,620
Ring toss?

158
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,650
Get her a watermelon?

159
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,420
I'm the watermelon.

160
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,140
Who came up with this idea?

161
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,060
Concubine Rong.

162
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,620
I was tricked.

163
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,820
Who are you?

164
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,780
I am Bu Yinge,

165
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,380
Consort Duan's sister.

166
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,780
Greetings, Your Excellency.

00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,060
Your Majesty.

168
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,540
I didn't know Your Majesty was here.

169
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,620
I didn't mean to offend you.

170
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,250
It's fine.

171
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,940
Your Majesty.

172
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,740
This is Prince of Nanyuan's concubine.

173
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,060
She came to the capital with the Prince of Nanyuan.

174
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,820
I heard that she's here to visit

175
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,500
Consort Duan.

176
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,140
The moon is beautiful tonight.

177
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,100
I wanted to enjoy the moon alone.

178
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,700
I didn't expect to meet His Majesty.

179
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,700
Lower your head.

180
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,300
Give me a more distant look.

181
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,060
Don't look at me.

182
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,020
All right, serve the dishes for me.

183
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,420
Wrong.

184
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,260
Wrong.

185
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,340
Say,

186
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,340
it's against the hierarchy

187
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,260
to have a meal together,

188
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,380
to have a meal together,

189
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,260
It's against the hierarchy

190
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,420
to have a meal together,

191
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,660
to have a meal together,

192
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:28,740
Good.

193
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,380
Good.

194
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,460
Here.

195
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,140
Wrong!

196
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,540
Back off! Back off!

197
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,340
Bow! Bow to me!

198
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,820
Then say,

199
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,940
"eat only with clean hands."

200
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,940
My hands are sweaty

201
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,300
and it's impolite

202
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,020
for Yinlou to eat with you.

203
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,380
Say it.

204
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,500
Eat only with clean hands.

205
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,450
My hands are sweaty

206
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,980
and it's impolite

207
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,810
for Yinlou to eat with you.

208
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:22,900
Good.

209
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,220
Very good.

210
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,300
I like you like this.

211
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:32,860
Go on.

212
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,780
Eat only with clean hands.

213
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,980
My hands are sweaty

214
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,020
and it's impolite

215
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,620
for Yinlou to eat with you.

216
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,180
Come here.

217
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,380
Why?

218
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,660
Why is it that no matter what I do,

219
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,860
you just don't like me?

220
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,260
Yinlou, why?

221
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,780
Your Highness.

222
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,540
Your Highness.

223
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,420
Your Highness, why are you here?

224
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,020
Yinlou?

225
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,820
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

226
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,660
I won't tell anyone

227
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,660
what I saw.

228
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,380
You

229
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,340
really have

230
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,300
no fear nor hate.

231
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,540
How virtuous!

232
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,460
I'm from the harem.

233
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,380
It's important not to fear nor hate.

234
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,540
Bu Yinlou.

235
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,060
Do you really think

236
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,700
you're the only one I want to marry?

237
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,100
Come.

238
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,500
Your Highness,

239
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,900
His Majesty is drunk.

240
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,859
Xiao Duo was transferred to the capital.

241
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,380
The Prince of Nanyuan came to the capital.

242
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,660
Bu Yinge gains attention.

243
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,579
This series of incidence

244
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:17,819
is not a coincidence.

245
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,380
Your Majesty, hold up!

246
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,980
I haven't put on my shoes yet.

247
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

248
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,060
You...

249
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,340
and her

250
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,820
ride around the field together.

251
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

252
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,700
The shadow of the flower on the wall...

253
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,460
I suspect someone is coming.

254
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:21,820
Tell me,

255
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,380
for a woman to be so heartless,

256
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,140
does she have someone else in her heart?

257
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,460
Your Majesty, that man

258
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,020
is dead.

259
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:34,860
No.

260
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,060
We have neglected this.

261
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,460
People who have been close to her,

262
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,620
except her cousin,

263
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,500
there is someone

264
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,500
who once

265
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,700
spent everyday with her every day.

266
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,860
Xiao Duo.

267
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,660
Your Majesty, you worry too much.

268
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,620
As the Emperor,

269
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,220
everyone looks up to you

270
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,140
and pleases you.

271
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,260
Chief Xiao is just a eunuch.

272
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,020
Her Highness is loved by you.

273
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,610
She's favored and honored.

274
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,140
How could she

275
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,740
risk her life

276
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,100
for a mere eunuch

277
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,980
and commit such a mistake?

278
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,100
Am I really worrying too much?

279
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,370
As the Emperor,

280
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,740
everyone looks up to me

281
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,220
and pleases me.

282
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,180
But she...

283
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,090
Only she!

284
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,560
[Royal Field]

285
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,260
His Majesty hit it with one hit.

286
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,220
That's amazing.

287
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,340
That's right.

288
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,890
If His Majesty's arrow hits,

289
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,100
it is a reward.

290
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,580
If it didn't, it's his kindness.

291
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,700
The thunder and rain dew are all God's grace.

292
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,820
It's all up to His Majesty.

293
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,140
You're right, Your Majesty.

294
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,460
You're right.

295
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,900
You're right.

296
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:36,650
Yes.

297
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,820
Your Majesty, spare my life!

298
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,380
Your Majesty!

299
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,420
Your Majesty, spare my life!

300
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,660
Do you know archery?

301
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:01,980
No.

302
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,260
Do you want to try?

303
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,980
Prince of Nanyuan won't mind, right?

304
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,260
It's her honor

305
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,100
to receive His Majesty's teachings.

306
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,220
Come.

307
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,020
Prince of Nanyuan is right.

308
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,980
To hit or not,

309
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,780
to kill or not,

310
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,220
is completely up to me.

311
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,020
Your Majesty.

312
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,740
It's broad daylight,

313
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,140
it's no good for people to see us like this.

314
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,180
It's good for people to see us.

315
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,700
Only when they see this

316
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,810
they'd know their place.

317
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,580
His Majesty is actually

318
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,900
being intimate with the Prince of Nanyuan's consort in public.

319
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,700
How inappropriate!

320
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,060
Isn't it just teaching archery?

321
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,740
I think it's fine.

322
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,860
Shameless.

323
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,380
It's immoral and shameless.

324
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,580
Why are you so angry?

325
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,300
Lower your voice. Relax.

326
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,620
Think about me and Xiao Duo.

327
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,210
We are shameless too.

328
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,740
We're basically the same.

329
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,420
I can't say anything about it.

330
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,180
How dare you say that?

331
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,060
He's favoring Bu Yinge

332
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,580
to show everyone,

333
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,620
and have Yuwen Liangshi,

334
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,260
and every one know,

335
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,460
that there's nothing he, Murong Gaogong,

336
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,580
can't get.

337
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,260
This also includes you.

338
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,780
That scared you?

339
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:13,700
Let's go.

340
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,620
Don't stay here.

341
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,420
Let's go over there.

342
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,260
Let's go.

343
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,580
Don't follow me.

344
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,260
Yes.

345
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,180
What do you think

346
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,380
is going on with that Bu Yinge?

347
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,540
Why are you here?

348
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,700
I am the brother of

349
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,140
the Prince of Nanyuan after all.

350
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,100
How can I be absent

351
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,460
at this shooting?

352
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,220
I'm sure you had to beg your brother

353
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,660
to come.

354
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,740
I just want to see you.

355
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,860
I found a good place just now.

356
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,540
There are many animals there.

357
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,500
Let's go together.

358
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,300
Sure.

359
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,340
Junior, let's go together.

360
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,780
You go first. I'll be right back.

361
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,700
Hurry up.

362
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,060
Okay.

363
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:01,740
Let's go.

364
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,780
Greetings, Your Highness.

365
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,180
You got the thing?

366
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,860
The palace is heavily guarded.

367
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,620
I dare not act rashly.

368
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,620
Please give me some more time.

369
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,620
You must get it tonight.

370
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,900
If you fail,

371
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,060
there's no need for you to live anymore.

372
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,340
Yes.

373
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,620
What are they looking for?

374
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,500
What are you doing here?

375
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,060
Are you following me?

376
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,220
Yes, I am.

377
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,500
I know who you met.

378
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,020
His Majesty.

379
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,140
You shameless thing.

380
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,060
I'll tolerate what you did

381
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,100
at the Deer's Reed Residence.

382
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,620
Now, in front of so many people,

383
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,140
you're being so shameless.

384
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,500
What am I?

385
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,740
Fool.

386
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,820
I am seducing His Majesty.

387
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,420
What can you do to me?

388
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,300
I want to steal your grace

389
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,860
and your favor.

390
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,180
If you kneel down

391
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,140
kowtow and beg for mercy,

392
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,940
maybe I can

393
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,980
put in a few good words for you

394
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,620
in front of His Majesty.

395
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:57,820
You're not?

396
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,060
Do you expect Chief Xiao

397
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,140
to continue supporting you?

398
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,450
That servant was kicked out

399
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,860
of the Imperial City like a dog.

400
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,060
You two are a perfect match.

401
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,540
You're all losers.

402
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,220
If you want to kill me,

403
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,100
His Majesty won't let you go.

404
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,300
There's no one here.

405
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,500
Stop!

406
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,380
What's going on?

407
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:58,840
[Royal Field, Palace]

408
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,420
What happened?

409
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,940
It's not Her Highness's fault.

410
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,020
I think

411
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,100
Her Highness saw you teaching me

412
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,260
archery skills personally

413
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,780
and got jealous.

414
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,780
I've explained for a long time,

415
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,340
but she didn't listen.

416
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,180
It's all my fault.

417
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,780
I don't know to speak well, so Her Highness got upset.

418
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,580
You leave first.

419
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,340
Yes.

420
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,540
Tell me.

421
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,500
Did you hit her?

422
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,740
If you hit her,

423
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:49,340
I can pretend

424
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,380
nothing has happened.

425
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,540
Tell me.

426
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,060
Did you hit her?

427
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,660
I'll wait for you

428
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,980
in the bedchamber tonight.

429
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,940
As long as you come,

430
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,340
no matter what you do,

431
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,100
I will always be on your side.

432
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:28,980
Remember,

433
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,940
this is the last time I'm waiting for you.

434
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,860
Should I tell him about

435
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,540
what's going on between Bu Yinge and Prince of Nanyuan.

436
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,140
But them meeting,

437
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,340
is nothing wrong on the surface.

438
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,740
I don't know any details.

439
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,100
What can I tell him?

440
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,380
Let's hurry up

441
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,660
and take everything there.

442
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,580
Has Princess Hede

443
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,540
come back from the battlefield?

444
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,220
No.

445
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,460
She must still be

446
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,220
with the prince.

447
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,180
Men are such a waste of time.

448
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:11,780
No way.

449
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,940
The Prince of Nanyuan must be up to something.

450
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,620
Since no one is helping me,

451
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,260
I'll take the risk.

452
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,170
Why did you bring me

453
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,740
to such a remote place?

454
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,530
There's nothing here.

455
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,460
Yes.

456
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,540
There's nothing here.

457
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,460
What's fun?

458
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,180
The capital is better.

459
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,820
There is a new opera in the theater.

460
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,900
The chef of Lingyan Pavilion

461
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,460
launched new dishes.

462
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,020
A new girl came to Dream House.

463
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,860
And that...

464
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,220
A new girl?

465
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:37,740
No.

466
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,300
I mean

467
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,740
there are more delicious food

468
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,060
and fun things than there are here.

469
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,580
What's the point of hunting?

470
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,220
When Junior comes back,

471
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,100
let's sneak back

472
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:47,820
to the capital together.

473
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,980
Stop it.

474
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,700
This is a royal hunting.

475
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,540
How can we sneak away?

476
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,700
It's in the middle of nowhere.

477
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,940
It's scary.

478
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,420
I heard there are wolves

479
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,580
and bears.

480
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,660
I can't even sleep at night.

481
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,540
You're insisting on

482
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,420
sending me back to the capital.

483
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,260
Are you hiding something from me?

484
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,420
No.

485
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,860
No.

486
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,020
No.

487
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,940
No.

488
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,180
Let's go then.

489
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,260
We've been away

490
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,180
for too long.

491
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:23,660
Don't let others

492
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,060
gossip about you.

493
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,580
Where did you take me

494
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,060
having come rounds and rounds.

495
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,740
How do we go back?

496
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:00,740
What do you think?

497
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,220
Are you going to do it tonight?

498
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,060
Do you have the right to know?

499
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,620
If it weren't for the fact that

500
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,020
you look a bit like Bu Yinlou,

501
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,460
and is of use in front

502
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,220
of Murong Gaogong,

503
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,820
I would have torn your mouth.

504
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,180
Know your place

505
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,620
and do what you should do.

506
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,610
I just want to know

507
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,700
how much reward

508
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,100
will I get for this?

509
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,780
Don't push your luck.

510
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,540
You are a wise master who knows how to reward and punish.

511
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,420
Of course you won't treat me badly.

512
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,540
Otherwise,

513
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,980
why have I not reported this to His Majesty?

514
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,140
This is because

515
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,460
I admire your character.

516
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,660
I'm willing to be loyal to you.

517
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:34,780
Fine.

518
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,220
I promise you.

519
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,180
I'll grant you the title of Noble Consort

520
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,300
when I get the Great Ye.

521
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,380
I'm glad I didn't let you down.

522
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:45,980
This is the commander's seal

523
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,940
to dispatch the army.

524
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,380
Go to Murong Gaogong's room tonight

525
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,940
and steady him.

526
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,820
They took the commander's seal.

527
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,540
Is the Prince of Nanyuan going to rebel?

528
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,180
Sun Taiqing.

529
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,820
Your Majesty.

530
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,580
What time is it?

531
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,260
It's midnight.

532
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,340
It's past nine.

533
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,300
She won't come.

534
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,380
Your Highness.

535
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,060
Your Highness, you can't go in.

536
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:27,780
I really have something important

537
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,540
to tell His Majesty.

538
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,660
Please tell His Majesty.

539
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,620
His Majesty is resting.

540
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,340
Your Majesty.

541
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,180
Your Majesty.

542
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,490
I really have something important to report.

543
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,180
Your Majesty.

544
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,260
What are you being so loud for?

545
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,060
His Majesty is asleep.

546
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,530
Tell me if you need anything.

547
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,660
Your Highness.

548
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,980
Please leave.

549
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,500
Master.

550
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,659
Master.

551
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,420
It's late.

552
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,620
Why are you back so late?

553
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:13,940
Don't mention it.

554
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,409
That unreliable Yuwen Liangxu

555
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,780
got me lost.

556
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,060
At night, someone was patrolling with a lantern

557
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:19,219
that's how we came back in the dark.

558
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,219
Consort Dowager Duan has been

559
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,380
looking for you.

560
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,659
She seems to have something important.

561
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,500
Wanwan.

562
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,380
Wanwan.

563
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:25,739
Bu Yinlou.

564
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,139
Why are you back so late?

565
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,020
It's urgent.

566
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,260
The Prince of Nanyuan is rebelling.

567
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,340
What happened?

568
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:31,980
Today, I bumped into

569
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,580
Prince of Nanyuan and Bu Yinge's secret meeting.

570
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,179
He was faking his loyalty to the Emperor.

571
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,139
What is wants to do is for Bu Yinge

572
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,300
to steal the commander's seal.

573
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,060
It's of no use if he steals the commander's seal.

574
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,380
The Imperial Army are royal guards.

575
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,900
They wouldn't attack the Emperor

576
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,860
just because of a commander's seal.

577
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,100
The commander's seal can't order the Imperial Army

578
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,060
to attack the Emperor,

579
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,219
but it can move the Imperial Army away.

580
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,659
On my way here,

581
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,739
I haven't seen a single Imperial Army.

582
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,650
I think they might be taking action soon.

583
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,540
We must contact

584
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,540
the battlefield guards immediately.

585
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,219
Okay.

586
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,650
I'll send someone to inform Lord Bu.

587
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,580
My father is in charge of

588
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:57,540
the battlefield guards?

589
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,580
Yes, why?

590
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,500
He is in cahoots with the Prince of Nanyuan.

591
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,060
Let's go.

592
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,620
It's too late.

593
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,260
They've rushed up the mountain.

594
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,300
I'll check over there.

595
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,820
Take them to the hall.

596
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:20,660
Be careful.

597
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,010
We'll meet in the hall later.

598
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,220
The Imperial Force has left the battlefield.

599
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,460
We'll head straight to the Emperor

600
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,780
and help His Highness take down Great Ye.

601
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,700
Head straight to the Emperor and take down Great Ye!

602
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,300
How is the situation at the mausoleum?

603
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,380
My lord,

604
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,260
I think those who have been sent there

605
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,860
must have taken action now.

606
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,980
Xiao Duo is now trapped in the imperial mausoleum.

607
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,060
He's alone and can't do anything.

608
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,180
It's a great opportunity for us to start our plan.

609
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,620
Only if he dies,

610
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,780
can His Highness and my aspirations

611
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,940
be achieved easily.

612
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,780
Yes.

613
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,380
You knew

614
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,460
the Prince of Nanyuan is going to rebel.

615
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,940
Wanwan, come with me.

616
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:41,620
Wanwan.

617
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,540
Yuwen Liangxu.

618
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,900
Where can we escape to?

619
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,700
We have nowhere to go.

620
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,260
Since we met,

621
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,610
we both knew it.

622
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,260
This day will come sooner or later.

623
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,860
It's good that it's here.

624
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:02,860
We don't have to

625
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,260
act that nothing's happening anymore.

626
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,140
Wanwan,

627
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,100
what do you mean?

628
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:10,780
Have you ever thought

629
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
about our future?

630
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,740
I thought about it.

631
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,900
But this is the furthest I can think.

632
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,460
What do you mean?

633
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,660
We used to hide

634
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,900
a lot of things in the past.

635
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,140
You may not know me well.

636
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,500
Let's get to know each other again.

637
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,100
My nickname is Wanwan.

638
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,660
My name is Hede.

639
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:34,980
My first name is Jun.

640
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,980
My name is Murong Jun.

641
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:39,660
Wanwan.

642
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,860
Jun means the power of the country.

643
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,700
Jun also means prosperity of the country.

644
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,500
My name comes

645
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,140
with a sense of responsibility and honor.

646
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,740
With the King of our dynasty here,

647
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,660
with me here.

648
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,420
I, Murong Jun,

649
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,820
as the Princess of Great Ye,

650
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,460
I won’t run away alone.

651
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,060
Get him out of here!

652
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:04,740
Yes.

653
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,660
Wanwan. Wanwan!

654
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,950
♫ The wind has risen in the smoke and rain ♫

655
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,460
Wanwan!

656
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,140
Wanwan!

657
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:08,540
Go.

658
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,460
Wanwan!

659
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,380
Wanwan!

660
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:17,580
♫ Even if the road ahead is rough ♫

661
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:11,860
Wanwan!

662
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,420
Wanwan!

663
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,220
Go.

664
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:17,980
Wan...

665
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:23,670
♫ The wind has risen and can hardly continue ♫

666
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:30,350
♫ I'll pledge my life to you ♫

667
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,410
Wanwan!

668
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,500
Wanwan!

669
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,460
Your Majesty, bad news!

670
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,220
Bad news!

671
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,020
Your Majesty.

672
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,620
What's wrong? Why are you in a hurry?

673
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,940
Your Majesty.

674
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,780
I don't know who sent

675
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,780
a group of rebels,

676
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,460
we have been surrounded.

677
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,140
Take Bu Yinlou away.

678
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:01,820
We can't leave anymore.

679
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,060
The exit is blocked by the rebels.

680
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,180
Come with me to the hall.

681
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,860
Where on earth are these rascals from?

682
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,340
They are rebelling!

683
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,580
Where is Bu Yulu.

684
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:09,820
He...

685
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,340
He won't come.

686
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,180
Why?

687
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,460
Murong Gaogong is foolish.

688
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,860
Today,

689
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,740
I, Yuwen Liangshi,

690
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,540
will be rebelling

691
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,700
to restore our country.

692
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,890
Attack! Attack!

693
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,820
Attack! Attack!

694
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,980
Attack! Attack!

695
