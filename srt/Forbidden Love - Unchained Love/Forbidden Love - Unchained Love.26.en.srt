[Episode 26]

4
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,920
In my opinion,

5
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,210
none of you have to continue

6
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,650
staying here with me here.

7
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,940
It's the Buddha's Birthday,

8
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,400
but the Heavenly Dog has eaten the Moon.

9
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,970
There may be someone with an ominous aura here

10
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,330
who is making the Buddha unhappy.

11
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,410
You may all go back now.

12
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,930
His Majesty is wise,

13
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,920
and his rule is almighty.

14
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,400
Even if the Heavenly Dog comes,

15
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,490
it'll be scared away by His Majesty's prowess.

16
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,680
You and that glib tongue of yours.

17
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,090
Your Majesty.

18
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,570
Today,

19
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,010
I'll make it clear to you.

20
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,440
Consort Duan is unchaste and ominous.

21
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,750
The heavens ordered the Heavenly Dog to eat the Moon

22
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,380
to warn all of us in Great Ye.

23
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,230
I won't let her go back to the palace.

24
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,130
Where's Consort Duan?

25
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,240
Your Majesty.

26
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,180
Consort Duan's maid reported that

27
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,079
Consort Duan is not feeling well.

28
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,660
She's afraid she might offend the Buddha,

29
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,340
so she went back earlier to rest.

30
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,480
Is that so?

31
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,150
I sent a maid two hours ago

32
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,080
to send some light snacks

33
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,830
to each of the concubines' rooms.

34
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,200
The maid didn't say anything

35
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,330
about Consort Duan being in the room.

36
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,480
Since you gave me a token,

37
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,329
I'll give you the Fish Immortal

38
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,880
as a token too.

39
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,340
It will bless and protect you

40
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,470
from misfortune, and grant all your wishes.

41
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,740
Everyone thinks I was the one who saved you.

42
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,960
But they don't know that

43
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,690
it was actually you who saved me.

44
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,260
All these years,

45
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,440
I've been trapped in countless schemes and conspiracies,

46
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,750
and I was so close to being torn apart and swallowed up

47
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,180
by this Imperial City.

48
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,540
Until I met you.

49
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,320
It was you who saved me from the path of no return.

50
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm not afraid of descending into hell,

51
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,890
neither am I afraid of falling into

52
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,360
a pit of hungry ghosts and wild beasts.

53
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,750
You are my only refuge.

54
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,120
After Rong'an is punished,

55
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,070
we'll find a place

56
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,570
where no one can find us

57
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,950
and live a normal life.

58
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,360
You already know Rong'an is the culprit?

59
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,250
I also know there's a little lunatic

60
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,980
who was so determined to track down the culprit

61
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,610
she kept putting herself into dangerous situations,

62
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,040
and catching me off-guard.

63
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:51,180
Then...

64
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,280
this little lunatic

65
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,550
wants you to promise her one thing.

66
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,360
You can take revenge,

67
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,290
but you must take me with you.

68
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,210
I'll help you.

69
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,440
You're not allowed to leave me behind alone.

70
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,390
Also,

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,410
I’ll keep this silk pendant.

72
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,980
Your wish is my command.

73
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,430
Oh no.

74
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,170
We'll be doomed if we don't go back soon.

75
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,350
Let's go. Are you trying to get us into trouble?

76
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,620
I think you're the one trying to get us into trouble

77
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,660
by trying to get us to head back together.

78
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,650
You're right.

79
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,550
Then, I'll leave first.

80
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,590
You head back a little later alright?

81
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,990
I see now.

82
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,420
You don't care about me at all.

83
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,360
You're just after

84
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,820
my beautiful looks.

85
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,630
Stop it. I'm leaving.

86
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,630
Come back a little later.

87
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,470
Be good.

88
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,960
Running off so quickly like that.

89
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,370
Your Highness, isn't that Consort Duan?

90
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,020
Why is she coming from there?

91
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,740
Did she really

92
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,590
stay out all night?

93
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

94
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,909
You...

95
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,720
You didn't return all night.

96
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,370
Where did you go?

97
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,360
I got bored of

98
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,370
listening to the old monk reciting sutras,

99
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,470
so I sneaked out to slack off for a while.

100
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,670
You forgot to bring your sutras,

101
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,710
and even sneaked out in the middle of listening to the recitations.

102
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,310
You did it on purpose.

103
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,310
Are you really that reluctant

104
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,700
to go back to the palace with me?

105
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,870
Where is the necklace

106
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,430
I gave you?

107
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,360
Why aren't you wearing it?

108
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,800
I think I must've dropped it somewhere.

109
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,100
I'll go look for it.

110
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,120
Why do you have to

111
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,210
deal with such a trivial matter yourself?

112
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,730
Yu Zun.

113
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,710
Give my order to search the entire temple

114
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,300
for Consort Duan's necklace.

115
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,100
Search every nook and cranny.

116
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,240
Yes.

117
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,890
You must be hungry

118
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,630
after being out for the whole night.

119
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,690
Have breakfast with me.

120
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,150
Yes.

121
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,030
Sure enough,

122
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,070
they were together last night.

123
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,790
The audacity...

124
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,580
How dare you come back?

125
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,260
How bold of you!

126
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,590
It seems that you really had

127
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,460
a secret rendezvous with Bu Yinlou

128
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,620
here last night.

129
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,340
Stop right there!

130
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,940
If you dare to take a single step away,

131
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,760
I will tell His Majesty

132
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,560
about every single detail of

133
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,470
your affair with her.

134
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,580
Go ahead then.

135
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,120
I'm just a mere eunuch.

136
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,790
Will His Majesty even believe

137
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,090
any of your stories?

138
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,440
He will only suspect that

139
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,490
I wanted to collude with Consort Duan

140
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,610
to win his favor.

141
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,350
If I lose all of His Majesty's favor

142
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,930
because of this,

143
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,990
I will definitely remember Your Majesty's grace to me

144
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,920
and take you down together with me.

145
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,400
After all, I know very well

146
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,420
all of the blood that is on your hands.

147
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,410
What do you mean by that?

148
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,870
I saw with my own eyes

149
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,620
how Noble Consort Shao

150
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,290
met her demise.

151
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,820
In the seventh year of Longhua,

152
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,590
the pregnant Consort Shu drowning in a well

153
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,750
was also planned by you.

154
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,380
In the ninth year of Longhua,

155
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,380
the few princes

156
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,170
who were most likely to inherit the throne

157
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,920
were killed by you one after another.

158
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,560
In the same year, during the great drought in the northwest,

159
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,030
you colluded with the Assistant Minister of Revenue

160
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,790
to embezzle disaster relief provisions,

161
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,720
causing countless disaster victims to die.

162
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,640
Should I continue with more,

163
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,890
Your Majesty?

164
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,980
Shut up.

165
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,790
After all these years of

166
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,640
painstaking effort

167
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,250
to get to

168
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,200
where you are today,

169
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,810
are you really going to

170
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,100
crash and burn together with me

171
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,290
just because of a girl like Bu Yinlou?

172
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,660
My wretched life is worth nothing.

173
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,350
Bu Yinlou

174
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,850
might be a mere girl to you,

175
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,200
but she is more noble and distinguished

176
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,670
than anyone else in my eyes.

177
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,350
If anyone dares to hurt her,

178
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,660
I'll drag that person down to hell with me.

179
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,150
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

180
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,780
We searched every corner of the temple grounds

181
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,610
but found nothing.

182
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,480
Tanxi Temple

183
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,670
is so small.

184
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,770
How can it just disappear?

185
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,630
There's a lake behind the temple.

186
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,180
Did you miss that out?

187
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,700
I've searched there too,

188
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,790
but found nothing.

189
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,820
Sun Taiqing,

190
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,820
you go and search too.

191
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:43,700
Yes.

192
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:49,750
Here, this is good.

193
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:50,380
This is delicious.

194
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:54,960
Let me

195
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,970
ask you again.

196
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,740
Where did you go last night?

197
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,260
Who did you meet?

198
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,450
Think carefully before you answer.

199
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,670
It's a serious crime to deceive the Emperor.

200
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,070
Last night, it was me who pulled Yinlou

201
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,320
along with me to listen to some storytelling.

202
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,690
Come on.

203
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,780
If His Majesty asks,

204
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:15,970
you can just

205
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,670
rat me out you know.

206
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,050
Why are you so guileless?

207
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,160
Please don't make it hard for her any more, Your Majesty.

208
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,350
Everything is all

209
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,600
my fault.

210
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,610
I apologize to you.

211
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,680
So

212
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,930
I must have lost the necklace at

213
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,840
Wan Wan's place.

214
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,930
I was so engrossed listening to the storyteller

215
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,400
that I don't quite remember.

216
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:41,910
Ruolan.

217
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:42,710
Yes.

218
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,140
Go search in my room.

219
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:44,930
Yes.

220
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,490
You don't have to search any further.

221
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,060
Are you all looking for this?

222
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,950
I just passed by the entrance of the Princess' room.

223
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,250
This was stuck

224
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,310
by the crack of the door to the entrance.

225
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,040
I initially thought

226
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,970
this belonged to the Princess.

227
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,870
I didn't expect that it was Consort Duan's.

228
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,560
Your Majesty.

229
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,880
Listening to the monks reciting sutras is an act of devotion.

230
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,830
Yet Consort Duan and the Princess have been slacking off all night.

231
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,000
How inappropriate.

232
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,150
I think they should be punished.

233
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,340
Don't worry about it, Imperial Sister-in-law.

234
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,680
I'll deal with it accordingly.

235
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,200
You may leave.

236
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,240
Slacking off?

237
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,490
It's just slacking off.

238
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,550
Why couldn't you just tell me honestly?

239
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,480
Silly girl.

240
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,750
Is it not enough for you to mess around on your own?

241
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,300
I can't believe you're being a bad influence on Yinlou now.

242
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,980
Who's the bad influence here?

243
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,200
Let's go.

244
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,170
We haven't finished listening

245
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,090
to the story last night.

246

You...

247
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,230
Stand here.

248
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,330
You're only allowed to leave

after staying with me for an whole hour.

250
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,460
You know everything?

251
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,280
How much do you know?

252
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,520
Are you still thinking of how much more

253
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,690
you can hide?

254
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,450
No.

255
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,800
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

256

At first,

257
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,950
I didn't plan for things to end up like this.

But now...

261
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,570
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have kept it from you.

I treated you as my friend,

about this.

If you know you were in the wrong,

Actually, since I came back to the palace,

I've been feeling uneasy all the while.

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,100
Actually...

344
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,080
He- He's a fake?

345
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,720
This matter is too serious,

346
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,150
I've never told anyone about this before.

347
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,700
You must help me keep this secret.

348
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,140
Bu Yinlou.

349
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,280
Are- Are you crazy?

350
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,270
You said you wouldn't hit me!

351
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,100
Listen.

352
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,780
This isn't over.

353
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,030
I won't help you two.

354
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,770
If you dare to continue having relations with each other,

355
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,990
and I find out, I'll—

356
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,980
Consort Duan.

357
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,780
Tonight, at quarter to 8, at the same place.

358
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,540
I'll wait for you.

359
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,100
This bastard.

360
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,010
I can't believe he has the guts to do this

361
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,020
in broad daylight.

362
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,640
Seriously, I'd better hit you.

363
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,120
Bu Yinlou!

364
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,640
You'd better stop right there!

365
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,850
Don't hit me!

366
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,260
Do you want to die?

367
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,910
Quick, get down!

368
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,130
What's happening? Are they blind?

369
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,150
The entire Tanxi Temple is full of my men.

370
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,430
No matter how bold they are,

371
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,170
they wouldn't dare go against me.

372
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,080
Look.

373
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,070
"A boat flies freely,

374
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,710
not knowing right from wrong.

375
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,900
Idling after catching fish,

376
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,800
refusing to return if not.

377
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,240
Akin to indolence, or to madness.

378
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,840
Who knows of this happiness?

379
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,490
The luxurious hall sees only beautiful lanterns,

380
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,680
but not the moon above a peaceful river."

381
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,740
The most precious thing in this world of ours

382
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,430
is the sight of the moon shimmering against the still waters.

383
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:35,700
You still remember?

384
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,900
I remember everything you say.

385
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,840
Isn't this a moment

386
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,090
with the moon above a peaceful river?

387
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,780
The moon above a peaceful river

388
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,880
is only temporary.

389
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,140
Look at these fish.

390
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,010
They will always be trapped

391
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,350
within the confines of the royal family's property,

392
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,190
with no chance to escape at all.

393
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,180
This lake doesn't even lead to any rivers.

394
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,210
Do you think

395
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,060
we can really escape from here?

396
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,710
♫ The palace is as it was yesterday ♫

397
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:29,320
♫ Whose soul has it trapped ♫

398
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,530
♫ Fate is unpredictable ♫

399
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,840
♫ No one can escape ♫

400
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,080
♫ Like bubbles, like fireworks ♫

401
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,710
♫ Fate is so full of twists and turns ♫

402
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,890
♫ You are ♫

403
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:51,110
♫ The persistence of my lifetime ♫

404
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,260
Why are you here?

405
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,940
Quick, have a seat over there.

406
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,690
Didn't I ask you to rest in your room?

407
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,160
You haven't recovered yet.

408
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,940
Things are so busy over at the Zhaoding Bureau,

409
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,660
yet you come to help me do my chores everyday.

410
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,420
I can't just continue

411
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,510
keeping you from your work everyday

412
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,590
and do nothing.

413
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,850
Not at all.

414
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,740
You are part of my work.

415
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,680
By the way,

416
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,870
let me see your hand.

417
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,790
Why?

418
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,820
I got you a box of ointment

419
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,740
from the Imperial Hospital.

420
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,380
This ointment is very effective.

421
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,390
Your hands will heal fully after applying it a few times.

422
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,660
I'll be gentle.

423
00:22:59,490 --> 00:22:59,970
The other one.

424
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,300
Does it hurt?

425
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,550
It doesn't hurt anymore.

426
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,340
I'm just a servant anyway.

427
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,610
It's not a big deal

428
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,690
to be bullied a little by them.

429
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,630
How can it not be a big deal?

430
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,680
Godfather told me before

431
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,960
the nobles up there

432
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,010
may not treat us as humans.

433
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,010
But we should always

434
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,090
treat ourselves as human beings.

435
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,730
I didn't understand it before,

436
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,540
but after seeing you suffer,

437
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,050
I understand this fully now.

438
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,770
In the future,

439
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,550
if anyone dares to bully you again,

440
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,420
just tell me.

441
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,680
I'll teach them a lesson.

442
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,050
What if you can't?

443
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,010
If I can't,

444
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,110
there's still my godfather.

445
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,580
I'll beg him to help.

446
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,100
What if your godfather

447
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,140
ignores you?

448
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,420
Then I'll beg my godmother.

449
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,560
My godfather will definitely agree.

450
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,040
By the way,

451
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,760
Godfather sent a message saying

452
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,490
that he and Godmother have made up.

453
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,210
Really?

454
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,890
They'll get you out

455
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,860
from here

456
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,900
very soon.

457
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,140
My master

458
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,260
must be very happy now.

459
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:10,990
Actually,

460
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,160
I'm very happy too.

461
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,640
Are you?

462
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,570
I-

463
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,200
I am!

464
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,720
I'm so happy.

465
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,490
Take this.

466
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,410
Thank you.

467
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,590
I'll get back to work now.

468
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,980
In a few days,

469
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,230
we'll be leaving Tanxi Temple.

470
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,370
Don't worry about Tongyun.

471
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,800
Cao Chun'ang replied me.

472
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,760
Everything is fine.

473
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,870
I'll find an excuse

474
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:09,790
to get her out soon.

475
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,030
I trust your ability to do things.

476
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,840
But right now,

477
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,680
His Majesty doesn't trust you.

478
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,080
Furthermore, Tongyun offended him greatly.

479
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,180
If you try and help her now,

480
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,400
won't you lose

481
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,820
even more of his trust?

482
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,930
Why don't you let me do it?

483
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,620
I'll coax His Majesty

484
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,930
and ask him to forgive Tongyun this time.

485
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,810
How are you going to coax him?

486
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,160
I can do the drum dance.

487
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,130
No.

488
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:43,930
Then...

489
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,660
I'll make him a meal?

490
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,920
No.

491
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,660
How about I sew something?

492
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:52,750
No way.

493
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,690
Why is everything a no?

494
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,780
Are you being jealous?

495
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,720
If everything is a no,

496
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,840
how do we help Tongyun?

497
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,550
Let me give you an idea.

498
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,100
You tricked me?

499
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,710
Okay, I won't. I'll talk to you properly.

500
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,240
Come here.

501
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:29,800
Come on.

502
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,410
Come over here!

503
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,290
No.

504
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,220
You're pretty smart huh?

505
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,140
I'll go find His Majesty.

506
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,660
Who are you going to see?

507
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,240
His Majesty.

508
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,710
The audacity!

509
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,980
I haven't seen Consort Duan for days.

510
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,070
What has she been up to?

511
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,880
Your Majesty,

512
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,710
Her Highness has been praying in

513
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,170
the temple's worship hall over the past few days.

514
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,990
Praying?

515
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,940
When did she become so sensible?

516
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,710
Whatever.

517
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,300
Let's go have a look.

518
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,650
Oh, merciful Buddha.

519
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,550
Your devoted disciple, Bu Yinlou, prays to you sincerely.

520
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,710
Please watch over Tongyun,

521
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,310
such that she is safe and sound.

522
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,120
You've been kneeling for days.

523
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,630
She's just a mere servant.

524
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,730
Why put yourself through so much for her?

525
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,690
Since we first entered Xiecui Garden,

526
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,420
we have been relying on each other.

527
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,210
In my heart, she is not a servant.

528
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,010
She's like family.

529
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,670
If it weren't for me,

530
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,390
she wouldn't have been punished.

531
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,160
People in the palace

532
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,920
will always side with those in favor.

533
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,990
She's probably suffering a lot

534
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,260
in the Dyeing Workshop now.

535
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,280
It's all my fault for being useless.

536
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,170
I don't know

537
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,980
what else I can do.

538
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,790
I'm willing to cut my flesh and pray fervently.

539
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,490
I beg Buddha to redirect all of her sufferings

540
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,080
onto me.

541
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,490
What are you doing?

542
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,050
As long as I can protect her from harm,

543
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,940
cutting a piece of my flesh is nothing.

544
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,380
Even if I have to sacrifice myself in her place,

545
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,560
it doesn't matter.

546
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:04,750
You...

547
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,240
Stop!

548
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,500
Stop!

549
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,170
You are my woman.

550
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,970
Every inch of your body belongs to me.

551
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,070
How dare you

552
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,070
hurt yourself?

553
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,000
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

554
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,690
I just feel terrible.

555
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,790
If I don't do this,

556
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,430
I don't know

557
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,690
what else I can do.

558
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,300
You...

559
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,570
Instead of praying to the Buddha for a miracle,

560
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,350
you'd be better off begging me for mercy.

561
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,330
Then...

562
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,100
Your Majesty, you mean...

563
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,800
For your sake,

564
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,360
I'll spare her just this once.

565
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,300
Thank you for your mercy, Your Majesty.

566
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,200
When can I go pick her up?

567
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,730
I'll send someone to do it now.

568
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,430
Stop crying.

569
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,320
Help me keep an eye on her.

570
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,070
Okay.

571
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,990
Let's go.

572
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,740
You were so fake just now.

573
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,300
Didn't I ask you to hold me back?

574
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,140
Why didn't you?

575
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,320
I was so close to actually cutting myself.

576
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,860
How was I to know you'd do that so suddenly?

577
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,590
It’s all Xiao Duo’s fault.

578
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,750
What a terrible idea!

579
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,160
Why am I helping you two?

580
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,270
This is the last time.

581
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,390
Whatever you two do in the future,

582
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,730
it has nothing to do with me.

583
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,350
Wan Wan, your brother asked you to keep an eye on me.

584
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,430
You can take care of yourself.

585
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,610
Wan Wan.

586
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,670
Godfather, Godfather!

587
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,370
I see it.

588
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,760
I'm seeing it with both my eyes.

589
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,150
Stop showing off.

590
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,080
I finally understand now.

591
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,100
You deliberately

592
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,050
sent me away these few days.

593
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,360
But you act pretty fast.

594
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,830
It's only been a while,

595
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,260
but Her Highness has already become my Godmother.

596
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,490
Hearing you call her that sounds much more pleasant.

597
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,460
By the way,

598
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,380
dispose of all of

599
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,730
my medicine later.

600
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,580
You won't take them anymore?

601
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:14,680
I won't.

602
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,410
You're not a reckless person by nature.

603
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,020
But why do you always act out of character

604
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,350
when it comes to Godmother?

605
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,930
We can't stay in the Imperial City

606
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:24,920
for much longer anyway.

607
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,060
I don't want to

608
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,030
wear this mask

609
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,950
when I'm with her any longer.

610
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,320
I should have stopped you

611
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,360
when you were planning all of this.

612
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,340
People will find out the truth sooner or later.

613
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,010
I wonder

614
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,010
how long more we can keep this under wraps.

615
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:37,900
You could have just

616
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,380
protected her from a distance,

617
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,280
and watched her lead a peaceful and happy life.

618
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,940
Isn't that enough?

619
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,240
Why are you trying to fight for more?

620
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,010
You want me to give up?

621
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,020
Dream on.

622
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:49,700
If you're willing to quietly

623
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,880
watch over your beloved,

624
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,180
then go do that yourself.

625
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,210
Why are you

626
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,490
trying to dictate what I should do?

627
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,090
Beloved?

628
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,390
I don't have one.

629
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,670
Go on and quietly watch over her.

630
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,400
Watching her get married, have children,

631
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,290
and lead a peaceful and happy life.

632
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,720
Isn't that enough?

633
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,990
Why fight for more, am I right?

634
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:11,920
Godfather!

635
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,770
How did you know?

636
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,460
His Majesty has lifted Tongyun's punishment.

637
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,920
Head to the Dyeing Workshop yourself.

638
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,160
How on earth did he know?

639
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,200
How can I be like Godfather?

640
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:27,880
If she follows me,

641
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,770
she'll be doomed.

642
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,300
But Godfather and Godmother

643
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,800
have been through so much,

644
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,900
and they're together now.

645
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,300
Should I learn from them?

646
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,910
I was careless.

647
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,330
Please forgive me.

648
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,610
Forget it.

649
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,950
When it comes to doing my hair,

650
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,090
Xiao Duo still does it the best.

651
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,700
Do you think

652
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,930
he's with Bu Yinlou now,

653
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,990
doing her hair for her?

654
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:13,910
Please don't be angry, Your Majesty.

655
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,070
How dare Xiao Duo

656
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:19,960
use my secret

657
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,180
to threaten me?

658
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,080
I'm still angry.

659
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,470
If he has something on me,

660
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,700
don't I also have something on him?

661
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,850
Even if he's made of the strongest steel,

662
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,150
I will find

663
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,490
the chink in his armor.

664
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,540
Yilan.

665
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,470
Send someone to keep an eye on Xiao Duo.

666
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,690
Your Majesty,

667
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,670
I’m afraid our men

668
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,060
will be taken down by Chief Xiao

669
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,140
even before they manage to get close.

670
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,200
Then keep an eye on the people around him.

671
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,890
It can't be that everyone around him

672
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,950
is as thorough as he is, can it?

673
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

674
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:53,850
Your Majesty.

675
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,780
I heard

676
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:56,580
another piece of news.

677
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,980
I heard His Majesty agreed to

678
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,580
pardon Consort Duan's maid,

679
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,290
the one who got sent to the Dyeing Workshop

680
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,860
Pardoned?

681
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,980
That's good.

682
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,310
Now that she's free from punishment,

683
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,330
I can use her to my benefit.

684
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,040
I've really been pardoned?

685
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,000
Yes, no mistake about it.

686
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,690
Someone will come to get you later.

687
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:31,989
Thank you sir.

688
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,929
Miss Tongyun.

689
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,090
So soon? Coming.

690
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,760
Sir,

691
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:57,780
shouldn't I be leaving the palace?

692
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,950
This doesn't seem to be

693
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,600
the way to Deer's Reed Residence...

694
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,340
Your Majesty, we brought her here.

695
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,680
Greetings, Your Majesty the Empress.

696
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,370
It's been a long time

697
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,960
since someone acknowledged my status as the Empress.

698
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,990
It makes me happy hearing that.

699
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,380
Rise.

700
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,320
Yes.

701
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:57,960
Where have you been?

702
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,600
I've been waiting for you.

703
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:02,660
What?

704
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,350
Are you lost for words at the prospect of leaving this place of suffering?

705
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,810
Let's go. Let's not stay

706
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,200
in this terrible place any longer.

707
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,610
Tongyun,

708
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,850
tell me.

709
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,410
If a person has a secret hidden in his heart,

710
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,090
should he say it out loud?

711
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,870
What do you mean?

712
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,260
Actually, about this,

713
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,940
I originally thought that

714
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,750
I should just

715
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,790
keep it to myself.

716
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,680
I didn't want to make things difficult for you.

717
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,780
But after thinking about it,

718
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,300
if people feel guilty about something,

719
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,020
the truth will come out sooner or later.

720
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,410
Am I right?

721
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,720
Actually, I...

722
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,140
I...

723
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,750
I care about you.

724
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,020
When we were at the Imperial Mausoleum,

725
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,860
I already thought you were very special.

726
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,680
Although you always scold me,

727
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,480
the more you scold me,

728
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,170
the more enthusiastic I get.

729
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,200
I thought I was being crazy.

730
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,810
But I guess I am crazy.

731
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,030
And there's nothing I can do about it.

732
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,110
♫ The wind slips through my heart ♫

733
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,220
This hairpin...

734
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,210
I actually wanted to give it to you

735
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,050
before I went to West Shu.

736
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,910
♫ Wrinkling our past ♫

737
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,520
♫ Lamenting and sighing ♫

738
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,840
♫ We can't escape parting ♫

739
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:13,340
♫ How can ripples form on a mirror ♫

740
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,200
I know I don't deserve you.

741
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,130
I don't intend to do anything either.

742
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,190
♫ The wind can't blow away the loneliness ♫

743
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,640
I'm just letting you know.

744
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,250
In that case,

745
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:23,030
you can keep this hairpin.

746
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,620
♫ But the sorrows and joys of this world ♫

747
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,460
You can throw it away if you don't like it.

748
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,230
♫ Look upon desolation and recklessness ♫

749
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,740
I'll leave first.

750
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,420
♫ Not knowing when I can return ♫

751
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:39,800
♫ How can we be calculating in this ephemeral world ♫

752
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:48,180
♫ The wind has risen in the smoke and rain ♫

753
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,350
Cao Chun'ang.

754
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:56,050
♫ I'll pledge my life to you ♫

755
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,660
I'm the one who doesn't deserve you.

756
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,480
What should I do?

757
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,340
Your Majesty, this plan may have great repercussions.

758
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,820
One careless move will lead to catastrophe.

759
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,800
Please think twice.

760
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,430
Think twice?

761
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,350
What do I have to think twice?

762
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,200
I am the daughter of an aristocratic family,

763
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,470
the Empress of Heaven's will.

764
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,830
I am the one who stands at the very top of the Imperial City.

765
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,940
Since I was a child,

766
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:31,900
I've always understood something.

767
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,090
If you want the clothes you like,

768
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,940
you have to vie for them.

769
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,600
If you don't want to be bullied by others,

770
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,550
you have to fight.

771
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,610
If you want ultimate power,

772
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,080
you have to grab it for yourself.

773
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,250
But someone like Xiao Duo...

774
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,180
But why

775
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,360
is it only Xiao Duo

776
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:53,740
that I have

777
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,310
failed

778
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,660
to acquire, to possess?

779
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,680
Who does he think he is?

780
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,450
He's just a mere servant.

781
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,850
How dare he disobey me?

782
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,400
I've enjoyed a life of prestige and nobility,

783
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,170
and also weathered through desolate times and loneliness.

784
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,360
What else do I want?

785
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,340
And what do I fear?

786
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,280
So what if we'll be doomed?

787
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,440
I just want him to know

788
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,730
that if there's something I can't have,

789
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,650
I will fight for it, vie for it, snatch it away.

790
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,200
Your Highness,

791
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:44,390
are you really not going to care about anything else

792
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,040
just because of someone like Xiao Duo?

793
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,380
This Imperial City

794
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,160
can drive any

795
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,210
dignified and respectable person

796
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,130
completely crazy.

797
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,170
Since Xiao Duo went crazy for a woman,

798
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,750
I'll go crazy with him too.

799
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:12,910
Your Highness.

800
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,370
Xiao Duo.
