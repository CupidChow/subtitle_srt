Chief She,

you do have a mouth,

6
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:51,300
but you don't have to use it to speak.

7
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,780
Regardless of whether I have a mouth, or use it to speak,

Chief is holding his records upside down.

Is anything wrong?

just ask.

Any news from Deer's Reed Residence?

14

Didn't you ask him not to look into it?

15

How is he going to get the news for you

17

Yes.

00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,340
Is she that kind of woman?

349
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,100
-Actually— -She has nothing to be afraid of.

350
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,060
Don't worry.

351
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,060
There's no way

352
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,770
we will believe that kind of nonsense.

353
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,340
Actually...

354
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,450
Actually, we all believe

355
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,620
in your integrity.

356
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,540
My brother too.

357
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,650
What are you thinking about?

358
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,180
Ridiculous.

359
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,620
Really.

360
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,740
It is quite ridiculous.

361
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,060
By the way,

362
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,940
I have something very important

363
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,700
to tell you.

364
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,570
Don't be scared.

365
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,220
Your maid, Suhuai,

366
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,340
is in Rong'an's pocket.

367
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,860
I'm afraid she wants to harm you.

368
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,970
You took all that trouble to climb in here

369
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,100
just for this?

370
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,010
-Just for this? -That's it.

371
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,140
I have a favor to ask.

372
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,700
Don't stop her.

373
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,260
[Permeating Fragrance]

374
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,340
You mean

375
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,740
you're baiting Rong'an

376
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,140
to make a move on you?

377
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,940
Have you gone mad?

378
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,010
I'm fine.

379
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,660
There's just something

380
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,940
I need to ask her about in private.

381
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,380
I can't let anyone else know.

382
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,340
I can only force her

383
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,740
to see me in person.

384
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,620
Can I borrow these things?

385
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,980
You're being ridiculous.

386
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:46,820
What do you have to ask,

387
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,860
that's made you go to this trouble?

388
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,660
Stop asking.

389
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,180
I have my reasons.

390
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,900
You've offended Rong'an many times.

391
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,220
She will kill you.

392
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,250
As long as there's a chance,

393
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,420
I have to take the risk.

394
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,820
You don't have to tell me why you're doing this.

395
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,900
But there's only one thing.

396
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,500
This is too dangerous,

397
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,020
I'm afraid you can't handle it alone.

398
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:04,740
Let me help you.

399
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,700
Count me in too.

400
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,220
Fine.

401
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,540
You can help,

402
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,420
but

403
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,620
if anything happens, it's on me.

404
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,900
Look how shrewd you are.

405
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,540
There's no one planted here at all.

406
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,780
She must be planning to take me on the way,

407
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,340
so no one will notice.

408
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,420
His residence is so far away,

409
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,300
why didn’t she rent a carriage for me?

410
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,490
That's strange.

411
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,380
Where are Empress Rong'an's people?

412
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,820
How did Her Highness get out?

413
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,170
Follow me.

414
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,140
It's too hot.

415
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,380
I can't walk anymore.

416
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,130
I can't walk anymore.

417
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,140
Let's go.

418
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,700
Bitch!

419
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,300
I've finally found you.

420
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,620
You abandoned your son

421
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,180
for your boy toy.

422
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,780
Come back home with me.

423
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,540
Okay, I'll come.

424
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,620
You even brought a carriage. Let's go, my good son.

425
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,300
This—

426
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,980
Hurry up.

427
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,740
Let's go.

428
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:28,820
Move aside.

429
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,650
Your Majesty, Suhuai sent a message.

430
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,900
She's got Her Highness.

431
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
Help me change.

432
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,900
I will send her off personally.

433
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,660
Yes.

434
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,740
Move aside!

435
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,180
Move aside!

436
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,540
Hurry up!

437
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,300
Get out of the way!

438
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,370
Make way!

439
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,420
Move!

440
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,020
Move! Move!

441
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,180
Move! Move!

442
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,700
Let's follow.

443
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,380
Hurry!

444
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,780
Hurry up!

445
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,100
Get out of the way!

446
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,100
Hurry, let's go!

447
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:52,820
Get out of the way!

448
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,740
Are you blind? Move!

449
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,700
Hurry up!

450
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,700
Get out of the way!

451
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,340
Move!

452
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,060
Move aside!

453
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,180
By the way,

454
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,940
after I escape from Deer's Reed Residence,

455
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,210
Empress Rong'an will definitely send someone

456
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,420
to take me someplace.

457
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,820
Follow after us.

458
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,060
As soon as she appears,

459
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,780
we'll have her trapped.

460
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,580
Trapped?

461
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,180
Trapped.

462
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,180
Get out of the way!

463
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,260
Move aside!

464
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,700
What can I do for you?

465
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:42,980
Leave that person behind.

466
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,580
Hurry up!

467
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,060
Your Highness.

468
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,580
Why are you here?

469
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:54,940
Your Highness,

470
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,650
I'm so glad you're fine.

471
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,260
Thank goodness I followed you closely.

472
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,100
Otherwise,

473
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,140
you would have been taken away.

474
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,820
You have no idea.

475
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,060
If I hadn't found someone

476
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,460
laying in ambush at Deer's Reed Residence,

477
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,100
you would have been taken away

478
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,420
by now.

479
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,180
I have not let Chief down.

480
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,060
Chief Xiao sent you here?

481
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,220
Your Highness,

482
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,900
could you not tell Chief?

483
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,780
Chief told me

484
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,100
to protect you in secret.

485
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,580
He doesn't want you to know. Look—

486
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,660
Why did the carriage stop?

487
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,380
Princess?

488
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,460
Your Highness?

489
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,420
Why are you here?

490
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,980
Are we still trapping her?

491
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,340
Trap?

492
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,580
What trap?

493
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,980
What is Her Highness trapping?

494
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,020
You should stop talking.

495
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,500
It's quite annoying.

496
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:50,900
Let's go.

497
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:57,940
Why are people

498
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,660
from the Zhaoding Bureau here?

499
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,740
Forget about the Zhaoding Bureau.

500
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,660
Those bastards

501
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,340
have disappeared.

502
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,060
We don't even know

503
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,700
where Rong'an was planning on

504
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,460
taking us.

505
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,420
It's just a kidnapping.

506
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,460
Why did it end up

507
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,580
so complicated?

508
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,420
Your Highness,

509
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,820
where are you going?

510
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,980
I want to know

511
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,540
where I'm going.

512
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,060
But can you help me find it?

513
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,300
I don't know what you're looking for.

514
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,260
If I knew,

515
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,260
I could help you.

516
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,060
You...

517
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,500
are looking for...

518
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,140
It seems he really can help you.

519
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,580
Chief She,

520
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,540
get something done for me.

521
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,700
Your Highness,

522
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,860
my mission is to protect you.

523
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,300
The most important thing now

524
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,420
is to send you back to Deer's Reed Residence.

525
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,100
You only obey Chief Xiao,

526
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,860
and not me, right?

527
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,260
How about now?

528
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,580
Greetings, Chief.

529
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,980
What happened?

530
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:41,980
You...

531
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,540
You are the Zhaoding Guards.

532
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,540
Tell me.

533
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,740
Where does Her Majesty

534
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,580
want to bring Consort Duan?

535
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,660
[Dilapidated house in the suburb of the Imperial City]

536
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,460
Your Highness, we're here.

537
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,540
Suhuai.

538
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,740
Suhuai.

539
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,180
If I had known I could do this,

540
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,020
I wouldn't have gone through all that trouble.

541
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,940
Wan Wan went to Deer's Reed Residence

542
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,700
to keep watch.

543
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,780
Since everything is settled here,

544
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,620
I'll go too.

545
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,620
Chief She, may I have a word with you?

546
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,140
What can I do for you?

547
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,860
I've troubled you today,

548
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,580
Chief She.

549
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,700
You may leave now.

550
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,660
As for the rest,

551
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,940
it's not for you to worry about.

552
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,180
No.

553
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,380
I have to

554
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,780
send you back to Deer's Reed Residence safely.

555
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,530
Will you leave?

556
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,860
I'll leave.

557
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,100
Also,

558
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,780
don’t tell Chief Xiao

559
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,980
about what happened today.

560
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,140
No.

561
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,220
I dare not disobey the Chief

562
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,340
by withholding the truth from him.

563
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,580
This ring is akin to the Chief himself.

564
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,060
If you don’t obey me,

565
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,540
aren't you disobeying him too?

566
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,060
I understand.

567
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,220
Your orders

568
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,820
are the Chief's orders now.

569
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,820
But the Chief's orders

570
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,980
are the Chief's orders too.

571
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,780
Your orders

572
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,500
and the Chief's orders—

573
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,500
Stop.

574
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,780
Stop talking. Let me figure this out for you.

575
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,980
Chief Xiao asked you to protect me in secret.

576
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,740
I'm asking you not to tell him about

577
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,180
what happened today.

578
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,980
Is there conflict between the two?

579
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,620
No.

580
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,380
Since there's no conflict,

581
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,150
you can obey both orders,

582
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,660
and not violate either.

583
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,740
Am I right?

584
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,980
You are.

585
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,740
Okay, let me try this again.

586
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,290
Okay?

587
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:42,940
Yes.

588
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,220
From now on,

589
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,220
don't tell Chief Xiao about me.

590
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,580
You’re awake.

591
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:15,980
Bu Yinlou?

592
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,500
Yilan!

593
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,540
Where are all of you?

594
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,100
Stop shouting.

595
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,020
Everyone outside only responds to my orders.

596
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,780
Bu Yinlou, how dare you!

597
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,580
Let me go!

598
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,380
I'm not as bold as you are.

599
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,820
You must have put quite some thought

600
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,900
into plotting against me.

601
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,610
What a coincidence.

602
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,980
I put quite some thought into this too.

603
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,100
What do you want?

604
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,020
Is it just Xiao Duo?

605
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,340
Don't you dare say his name.

606
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,420
Why are you laughing?

607
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,180
You're pitiful.

608
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,300
I pity you

609
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,180
because your beautiful appearance

610
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,780
hides a most despicable heart.

611
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,660
You couldn't breathe

612
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,820
in the boundless loneliness,

613
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,420
so you treated Xiao Duo as your savior.

614
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,220
But he refused to save you.

615
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,020
He doesn't even want

616
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,420
to look at you.

617
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:09,940
Shut up!

618
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,540
Do you know why?

619
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,540
Because besides jealousy,

620
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,340
manipulation, hatred, and robbery,

621
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,900
you have nothing.

622
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,260
Have you ever experienced sincerity?

623
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,659
Have you ever felt happiness?

624
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,940
Have you ever loved without reservation?

625
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:25,860
Have you ever trusted him?

626
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:27,780
How did you

627
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,340
get him so smitten with you?

628
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,780
My status is noble.

629
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,179
My title of Empress

630
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,650
is respected by all.

631
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
And you

632
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:38,420
are nothing

633
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,780
but a lowly, baseborn woman.

634
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,900
How dare you compare yourself to me?

635
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,260
But in his eyes,

636
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,100
I'm noble too.

637
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,900
You're noble

638
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,100
because you're Empress Rong'an.

639
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,380
I'm noble

640
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,380
because I am myself.

641
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,900
What? Are you angry?

642
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,660
Here, take this medicine

643
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,780
to calm your anger.

644
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:17,930
How is it?

645
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,780
Doesn't it look familiar?

646
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,180
I made it according to your prescription.

647
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,020
It took me a bit of effort.

648
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,420
You deserve to die

649
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,420
for poisoning me.

650
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,780
But right now,

651
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,620
I'm at Deer's Reed Residence.

652
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,220
Your Majesty,

653
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,500
if you die here,

654
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,500
how could anyone in the palace

655
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,420
ever find out?

656
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,300
Please let me go.

657
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,700
Please let me go.

658
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,740
I'll give you whatever you want.

659
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,830
I promise you.

660
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:57,740
Fine.

661
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,460
Let's talk properly.

662
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,980
Six years ago,

663
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,220
the Prince of Nanyuan came to the capital under imperial edict.

664
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,620
During that time,

665
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,740
who did he meet with

666
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,140
in secret?

667
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,610
How would I know about him?

668
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:16,970
Your Majesty.

669
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,740
I advise you to think about this carefully.

670
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,780
I am

671
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,740
not a patient person.

672
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,460
He has always been cautious.

673
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,060
He keeps many things

674
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,140
from me,

675
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,540
there's a lot I don't know.

676
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,460
I only know about

677
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,540
my meetings with him.

678
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,060
Did you meet with him six years ago?

679
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,460
That time,

680
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,580
it was because of the late Emperor's birthday.

681
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,260
The Prince of Nanyuan came to the capital to celebrate his birthday.

682
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,180
We plotted in secret when we met.

683
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,660
Where did you meet?

684
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,900
I think

685
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,980
it was a teahouse.

686
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,180
Where?

687
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,580
Ruyi Alley.

688

[Deer's Reed Residence]

692
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:06,700
Your Majesty.

693
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,420
I thought you were leaving the palace

694
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,380
to visit the Grand Secretaries.

695
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,140
Now I see that

696
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,180
your intention is something else.

697
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,620
If you understand...

698
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:17,940
Yes.

699
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,860
oP

700
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,580
Where is Consort Duan?

701
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,020
I'm asking you. Where is Consort Duan?

702
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,620
Your Majesty.

703
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,260
This was found outside the north wall.

704
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,700
Her Highness must have escaped.

705
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,220
Escaped?

706
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,180
Where can she go?

707
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,060
We'll go get her from the Bu Residence.

708
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,660
Your Majesty,

709
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:50,740
Lord Bu

710
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,540
probably dares not take Her Highness in.

711
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,580
Who in the capital

712
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,060
would dare help her

713
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,340
go against me?

714
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,570
We'll go the Chief's residence.

715
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,300
How did you meet?

716
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,420
Back then,

717
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,860
after I left the palace,

718
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,930
I pretended to be a member of the Prince of Nanyuan's family.

719
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,660
After disguising myself,

720
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,260
I got on his carriage

721
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,940
to hide my identity,

722
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,460
and entered Ruyi Alley.

723
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,940
On the way back, did you-

724
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,980
Junior!

725
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,850
Save me! Hurry!

726
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:22,980
Save me!

727
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,420
What are you doing?

728
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,700
I haven't finished interrogating her.

729
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,660
You'll have to stop.

730
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,300
Wan Wan asked me to tell you

731
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,140
His Majesty suddenly arrived at Deer's Reed Residence.

732
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,420
For some reason,

733
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,380
he's leading the Imperial Army

734
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,820
to the Chief's residence.

735
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,600
[Imperial City, Xiao's Residence]

736
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,340
Chief.

737
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,380
Why are you here?

738
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,020
Did something happen to Her Highness?

739
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,220
Nothing.

740
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,380
Go back to Deer's Reed Residence and keep watch.

741
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,700
I'm going to Changqing Palace.

742
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,940
The murderer six years ago

743
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:53,980
might have been Rong'an.

744
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,780
Her again?

745
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,260
What do you mean?

746
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,770
I can't tell you.

747
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,020
Why not?

748
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,220
Her Highness-

749
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:05,900
Her Highness ordered me

750
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,780
not to tell you.

751
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,300
She has your ring,

752
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,740
I dare not disobey.

753
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,860
What did she ask you to hide from me?

754
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:13,820
Master!

755
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,660
Master!

756
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,820
Master!

757
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,060
Master!

758
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,420
His Majesty has surrounded the residence

759
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,860
with the Imperial Army!

760
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,300
Greetings, Your Majesty.

761
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,500
Where is she?

762
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,700
Who are you looking for?

763
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,380
Deer's Reed Residence is heavily guarded.

764
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,780
Other than you,

765
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,180
who has the capability

766
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,420
to kidnap someone from under my nose?

767
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,060
Where is Yinlou?

768
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,900
Her Highness is missing?

769
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,700
Playing dumb?

770
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,700
Do you really think

771
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,120
I dare not kill you?

772
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,220
Your Majesty,

773
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,980
you mustn't be impulsive.

774
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,580
Since Your Majesty has ordered me to die,

775
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,100
I dare not refuse.

776
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,340
It's only that Her Highness' whereabouts are still unknown.

777
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,460
Your Majesty,

778
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,460
please allow me to send my men

779
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,580
to search for Her Highness.

780
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,530
Your Majesty, please allow me to send my men

781
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,020
to search for Her Highness.

782
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,900
Your Majesty, we found Her Highness.

783
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,660
Chief,

784
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,780
are you okay?

785
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,660
What happened to her?

786
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,620
Tell me everything.

787
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,660
Yinlou!

788
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,060
Yinlou!

789
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,260
What's wrong with her?

790
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:27,460
Madam.

791
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,620
Madam, you-

792
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,700
Madam.

793
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:30,780
Madam.

794
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:31,900
You-
