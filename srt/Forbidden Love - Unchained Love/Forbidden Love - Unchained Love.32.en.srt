8
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,970
I have something important to tell you.

9
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,160
While His Majesty is recovering from injury,

10
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,490
he won't have the energy to think about us.

11
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,370
I've already started preparing in the meantime.

12
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,010
But it will need a bit more time.

13
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,160
Be it the route we leave by,

14
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,530
or what will become of my men at Zhaoding Bureau,

15
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,560
I'll need to work something out.

16
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,890
We'll leave

17
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,890
once I'm done dealing with all those.

18
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:13,920
Really?

19
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,450
I'm afraid your life together with me

20
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,480
will be difficult in the future.

21
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,170
Then you can follow me instead.

22
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,650
At worst, I'll just change

23
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,890
my aspiration of bumming around

24
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,240
and be more hardworking.

25
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,450
In the future, with every mouthful of rice I get,

26
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,800
I'll feed you a mouthful of rice too.

27
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,040
That's good.

28
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,520
It's a deal then.

29
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,360
By the way,

30
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,490
I packed some things for our journey.

31
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,690
Have a look to see if we're still missing anything.

32
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,450
This is what you meant by

33
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,370
'packed some things'?

34
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,380
I've already sent away

35
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,640
most of our possessions.

36
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,650
These are just some money we'll bring as travel expenses.

37
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,040
We can only pack lightly this time,

38
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,120
so it's a little shabby.

39
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,730
You'll have to suffer for a bit.

40
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,209
As long as I can be with you,

41
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,690
this bit of suffering

42
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,370
is bearable for me.

43
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,530
You're blinded by money.

44
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,400
Instead of hugging these inanimate things,

45
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,840
you might as well come hug me.

46
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,090
He is in the imperial prison.

47
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,880
Do you want to visit him?

48
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,280
He is guilty of treason, which is punishable by death.

49
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,680
I'm afraid this meeting

50
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,440
might be your last time seeing him.

51
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,480
With things like this now,

52
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,960
he won't want to see me.

53
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,240
I don't want to see him either.

54
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,060
Those knee pads you were rushing to make,

55
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,600
who are they for then?

56
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,520
I-

57
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,960
I made them for you.

58
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,730
I'm young and strong.

59
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,880
I don't need that.

60
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,490
Since you've made it, give them to him.

61
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,930
Don't waste your effort.

62
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,080
Your legs can't be exposed to the cold.

63
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,130
The imperial prison is cold and dark.

64
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,600
These knee pads

65
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:58,610
are for you.

66
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,970
You unfilial girl.

67
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,400
You ruined me,

68
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,360
and ruined the Bu family.

69
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,760
The Bu family was so illustrious back then.

70
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,090
But it gradually went into decline

71
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,490
in my generation,

72
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,760
and was looked down upon by others.

73
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,090
I joined the Prince of Nanyuan

74
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,330
so that I could

75
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,080
earn credit by supporting the future ruler

76
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,600
and regain the glory of our family.

77
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,770
But all this,

78
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,360
all this was ruined by you.

79
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,570
You are my blood-related daughter.

80
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,300
But yet, instead of being grateful,

81
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,280
you chose to help others,

82
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,840
and ruined all my years of careful planning.

83
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,400
Do you think that

84
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,890
I, as your daughter,

85
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,690
have let you down?

86
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,520
In my heart,

87
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,600
you have let me down

88
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,010
as a father too.

89
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,250
As father and daughter, we're not too different from each other.

90
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,240
Unfilial wench!

91
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,520
I was wrong.

92
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,320
I was wrong to have

93
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,050
birthed a child like you!

94
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,040
Father.

95
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,570
Let me tell you a joke.

96
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,640
When I entered the palace,

97
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,600
I kept having the same dream.

98
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,159
In my dream,

99
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,730
on the day I entered the palace,

100
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,210
you were following me from a distance

101
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,160
behind my sedan.

102
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,320
You were calling my name

103
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,210
and we travelled like that for a long while.

104
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,760
Just like before,

105
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,650
you were still calling me Zhuo Ying,

106
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,570
and I was still calling you Father.

107
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,730
But I know

108
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,810
you didn't come on the day I entered the palace.

109
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,970
Be it me,

110
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,240
or Bu Yinge,

111
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,330
we're both just

112
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,690
pawns for your plot for power.

113
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,920
I too once wished,

114
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,440
I wished that you could

115
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,920
love me and dote on me

116
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,920
like a normal father,

117
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,570
even if it was just for a moment.

118
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,600
But I know

119
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,010
there is never a time that that will happen.

120
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,370
Isn't it funny?

121
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,370
As father and daughter,

122
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,560
we are the closest, but yet the most distant.

123
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,770
In this life,

124
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,560
I can only go this far with you.

125
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,650
From now on,

126
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,010
I won't dream about anything anymore.

127
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,960
I hope you'll feel comfortable wearing these knee pads.

128
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,960
If you don't like it,

129
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,480
just throw it away.

And you need the palace servants around to take care of you.

Don't worry, with me around,

I am in this situation

182

all thanks to Yuwen Liangshi.

183
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,360
I'm going to crush him into pieces

to vent my anger.

185
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,480
Also,

that Yuwen Liangxu.

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,610
I want him to die.

188
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,800
I'm going to sentence every member of the Yuwen clan

189
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,490
to death by slow slicing.

Your Majesty.

191
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,370
Indeed, they do deserve death.

192
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:04,930
But the Yuwen family

193
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,890
is quite popular among the people in West Shu.

194
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,210
If the Yuwen clan is overthrown,

195
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,650
I'm afraid there will be chaos in West Shu.

196
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,570
Why don't we keep them

197
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,410
to stabilize West Shu?

198
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,160
This will speak to your benevolence and reputation

199
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,680
and also secure the hearts of the people and the country.

Fine.

201

I can spare them from the death penalty,

202
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,170
but I'll make sure they pay for it even if they are alive.

But yet I can't ignore his last request

211

before he died.

However,

213
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,250
this is the most that I can do.

214

But for Young Prince Yuwen,

215
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,650
being demoted to a commoner

216
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,440

You don’t have to, Chief Xiao.

346
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,290
Her Highness is concerned about His Majesty,

347
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,770
and insisted on

348
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,280
serving His Majesty personally.

349
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:27,970
Your Majesty.

350
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,700
The Imperial Hospital came up with

351
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,680
a new prescription that is better suited for you.

352
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,370
Since Her Highness wants to

353
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,360
serve His Majesty personally,

354
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,010
why don't we get Her Highness

355
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,850
to brew the new medicine for His Majesty?

356
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,770
I'll brew it.

357
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,340
[Prescription]

358
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,370
Bastard.

359
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,650
What new prescription?

360
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,100
Isn't it just the old prescription

361
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,440
written in reverse now?

362
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,290
Your Highness was so quick to

363
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,970
rush to the Emperor's side to serve him.

364
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,180
I guess brewing this medicine

365
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,290
is no big deal for you either.

366
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,080
These cherries look familiar.

367
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,130
They look rather like

368
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,080
the ones I sent over to you.

369
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,290
Don't all cherries

370
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,000
look the same?

371
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,160
How can you even tell?

372
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,280
This medicine isn't brewed well.

373
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,570
Don't make trouble for me.

374
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,920
If you piss me off, I...

375
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,850
What are you going to do?

376
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:26,890
I...

377
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,050
Since it's a new prescription,

378
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,530
we should be more careful.

379
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,970
According to the rules in the palace,

380
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:48,770
for the first time brewing any medicine,

381
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,760
you will need to brew ten pots to practice.

382
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,810
Ten pots?

383
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,660
Why haven't I heard of this?

384
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,450
Who set the rule?

385
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,200
Tell him to come out.

386
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,400
I just set it.

387
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,760
It's not that

388
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,280
I willingly went over today.

389
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,890
At first, His Majesty lost his temper,

390
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,810
and wanted to dig out the eyes of all the maids in the room.

391
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,400
So much blood,

392
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,770
how scary would that have been?

393
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,690
I know I was wrong.

394
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,490
I know you did it for my own good.

395
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,080
If anything happens in the future,

396
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,000
I'll discuss with you in advance.

397
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,410
I won't act on my own.

398
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,880
Don't be angry.

399
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,280
His Majesty just suffered a huge shock,

400
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
and his mood is unstable.

401
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,960
You'd better stay away from him.

402
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,810
After you send the medicine in later,

403
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,810
don't go to his room again.

404
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,610
If anything happens,

405
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,130
just get me to go over and deal with it.

406
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,730
Then...can you reduce the number of pots of medicine I have to brew?

407
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,000
No.

408
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,490
I said ten pots,

409
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,570
not a single pot less.

410
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,170
If I don't punish you, you won't learn your lesson.

411
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,240
Have you learnt your lesson?

412
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,760
Of course, of course I've learnt my lesson.

413
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,250
I'll brew it faster.

414
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,450
The smoke is getting into my eyes and nose.

415
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,320

Slow down.

423
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,730

00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,000
Yes.

00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,440

or how much of it was out of my control,

499
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,250
the fact is that I still lied to many people.

501
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,890

Tell me,

507
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,640
was it wrong of us after all?

00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,760
a completely different era.

518
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,930
By then,

519
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,840
there will be no concept of nobility

520
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,090
or monarchy,

521
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,220
nor emperors and concubines,

522
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,210
masters and slaves.

523
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,360
And there won't be people like you and me

524
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,080
who can't have freedom.

525
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,400
By then,

526
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,260
there may be someone

527
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,120
who might say we are right.

528
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:04,840
And there must be people

529
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
saying that we are in the wrong.

530
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,000
But so what?

531
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,720
I don't care in the least.

532
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,000
Do you care?

533
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,850
I do care about it somewhat.

534
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,810
After all,

535
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,340
I'm not as experienced at

536
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,400
being scolded as you are.

537
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,360
But I have you.

538
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,120
I'm not afraid.

539
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,570
Don't worry.

540
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,210
I've arranged everything

541
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,290
relating to our departure.

542
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,130
I've requested an edict

543
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,650
to take you to buy supplies tomorrow.

544
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,960
We'll leave tomorrow.

545
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,290
We're leaving tomorrow?

546
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,410
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

547
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,850
It's rare to see

548
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,930
you looking all miserable.

549
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,440
I'll miss it, so I wanted to enjoy it for a bit more.

550
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,250
Then I'll make you miserable too.

551
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,480
Try then.

552
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,440
This...

553
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,010
How can this be?

554
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,130
But Xiao Duo is a...

555
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,880
Xiao Duo is actually a fake eunuch?

556
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,690
The man having secret relations with Yinlou

557
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,730
was him after all.

558
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,290
So I was a joke

559
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,970
all along.

560
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,440
I was a joke all along.

561
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,530
Bu Yinlou.

562
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,440
Xiao Duo.

563
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,530
For playing me all this time,

564
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,930
I'll make sure you two suffer

565
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,810
a fate worse than death.

566
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,360
This way please, Your Highness.

567
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:37,840
Your Majesty.

568
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,120
You're back.

569
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:40,730
Have a seat.

570
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,440
Recently, operas are popular among the people.

571
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,890
So I invited a troupe over

572
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,050
for you to enjoy,

573
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,240
and liven things up a bit.

574
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,290
Do you know why

575
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,600
this play became popular?

576
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,680
It's all because of

577
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,690
Consort Duan and Chief Xiao.

578
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,930
♫ No one knows I'm a true man ♫

579
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,970
♫ Pretending to be a eunuch hiding in the palace ♫

580
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,170
♫ O, how foolish is the Emperor ♫

581
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,730
♫ Sending a beauty into my tent! ♫

582
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,490
♫ O, how foolish is the Emperor ♫

583
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:30,560
♫ Sending me into your tent! ♫

584
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,940
Consort Duan and Chief Xiao have made

585
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,080
great contributions in pacifying the rebellion.

586
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,130
You two are now

587
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,210
the most popular figures in the capital.

588
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,220
There are also rumors that

589
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,420
the two of you watched an opera

590
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,650
together in West Shu.

591
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,080
The people are busy imitating you two

592
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,960
and it actually became a trend.

593
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,680
Look.

594
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,890
How exciting is this show!

595
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,970
It's about the story of how

596
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,800
Consort Duan risked her life to deliver the edict,

597
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,200
and Chief Xiao suppressing the rebellion.

598
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,520
But,

599
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,640
I didn't think it was a good performance,

600
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,970
so I asked them to add in a scene.

601
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,930
He's my real man.

602
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,090
What a pair of adulterers!

603
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,330
I want both of you

604
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,130
to end up together in Hell!
