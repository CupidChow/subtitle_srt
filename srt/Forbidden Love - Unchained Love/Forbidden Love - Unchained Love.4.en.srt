[Episode 4]

4
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,539
Are you determined

5
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:44,780
to make things difficult for me?

6
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,259
Please listen to me.

7
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,700
You tried your best

8
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,300
to keep me alive

9
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,980
because you want to win over Prince Fu, right?

10
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,740
Yes.

11
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,540
But now is not the time.

12
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,780
What if

13
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,139
because of me,

14
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,180
the Empress manages to

15
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,540
get something on Prince Fu,

16
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,900
and ruins your plan?

17
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,420
You don't want that, right?

18
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,380
Right.

19
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,460
You should hold him off first.

20
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,460
Hold him off?

21
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,329
Yes.

22
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,620
They say that important people are forgetful.

23
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,180
Keep him happy for now.

24
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,700
After a while,

25
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,780
he won't even remember who I am anymore.

26
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,140
I'm going to save my Mistress.

27
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,700
Stop! Stop!

28
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,380
Come back!

29
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:41,820
Let go of me!

30
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,260
No.

31
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,140
I said you can't go in.

32
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,220
You can't go in.

33
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,940
You mean

34
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,140
you don't want to be with Prince Fu,

35
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,540
you want to be with me?

36
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,420
Yes.

37
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,420
That's roughly what I mean.

38
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:11,620
No.

39
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,620
Why does that

40
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,860
sound so awkward?

41
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:17,740
But

42
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,340
it seems that Prince Fu and you

43
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,740
are not that close.

44
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,890
You

45
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,570
must keep me close

46
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,540
as a bargaining chip.

47
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,860
From now on, let's work together.

48
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,740
Let's collude.

49
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,260
You barely have to lift a finger

50
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,740
to help me.

51
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,300
Are you really willing

52
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,260
to conspire and collude

53
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,460
with me?

54
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,420
Yes.

55
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,220
I'm more than willing.

56
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,220
I don't understand.

57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,460
It's not like Prince Fu

58
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,820
is an unappealing middle-aged man.

59
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,700
Are you refusing him

60
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,940
because there is someone you like?

61
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,020
I wish.

62
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,579
But there isn't.

63
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,860
Since there isn't,

64
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,820
why are you hesitating?

65
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,180
Given Prince Fu's status,

66
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,380
your future is infinitely promising.

67
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,260
Why waste your life?

68
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,860
If you're afraid the title of Consort Dowager

69
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,500
will make it inconvenient in the future,

70
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,500
I can take care of it.

71
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,820
You're right.

72
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,459
But I don't want to.

73
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,300
I'm happy to sit around doing nothing,

74
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,660
and waste my life away.

75
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,740
You're pulling all the stops

76
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,300
just so you can sit around doing nothing,

77
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,100
living a wasted existence?

78
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,460
You're really something.

79
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,700
Of course.

80
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,980
That's all I've got, though.

81
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,260
As for ambition,

82
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,140
I'll leave it to those

83
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,100
who need it.

84
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,020
I just hope

85
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,300
to live on like this.

86
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:49,380
You've climbed the ladder by your own efforts.

87
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,300
I'm sitting around by my own efforts too.

88
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,700
You don't know what I'll be capable of

89
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,900
if you push me too hard.

90
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,980
What will you do if I push you too hard?

91
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,480
I...

92
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,100
Let go.

93
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,920
No.

94
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,540
Let go!

95
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,020
No.

96
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,060
Fine.

97
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,210
and then leave me behind.

98
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,420
Mistress.

99
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,740
Mistress.

100
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,180
What...

101
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,740
What happened?

102
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,420
I promise you.

103
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:34,980
What did you say?

104
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,500
Before the situation is certain,

105
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,540
I will try to hold Prince Fu back,

106
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,740
and protect you.

107
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,980
Really?

108
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,659
Your Highness, can you let me go now?

109
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:45,900
There's no hurry.

110
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:46,740
How about

111
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,659
you leave a note

112
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:50,860
with a fingerprint?

113
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,980
It's not that I don't trust you.

114
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,380
You are a powerful man.

115
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,540
Let's follow the proper procedure

116
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,940
as a guarantee

117
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,180
to each other.

118
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,100
There's no need for a note,

119
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,780
I'll leave a seal instead.

120
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,420
This copper ring was bestowed by the late Emperor.

121
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,180
Having it is like having me present in person.

122
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:16,860
I'll take it.

123
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,940
Here.

124
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:23,660
Godfather.

125
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,340
I left in a hurry and didn't bring any ink.

126
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,020
Why do you need ink?

127
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,260
What can't be ink?

128
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,740
It's done.

129
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,940
You have to protect me.

130
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,180
You can't go back on your word.

131
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,300
I have to take good care of the Fish Immortal.

132
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,860
It's really efficacious.

133
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,340
By the way,

134
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,060
are you taking back

135
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,020
the gold and jewels?

136
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,420
Since I've given them to you,

137
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,300
they're yours.

138
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,180
Okay.

139
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,140
Have one.

140
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,540
Godfather,

141
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,620
do you really trust

142
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,820
Consort Dowager Duan?

143
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,580
This Bu Yinlou

144
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,180
pretends to be obedient

145
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,140
and naive.

146
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:36,500
I won't believe

147
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:37,300
anything she says.

148
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,140
She pulled out all the stops

149
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,980
and almost lost her life,

150
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:41,940
just to be able to sit around and do nothing?

151
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,740
Would you believe such nonsense?

152
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,500
What does she want then?

153
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,300
Prince Fu hasn't taken power yet.

154
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,580
She probably doesn't want to get locked in too early.

155
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,980
So she's taking a step back

156
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,860
and using me to take the heat off her.

157
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,940
She'll make a decision

158
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,100
when the situation becomes certain.

159
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,860
She's quite cautious.

160
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,980
She's not a careless one at all.

161
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,140
Then why did you promise her?

162
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,340
She's using you.

163
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,700
She said one thing right.

164
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,060
As long as I have her in my custody,

165
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,340
she is a bargaining chip.

166
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,220
Would you care about

167
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,420
what a chip is thinking?

168
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,100
Prince Fu is unreliable.

169
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,940
It's hard to say if we can get him into position.

170
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,300
We can't give her to him so easily.

171
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:25,860
As long as

172
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,220
Bu Yinlou is under my control,

173
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,500
he wouldn't dare mess up our plans.

174
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,700
She and I

175
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,179
both get what we want.

176
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,059
That's good.

177
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,850
I saw that you were

178
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,020
expending considerable effort on her.

179
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:39,980
I really thought

180
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,659
she had you fooled.

181
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,140
It's just a petty trick.

182
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,860
How could she fool me?

183
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,220
Your Highness,

184
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,100
it took a long time to make these lanterns,

185
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,980
why are you taking them apart?

186
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,780
I made such a big fool of myself

187
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,220
in front of Yinlou.

188
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,740
She must hate me now.

189
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,020
I knew it.

190
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,740
I...

191
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,340
can't do anything well.

192
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,660
I'm useless.

193
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,660
How is that possible, Your Highness?

194
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,100
Her Highness even praised the lantern.

195
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,220
She likes it.

196
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,620
She...

197
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,500
She did say it was pretty.

198
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,140
That's right, Your Highness.

199
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,100
Her Highness said it's pretty,

200
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,900
that means she likes it.

201
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:16,580
That makes sense.

202
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,580
Then

203
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,220
I will make another one for her.

204
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,420
That'll make her happy, right?

205
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:21,980
Yes.

206
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,700
Great.

207
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,100
I'll leave you to it.

208
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,900
Okay.

209
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,620
Good.

210
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,580
Murong Gaogong.

211
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,380
It's all your fault

212
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,780
for telling on us to Grand Tutor Fu.

213
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,300
Now, all of us have to write lines.

214
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
You little bastard

215
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,180
without a mother.

216
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,420
How dare you come with us

217
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,660
to listen to the Grand Tutor's lectures?

218
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,300
You're so tall

219
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,260
but so timid.

220
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,570
What a loser.

221
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,340
He's afraid of the dark.

222
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,250
Let's lock him up here,

223
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,340
and teach him a lesson.

224
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:17,980
Okay.

225
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:18,940
Let's go.

226
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,340
No! No!

227
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,340
Don't leave me

228
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,180
alone here.

229
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,260
No!

230
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,700
No!

231
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,380
Don't leave me

232
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,180
alone here.

233
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,490
No.

234
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,420
My name is Bu Yinlou.

235
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,580
♫ In the late autumn, for whom do the swallows wait ♫

236
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,100
Why are you here alone?

237
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,420
I'll bring you out.

238
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,210
♫ Lingering among the flowers and turning sallow ♫

239
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,000
♫ Are you also ♫

240
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,620
♫ Wallowing in sorrow ♫

241
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,740
♫ The moon crescents ♫

242
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,410
♫ The song of moonlight in my previous life ♫

243
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,110
♫ It's still conjecture ♫

244
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,180
♫ My song of moonlight ♫

245
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,750
♫ Who will I sing it with ♫

246
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,270
♫ The candle is out ♫

247
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,800
♫ How do I cover my dried tears ♫

248
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:34,860
♫ It's my fault for being too harsh ♫

249
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,460
W- Who is it?

250
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,710
Sun Taiqing.

251
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,700
Sun Taiqing!

252
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,100
Coming.

253
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,940
Your Highness.

254
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:47,790
Your Highness.

255
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,620
Someone's here.

256
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,300
Someone's here!

257
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:49,900
Someone's here!

258
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,060
No one's here.

259
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:52,700
Look.

260
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,780
Take a look.

261
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,260
A Heart Like Bamboo

262
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,340
Do you realize that

263
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,540
you killed your own nephew,

264
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,940
the Crown Prince of the Great Ye?

265
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,180
His death

266
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,820
will implicate both

267
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,980
the Zhaoding Bureau and Prince Fu's residence!

268
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,740
Chief Xiao,

269
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,300
y- you are out of line.

270
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:12,740
You-

271
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,260
Get lost!

272
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,180
I know...

273
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,620
I know where you're coming from.

274
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,100
But what's done is done.

275
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:19,530
I…

276
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,180
Chief Xiao.

277
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,820
I beg of you,

278
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,140
please save me.

279
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,940
At this point,

280
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,660
we can only take a gamble.

281
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,060
Cao Chun'ang.

282
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,910
Bring forward the plan!

283
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:34,780
Yes!

284
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:39,780
Help me.

285
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,380
You must do

286
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,580
what I say.

287
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,380
I- I’ll do

288
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,460
whatever Chief Xiao tells me to.

289
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,850
Y- Your Highness.

290
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,100
Your Highness.

291
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,640
[Futu Pagoda]

292
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,100
Is this true?

293
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,180
That eunuch

294
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,580
talked nonsense as soon as he came in,

295
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,300
and then fell unconscious.

296
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,780
I dare not take him seriously.

297
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,660
Chief Xiao,

298
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,220
tell me.

299
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,580
How could Prince Rong have died,

300
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,540
just like that?

301
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,220
Your Majesty,

302
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,940
the Imperial Hospital reported that

303
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,700
Prince Rong died from a head injury.

304
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,460
Prince Fu.

305
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,380
Prince Rong was with you all along.

306
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,700
Why did he go to Futu Pagoda

307
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,900
this late at night?

308
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,620
I was making lanterns in my residence,

309
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,100
I don't know anything.

310
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,730
The servants

311
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,620
told me that

312
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,660
Prince Rong was calling for his mother in his dream.

313
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:47,620
Then...

314
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,260
Then he disappeared.

315
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,580
A half-grown child

316
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,180
somehow entered the Imperial City,

317
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,660
and then suddenly barged into the Futu Pagoda.

318
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,300
It's ridiculous.

319
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,540
When the guard wakes up,

320
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,820
bring him here.

321
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:21,940
Tell me.

322
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,580
What did you see?

323
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,700
Your Majesty,

324
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,860
It was extremely strange

325
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,290
tonight.

326
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,780
There was no wind in the hall,

327
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,460
but the light in front of the Noble Consort's spirit tablet

328
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,410
went out several times.

329
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,260
At some point,

330
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,900
Prince Rong walked in,

331
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,450
looking sleepy.

332
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,540
Then I saw...

333
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,260
I saw...

334
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,820
What did you see?

335
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:45,700
Tell me.

336
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,260
I saw

337
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,460
Her Highness' coffin

338
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,460
suddenly falling off.

339
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,700
She got up in the coffin

340
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,860
and her throat was gurgling.

341
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,220
Prince Rong called her "Mother",

342
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,140
and then crashed into the coffin.

343
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,180
His head was covered in blood.

344
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,940
Then, the coffin

345
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,220
returned to its place.

346
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,020
How could this happen?

347
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,620
Did you see it clearly?

348
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,690
Your Highness.

349
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,700
This concerns a member of the royal family,

350
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,620
I dare not lie.

351
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,900
The Noble Consort must be missing her son,

352
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,820
so her spirit returned

353
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,660
and took Prince Rong away.

354
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,220
What are you saying?

355
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,420
It's obviously a trick.

356
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,700
Send someone to investigate

357
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,060
and find out the truth.

358
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,180
Take him away.

359
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:48,740
Your Majesty.

360
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,820
Prince Rong's death

361
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,180
pains me.

362
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,100
But the country can’t be without an emperor.

363
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,460
The Ye Dynasty has persisted

364
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,820
for over 260 years.

365
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,340
In this generation,

366
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,940
few royal offspring are left.

367
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,100
With Prince Rong gone,

368
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,500
only one member

369
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,700
is left of the Murong family.

370
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,900
Chief Xiao,

371
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,380
what do you mean?

372
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,980
Prince Fu is a great man,

373
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,300
who has achieved immense wisdom.

374
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,180
Please take charge of the situation

375
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,820
and perpetuate the glory of the Great Ye.

376
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,940
Please take charge of the situation

377
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,060
and perpetuate the glory of the Great Ye.

378
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,380
Please take charge of the situation

379
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,500
and perpetuate the glory of the Great Ye.

380
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,980
Please take charge of the situation

381
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,860
and perpetuate the glory of the Great Ye.

382
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,740
Your Majesty.

383
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,420
You...

384
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:10,390
Abyss Clear and Jade Clean

385
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,820
Mistress.

386
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,580
Mistress.

387
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:18,740
I've got it.

388
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,180
What is it?

389
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,540
I've got it.

390
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,420
Prince Fu is going to become the emperor.

391
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,220
It seems that Prince Rong has really...

392
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,100
Everyone in the palace says it was the Noble Consort

393
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,860
who returned to take Prince Rong away.

394
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,140
Others must be saying

395
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,780
it was Chief Xiao,

396
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:38,500
who did it to

397
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,060
make Prince Fu the emperor.

398
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,260
Amazing. You are right.

399
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,340
You also went to ask around?

400
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,180
No need.

401
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,470
It does seem like

402
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,340
something he's capable of.

403
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,820
But I think

404
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,740
he won't do that.

405
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,660
Mistress.

406
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,580
you've gotten me confused.

407
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,980
Was it him

408
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,460
or not?

409
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,740
Forget it.

410
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,340
It must be him.

411
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,500
He has the blood of innumerable people

412
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,700
on his hands.

413
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:11,900
There's nothing that

414
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,460
he's incapable of.

415
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,420
Mistress,

416
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,340
you must avoid him

417
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,500
as much as possible.

418
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,820
What if he goes berserk,

419
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,180
and harms you too?

420
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,700
How about

421
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,140
I go and hide somewhere?

422
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:22,980
Okay.

423
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:23,970
I'll go

424
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,980
pack your luggage right away.

425
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,700
You really will believe anything.

426
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,620
Prince Rong

427
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,620
Chief Xiao,

428
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,340
what will happen to me in the future?

429
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,320
Prince Rong

430
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,180
Did you really kill Prince Rong?

431
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,820
Rumor has it

432
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,100
that I killed Prince Rong.

433
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,500
Why do you have to ask?

434
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,220
I don't believe it.

435
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:40,860
Why?

436
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,660
Because you're handsome.

437
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,460
Anyone who can look like this

438
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,500
is surely not a bad person.

439
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,860
It's actually very simple.

440
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,220
You're smart

441
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,380
so you won't waste your time

442
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,020
doing unnecessary things.

443
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,940
If you really

444
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,140
intended to change the Emperor,

445
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,020
you wouldn't have tried so hard

446
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,900
to get Prince Rong out of the Imperial City,

447
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,300
in the very beginning.

448
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,420
You would have killed him

449
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,580
in secret

450
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,180
and framed the Empress.

451
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,180
So.

452
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,340
You didn't kill him.

453
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,020
You know me well.

454
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,460
But there's one thing

455
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,420
I still don't understand.

456
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,170
You're not related to Prince Rong.

457
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,300
You don't seem

458
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,060
like a sentimental person either.

459
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,940
Why are you

460
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,580
so affected by Prince Rong's death?

461
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:58,940
I see.

462
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,020
Because you feel guilty.

463
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,820
You said you would protect him.

464
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,980
But you failed.

465
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,580
In life,

466
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,260
things often go against our wishes,

467
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,340
we can rarely get what we want.

468
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,050
Even powerful people

469
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,080
like you

470
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,890
are helpless at times.

471
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,010
You are human,

472
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,340
not a deity.

473
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,450
Wanting everything to be under your control

474
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,940
is a kind of arrogance.

475
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,140
It's an illness.

476
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,060
It has to be treated.

477
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,020
You're saying I'm sick?

478
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,180
Watch your mouth.

479
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,860
You’re a good person,

480
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,180
I’m comforting you.

481
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,820
I can't stand

482
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,020
you being misunderstood like this.

483
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,500
The entirety of the Great Ye

484
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,260
regards me as a reprobate.

485
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,060
Everyone hates me, resents me,

486
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,140
and treats me with contempt.

487
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,500
People like me

488
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,050
will only

489
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
go down in history

490
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,060
with a bad name.

491
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,180
Only you would

492
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,100
call me a good person.

493
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:09,740
Chief Xiao,

494
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,380
I’ll take you to a place.

495
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,060
Let's go.

496
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,400
[Imperial Kitchen, Tea Garden]

497
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,140
Why did you bring me

498
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,900
to the tea garden of the Imperial Kitchen?

499
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,500
Keep your voice down.

500
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,460
We sneaked in,

501
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,220
we have to be stealthy.

502
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,060
Look.

503
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,490
This is the daylily.

504
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,140
Its root is highly poisonous,

505
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,020
even beasts and snakes avoid it.

506
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,860
But experienced chefs know that

507
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,940
after it is blanched in boiling water,

508
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,420
it tastes

509
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,220
refreshing and sweet.

510
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,980
Meat stewed in it is especially fragrant.

511
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,180
That's why it's also called the "sorrow-forgetting grass".

512
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,500
People usually judge a person

513
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,780
based on superficial appearances.

514
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,700
That's because

515
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,320
it's easy for them to do that.

516
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,500
Some people

517
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,780
are like this daylily,

518
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,100
living in a dangerous environment.

519
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,660
If they were completely harmless,

520
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,140
they would only be harmed by others.

521
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,180
But even so,

522
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,660
under the superficial cruelty,

523
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,900
remains

524
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,500
a unique sweetness.

525
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,260
Just like you.

526
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,020
Are you thinking

527
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,500
I spoke very well

528
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,700
and very touchingly?

529
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,460
Why am I

530
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,620
so eloquent?

531
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,460
What are you trying to do,

532
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,740
putting so much thought into this?

533
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,380
Don't you understand?

534
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,740
I want to make you happy.

535
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,100
You are quite honest.

536
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,220
So, did I succeed

537
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,620
or not?

538
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,900
This should be considered stealing.

539
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,820
You seem well-practiced,

540
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,620
are you a habitual offender?

541
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,780
What are you talking about?

542
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,660
I'm still a concubine.

543
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,500
Is it considered stealing

544
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,140
when a concubine takes it?

545
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,940
I'm only taking a look.

546
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,100
Just looking around.

547
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,340
Surely you won't tell

548
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,140
the Head of the Imperial Kitchen?

549
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:20,540
Who is it?

550
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,540
Stand up.

551
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,100
Who are you?

552
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,380
Please pull rank for me.

553
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,450
I told you to stand up. Didn't you hear me?

554
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,820
-Let me feel... -Stand up.

555
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,570
what it feels like to have a backer.

556
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:37,700
Xiao-

557
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,060
Greetings, Chief Xiao.

558
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,500
If you want tea,

559
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,300
just tell me

560
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,340
to send it to you.

561
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,020
Having a backer

562
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,900
is nice indeed.

563
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,460
Godfather, where have you been?

564
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,100
I've been looking for you.

565
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:11,900
What is it?

566
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,700
We have news from Zhongshan.

567
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,700
Something this big has happened,

568
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,380
so why hasn't Yuwen Liangshi contacted me

569
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,260
at all?

570
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,500
Your Highness.

571
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,900
Our secret messenger

572
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,820
was caught by the Zhaoding Bureau.

573
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,700
Most of the officials

574
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,530
have also turned to support Prince Fu.

575
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:44,980
Your Highness.

576
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,300
Chief Xiao is trying to

577
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,460
corner you.

578
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,100
If they want Prince Fu

579
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,260
to take the throne,

580
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,700
they'll need my approval.

581
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

582
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,300
What are you doing here again?

583
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,060
I have news

584
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,860
to report.

585
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,780
The night

586
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,380
before Prince Rong died,

587
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,900
I saw Prince Fu sneak into the palace

588
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,860
to meet with Consort Dowager Duan.

589
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,700
I see.

590
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,340
I thought Murong Gaogong

591
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,580
had no ambition.

592
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,660
I wondered why he decided to take the risk this time.

593
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,260
So he was thinking about this.

594
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,700
As long as we have the Consort Dowager,

595
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,260
it'll be easy to control Prince Fu.

596
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,500
If his master falls

597
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,500
before taking the position,

598
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,700
however powerful Chief Xiao is,

599
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,700
he would become nothing more than

600
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,500
a homeless dog.

601
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,540
Who do you think you are?

602
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,140
Who are you to talk about him?

603
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,180
I deserve to die.

604
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,380
I deserve to die. Please forgive me.

605
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,060
Yan Sunlang.

606
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:16,820
Yes.

607
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
There's something

608
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,660
I need you to do.

609
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,900
I'll do as you say.

610
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,420
Lady Zhang.

611
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,420
I already know

612
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,180
what you asked me to do.

613
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,420
Where is it?

614
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,020
This must be done properly.

615
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,860
Don't make any mistake

616
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,780
with that Consort Dowager.

617
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,420
What mistake could I make?

618
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,900
I wonder

619
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,900
why her luck's so good.

620
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:01,700
She died once,

621
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,060
but then made a connection in a high place.

622
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,660
Now she's doing better than ever.

623
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,020
Eunuch Yan,

624
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,260
tell my aunt,

625
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,620
I'll get it done for her.

626
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,710
Abyss Clear and Jade Clean

627
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,100
A bunch of daylily

628
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,740
is enough to make him happy?

629
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,580
That can't be it.

630
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,140
No.

631
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,660
I need to think of other tactics

632
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,260
and try harder next time.

633
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,700
Sister Zhang.

634
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,820
Why are you here?

635
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,020
Greetings, Sister Zhang.

636
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:56,820
Why are you

637
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,020
greeting me?

638
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,580
Have you forgotten?

639
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,380
you are Consort Dowager Duan now.

640
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,700
Right, I am.

641
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:06,980
Then,

642
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,340
I'll get Tong Yun

643
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,179
to serve you tea.

644
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,020
No need.

645
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,780
I've prepared some snacks

646
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,179
and invited a few sisters

647
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,780
to have tea and play cards together.

648
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,420
Come along with us.

649
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,500
Unfortunately,

650
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,219
I just had my meal,

651
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,380
so

652
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,500
I'm a little sleepy now

653
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,900
Sleepy?

654
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,860
You won't be sleepy after two rounds.

655
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,739
Gambling is banned in the Imperial City.

656
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,659
If the guards ask,

657
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,020
what should we say?

658
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,380
Don't worry.

659
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,380
I've sent the guards away.

660
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,260
Just follow me.

661
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,560
Sister Zhang,

662
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,739
you're so thoughtful.

663
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:00,840
Since we are playing cards,

664
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:01,820
fine.

665
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,690
Let's play my cards.

666
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,760
The guards will be back soon.

667
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,060
We have to get going.

668
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,150
Wait a moment.

669
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,740
I'll close the door.

670
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,250
[Empress Rong'an]

671
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:06,010
[Prince Fu's Residence]

672
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,500
Prince Fu is a great man,

673
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,820
who has achieved immense wisdom.

674
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,580
Please take charge of the situation

675
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,260
and perpetuate the glory of the Great Ye.

676
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,360
It's fine if you want to detain me,

677
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,860
but it's not worth it to get violent.

678
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,660
You knew I wanted to detain you?

679
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,760
Of course.

680
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,230
You guys

681
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,770
have it written all over your faces.

682
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,320
You knew and you're not escaping?

683
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,540
I wanted to escape.

684
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,280
I didn't see a chance,

685
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,540
my whole way here.

686
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,140
You're being kidnapped,

687
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,550
but you're not making a scene.

688
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,350
Rather, you're being quite cooperative.

689
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,530
It's my first time. I'm inexperienced.

690
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,370
I was thinking, if I cooperated,

691
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,340
I could suffer less.

692
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,140
You-

693
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,660
Stay away! Stay away!

694
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,220
Stay away!

695
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,370
Bu Yinlou, open the door!

696
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,310
Open the door!

697
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,230
No!

698
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,950
Don't think that you're safe.

699
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,070
By the way, you still don't know

700
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,530
who it is that you offended.

701
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,610
The Empress.

702
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,750
How did you know that?

703
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,820
You're her niece,

704
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,500
there are no other possible candidates.

705
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,460
Bu Yinlou,

706
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,180
don’t think that just because you know Chief Xiao,

707
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,420
someone will come to rescue you.

708
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,770
He has

709
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,740
important affairs to handle,

710
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,740
and has left the city.

711
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,100
He has no time for you now.

712
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,620
Left the city?

713
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,750
Then the leaf tags I left

714
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,940
are useless then.

715
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,820
Just stay inside.

716
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,460
You'll suffer later.

717
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:35,500
Virtue of Jade

718
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,260
Your Highness.

719
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,940
Do you think that

720
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,100
I am useless?

721
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,580
No matter what I want to do,

722
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,220
they all eventually

723
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,540
come to ruin by my own hands.

724
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,300
How could you be useless?

725
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,060
In the future,

726
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,660
you'll become the Emperor.

727
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,820
Emperor?

728
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,680
Father never favored me.

729
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,690
I've always been marginalized

730
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,940
from candidacy for the throne.

731
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,980
Now, I have killed my own nephew

732
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,060
but I want to become Emperor.

733
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,180
Isn't...

734
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,700
isn't the way of this world

735
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,980
truly a joke?

736
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,300
Your Highness.

737
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,650
I have been serving you

738
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,260
since the time Consort Jing was alive.

739
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,460
I've seen you suffer a lot

740
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,020
over the years.

741
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,820
Now, you are about to ascend the throne.

742
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,300
Perhaps,

743
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,660
it's heaven making it up to you.

744
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,540
What you can achieve in the future

745
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,740
is unlimited.

746
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,540
I've never thought about that.

747
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,300
I just want to live a peaceful life

748
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,820
with the woman I love.

749
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,690
But as usual,

750
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,580
that has been ruined by my own doing.

751
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,780
These days, I keep dreaming of Prince Rong

752
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,780
He pulls at my sleeves,

753
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,660
calling me "uncle,"

754
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,540
saying he is in pain,

755
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,620
and asks why I killed him.

756
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,060
I…

757
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,180
Your Highness.

758
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,380
That was just an accident.

759
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,780
It’s not your fault.

760
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,500
Just think of Consort Dowager Duan.

761
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,220
You must climb to the highest position

762
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,930
in order for her

763
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:00,180
to be able to remain by your side.

764
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,690
All of this is worth it.

765
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,100
Is it?

766
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:12,940
Yes.

767
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,460
For Yinlou,

768
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,620
everything is worth it.

769
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,700
Yes, Your Highness.

770
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,020
Your Highness.

771
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,980
Consort Dowager Duan

772
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,500
sent someone with an urgent letter.

773
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:38,490
Bu Yinlou.

774
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,140
Ninth Hall in the southeast. Rescue me, quickly.

775
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,380
Yinlou is in trouble.

776
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,540
Get the carriage ready. I want to enter the palace.

777
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,620
Yes.

778
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,340
I have done it all according to Your Majesty's instructions.

779
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:47,940
The forged letter

780
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,180
has been sent to Prince Fu's residence.

781
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,100
Prince Fu believed it fully.

782
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,820
We just need to wait for him to break in,

783
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,220
playing the knight in shining armor.

784
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,780
The aphrodisiac incense,

785
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,220
made personally by Your Highness,

786
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,780
will be waiting there for them.

787
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,140
Prince Fu will be charged

788
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,100
with the grave crime of incest and immorality.

789
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,260
The law will not tolerate him.

790
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:08,780
It seems

791
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,460
the throne

792
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,700
is not for him to claim after all.

793
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,180
Are you done?

794
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,380
Yes!

795
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,810
You may leave.

796
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,420
I'll take my leave.

797
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,220
Your Highness.

798
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,460
A suitable child has been identified

799
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,860
from a marginal branch of the Murong family.

800
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,300
As long as Prince Fu commits a crime,

801
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,700
he won't be able to ascend the throne.

802
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,180
By then, with the power of your birth clan,

803
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,700
and the support of the Prince of Nanyuan,

804
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,580
a new Emperor will surely be named.

805
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,940
There's nothing Chief Xiao can do then.

806
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,580
If Xiao Duo hadn't

807
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,220
hurt me,

808
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,700
how could a useless member of the Murong clan

809
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,020
make me act out like so?

810
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,020
The naughty cat

811
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,260
has run into someone else's home.

812
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,860
That's okay.

813
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,380
I will pull out its teeth and claws,

814
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,700
and let it feel pain.

815
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,860
It will return home obediently then.
