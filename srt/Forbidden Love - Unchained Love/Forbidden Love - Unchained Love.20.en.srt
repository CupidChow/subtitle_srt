00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:37,880
Put that thing over there.

178
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,289
Do it properly.

179
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,280
Your Highness.

180
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,240
General Zhao...

181
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,680
What General Zhao?

182
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,250
Don't you see that Xiao Duo has sent his men here

183
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,330
to surveil us?

184
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,680
We can't contact

185
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,760
Zhao Lanzhou.

186
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,600
[Mingding Tower]

187
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,120
What is His Highness up to?

188
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,420
He asked me to meet him

189
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,050
a few days ago.

190
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,210
I've been here for days,

191
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,120
but he hasn't showed up.

192
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,120
[General of the Shu Army, Zhao Lanzhou]

193
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,120
General, I heard that

194
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,640
men from the Zhaoding Bureau are at the Prince's residence.

195
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,080
They're making merry and drinking every night.

196
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,280
Why is His Highness

197
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,650
consorting with the eunuchs?

198
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,940
Didn't he say that they are troublesome,

199
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,610
and wanted to get rid of them?

200
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,290
What is he up to?

201
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,720
I also found out that

202
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,570
Young Master Liancheng of Mingding Tower confessed

203
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,410
you were the mastermind

204
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,440
behind Xiao Duo's assassination.

205
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,280
Bastard!

206
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,480
Nonsense!

207
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,580
Well, that entertainer

208
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,970
works for Yuwen Liangshi. What?

209
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,880
That's not right.

210
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,090
Yuwen Liangshi failed to kill Xiao Duo,

211
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,680
and now he wants to deny his involvement in the matter.

212
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,020
He's trying to win Xiao Duo over,

213
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,330
and put the blame on me.

214
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,280
Here are the dishes.

215
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,730
Sorry to keep you waiting.

216
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,170
General, Mingding Tower

217
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,570
is Yuwen Liangshi's territory.

218
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,560
Who would dare carry out an assassination here?

219
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,520
Isn't he trying to silence me?

220
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,600
Yuwen Liangshi,

221
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,690
you betrayed me first.

222
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,330
Don't blame me for what I'm about to do.

223
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,250
Your Highness.

224
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,850
Your Highness.

225
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,480
Aren't you drunk?

226
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,080
Where are you going?

227
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,840
To the toilet.

228
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,960
It's been so long.

229
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,770
Xiao Duo still hasn’t shown up.

230
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,700
Do all of you from the Zhaoding Bureau

231
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,810
plan on treating my residence

232
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,540
like your own home?

233
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,840
You're not planning on leaving?

234
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,200
I have to sneak out of my house

235
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,920
as if I were a thief!

236
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,650
Okay.

237
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,890
I'm leaving!

238
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,840
Yuwen, you bastard!

239
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,290
I'm going to kill you!

240
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,570
Zhao Lanzhou.

241
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,010
You deployed the garrison without permission.

242
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,760
Are you crazy?

243
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,810
You're merely a young master who doesn't know the ways of the army.

244
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,130
You get to order me around,

245
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,840
only because you were born into the right family.

246
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,930
I've worked for you for so many years.

247
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,290
Now, you want my life.

248
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,840
I won't let you off!

249
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,050
Idiot!

250
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,240
You fell into their trap!

251
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:45,840
Don't move!

252
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,610
Don't move!

253
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,800
[Blessings and Prosperity]

254
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,190
[Order]

255
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,240
No wonder you didn't show up.

256
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,760
Turns out it was a set up.

257
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,700
Zhao Lanzhou deployed the garrison in secret,

258
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,040
and attempted to assassinate a nobleman.

259
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,770
Escort him to the capital for interrogation.

260
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,160
Now that I have come to this,

261
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,120
I will drag you down with me.

262
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,250
Xiao Duo,

263
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,320
the one who poisoned you

264
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,920
is him.

265
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,880
He was afraid you would find out

266
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,810
he traded salt

267
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,840
to fund the illicit purchase of weapons for the Shu Army.

268

Zhao Lanzhou.

269
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,680
General Zhao.

270
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,640
You can't say that.

271
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,210
Do you have any evidence?

272
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,560
I did all these

273
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,400
on his behalf.

274
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,320
I kept the military supply ledgers

275
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,880
as evidence.

276
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,210
There are also a few

277
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,400
iron workers who can stand witness.

278
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,720
They are all at my residence.

279
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,840
Go to General Zhao's residence to search for the witnesses.

280
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,450
Yes.

281
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,000
Your Highness, you're planning a rebellion.

282
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,610
That is a capital offense.

283
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,490
Effective immediately,

284
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,810
I will take over command of the Shu Army, on behalf of the court.

285
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,250
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

286
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,760
You will have to be placed under house arrest,

287
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,240
while waiting for the capital's sentencing.

288
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,520
Take him away.

289
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,600
Go.

290
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:21,220
Go.

291
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,640
Go.

Qilang is awaiting your instruction.

296
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,690
Do you know

297
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,010
the direction of the wind tonight?

298
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,120
It's the southwest wind,

299
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,530
blowing in the direction of the capital.

300
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,890
That day, Duo died in the capital.

301
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,240
That day, I died too.

302
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,730
The only one left

303
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,520
was a half-false Xiao Duo.

304
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,200
Tonight,

305
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,200
I have avenged them.

306
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,280
Chief Xiao.

307
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,920
Well played.

308
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,600
You've finally succeeded.

309
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,770
Are you here to

310
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,160
humiliate me on purpose?

311
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,920
Your Highness, you are deeply in debt to me.

312
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,210
We'll have to settle them all, slowly.

313
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,960
I took away your military power

314
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,690
because you touched my people

315
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,010
and offended me.

316
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,930
Now, I'm here

317
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,810
regarding the other debt you owe me.

318
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,010
On the seventh day of the sixth lunar month, six years ago,

319
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,460
Your Highness killed a young man

320
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,210
in Ruyi Alley in the capital.

321
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,040
Do you remember?

322
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,890
Do you think

323
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,130
my crimes are not serious enough?

324
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,610
Is that why you're pinning this

325
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,320
spurious crime on me as well?

326
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,530
Your Highness, you're rich and powerful.

327
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,690
It's much too easy for you to take a life.

328
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,370
Of course you can't remember this.

329
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,810
Do you remember now?

330
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,569
What is this?

331
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,800
Chief Xiao,

332
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,520
do you really think this belongs to me?

333
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,720
There are clearly

334
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,250
traces of perfume on this silk pendant.

335
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,370
It must have been tied to a perfume sachet.

336
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,410
If I come into contact with perfume,

337
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,640
rashes will grow all over my body.

338
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,970
We do not burn incense in my residence,

339
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,290
and neither do we carry perfume sachets.

340
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,410
It can't possibly be mine.

341
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,050
Do you think I'll believe you?

342
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,360
This is a secret of our residence.

343
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,930
Outsiders do not know of it.

344
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,930
Chief Xiao, if you don’t believe me,

345
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,210
you can ask the old servants.

346
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:06,970
They'll tell you.

347
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,200
They all know it.

348
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,140
Six years ago, you went to the capital

349
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,210
to meet with the late Emperor.

350
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,160
You were in the capital.

351
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,680
The night he was murdered,

352
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,050
yours was the only carriage

353
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,170
to enter Ruyi Alley.

354
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,720
I remember now.

355
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,840
When I went to the capital six years ago,

356
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,120
I did go to Ruyi Alley for tea.

357
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:29,960
But at that time,

358
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,210
I was very tired.

359
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,900
Every day before dusk,

360
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,960
I would return to the stage station.

361
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,280
I didn't go out at night.

362
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,880
The stage stations keep records of comings and goings.

363
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,720
Impossible.

364
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,530
That night, I saw the emblem on the carriage

365
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,890
with my own eyes.

366
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,760
It was your carriage.

367
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:50,930
Xiao Duo.

368
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,010
Murong Gaogong gave the order

369
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,490
to kill me.

370
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,410
If you do this privately,

371
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,090
you'll be in contempt of his authority.

372
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,810
You won't meet a good end!

373
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,770
Whether you were the murderer or not,

374
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,200
you sold salt and forged weapons.

375
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,970
Your crimes

376
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,010
are unforgivable.

377
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,810
Wait patiently for the imperial edict.

378
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,250
You'll be executed then.

so I stole a bun

from a store

444
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,520

I couldn't find him.

One day, he came back suddenly,

453
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,610
and gave me half a tael.

454
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,530
He asked me to keep it well.

455
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,040
He was tricked into entering the palace,

456
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,800
and was castrated.

457
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,920

461
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,410
why he went with someone so casually.

462
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,720

00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,680
that person promised him money.

464
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,600
All he thought was

465
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,250
he could bring me

466
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,440
a roast chicken when he came back.

467
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,880
I often think,

468
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,130
if I hadn't

469
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,490
stolen that bun back then,

470
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,360
would Duo not have entered the palace?

471
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,810
Would he not have died?

472
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,400

00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,370

I hate myself.

476
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,330
I hate that when he was

477
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,370
tricked into entering the palace,

478
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,570
I wasn't with him.

480
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,000
I wasn't with him either.

481
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,050
Until today,

482
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,370
I don't even know who was the person

483
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,250
who killed him.

491

You can't do it, right?

493
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,970
there are many things

but can't get.

496

499

were under your control,

500
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,280
that's just arrogance.

501
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,680

will come to light one day.

can't forgive yourself for it,

then at least share the burden with me.

00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,360
How could you say

518
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,530
something so important so casually?

519
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,680
You're unwilling?

520
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,610
Let's do it today then.

521
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,800
Let's get married now.

522
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,850
Everything is as per normal. Nothing happened.

523
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,530
You may leave.

524
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,090
Your Majesty.

525
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,210
Your Majesty.

526
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,370
We're already in Jinguan City.

527
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,050
Do you want to take a rest?

528
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,920
No need. How is the investigation going?

529
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,370
According to the report,

530
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,240
the Prince of Nanyuan wanted to poison Chief Xiao.

531
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,370
But somehow,

532
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,210
it was Her Highness who got poisoned.

533
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,690
The Prince of Nanyuan is indeed bold

534
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,730
and disrespects royal power.

535
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,130
But I didn’t expect that Chief Xiao

536
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,200
would hide it from us.

537
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,010
I'm going to the Prince of Nanyuan's residence.

538
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,520
Yes. To Prince of Nanyuan's residence.

539
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,530
Floral Goddess,

540
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,850
I, Bu Yinlou and...

541
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,450
Should I call you Xiao Cheng

542
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,440
or Xiao Duo?

543
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,720
After living with Xiao Duo's name

544
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,080
for so many years,

545
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,850
I can't tell

546
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,960
who I am anymore.

547
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,280
That's alright.

548
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,490
No matter who you are,

549
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,800
you will always be my Fangjiang.

550
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,440
Let me do it again.

551
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,370
Floral Goddess,

552
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,250
I, Zhuoying, and Fangjiang,

553
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,880
are getting married today.

554
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,760
We will stay together forever and never betray each other.

555
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,010
Floral Goddess,

556
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,530
Zhuoying and Fangjiang

557
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,320
shall be wed as husband and wife from today on.

558
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,480
We will stay together forever and never betray each other.

559
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,240
First bow, to the heaven and earth.

560
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:23,930
Second bow...

561
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,720
Second bow, to our parents.

562
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,330
Bow to each other.

563
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,680
I married you

564
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,520
without a betrothal gift.

565
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,290
I'm so sorry.

566
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,720
Keep this.

567
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,770
It's a token for you.

568
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,450
Keep it well.

569
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,570
Don't let others see you.

570
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,840
If we accidentally get separated,

571
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,690
you can use this

572
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,360
to command the Zhaoding Bureau.

573
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,410
Don't worry,

574
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,250
I will keep it well.

575
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,040
I won't let anyone else have it.

576
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,640
We will be husband and wife from now on.

577
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,320
I will give my heart to you.

578
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,280
No matter what happens in the future,

579
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,450
you can't leave me behind.

580
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,770
Otherwise, I'll go crazy.

581
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,480
All these years,

582
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,730
it's been hard on you,

583
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,160
having to hide

584
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,410
such a big secret in your heart.

585
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,440
From now on,

586
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,810
I will always be with you.

587
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,520
I will do what you want to do

588
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,370
and find the person you want to find together with you.

589
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,850
You can't just say it.

590
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,650
You have to give me something concrete.

591
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,520
Then...

592
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,770
I'll

593
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,080
leave a seal

His Majesty is here.

602

Summoning the Prince of Nanyuan to see His Majesty.

603
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,490
Prince of Nanyuan, please.

604
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,450
Your Majesty, Prince of Nanyuan is here.

605
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:22,440
"Clear the world and bring order to the eight lands."

606
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,680
This was written by Sima Yi

607
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,840
to compare himself to the Emperor Gaozu of Han.

608
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,490
Seems like the Prince of Nanyuan

609
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,930
also has such ambitions.

610
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,800
I haven't seen Your Majesty for years.

611
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,720
Seeing Your Majesty today,

612
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,320
it seems like a lot has changed.

613
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,240
You have changed a lot too.

614
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,770
You amassed wealth illicitly, forged weapons privately,

615
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,450
and plotted a rebellion.

616
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,330
All these are

617
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,320
major crimes that will get your entire family executed.

618
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,760
Your Majesty, for the sake

619
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,570
of the country,

620
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,560
you can't kill me.

621
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,490
Why?

622
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,370
I have three questions.

623
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,600
Your Majesty, firstly,

624
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,280
who is the person

625
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,360
who did everything they could

626
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,880
to prove my crimes?

627
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,130
Your Majesty, second.

628
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,520
Your Majesty is kind-hearted,

629
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:24,889
you have never had the thought of killing me,

630
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,719
yet lately, you began seeing me as a grave threat.

631
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,679
Who had been

632
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,409
instigating it all?

633
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,570
Your Majesty, third,

00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,719
if I die,

635
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:37,159
who would

636
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,420
the Great Ye end up belonging to?

637
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,330
How dare you!

How dare you say such bold things

in front of His Majesty?

640
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:48,210
Your questions are pointing to Chief Xiao.

641
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,210
You're trying to sow discord to save your own life.

642

How arrogant you are.

Chief Xiao's hidden ambition,

649
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,970
Your Majesty has realized that

00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,760
has been controlled by Xiao Duo?

689
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,290
The power to review memorials,

690
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,090
and the proposals sent to me

691
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,450
by the Secretary of the Six Offices of Scrutiny,

692
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,610
are all first handled by Xiao Duo.

693
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,420
So I can only see

694
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:19,940
what Xiao Duo

695
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,170
wants me to see.

696
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,000
Even if he leaves the capital,

697
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,200
can I only

698
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,400
look up to him?

699
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,440
Your Majesty,

700
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,050
aren't you afraid that saving the Price of Nanyuan

701
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,770
will cause disasters?

702
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,450
I am keeping

703
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,690
Yuwen Liangshi's life

704
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,490
to knock some sense into Xiao Duo.

705
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,520
I want him to know

706
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,840
no matter how arrogant one is,

707
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,770
their lives are fully

708
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,290
under my control.

709
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,690
I just want him to behave himself.

710
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,690
Your Majesty, with all due respect,

711
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,540
without Chief Xiao,

712
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,690
there's no one around you that you can use.

713
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,810
I think Chief Xiao

714
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,940
knows this too,

715
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,340
that's why he's

716
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,610
getting more and more proud.

717
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,370
Yes.

718
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,080
Do you have any good ideas then?

719
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,970
Your Majesty,

720
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,600
you need to train your own people.

721
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,570
It’s hard to tame Chief Xiao.

722
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,570
What Your Majesty needs

723
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,300
is someone who truly obeys you,

724
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,600
and is loyal to you.

725
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,320
How about

726
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,360
I have Yu Zun return?

727
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,290
Good, good!

728
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,290
Send someone immediately,

729
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,160
summon Yu Zhun to meet me in West Shu.

730
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,370
I'll do it now.

731
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,730
Let's go visit Yinlou first.

732
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,810
After what happened,

733
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,040
she must be scared.

734
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,720
Your Highness.

735
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:02,930
Your Highness.

736
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,090
His Majesty has gone too far.

737
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:14,930
Your Highness,

738
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,080
do you really have

739
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,210
no complaints?

740
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,010
Isn't it great

741
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,130
that I escaped a death sentence?

742
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,050
I'll retire

743
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,800
and wait for punishment.

744
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,290
Xiao Duo

745
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,490
is really

746
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,730
a good opponent.

747
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,450
If only he was not an enemy,

748
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,130
I would really want to

749
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,170
have a drink with him.

750
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,010
Unfortunately, I lost.

751
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,450
He's the next one

752
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,760
Murong Gaogong

753
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,610
will get rid of.

754
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,210
When Xiao Duo

755
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,970
gets weakened,

756
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,720
I will rise again.

757
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,730
The friend I tried so hard

758
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,530
to hide in the capital.

759
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,490
They'd better hide well!

760
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,370
When the time comes,

761
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,170
help me give a good push

762
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,360
to Murong Gaogong!

763
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:55,840
Sirs,

764
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,410
my young master is really

765
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,890
the cousin of Her Highness.

766
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,080
He left in a hurry,

767
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,490
but there are some things

768
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,330
he didn't get to pass to Her Highness.

769
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,450
These are all the belongings

770
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,850
of Her Highness in the past.

771
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,090
Please let me in.

772
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,450
Young Master and Her Highness

773
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,650
are really pretty close.

774
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,370
He just came to your residence a few days ago

775
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,570
to visit Her Highness too.

776
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,370
Let me in.

777
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,530
Who is your young master?

778
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,570
Greetings, Your Majesty.

779
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,650
Your servant Xiao Duo

780
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,530
pays his greetings to Your Majesty.

781
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,520
Consort Dowager Duan, get up.

782
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,570
Yes.

783
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,490
I've punished Prince of Nanyuan,

784
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,050
seized his property and confined him in his residence

785
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:09,890
in perpetuity.

786
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,520
As for the death penalty, I have let him off.

787
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,680
What do you think, Chief Xiao?

788
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,480
Your Majesty,

789
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,330
The Prince of Nanyuan broke the law.

790
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,280
He is guilty of treason and is unforgivable.

791
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:22,640
Fair.

792
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,770
Chief Xiao is fair and strict.

793
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:26,770
I'm sure you would

794
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,040
hold yourself to the same standard.

795
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,650
Consort Dowager Duan was poisoned,

796
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:30,890
and Xiao Duo failed to protect her.

797
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,080
Guards, cane him.

798
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,800
-Your Majesty. -I accept my punishment.
