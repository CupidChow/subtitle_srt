It's all wrong!

That's not how you should be acting!

7

That...

8
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,280
That eunuch.

Are you enjoying this show?

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,270
I had it arranged specially for you.

You're not?

What about me then?

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,620
Who am I?

Consort Duan has moved into Deer's Reed Residence for too long.

It's time to return to the palace.

This place is under the jurisdiction of Zhaoding Bureau.

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,170
I apologize.

I'm not allowed to leave your side.

Don't worry and just stay in the palace.

and was thrown into prison by His Majesty.

54
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,460
Even his residence was raided.

70
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,540
Well, His Majesty loves me so much that

00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,180
even if I committed a serious crime,

72

he still wants to keep me in the palace.

He favors me more and more each day,

74

and sleeps with me every night.

75

He sleeps with you every night?

76

Then I guess I have to congratulate you

what's there for you to be proud about?

00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,720
Who are you to look down on me?

87

Do you think I want to

live on shamelessly like this?

89
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,530
I ended up like this because of you.

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,130
If it weren't for you,

91
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,430
I wouldn't have been married off to West Shu.

92
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,740
I wouldn't have been given to

93
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,870
His Majesty like a plaything

94
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,960
just because I look somewhat similar

95
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,350
to you.

96
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,410
And I wouldn't have ended up losing at the last moment

97
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,710
and having my family torn apart.

98
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,260
Now you ask me what I want?

99
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,270
If you had

100
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,700
married in my place back then,

101
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,420
or died in the imperial mausoleum,

102
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,270
none of this would have happened.

103
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,610
I would still have been

104
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,460
the precious legitimate daughter of the Bu Residence,

105
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,720
and I would still have my father and mother

106
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,810
who dote on me and love me.

107
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,040
I would have had a noble life.

108
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,470
It's all because of you.

109
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,120
Give me back my life!

110
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:47,890
Bu Yinge.

111
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,700
You don't think you'll be happy

112
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,580
as long as I'm not happy?

113
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,890
Don't be silly.

114
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,230
I was never the one

115
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,240
who hurt you.

116
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,140
Father was the one who gave up on you and used you.

117
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,820
The ones who bullied you and humiliated you

118
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,620
are the Prince of Nanyuan

119
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,040
and Murong Gaogong.

120
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,940
You dare not

121
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,790
confront the real culprits and get even with them,

122
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,930
but instead you're making things difficult for me.

123
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,410
Don't you think

124
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,500
you're a joke?

125
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,110
You're the one who's a joke.

126
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,210
You abandoned His Majesty

127
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,310
just so you could cosy up with a lowly servant?

128
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,410
You chose to be lowly,

129
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,880
and ruined everything.

130
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,520
If you're willing to be

131
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,160
a plaything that is used by others,

132
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,340
then that's your business.

133
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,650
I'm following my own desires

134
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,159
to love the person I want to love,

135
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,840
to go on the path I want to go on,

136
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,480
and do what I want to do.

137
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,830
If we compare with each other,

138
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,010
which one of us is the one choosing to be lowly?

139
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,730
You-

140
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,230
Was this what His Majesty ordered people to do to you

141
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,700
when you were locked in the temporary palace in Weichang?

142
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,570
After he treated you like this,

143
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,660
do you really still believe

144
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,330
he's keeping you around

145
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,300
because he loves you?

146
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,610
He dotes on me, loves me, and can't leave me.

147
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,660
Otherwise,

148
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,760
he wouldn't want to keep me

149
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,810
at the expense of offending everybody.

150
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,900
Bu Yinge, stop being silly.

151
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,000
Even if you keep on giving in to those

152
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,310
who hurt you and insulted you,

153
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,820
you still won't recover your dignity.

154
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,160
You'll only sink deeper and deeper.

155
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
and lose everything in the end.

156
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,610
While it's still not too late,

157
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,910
ask to leave the palace now.

158
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,550
Why should I leave the palace?

159
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,380
Are you jealous that I can make a comeback?

160
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,530
I'll be honest with you.

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,890
I will be the empress soon.

162
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,110
I will become the most respected

163

woman in Daye.

164
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,980
Bu Yinge.

165
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,660
You're still dreaming aren't you?

166
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,170
Her Highness is here too.

167
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,710
Bu Yinge, receive the decree.

168

Yes.

00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,330
Your Highness.

172
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,890
I was just about to

173
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,570
go to Yongze Palace to invite you too.

174
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,550
Please go with us then.

175
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,670
I'll let you see for yourself

176
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,470
if I'm telling the truth.

177
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,210
Bu Yinge is a rebel's concubine!

178
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,590
She can't be the empress!

179
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,200
Please withdraw your order.

180
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,640
Please withdraw your order.

181
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,130
Bu Yinge.

182
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:47,900
Come here.

183
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,560
This bunch of people just don't understand.

184
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,840
I said I would make you the Empress.

185
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,570
They all opposed it.

186
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,880
They're crying and making a scene as if their father died.

187
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,860
What do you think I should do?

188
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,840
I'll heed whatever Your Majesty says.

189
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,500
Then you need to

190
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,180
do your part to contribute.

191
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,800
Perform a dance in the palace,

192
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,350
and show them

193
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,040
the overflowing charms of my future empress,

194
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,170
to see if you're worthy of being

195
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,010
called the mother of the nation.

196
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,080
Yes.

197
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,970
So ridiculous.

198
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,370
How inappropriate!

199
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,090
What is this?

200
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,390
How could this be?

201
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,250
This is ridiculous.

202
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:09,960
Yes.

203
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,520
Are you kidding me?

204
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,620
How utterly embarrassing!

205
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,090
Indeed.

206
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,130
This...

207
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,390
I've never heard

208
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,980
such a ridiculous thing.

209
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,570
Brilliant!

210
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,210
Your Majesty.

211
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,820
The Hall of Imperial Supremacy is where matters of the state are discussed.

212
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,380
How can you let a witch behave immorally?

213
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,680
Your Majesty!

214
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,490
Have you gone mad?

215
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,920
Your Majesty.

216
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,690
T- This is really...

217
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,710
rather inappropriate.

218
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,860
Come.

219
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,220
You danced so well.

220
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,260
The Empress Dowager has arrived!

221
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,680
Greetings, Mother.

222
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,000
Arrest this witch!

223
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,150
Your Majesty.

224
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,530
It's my fault for

225
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,180
alarming the Empress Dowager.

226
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,690
I'm not against

227
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,830
you wanting to appoint an empress.

228
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,470
But the Empress is the mother of the nation,

229
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,620
and a role model for all the women of the land.

230
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,520
How could you choose her of all people?

231
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,580
A wicked, impure woman

232
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,020
who even committed treason.

233
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,540
It's already absurd to allow you to keep her in the palace.

234
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,010
And you still want to appoint her as Empress?

235
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,820
Out of all of the

236
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,050
many virtuous and respectable ladies in the harem,

237
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,450
do none of them compare to her?

238
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,370
I dare not accept these words of yours, Mother.

239
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,110
It was unfilial of me,

240
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,590
and I made you upset.

241
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,320
But you are absolutely right, Mother.

242
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,510
All of my concubines in the harem,

243
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,480
as long as they can enter the palace,

244
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,290
they must all be good candidates who are

245
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,380
virtuous and respectable.

246
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,450
So in your opinion,

247
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:58,970
the Empress should be

248
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,230
chosen from these people?

249
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,460
That's right.

250
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,230
Aside from Bu Yinge,

251
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,330
which one of them isn't a good candidate?

252
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,210
Do all the ministers

253
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,680
think so too?

254
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,840
Your Majesty, we agree.

255
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,700
Fine.

256
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,630
Then I...

257
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,560
Then I'll do

258
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,610
as you wish.

259
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,910
Sun Taiqing.

260
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

261
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,890
Relay my order.

262
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,430
Relaying His Majesty's order.

263
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,070
I have quested after the rules of the world,

264
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,970
and a successful man needs a woman behind him.

265
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,870
Consort Duan of Yongze Palace

266
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,010
is filial and modest;

267
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,980
virtuous and honorable;

268
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,750
refined and dutiful.

269
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,350
She is befitting of the position of Empress.

270
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,800
By the grace of the Empress Dowager,

271
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,600
With this decree and seal,

272
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,910
I hereby appoint you as Empress.

273
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,460
How can you treat

274
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,560
appointing an empress like child's play!

275
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,030
Child's play?

276
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,270
Mother, everything you just said,

277
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,910
which part of it did I not follow?

278
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,680
Even so, it cannot be her!

279
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,950
I am undeserving,

280
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,210
and dare not accept Your Majesty's grace.

281
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,060
I was originally part of the former Emperor's harem,

282
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,320
and only had the chance to return to the palace

283
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,290
after receiving Your Majesty's grace.

284
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,590
I am already greatly favored.

285
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,940
If I am appointed Empress now,

286
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,240
I will become a sinner for generations to come,

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,810
and I will be too ashamed to face my ancestors after I die.

288
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,080
I implore Your Majesty to choose another candidate.

289
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,420
I've given the decree.

290
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,680
Since time immemorial,

291
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,950
the words of the Emperor are absolute.

292
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,030
Besides, Mother has given her word,

293
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,340
and all the ministers agreed to it.

294
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,910
You want me to withdraw my order?

295
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,930
Thank me for my grace,

296
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,030
my Empress.

297
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,770
I...

298
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,849
thank Your Majesty for your grace.

299
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,660
Escort Consort Duan to Fengyi Palace at once.

300
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,390
Ask the Imperial Astronomical Bureau to pick an auspicious date

301
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,590
to hold the coronation ceremony.

302
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,150
First, he acted all absurd

303
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,120
and used Bu Yinge as a cover.

304
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,390
Then, he set up a decoy

305
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,200
and shut everyone up.

306
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,220
He planned this all in advance.

307
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,540
No matter how unsuitable I am to be Empress,

308
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,640
I have no choice now.

309
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,240
This is not him favoring me.

310
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,880
This is revenge.

311
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,020
He wants to trap me for good

312
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,490
in the Imperial City.

313
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,020
Your Majesty, slow down.

314
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,460
Your Majesty.

315
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,180
Your Majesty.

316
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,570
What you said earlier in the court

317
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,080
is not true, right?

318
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,160
How dare a witch guilty of treason like you

319
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,360
come to me begging for dignity?

320
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,650
The position of Empress is one of such honor.

321
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,710
Even if I really give it to you,

322
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,440
do you dare to take it?

323
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,910
Do you deserve it?

324
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,690
I was wrong.

325
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,740
I beg Your Majesty

326
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,740
to spare my life for the sake of

327
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,000
our previous relationship with each other.

328
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,040
Your Majesty, don't you like

329
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,180
this face of mine?

330
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,550
I will destroy this face of yours right now!

331
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,230
Your Majesty!

332
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,780
This lowly wench deserves to die.

333
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,500
You're the almighty Emperor.

334
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,390
She's not worth getting blood on your hands.

335
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,400
Leave it to me.

336
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,870
I'll handle it for you.

337
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,540
You're right.

338
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,650
She doesn't deserve me getting blood on my hands.

339
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,290
But I don't

340
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,340
want her to

341
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,060
die comfortably either.

342
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,620
I want her to live in pain.

343
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,010
How about this?

344
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,600
Banish her to the Laundry Bureau, and make sure

345
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,110
she can never get out for the rest of her life.

346
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,630
Yes, take her away quickly.

347
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,310
Bu Yinlou was right.

348
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,370
I'm such a joke.

349
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,600
You, Father, and Yuwen Liangshi!

350
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,730
You all used me

351
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,530
and trampled all over on me!

352
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,250
You all ruined me!

My sister won't be as stupid as me,

356
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,920
she'll make sure you suffer!

357
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,110
What else can she do

358
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,460
to make me suffer?

359
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,290
Let's go.

360
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,650
Come with me to see my new Empress.

361
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,440
Your Majesty, be careful.

362
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,260
Be careful, Your Majesty.

363
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,360
Those who stand in my way

364
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,950
must be kicked out.

365
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,920
Your Highness, congratulations on being appointed Empress

368

Shut up.

369
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,700
How unlucky.

370
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,370
Yinlou.

371
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,200
I miss you.

372
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,630
I'm here to see you.

373
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,450
Come on.

374
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,980
I heard that you like pear blossoms,

375
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,170
and that Chief Xiao's residence has beautiful pear trees,

376
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,430
which still thrive

377
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,030
even after they've been moved.

378
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,500
I believe

379
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,850
they'll thrive too after being moved here.

380
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,340
Trees are like people.

381
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,400
They can adapt to some places,

382
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,030
but not to others.

383
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,060
You know that.

384
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,780
You just don't want to let it live.

385
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,390
Yinlou.

386

Why are you so hard to please?

387
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,170
I've already banished

388
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,020

389

to the Laundry Bureau.

390
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,790
She has already become the lowest

391

392
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,020
And you will soon become

393
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,720
the most respected woman in the land.

394
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,610
Are you happy?

395
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,730
You were once all intimate with her too.

396
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,370
How could you have the heart to do that?

397
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,260
Look.

398
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,240
You always misunderstand me.

399
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,050
I've said it hundreds of times.

400
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,480
The only one I love is you.

401
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,370
You are also my only Empress.

402
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,050
Once you stand at the top,

403
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,200
naturally everyone in the Imperial City will have their eyes on you,

404
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,560
and everyone in Great Ye

405
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,240
will help me trap you.

406
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,750
And you will be trapped in this position

407
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,340
as the Empress,

408
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,750
forever lonely.

409
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,440
Since you hurt me,

410
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,550
it's only fair that you share the pain

411
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,680
with me.

412
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,120
Oh right.

413
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,980
You must personally tell

414
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,620
this great news to the person

415
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,090

423
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,560

I’ll let you try all of them

428
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,900

429

How's that?

430
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,650
I was wrong.

431
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,830
I didn't know better, and my sins are unforgivable.

432
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,390
I beg you to spare him.

433
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,810
I beg you to spare him.

434
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,000
Zhuo Ying, get up.

435
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,680
Get up.

436
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,720
Are you...

437
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,190
begging me right now?

438
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,160
For what?

439
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,580
You're begging me to give him something good,

440
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,960

441
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,150
No!

442
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,870
No.

443
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:48,920
No.

444
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,870
Get out of the way.

445
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,760

453
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,970
What should we do then?

00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,890
We should deprive their positions,

516
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,400
confiscate their property and expel them from the palace.

517
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,140
Sun Taiqing, you may leave first.

518
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,580
Yes.

519
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,810
Are you questioning me

520
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,980
or pleading for them?

521
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,590
I haven't blamed you yet.

522
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,430
You are already here

523
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,440
to play a trick on me.

524
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,520
Wan Wan.

525
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,620
Wan Wan.

526
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,020
You and I are siblings

527
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,500
who grew up relying on each other.

528
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,670
Indeed.

529
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,860
After that, in order to protect yourself,

530
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,750
you stayed close to the Empress Dowager

531
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,920
and went to Tanxi Temple,

532
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,330
leaving me alone in the palace

533
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,360
to be humiliated.

534
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,670
But I

535
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,500
have never blamed you.

536
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,540
Because you're my only sister.

537
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,850
My only family

538
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,440
and the only person I trust.

539
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,620
Shouldn't you

540
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,630
be wholehearted to me?

541
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,860
You knew

542
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,450
they had an affair.

543
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,760
But you helped them to deceive me.

544
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,450
How could you betray

545
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,040
your only family?

546
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,220
I want to know

547
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,230
the true colors of your heart.

548
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,160
When I first knew

549
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,500
about this,

550
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,730
I wanted to tell you.

551
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,510
But, Brother,

552
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,660
I couldn't say it.

553
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,580
Why?

554
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,390
Because I envy Yinlou.

555
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,850
Bu Yinlou is disloyal and unfaithful.

556
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,210
You're the Princess Hede.

557
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,470
Why do you envy her?

558
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,730
I envy her because she doesn't

559
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:42,570
take her fate lying down.

560
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,220
She tries her best to protect

561
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,940
her innocence in her bones.

562
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,130
Everyone in the Imperial City

563
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,700
has a title

564
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,210
and identity.

565
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,480
They own luxurious clothing

566
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,690
but they are

567
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,250
barely living.

568
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,600
Only Yinlou

569
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,950
is always herself.

570
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:04,960
Brother,

571
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,150
please let her go.

572
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,630
Nonsense!

573
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,850
I lied to you.

574
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,410
I'm sorry.

575
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,110
Every day, I ask myself

576
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,380
whether I was right or wrong.

577
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,750
Now I've figured it out.

578
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,610
I think I understand Yinlou now.

579
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,090
You keep saying that you like her,

580
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,820
but she has things that she is

581
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,910
willing and unwilling to do,

582
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,040
and her own likes and dislikes.

583
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,090
Have you ever cared about that?

584
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,560
Just because of

585
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,540
your wishful thinking,

586
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,800
you forced her with your power.

587
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,020
In your eyes,

588
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,170
is she still a human being?

589
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,730
Do you really like her?

590
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,190
I am the Emperor.

591
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,610
If I want a woman,

592
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,620
why would I bother to care so much?

593
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,500
Brother.

594
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,190
How did you become like this?

595
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,840
We used to be tortured

596
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,930
by power.

597
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,830
Our mother died because of that.

598
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,210
Now you have

599
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,350
the supreme power,

600
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,450
yet you trampled on others.

601
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,970
You treat a woman

602
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,700
as if she is your belonging and take this for granted.

603
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,250
Brother,

604
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,680
you have become

605
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,230
the person we hated the most.

606
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,740
You betrayed us.

607
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,410
Times have changed.

608
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,550
You're the one who doesn't know

609
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,930
your place.

610
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,290
You betrayed me for other people.

611
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,980
As your brother,

612
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,910
I have to take the responsibility

613
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,760
to educate you.

614
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,280
I want you to know,

615
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,710
in this world,

616
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,070
power is the only truth.

617
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,050
Brother.

618
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,220
The Yuwen family

619
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,280
has lost their power and influence.

620
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,250
They can only kneel on the ground

621
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,190
and bear my humiliation.

622
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,710
Please don't. Brother.

623
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,970
Wan Wan.

624
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,420
You are an adult.

625
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,140
Why are you still

626
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,490
being childish?

627
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,790
You're too greedy.

628
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,360
You begged me to spare Xiao Duo and Yinlou.

629
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,460
Now you beg me to let him go.

630
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,260
You can only choose either one.

631
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,000
Make a choice.

632
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:44,510
Wan Wan.

633
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,740
-Wan Wan. -Don't you care?

634
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,370
Leave me alone.

635
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,710
Please don't. Brother.

636
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,940
I will make a choice.

637
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,090
I will make a choice.

638
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,550
Brother,

639
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,280
please spare Yuwen Liangxu.

640
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,180
Love is selfish.

641
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,400
Wan Wan, look.

642
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,840
Even you can't do it yourself.

643
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,590
How can you ask me

644
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,150
to be magnanimous?

645
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,330
But I promise

646
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,350
to fulfill your request.

647
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,370
From now on,

648
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,970
please remember who you are.

649
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,100
Don't do anything

650
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,580
to let me down again.

651
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,590
Princess Hede.

652
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,840
Your sister

653
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,410
obeys.

654
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:58,850
Liangxu.

655
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,610
Liangxu.

656
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,000
Liangxu.

657
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,180
Liangxu.

658
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,560
Liangxu.

659
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,100
I have bribed

660
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,150
the guards here.

661
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,000
You leave immediately.

662
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,100
Go as far as you can.

663
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,550
Come with me.

664
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,170
When I first came to the capital,

665
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,480
I found everything newfangled and interesting.

666
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,699
After staying here for a long time,

667
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,429
I realize the people here

668
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,909
have ugly and horrible desires.

669
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,370
My brother was buried here.

670
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,770
I don't want to lose you too.

671
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,900
I don't care about the grudges anymore.

672
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,580
I just want us to be fine.

673
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,679
Let's go.

674
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,400
I am the Princess.

675
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,960
I can't leave my brother behind.

676
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,690
Does he still regard you as his sister?

677
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,290
He's gone crazy.

678
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,900
If you stay here,

679
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,530
you'll be abused by him.

680
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:11,800
Wan Wan,

681
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,490
come with me.

682
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,500
Follow me to West Shu,

683
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,600
back to my home.

684
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,650
From now on,

685
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,380
let's just be an ordinary couple.

686
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,680
We can live freely.

687
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,270
You don't have to worry about

688
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,040
the tricky world in the Imperial City anymore.

689
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,550
OK?

690
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,270
OK.

691
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,630
I'll go with you.

692
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,530
We fell into their trap. Quickly leave!

693
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,410
Let's go together.

694
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,250
Don't be so dramatic.

695
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:19,710
Go quickly!

696
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:26,640
Who dares to go there

697
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,200
will be the first to be sacrificed for my sword.

698
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,270
Wan Wan, you lied to me again.

699
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,260
Brother.

700
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,740
Are you testing me?

701
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,370
If not,

702
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,760
how would I know

703
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,230
you would betray me?

704
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,830
You all

705
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,550
either want to leave me

706
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,690
or beg me to spare others.

707
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,380
I really hate it.

708
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:57,970
Tell me.

709
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,540
How should I punish you?

710
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,830
I have

711
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,310
a good suggestion.

712
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:14,310
Since you like him so much,

713
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,760
I'll invite him back

714
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,460
and cut off his arms and legs

715
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,260
and put them in a jar.

716
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,840
Let him be with you forever.

717
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,920
Sun Taiqing.

718
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

719
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,520
Pass on my decree.

720
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,750
Arrest Yuwen Liangxu.

721
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,810
Don't care if he's dead or alive.

722
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,240
Yes.

723
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,520
Let's go.

724
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,380
His Majesty gave an order.

725
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,140
It has been chaotic outside recently.

726
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,660
He wants you to move here

727
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,300
so that you won't be disturbed by irrelevant people.

728
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:57,710
[Hill Outside the Imperial City]

729
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,620
Go!

730
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,700
Fool.

731
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,550
[Fengyi Palace]

732
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,360
You have a home.

733
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,380
I'll take you home.

734
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,580
Your Highness, you're awake.

735
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,700
I want to go home.

736
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,550
What are you talking about?

737
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,650
The Imperial City is your home.

738
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,210
How's Zhaoding Bureau lately?

739
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,900
Nothing unusual has happened.

740
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,220
Zhaoding Bureau has been with Xiao Duo for many years.

741
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,350
They must only follow Xiao Duo,

742
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,990
not the Emperor.

743
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,960
I took Xiao Duo down.

744
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,640
How could they sit still?

745
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:33,900
What?

746
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,550
Do they think I can't touch them?

747
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,690
Pass my order.

748
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,790
Zhaoding Bureau colluded with

749
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,970
Yuwen Liangxu from West Shu

750
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,140
and attempted to rebel.

751
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,120
From now on, disband Zhaoding Bureau.

752
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,380
Leave no one alive.

753
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,060
But Your Majesty,

754
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,530
Chief Xiao and Zhaoding Bureau

755
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:50,540
have contributed a lot to pacifying the rebellion.

756
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,060
What?

757
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:03,600
Now even you dare to disobey me?

758
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,690
I dare not.

759
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,580
If it weren't for Consort Jing,

760
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,670
I would have been dead long ago.

761
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,510
Your Majesty is

762
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,480
the child of Consort Jing.

763
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,570
Your Majesty's will

764
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,540
is my will.

765
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:12,840
I will obey your orders.

766
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,640
Then what are you waiting for?

767
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:15,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

768
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,530
Where is the herbal soup?

769
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,970
Your Majesty, you shouldn't drink too much of

770
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,340
potent herbal soups like these

771
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,580
made from deer and tiger penises.

772
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,590
Shut up.

773
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,860
Serve me another bowl. Hurry.
