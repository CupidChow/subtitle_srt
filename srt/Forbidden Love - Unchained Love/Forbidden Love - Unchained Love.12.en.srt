Yes.

00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,270
So many flowers were thrown.

Her Highness is amazing.

She was wearing a veil.

She was dressed like Meng Jieyu

and I couldn't recognize her at all—

20

She was dressed like Meng Jieyu?

21

Meng Jieyu must be dressed skimpily.

How can she dress like Meng Jieyu?

23

She wasn't dressed skimpily actually.

it's also pleasant.

do you think she knows?

354
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,940
I want her to know,

355
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,710
but I dare not let her—

She went to apprentice at the Dream House?

363
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,500
Why would she go there?

364
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,030
Was it your idea again?

365
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,080
With this,

366
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,430
what kind of a scumbag will I have become

367
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,350
in her eyes?

Your Majesty, please calm down.

369
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,000
I only mentioned it in passing

370

to Chief Xiao.

371
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,270
I dare not

make the decision on such a matter.

The Lantern Festival is in a few days,

invite Her Highness to admire the lanterns with you?

381

I'm sure she'll be happy.

382
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,590
Admire the lanterns together...

383
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,420
That's a good idea.

384
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,830
I'll inform Her Highness then.

392
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,720
a spy

escaped.

From then on,

00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,200
you will have eyes only for her.

You want to know why she's happy,

437
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,150
and you want to be happy with her.

438
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,120
You want to know why she cries,

439
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,760
and you want to

440
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,230
wipe her tears with your own hands.

441
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,610
You want to live in her heart

only of you.

444

Why am I telling you this?

445
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,260

His Majesty

No matter what happens in the future,

your love

453
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,210
I know that too.

454
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,970
But do you know

455
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,150
how long a life is?

456
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,640
Even if we live to be a hundred years old,

457
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,220
we will only have

458
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,820
about 36,000 days and nights.

459
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,370
And this is to say nothing of natural disasters,

460
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,550
sicknesses, and mishaps.

461
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,000
You have to do what you want.

462
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,220
Because it's possible that tomorrow,

463
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,440
you won't be able to anymore.

464
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,540
As for what will happen in the future,

465
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,720
it's all Heaven's will.

466
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,480
Since it's not up to me,

467
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,580
I'll do what I can do

468
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,710
in the present moment.

469
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,520
I will love the person I want to love

470
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,610
and stay by her side,

471
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,490
no matter how ephemerally.

472
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,090
Even so, it is a fortunate thing.

473
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,370
I didn't expect Your Highness

474
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,590
to be so perspicacious.

475
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,180
I was too shallow.

476
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,950
So you're agreeing to help me?

477
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,330
No.

478
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,360
I've said so much. You-

479
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,320
It's getting late.

480
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,090
Your Highness, you should leave now.

481
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,040
Your Highness.

482
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,600
The door is this way.

483
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,880
No matter how ephemerally...

484
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,100
I treated him like a sister.

485
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,910
I thought he admired

486
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,970
my extraodinary intelligence.

487
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,400
To think

488
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,250
he actually covets my good looks.

489
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,730
Shallow.

490
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,880
No wonder he is always

491
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,060
posturizing in front of me.

492
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,280
Vixen!

493
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,240

494
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,960
Big liar!

495
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,230
Don't think too much into it.

496
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,080
Him coveting your good looks

497
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,260
is only a possibility.

498
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,870
Let me tell you.

499
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,560
I'm sure of it.

500
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,480
He's definitely into me.

501
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,360
Definitely!

502
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,180
You're a piece of wood that doesn't know emotions and desires.

503
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,390
No wonder you're a eunuch.

504
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,070
Serves you right!

505
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,530
Senior.

506
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,170
Why are you here?

507
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,060
Let's not talk about it.

508
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:11,950
Junior,

509
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,940
you're the only one who can help me now.

510
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,090
Are you kidding me?

511
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:19,890
Given your ostentatious behavior

512
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,860
towards Wan Wan,

513
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,370
If he agreed,

514
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,010
it would be because he was out of his mind.

515
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:25,560
Right.

516
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,400
You don’t mean much

517
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,580
to Xiao Duo.

518
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,160
How could Xiao Duo

519
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,000
agree to help me

520
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,050
just because of you?

521
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,190
I shouldn't make things difficult for you.

522
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,070
What?

523
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,960
I don't mean much?

524
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,680
I've got this.

525
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:50,800
Your Highness.

526
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,860
What are you trying to say?

527
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,380
Well...

528
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,470
Well-

529
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,860
Anyway...

530
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,720
there is this situation.

531
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,460
This...

532
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,690
This...

533
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,320
What is this situation?

534
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,720
She wants me to help the Young Prince.

535
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,740
Yes.

536
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,260
You understood that?

537
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,190
Don't bother helping him.

538
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,620
Their statuses are incompatible.

539
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,670
Getting too close

540
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,890
will be bad for both of them.

541
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,700
Why will it be bad?

542
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,680
It's only natural for the Young Prince

543
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,740
to apologize for his mistake.

544
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,160
If you're worried,

545
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,720
you can come with him.

546
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:49,680
If you're there,

547
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,110
nothing bad could happen.

548
00:30:59,220 --> 00:30:59,930
Then...

549
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,670
what if I go too?

550
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,160
No.

551
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,500
Why would he reject me?

552
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,730
This can't be.

553
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,160
Forget it.

554
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,720
It's nothing embarrassing.

555
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,270
Don't be sad.

556
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,140
He must have done it on purpose

557
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,340
to get my attention.

558
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,620
This trick

559
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,680
isn't worth my time.

560
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,400
I don't care at all.

561
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,870
I said

562
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,760
I will get this done for you, so I will.

563
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,610
Since he won't, I will.

564
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,160
I'm so mad.

565
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,250
Tongyun, let's go.

566
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:51,880
Let's go find Wan Wan.

567
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,320
Let's stop fooling around.

568
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,330
The Princess is in the palace,

569
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,180
and you can't get in there.

570
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,440
Then I'll wait for her at the palace gates.

571
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,160
Who is your master angry with?

572
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,650
You said Yinlou

573
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,290
wants to go to the Lantern Festival with me?

574
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,070
Really?

575
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,580
Yes.

576
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,370
Mistress,

577
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,090
we only

578
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,390
handed a note

579
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,610
to the guard at the palace gates.

580
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,410
Will the Princess really receive it?

581
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,930
It depends on fate.

582
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,730
It's too bad that I didn't have a way in.

583
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,870
Then why did you agree to help him?

584
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,760
Isn't this akin to sabotaging him?

585
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,390
How could I have known

586
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,020
Chief Xiao wouldn't agree?

587
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,430
Didn’t I tell you already

588
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,310
that Chief Xiao

589
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,110
couldn't possibly like you?

590
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,000
You don't believe me?

591
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,680
Who are you looking down on?

592
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,150
He is definitely coveting me.

593
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:08,740
Next time,

594
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,960
I'll prove it to you.

595
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,250
Wan Wan.

596
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:27,890
You're here?

597
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:28,940
In the past, I've always celebrated

598
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,950
the Lantern Festival at the palace.

599
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,340
The lights in the palace are gorgeous,

600
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,890
but the atmosphere is much livelier out here.

601
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:33,810
Yinlou,

602
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:34,570
I didn't even

603
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,620
bring Ruolan out with me.

604
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,510
You must show me around.

605
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:38,940
Don't worry.

606
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,580
I'll make sure this is a memorable experience.

607
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,710
I just didn't expect

608
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,770
Chief Xiao would also come to see the lanterns.

609
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,450
It’s unbelievable.

610
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,620
It's so beautiful over there.

611
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,420
Let's go and take a look.

612
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,020
Yes.

613
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,330
It is quite unbelievable.

614
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,670
Didn't you say you wouldn't come?

615
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,890
Why did you bring Wan Wan

616
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,360
out with you?

617
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,360
It was a coincidence.

618
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,130
The Princess wanted to see the lanterns too.

619
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,060
Really?

620
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,060
So beautiful!

621
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,070
Bravo!

622
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,630
Bravo!

623
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,600
Bravo!

624
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,520
Bravo!

-Bravo! -Bravo!

626
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,469
Bravo!

627
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,219
Good!

628
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:48,030
-Bravo! -Bravo!

629
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,750
-Beautiful! -So beautiful!

630
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,010
What a great dance!

631
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:51,719
Bravo!

632
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,500
Bravo!

633
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:56,800
Bravo!

634
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,470
Good!

635
00:34:59,150 --> 00:34:59,830
Bravo!

636
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:13,810
There are too many people here,

637
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,950
let me bring you somewhere else.

638
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,060
-Bravo! -Bravo!

639
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,500
-Bravo! -Bravo!

640
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,060
Yinlou-

641
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,000
Bravo!

642
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:37,840
Where is she?

643
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,740
Yuwen Liangxu!

644
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:15,930

Go find them!

684

Where is he?

685
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,080
He escaped before me.

686
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,270
Where are you going?

this is the first time

someone other than my mother

691
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,790
has given me a lantern.

692
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,160
What are you doing?

693
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:50,650
Look.

694
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,300
Doesn't it look like a fish swimming in water?

695
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,100
When I was young,

696
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,990
I read Wang Jingwen's "To the tune of 'Francolins in the sky'."

697
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,130
"A boat flies freely,

698
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,440
not knowing right from wrong.

699
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,640
Idling after catching fish,

700
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,160
refusing to return if not.

701
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,100
Akin to indolence, or to madness.

702
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,460
Who knows of this happiness?

703
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,400
The luxurious hall sees only beautiful lanterns,

704
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,760
but not the moon above a peaceful river."

705
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,540
When I was young, I just found it interesting.

706
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,190
Only now, I think I truly understand it.

707
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,170
The rarest thing in life

708
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,240
is that moon above a peaceful river.

709
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,540
It might be rare,

710
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,300
but you will encounter it eventually.

711
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:37,940
Isn't this a moment

712
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,030
with the moon above a peaceful river?

713
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,730
♫ The flowers have scatter ♫

714
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,020
♫ Their color has changed ♫

715
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,390
♫ Overlapping, disillusioning ♫

716
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,450
♫ Warmth still remains ♫

717
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,290
♫ What can I do ♫

718
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,750
♫ The song of longing ♫

719
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,420
♫ Sings of nothing but ♫

720
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,330
♫ The entanglement between sobriety and intoxication ♫

721
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,900
♫ I'm still awake but I can't do anything ♫

722
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,950
♫ I'm still pretending in my dream ♫

723
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:16,760
♫ I don't know I am a wanderer ♫

724
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,290
♫ I want to know how ♫

725
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:24,010
♫ You could divide this moonlight ♫

726
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,320
-So pretty! -It's so pretty!

727
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,420
♫ Or is there not an ♫

728
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:32,580
♫ Otherwise ♫

729
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,690
Where did they go?

730
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:41,230
Mistress.

731
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,620
Lanterns for sale!

732
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,540
Really.

733
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,220
Gift a lantern to your lover,

734
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,230
Mistress.

735
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,580
and husband and wife will always be together.

736
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,470
Tong- Tongyun.

737
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,240
Do you think the lanterns are pretty?

738
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,450
It's a cloud.

739
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,640
So beautiful...

740
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,110
Not at all.

741
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,450
Don't waste your time.

742
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,380
Come with me to find my mistress.

743
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,570
What's the rush?

744
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,290
Her Highness won't be in danger

745
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,420
since she's with my godfather.

746
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,400
Take it.

747
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:07,990
This one.

748
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,590
Okay.

749
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,860
Take it.

750
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,110
Shall we... go play too?

751
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,410
Let's go.

752
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,010
Let's go.

753
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:22,480
Take care.

754
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,040
Lanterns for sale!

755
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,150
Chief Xiao,

756
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,960
do you come here every year

757
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,470
during the Lantern Festival?

758
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,260
I like the Lantern Festival.

759
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,640
Why?

760
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,410
Because I know someone

761
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,550
who likes it.

762
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,900
Then, I liked it too.

763
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,090
Every year at this time,

764
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,530
he would come to admire the lanterns.

765
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,460
He won't leave even after the crowd disperses.

766
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,650
What's there left to see

767
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,830
after the crowd is gone?

768
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,700
Because only then,

769
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,840
he could pick up the lanterns

770
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,850
left behind by the visitors.

771
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,410
In the eighth year of Tianyou,

772
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,930
his hometown suffered a locust attack.

773
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,580
The government's relief money and provisions

774
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,430
were almost completely pocketed by officials.

775
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,190
There was nothing to eat,

776
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,340
and the price of rice was exorbitant.

777
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,520
He sold all the properties left to him

778
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,740
by his ancestors.

779
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,100
Even then,

780
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,180
he couldn't keep his family fed.

781
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,330
Later, his parents died, one after another.

782
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,550
He and his brother

783
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,690
entered the capital as beggars.

784
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,140
His first day here

785
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,150
was the day of the Lantern Festival.

786
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:52,730
Brother,

787
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,620
look how pretty the lantern is.

788
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,150
You are his brother?

789
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:14,780
He's in luck now.

790
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,290
You're rich and powerful,

791
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,170
so you can buy him

792
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,100
as many lanterns as he wants.

793
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,320
Where is he?

794
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:20,410
Why don't you ask him

795
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,460
to come out and have fun?

796
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,230
He's dead.

797
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,560
I didn't expect

798
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,170
that beneath his assured exterior,

799
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,890
he's just an orphan.

800
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,200
His only brother is gone too.

801
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,720
He must have suffered a lot.

802
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,990
Let's float river lanterns together.

803
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:48,170
Let's go.
