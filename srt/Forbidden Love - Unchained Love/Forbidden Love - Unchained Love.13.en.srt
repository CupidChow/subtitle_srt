[Episode 13]

4
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,460
Make a wish.

5
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,700
I have no wishes.

6
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,780
How could you have no wishes?

7
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,500
Just say something

8
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,940
you can't have

9
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,300
that you really want.

10
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,180
May the way of the world be virtuous,

11
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,620
and peace be everlasting.

12
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,620
May our citizens never again have to be

13
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,020
separated from their loved ones.

14
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,220
May this world

15
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,890
never need another person like me.

16
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,980
The second half doesn't count.

17
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,820
Why not?

18
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,020
The Great Ye needs the Zhaoding Bureau

19
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,380
and people like me

20
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,579
only when the world is not

21
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,500
orderly and peaceful.

22
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,180
When the Great Ye

23
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,180
no longer needs me,

24
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,380
it means the world has really gotten better.

25
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,620
Even if the world becomes better one day,

26
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,500
and the Great Ye doesn’t need

27
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,380
people like you anymore,

28
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,420
there are still many people

29
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,300
who need you.

30
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,540
Like Cao Chun'ang,

31
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,380
Chief She,

32
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,370
and all of your men

33
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,660
at the Zhaoding Bureau.

34
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,940
Chief She told me

35
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,820
many of your Zhaoding Guards

36
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,260
were of lowly birth.

37
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,340
Most of them are orphans

38
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,660
who had no way out

39
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,340
other than joining the Zhaoding Bureau.

40
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,980
You protected them,

41
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,620
and helped them survive

42
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,900
in the midst of complicated power struggles

43
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,860
between the rich and power in the capital.

44
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,860
Qilang is a big-mouthed one.

45
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,620
You are their leader.

46
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,980
Even if the Great Ye doesn’t need you anymore,

47
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,500
they will still need you.

48
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,460
What about you?

49
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,420
Do you need me?

50
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,780
I...

51
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,780
Of course I need you.

52
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,620
Why?

53
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,940
Because you're a good person.

54
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,100
You suffered so much

55
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,260
but you only wish that

56
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,300
others won't have to suffer

57
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,180
like you did.

58
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,580
You seem to have done countless evils,

59
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,580
but your sword

60
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,260
only kills corrupt officials.

61
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,540
Your reputation is sullied,

62
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,220
but you are truly

63
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,660
protecting this country

64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,500
and protecting its people.

65
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,019
Actually,

66
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,660
you are a very gentle person.

67
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,900
I'm not as good as you think I am.

68
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,900
You are.

69
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,740
My mother said that

70
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,860
river lanterns send our well wishes

71
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,740
to our deceased relatives,

72
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,620
telling them that

73
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,620
we are living very well.

74
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,580
You're doing very well now.

75
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,860
Knowing this,

76
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,300
they will be happy for you.

77
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,540
All right.

78
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,700
Come on.

79
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,740
Let's float the river lanterns.

80
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:18,960
Thank you.

81
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,620
For what?

82
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,060
It's just a river lantern.

83
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,500
I am thankful

84
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,140
I got to meet you.

85
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,540
I used to despise myself,

86
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,580
but after meeting you,

87
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,340
I think

88
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,900
I like myself a little now.

89
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,700
Why?

90
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,980
Why are you laughing?

91
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,220
Nothing.

92
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,380
Let's go over there.

93
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,700
Okay.

94
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,140
-Bravo! -Bravo!

95
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,500
-Bravo! -Bravo!

96
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,020
-Bravo! -Bravo! -Bravo!

97
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,820
-Bravo! -Bravo!

98
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,340
It's fun to watch,

99
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,740
but she's not as good as I am.

100
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,580
-Bravo! -Bravo!

101
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,860
Even if you say so,

102
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,860
I can't tell the difference.

103
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,740
Why can't you tell?

104
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,700
Didn't you see me in the Dream House?

105
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,180
-Bravo! -Bravo!

106
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,980
It was dark that day,

107
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,100
I couldn't see clearly.

108
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,810
Bravo!

109
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,180
-Bravo! -Great! -Bravo!

110
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,700
Don't try to fool me

111
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,820
into dancing for you again.

112
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,500
Let's watch this.

113
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,380
-Bravo! -Bravo!

114
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,300
Bravo!

115
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,460
-Bravo! -Bravo!

116
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,780
How could you have no wishes?

117
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,460
Just say something

118
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,940
you can't have

119
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,180
that you really want.

120
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:43,900
Actually,

121
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,900
what I want the most

122
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:49,980
is...

123
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,580
Bravo!

124
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,540
Just like Xishi's veiled face, you make all others pale in comparison.

125
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,570
Your Majesty.

126
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,620
By the way,

127
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,740
about the Dream House...

128
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,540
Sun Taiqing was out of line.

129
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,660
I've already punished him.

130
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,460
And you.

131
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,420
Chief Xiao.

132
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,780
How could you

133
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,460
be so irresponsible too?

134
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,140
I was thoughtless

135
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,100
and humiliated Her Highness.

136
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,690
It had nothing to do with Chief Xiao.

137
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,500
I insisted on going.

138
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,660
Actually...

139
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,780
Actually, you didn't have to do that.

140
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,460
No matter what you are like,

141
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,380
I still like you.

142
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,860
Your Majesty.

143
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,460
Isn't there a banquet at the palace tonight?

144
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,620
Why are you out?

145
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,100
I...

146
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,299
sneaked out.

147
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,340
It's such a beautiful night.

148
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,020
How could I spend it

149
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,660
with those old men of the imperial court?

150
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:48,780
I only

151
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,780
want to spend it with you.

152
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,380
Besides,

153
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,340
there are so many people on the streets tonight.

154
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,420
I could find you

155
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,940
in the crowd

156
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,340
at a glance.

157
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,540
Don't you think

158
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,700
it's because Heaven

159
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,340
wanted me to find you too?

160
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,580
This lantern

161
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,020
is coarsely-made.

162
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,860
It's not good enough for you.

163
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,140
Come on, Sun Taiqing.

164
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,100
Let me show you

165
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,260
what's really interesting.

166
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,100
Zouma lanterns.

167
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,970
They're so beautiful.

168
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,980
Your Highness.

169
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,060
Every lantern here

170
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,420
was made specially for you

171
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,300
by His Majesty.

172
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,460
Your Majesty.

173
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,820
You are so skilled.

174
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,050
If you weren't the Emperor,

175
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,220
and opened a lantern shop instead,

176
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,820
you would definitely be the best in the capital.

177
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,500
Your Highness,

178
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,980
you shouldn't say that.

179
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,260
It's okay.

180
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,220
So,

181
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,020
do you like

182
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,620
my present to you?

183
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,420
Yes.

184
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:35,780
Great.

185
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,540
That makes all my effort on them

186
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,900
worth it.

187
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,140
What are those words

188
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,420
on the seal?

189
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,700
It is

190
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,460
my nickname.

191
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,140
Youwu.

192
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,580
[The Flight of Chang'e to the Moon]

193
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,460
What is your nickname?

194
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,170
On a beautiful night,

195
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,380
sharing one's nickname with one's beloved.

196
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,940
It's like a scene straight out of an opera.

197
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,900
Your Highness,

198
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,900
tell His Majesty, quickly.

199
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,820
My nickname...

200
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,980
My nickname is...

201
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,420
Here, don't catch a cold.

202
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,980
Your Highness and His Majesty

203
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,140
are a perfect match.

204
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,180
Bravo!

205
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,060
Bravo!

206
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:21,820
Bravo!

207
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,500
Bravo!

208
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,580
Bravo!

209
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,740
It's brilliant.

210
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,580
Over there.

211
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,260
-Bravo! -Bravo!

212
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,660
-Bravo! -Bravo!

213
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:08,980
Money!

214
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,340
That's a lot of money!

215
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,020
Be careful!

216
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,540
Yinlou!

217
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,740
I picked it up first.

218
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,260
Put it down.

219
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,580
Scram!

220
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,860
Your Majesty,

221
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,260
this man is a spy

222
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,940
the Prince of Nanyuan planted in the capital.

223
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:55,820
Yinlou!

224
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,420
I won't allow anyone

225
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,900
to hurt you!

226
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,580
I can protect you now.

227
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,740
Only I can protect you.

228
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,450
Your Majesty.

229
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:25,940
Be careful.

230
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,100
Your Majesty.

231
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,380
It's fine to kill him.

232
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,460
It doesn't matter.

233
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,700
It's an honor

234
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,060
even to royalty and aristocrats

235
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,180
to be killed by the Emperor himself,

236
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,860
much less to say a mere spy.

237
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,340
The King of Nanyuan has his eye on us.

238
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,460
It seems that staying outside the palace

239
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,820
is not the safest option.

240
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:03,860
Yinlou,

241
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,020
once you recover,

242
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,260
come back to the palace with me

243
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,340
and receive a title.

244
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,500
Your Majesty.

245
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,020
The situation at court is complicated now.

246
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,100
Once your edict has been issued,

247
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,980
I’m afraid there will be criticism from the court.

248
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,220
Chief Xiao,

249
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,940
shouldn’t it be easy

250
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,380
for you to handle this?

251
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,180
We just need to

252
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,980
get Her Highness a new identity

253
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,380
to cover it up.

254
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,660
Her Highness got injured so severely

255
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,460
in such a short time outside the palace.

256
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,140
It shows that

257
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,540
she will be the safest

258
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,500
when she returns to His Majesty.

259
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:39,900
But-

260
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,820
Chief Xiao,

261
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,620
I’ve made up my mind.

262
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,820
Her Highness is severely injured.

263
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,940
Please allow me

264
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,620
to take her back for treatment.

265
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:51,620
No need.

266
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,700
I'll send her myself.

267
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,380
Don't follow me.

268
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,700
There's something I want you to do.

269
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,020
In the past, I was too merciful.

270
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,020
I left the Prince of Nanyuan unchecked

271
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:05,819
to grow his influence

272
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,900
in the capital.

273
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,540
I want you to find out

274
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,660
which officials at court

275
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,180
are affiliated with him.

276
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,660
I want to purge

277
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,819
all his followers.

278
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

279
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,180
Here.

280
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,980
[Xiao's Residence]

281
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,500
Over the past few days,

282
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,180
thirteen officials in the Prince of Nanyuan's camp

283
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,780
have been imprisoned.

284
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,580
Their seized property have been transferred into the Treasury.

285
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,380
Would you like to

286
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,380
personally verify the exact sum?

287
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,620
Steward Zheng.

288
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,580
Master.

289
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,100
What are you doing?

290
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,460
Lady Bu is leaving.

291
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,100
We were told to pack up.

292
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,380
It's interesting.

293
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,260
She didn't have much when she came,

294
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,860
but now that she's leaving, there's quite a lot.

295
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,060
Yes.

296
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,860
The documents pertaining to

297
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,980
changing Her Highness' identity

298
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,260
are ready.

299
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,420
Do you want to take a look?

300
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,860
Don't worry.

301
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,620
Her Highness won't get bullied in the palace.

302
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,060
We should be thankful if she doesn't

303
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,140
bully others.

304
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,500
Besides,

305
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,730
your people are everywhere in the palace.

306
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,940
Send some men we trust

307
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,340
from the Zhaoding Bureau

308
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,420
to protect Her Highness.

309
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,500
That's right.

310
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,900
Who would be stupid enough

311
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,340
to dare touch Her Highness?

312
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,700
The Zhaoding Bureau will not spare him.

313
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,020
Godfather,

314
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980
I must say something else.

315
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,380
This is not the time to get distracted.

316
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,340
You still have things you must do,

317
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,860
and Her Highness has a fate

318
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,700
she must face.

319
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:13,980
Get out.

320
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,420
What-

321
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,780
What do you want?

322
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,340
You don't feel reluctant

323
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,620
to return to the palace anymore?

324
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,620
That's it?

325
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,900
Did anyone ask what I wanted?

326
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,500
Does anyone care?

327
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,540
I do.

328
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,780
You've done enough for me,

329
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,930
you've even saved my life.

330
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,020
I feel embarrassed

331
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,980
for being a burden to you.

332
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,330
Besides,

333
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,260
it's not my first time

334
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,260
in the Imperial City.

335
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,620
Don't worry.

336
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,820
If I receive an official title,

337
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,660
I won't forget your kindness.

338
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,780
With my brains,

339
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,570
I can live a good life in the Inner Court.

340
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,740
When that time comes,

341
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,460
we can look out for each other

342
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,580
and support each other.

343
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,780
In a few years, I will also be

344
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,220
a powerful influence in the Great Ye.

345
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,220
The whole Imperial City will have to bow down to us.

346
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,020
If anyone bullies us,

347
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:57,980
they'll be doomed.

348
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,340
Doesn't it sound

349
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,060
very exciting?

350
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,460
I...

351
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,180
I forgot.

352
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,220
I-

353
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,940
I haven't packed up the table in the courtyard.

354
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,760
♫ I will not hide ♫

355
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:29,550
♫ My love for you is never cowardly ♫

356
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,600
♫ This is my ♫

357
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:35,980
♫ Promise of my lifetime ♫

358
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,800
♫ Let this fire ♫

359
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:44,060
♫ Burn up the entanglements of my previous life ♫

360
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,380
Thank you

361
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,260
for taking care of me.

362
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,820
♫ For the rest of my life ♫

363
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,330
♫ I'll stay with you ♫

364
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,840
♫ I won't hide ♫

365
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,660
♫ My love for you is never cowardly ♫

366
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,830
♫ This is my ♫

367
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:04,210
♫ Promise of my lifetime ♫

368
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,820
♫ Let this fire ♫

369
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:12,080
♫ Burn up the entanglements of my previous life ♫

370
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,630
♫ For the rest of my life ♫

371
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,440
♫ I'll stay with you ♫

372
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:35,740
Godfather.

373
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,500
Are you really going to ask His Majesty

374
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,940
to withdraw his edict?

375
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,460
He has already made up his mind.

376
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,660
Why would you

377
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,690
ask for trouble?

378
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,780
It's not worth it.

379
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,540
I don't have a plan even if I wanted to.

380
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,620
All the more you mustn't go.

381
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,330
There will be a way.

382
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,180
Eunuch Zhang.

383
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,690
Eunuch Zhang, I beg you.

384
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,020
Yes.

385
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,220
My family has been loyal to the Emperor for generations,

386
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,540
we would never befriend traitors.

387
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,140
Your Majesty,

388
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,420
please help us.

389
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,700
Madam.

390
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,420
Madam Bu.

391
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,100
The Empress Dowager has

392
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,660
made her intentions clear.

393
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,060
How about

394
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,740
we call it a day?

395
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,060
Eunuch Zhang.

396
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:15,810
Daughters of the Bu family

397
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,420
would never marry a rebel.

398
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,660
If she gets married,

399
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,420
her dowry would be white rope to hang herself with.

400
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,540
Don't talk nonsense

401
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,740
inside the palace.

402
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,060
What are you waiting for?

403
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,620
Help Her Ladyship up.

404
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,820
I think my daughter

405
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,660
is doomed.

406
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,660
I might as well

407
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,990
-kill myself here! -Madam!

408
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,980
Please don't, Madam.

409
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,060
Let me die.

410
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,500
Madam.

411
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,220
Madam.

412
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:34,660
Eunuch Zhang.

413
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:35,980
What’s the fuss?

414
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,500
Chief Xiao.

415
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,900
Greetings, Chief Xiao.

416
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,780
Here’s the thing.

417
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,340
The late Emperor

418
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,620
had bethrothed the legitimate daughter of the Bu family

419
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,540
to the Prince of Nanyuan as his concubine.

420
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,700
It was a good thing,

421
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,820
but now

422
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,380
things have changed.

423
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,380
At court,

424
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,060
the officials in the Prince of Nanyuan's camp

425
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,660
have all been demoted

426
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,420
or had their property confiscated.

427
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,340
Now that it has come to this,

428
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,540
the Bu family is of course no longer willing

429
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,180
to become in-laws with the Prince of Nanyuan.

430
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,220
The wedding is coming,

431
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,020
but they want to call off the engagement.

432
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,620
If you have no other orders,

433
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,980
I'll try to persuade-

434
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:26,980
I'll try to persuade her again.

435
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:28,780
Go back first.

436
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,380
Okay.

437
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,380
Help her.

438
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,340
Hurry.

439
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,220
Your Majesty.

440
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,660
Grand Tutor Bu's wife

441
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,740
wanted to see the Empress Dowager.

442
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,170
She wants to call off the engagement.

443
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,660
I heard that

444
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,660
Chief Xiao is taking down

445
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,620
old allies of the Prince of Nanyuan right now.

446
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,140
If they get married,

447
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,660
the Bu family would take a hit.

448
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,860
When that happens,

449
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,980
Yinlou would definitely bear a grudge against me.

450
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,580
As for Bu Yulu,

451
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,180
he doesn't have many achievements,

452
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,340
and rarely

453
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,740
interacts with the Prince of Nanyuan.

454
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,180
He would be the last one

455
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,220
to collude with the Prince of Nanyuan.

456
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,340
Now,

457
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,580
I have decided to demote the Prince.

458
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,500
It's fine,

459
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,620
let them call off the engagement.

460
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:24,860
Your Majesty.

461
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,860
The Prince of Nanyuan holds the military power of West Shu.

462
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,340
If you demote him,

463
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,820
he might use it as an excuse

464
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,860
to collude with the other Princes and start a rebellion.

465
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,220
It will be hard to deal with him then.

466
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,300
If Your Majesty wants to take him down,

467
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,540
why not do it in a roundabout way?

468
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,580
What do you mean?

469
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,940
The engagement of the Bu family is an opportunity.

470
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,420
His Majesty can send someone

471
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,340
to West Shu

472
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,140
together with the bride's entourage.

473
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,100
We can familiarize ourselves with the Prince of Nanyuan,

474
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,260
before waiting for a chance to take action.

475
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,980
So this wedding must still happen.

476
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,500
Chief Xiao,

477
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,540
I only trust you.

478
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,220
I will have to trouble you

479
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,540
to make this trip.

480
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

481
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:11,940
But...

482
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,980
At this moment,

483
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,260
we are thinking about

484
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,740
how to deal with the Prince of Nanyuan.

485
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,420
The Prince of Nanyuan

486
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,540
has his eyes on the capital.

487
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,460
If he makes a big fuss

488
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,300
about Her Highness' status as Consort Dowager,

489
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,780
it might ruin our plans.

490
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,140
You mean...

491
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,100
Yinlou can't return to the palace?

492
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,700
Am I not just taking a Consort?

493
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,540
Why is there always

494
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,260
an obstacle

495
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,380
in front of me?

496
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,660
As long as West Shu is in turmoil,

497
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,900
His Majesty will be at the mercy of others.

498
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,540
I'll think again  about West Shu.

499
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,140
Please handle

500
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,820
the affairs regarding the wedding.

501
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,940
You must go as early as possible,

502
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,140
tomorrow would be best.

503
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,300
You can arrive first.

504
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,450
As for the dowry,

505
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,290
we can send them there at a later date,

506
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,460
once they're ready.

507
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

508
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,580
Your Majesty.

509
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,260
Chief Xiao has repeatedly defied you

510
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,020
on the matter of bringing Her Highness back to the palace.

511
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,780
He's also becoming

512
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,020
more and more disrespectful towards you.

513
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,860
I'm afraid he's become disloyal.

514
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,020
Are you really sending him to West Shu?

515
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,420
What if he colludes with the Prince of Nanyuan?

516
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,540
Look.

517
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,420
The Zhaoding Bureau

518
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,020
has always relied on the authority of the Emperor.

519
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,540
The Prince of Nanyuan

520
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,180
would never trust Xiao Duo.

521
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,340
When two giants fight,

522
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,660
one will be injured.

523
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,020
No matter who dies and who is injured,

524
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,140
I...

525
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,860
I

526
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,980
will be the one who benefits.

527
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,460
Your Majesty,

528
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,100
you are really different from before.

529
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,420
I thought

530
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,620
you would continue to

531
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,220
rely on Chief Xiao.

532
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,170
I have been

533
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,530
reading the records of the late Emperor recently.

534
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,540
I've learned a lot.

535
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,140
At the beginning of Emperor Taizu's reign,

536
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,180
the court was in turmoil,

537
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,740
so he established the Zhaoding Bureau

538
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,140
to supervise the officials and ministers.

539
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,620
Through the generations,

540
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,300
the Zhaoding Bureau became more and more powerful.

541
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,340
In my time,

542
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,450
the court already fears Chief Xiao

543
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,740
more than they fear me.

544
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,300
When I first ascended the throne,

545
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,260
you once said

546
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,620
you would make everyone on their knees submit to me

547
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:37,900
and fear me.

548
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,210
Look.

549
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,730
If Xiao Duo never leaves the capital,

550
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,780
when would I be able to hold absolute power

551
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,220
in my own hands?

552
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,940
When would I be able to make everyone

553
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,060
submit to me

554
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,060
and fear me?

555
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,020
Come.

556
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,540
Alright, Yinge,

557
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,460
stop crying.

558
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,300
Don't worry.

559
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,460
I won't let you marry him.

560
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,700
I thought His Majesty

561
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,020
would call off this engagement.

562
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,860
Why did he confirm it

563
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,700
after you went to the palace?

564
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,140
What did His Majesty say?

565
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,780
Is he suspecting that I'm disloyal?

566
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,980
Bu Yulu,

567
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,420
you're just a Grand Tutor.

568
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,420
You're not significant enough

569
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,980
for His Majesty to be suspicious of you.

570
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,860
You coward.

571
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,580
All you do is pretend to be sick

572
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,500
and hide at home.

573
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,420
Marrying you

574
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,700
was my biggest misfortune.

575
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,340
The Zhaoding Bureau

576
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,700
is eradicating former allies of the Prince of Nanyuan.

577
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:58,940
Go out and take a look.

578
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,900
How many aristocratic families

579
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,740
have been exiled overnight?

580
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,540
Do you want to go with them?

581
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,220
If I don't stay home,

582
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,060
should I go out there

583
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,140
to be a moving target for them?

584
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,820
If the Prince of Nanyuan

585
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,740
really gets demoted,

586
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,500
what would happen to our Yinge?

587
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,020
There's no way she's getting married!

588
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,780
Fine!

589
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,380
At worst,

590
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,580
we'll disobey the edict,

591
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,380
and our whole family can die together.

592
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,180
You-

593
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,420
The Prince of Nanyuan's residence

594
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,100
only came to ask

595
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,140
for her date of birth.

596
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,660
They haven't even seen her.

597
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,820
By the way,

598
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,660
our family

599
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,540
doesn't only have one daughter.

600
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,620
Are you crazy?

601
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,580
Yinlou was conferred the title of Consort Dowager

602
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,180
by His Majesty himself.

603
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,300
You colluded with the Zhaoding Bureau.

604
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,460
Don't think I don't know.

605
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,860
Bu Yinlou has long left the mausoleum,

606
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,300
and is in the capital now.

607
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,420
All these years,

608
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,380
I've been really kind to her.

609
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,460
It's time for her to fulfil her filial duties.

610
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,060
You can't just swap her out as you wish.

611
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,660
She's His Majesty's woman.

612
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,220
If she really were,

613
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,340
His Majesty would have brought her

614
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,300
to the palace long ago.

615
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,260
How could he allow her

616
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,700
to waste her time outside?

617
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,900
How ignorant.

618
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,740
Usually,

619
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,820
I turn a blind eye

620
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,780
to what you do.

621
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,140
Don't go overboard.

622
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,770
On the day of the sacrifice,

623
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,220
you went to the palace

624
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,980
to talk to the eunuch in charge of selecting tribute ladies.

625
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,580
I haven't settled this score with you yet.

626
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,740
You're just starting

627
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,860
to feel sorry for that little bitch?

628
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,090
Why didn't you stop me back then?

629
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,700
Aren't you just like me?

630
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,020
You wanted the reward for being the family of a tribute lady.

631
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,460
You wanted the Bu family's sons

632
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,940
to advance in officialdom!

633
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,460
I think

634
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,980
you just realized

635
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,300
that bitch is worth something.

636
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,540
You want to rely on her to get promoted.

637
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,060
Otherwise, why didn't you tell her

638
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,860
that woman died a long time ago?

639
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,460
Aren't you afraid that

640
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,180
she will make a scene

641
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,220
and ruin your grand plans?

642
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,260
Enough!

643
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,380
His Majesty has given his order.

644
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,300
Yinge

645
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,020
has to get married no matter what.

646
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,660
You- You-

647
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,820
Mother.

648
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,300
My baby.

649
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,780
Don't cry.

650
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,140
Don't cry.

651
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,660
Don't listen to your father.

652
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,620
I will find a way out for you.

653
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,300
I won't let you get married.

654
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,460
I won't.

655
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,740
All right.

656
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,260
My baby.

657
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,659
He said he cared about me that day.

658
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:28,900
Mistress.

659
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:29,820
Mistress.

660
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,540
The Grand Tutor's residence sent a message,

661
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,380
saying that Her Ladyship is sick.

662
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,900
Which lady?

663
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:35,900
Who else?

664
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,060
Your mother!

665
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,500
Isn't my mother

666
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,500
fully recovered?

667
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,739
What illness is it?

668
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,580
What happened?

669
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,860
I don't know.

670
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,940
They said it was sudden,

671
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:48,540
and that she's dying.

672
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,100
Where is Chief Xiao?

673
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,060
Where did Chief Xiao go?

674
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:52,860
He’s in the palace.

675
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,699
He’s not here now.

676
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:55,889
Let's go.

677
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,610
Yinlou.

678
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,700
You're finally back.

679
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,660
Where is my mother?

680
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,140
What's the rush?

681
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,140
I'll take you to see her now.

682
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,340
What are you doing?

683
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,380
Let's go.

684
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,220
Godfather.

685
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,540
I know it has been difficult for you

686
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,980
to get to the Prince of Nanyuan for the past few years.

687
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,660
Now, His Majesty

688
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,780
has handed you an opportunity.

689
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,580
Even then, isn't it too hurried

690
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,260
for you to leave today?

691
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,020
You've been busy with wedding preparations

692
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,260
the whole day.

693
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,020
Doesn't His Majesty rely on you the most?

694
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,020
Why do I feel like he wants you

695
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,500
to leave for West Shu immediately?

696
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,420
It is a perilous task to serve the Emperor.

697
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,060
No matter how much he relied on me in the past,

698
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,060
now that he's sat on that throne for a while,

699
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,220
the way he looks at people

700
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,180
has changed.

701
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,420
The Zhaoding Bureau is too powerful.

702
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,690
It's only a matter of time before his trust in me begins to wane.

703
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,780
If this is so clear to you,

704
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,660
how dare you leave the capital now?

705
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,820
I'm different from the officials of the court.

706
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,140
No matter how capable I am,

707
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,260
I am still just a servant of the Murong family.

708
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,660
If he really wants to undermine me,

709
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,340
I have no way of resisting.

710
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,450
I might as well obey

711
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,820
and leave the capital.

712
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,780
My purpose

713
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,380
all along

714
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,220
has been in West Shu.

715
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,180
You can make contact with the Prince of Nanyuan's secret service

716
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,620
using this piece of jade.

717
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,740
Bring some men with you,

718
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,180
[Yuwen]

719
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,930
along with this jade,

720
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,500
to West Shu.

721
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,140
See what the Prince of Nanyuan has been up to recently.

722
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,540
Yes.

723
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,700
You said your purpose is in West Shu.

724
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,620
If you really

725
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,100
were concerned only with West Shu,

726
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,540
why did you stop Her Highness from entering the palace?

727
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,140
Not only did you offend His Majesty,

728
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,460
you also failed.

729
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,180
Cut the crap.

730
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,100
I have ordered Qilang

731
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,020
to wait at the port.

732
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,500
You guys make a move first

733
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,140
and escort the Bu family entourage.

734
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,020
I'll catch up with you later.

735
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,180
Aren't you coming with us?

736
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,980
You're really determined

737
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,580
to convince His Majesty to retract his order.

738
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,460
I can't let her enter the palace.

739
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,420
Master.

740
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,500
Master!

741
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,460
Master.

742
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,420
Yesterday, someone from the Grand Tutor's residence told me

743
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,660
that the concubine of the Bu family was sick.

744
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,500
Lady Bu insisted on leaving,

745
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,220
and hasn't come back since.

746
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:56,820
Godfather.

747
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,740
Maybe Her Highness is just visiting.

748
00:37:59,060 --> 00:37:59,780
If you go,

749
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,860
you'll cause a scene.

750
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:01,700
Following His Majesty’s orders, the Bu family

751
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,660
is marrying off their legitimate daughter.

752
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:11,300
[Xiao's Residence]

753
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,460
This is a highly inauspicious time

754
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,580
for a concubine of the family to fall ill.

755
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,660
Last night,

756
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,580
did the Bu family report

757
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,860
the illness of their concubine?

758
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,060
No.

759
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,100
What if Her Highness missed home,

760
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,620
and made up an excuse?

761
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,380
She only had to tell me. There's no need to lie.

762
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,410
Someone must have used false information

763
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,860
to lure her back home.

764
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,580
Have you been

765
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,940
stewing too long in subterfuge?

766
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,140
What could be wrong with going home?

767
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,940
Her Highness said that

768
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,340
she never received any letters from her mother after entering the palace.

769
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,980
Her mother wasn't at the old residence at Fushui town,

770
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,340
and hasn't showed up at the Bu residence in the capital.

771
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,180
Even the dowry list

772
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,740
doesn't include a contribution from her.

773
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,010
It's very suspicious.

774
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,180
It's another matter altogether whether she's alive or dead,

775
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,170
but this is definitely a ploy.

776
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,370
[Xiao’s Residence]

777
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,780
Chief Xiao,

778
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,860
what brings you here?

779
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,980
My daughter is already on the way.

780
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,100
Where is Consort Dowager Duan?

781
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:58,980
Consort Dowager Duan?

782
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,740
Isn't she

783
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,820
at your residence?

784
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:04,660
Chief!

785
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,100
I found Tongyun.

786
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,340
This... How dare you!

787
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,860
My husband is the Grand Tutor,

788
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,860
an ordained official of the court.

789
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,740
How dare you

790
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,140
search our residence for no reason?

791
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,380
Shut up!

792
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,420
My wife is ignorant.

793
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,940
Please be magnanimous, Chief Xiao,

794
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,620
and forgive her.

795
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,020
Chief Xiao,

796
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,540
please save my mistress.

797
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,980
They are forcing her to get married as a replacement.

798
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,820
She just left.

799
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,460
She'd better be safe.

800
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,660
Otherwise, I am a narrow-minded person,

801
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,860
and will not let this pass.

802
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,060
Cao Chun'ang.

803
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,500
Inform Qilang immediately.

804
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,780
We can't let the entourage ships

805
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,620
leave the port.

806
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,740
Dispatch men from the Zhaoding Guard Stations

807
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,780
in the area

808
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,140
to intercept

809
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,180
the Bu family entourage.

810
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,500
Don't let a single one of them leave.

811
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:56,580
Yes.

812
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:03,660
You...

813
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,860
Xiao Duo.

814
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,180
Xiao Duo.

815
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,940
Xiao Duo must not know yet.

816
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,180
I have to escape.

817
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,940
I can't marry into West Shu.

818
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,580
I must find her.

819
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:40,980
After her!

820
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,540
After her!

821
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,220
Stop!

822
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:43,980
Stop!

823
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,380
Stop!

824
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,380
Stop running.

825
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,780
Don't worry.

826
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,580
Stop running.

827
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,540
Relax.

828
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:58,690
Don't come near me.

829
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,580
Don't come near me!

830
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,260
Don't come near me!

831
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,740
Listen up.

832
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,730
I'm the bride from the Bu family

833
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,620
who is getting married to the Prince of Nanyuan.

834
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,620
The late Emperor ordered the marriage.

835
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:08,820
If I get hurt,

836
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,300
none of you can escape scot-free.

837
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,420
How about you let me go?

838
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,580
All of us will be safe and sound.

839
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,260
Otherwise,

840
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,340
I'll kill whoever I catch.

841
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,420
I'll kill whoever I catch.

842
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,260
I didn't mean to run away.

843
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,580
Take me to Fushui Town.

844
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:06,940
Hurry.

845
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,580
Okay, I'll take you there.
