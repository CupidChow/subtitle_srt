1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,000
[Episode 39]

19
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,250
The former Lady Fu Ling was spirited and resolute,

20
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,730
with swift and ruthless judgment.

21
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,750
Although you are holding a sharp blade,

22
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,660
there’s no opportunity to wield it.

23
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,340
What a pity.

24
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,840
Why don't I give you a chance?

25
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,510
What do you want?

26
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,750
I've said that

27
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,680
once I've returned, I shall reign supreme over the world.

28
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,420
Although the Eastern Continent's Eternals and demons are weak,

29
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,230
a good number of them collectively

30
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,329
makes for a decent supplement.

31
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,060
As long as you obey

32
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,260
and capture Eternals and demons for me,

33
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,040
you are allowed to enter and exit

34
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,500
Cold Spring Palace freely.

35
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,940
After all,

36
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,650
you used to do this sort of thing all the time,

37
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,620
didn’t you?

38
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,190
No way.

39
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,280
What if Chong Zhao's life is at stake?

40
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,260
Let's see how you choose.

41
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,850
Chong Zhao!

42
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,700
Xi.

43
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:13,900
Xi.

44
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,480
Chong Zhao.

45
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,740
You are still here.

46
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,019
You really are still here.

47
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,190
There’s still so much we haven’t accomplished yet.

48
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,810
I know you're waiting for me.

49
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,110
I won't disappear so easily.

50
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,660
How sincere

51
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,870
and touching.

52
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,230
Actually, the existence of you two

53
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,480
is not something

54
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,330
I find entirely unacceptable.

55
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,740
Chong Zhao.

56
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,380
Persuade her well.

57
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,850
Instead of resisting,

58
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,460
why not obey me?

59
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,780
That's the only wise choice.

60
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,350
Xi.

61
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,550
You were forced to be a demon for ten years

62
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,810
and suffered for ten years.

63
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,290
You finally escaped Cold Spring Palace

64
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,650
to become Bai Xi again.

65
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,750
You must not go back to your old ways.

66
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,350
The righteousness of the world

67
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,050
and your future is always more important than my life.

68
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,320
Don't you ever feel threatened by him.

69
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,370
That's not what I want to hear.

70
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,070
Zhao!

71
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,450
Zhao!

72
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,790
Xi.

73
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,610
Remember,

74
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,610
regardless of how Mo Li treats me,

75
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,480
even if he kills me,

76
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,040
you mustn't give in to him.

77
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,350
How stubborn.

78
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,070
I really don't understand

79
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,990
why you would fall for

80
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,650
such a boring and stubborn person.

81
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,100
You will

82
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,420
never understand his loyalty!

83
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,000
Your so-called morality

84
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,810
is the most hypocritical and ridiculous in my eyes.

85
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,610
I may have given you a chance,

86
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,030
but that doesn't mean you are irreplaceable.

87
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,540
Since you don't appreciate it,

88
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,490
you can just stand by and watch

89
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,390
how the Eternals and demons grovel at my feet,

90
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,900
begging for mercy.

91
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,190
Xiu Yan once said

92
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,040
he could feel that

93
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,180
the Xing Yue Divine Bow is right above the Eastern Continent.

94
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,770
But no matter how I summon it,

95
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,640
the Divine Bow wouldn't appear.

96
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,700
The Contemplation Stone and the Outlander King's Sword also had no reaction to it.

97
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,100
The Contemplation Stone and the Sword acknowledged you as its master

98
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,160
because they sensed that

99
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,710
you have Xing Yue's Divine Mantle,

100
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,380
but the Xing Yue Bow remained completely silent.

101
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,960
Unless...

102
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,290
Unless it's not yet awakened

103
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,630
and doesn't know it's a Divine Bow.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,640
Back then, the Xing Yue Divine Bow could defy Xing Yue's own wishes

105
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,980
and shot Jing Yuan down.

106
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,250
This means it has its own consciousness.

107
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,740
It's different from other divine objects.

108
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,490
Bad news.

109
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,020
Mo Li launched a sudden attack on various demon clans and Eternal sects.

110
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,490
Many Eternals and demons have nowhere to go.

111
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,000
They've all fled to the Polar Region for refuge.

112
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,150
Mo Li has gathered several demon warriors

113
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,409
to attack the Polar Region.

114
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,110
The Polar Region's terrain is vast and complex.

115
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,050
It's certainly possible to take in the Eternals and demons seeking refuge.

116
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,600
I believe the demon warriors of Bright Moon Palace

117
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,660
are not afraid of a battle.

118
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,800
But here in the Polar Region,

119
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,980
there are also many little demons that you saved.

120
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,240
If Mo Li attacks,

121
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,670
they won't be able to withstand it.

122
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,970
On the day we established this palace in the Polar Region,

123
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,540
I made it clear that no one would be allowed to encroach on my territory.

124
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,630
What are you trying to do?

125
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,110
Jing Yuan left all of his divine power to me.

126
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,480
I can summon the Purple Moon above the Polar Region

127
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,820
and protect the entire Polar Region with my primal power.

128
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,750
Although the primal power of the Demon Lord is strong,

129
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,900
the Polar Region spans hundreds of thousands of miles of land.

130
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,970
If you form a barrier with your divine power,

131
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,740
it will inevitably consume your power continuously.

132
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,670
Master.

133
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,280
You're draining yourself.

134
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,250
Anyone who comes to the Polar Region,

135
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,600
whether an Eternal or a demon,

136
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,500
is entrusting their life to me.

137
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,710
I will protect them all.

138
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,020
Master!

139
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,640
Aren't you going to stop him?

140
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,880
If he isn't going to resolve matters this way,

141
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,020
he wouldn’t be the Master of Bright Moon Palace

142
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,820
or the Fan Yue I know.

143
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,250
He has endured too much suffering

144
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,640
and faced too many hardships in the past.

145
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,220
That's why he wants to stand in front of others

146
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,690
and shield those who are also suffering.

147
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,720
This is his choice.

148
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,400
I agree and I won't stop him.

149
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,450
As for my choice...

150
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,920
I've already told you,

151
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,480
We shall fight side by side,

152
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,060
sharing both life and death.

153
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,410
Purple Moon!

154
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,840
-It's the Purple Moon! 
 -It's the Purple Moon!

155
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,520
It's the Purple Moon! Look!

156
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,990
Purple Moon!

157
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,450
It's the Demon Lord who is using the Purple Lunar Power to form a barrier

158
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,820
in order to block Mo Li's attack.

159
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,330
I didn't expect that us Eternals have to escape to the Polar Region

160
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,300
and receive protection from Fan Yue

161
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,730
in order to survive.

162
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,670
Fan Yue.

163
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
I'm fine.

164
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,140
Previously, Eternals and demons all believed that

165
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,230
the Master of Bright Moon was ruthless by nature.

166
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,830
Now, they will all know that

167
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,090
you are the most merciful one.

168
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,790
It doesn't matter whether they know or not.

169
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,000
What matters is

170
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,870
no matter what happens next,

171
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,900
I mustn't allow Mo Li's wild ambitions succeed.

172
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,910
60,000 years ago,

173
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,570
Mo Li destroyed the Divine Region.

174
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,880
60,000 years later,

175
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,750
I won't let him destroy the Eastern Continent again.

176
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,240
It was exactly this Purple Moon that

177
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,870
gave me immense hope back then.

178
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,670
It's the same this time.

179
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,410
The appearance of the Purple Moon

180
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,800
will protect the Eternals and demons.

181
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,660
Mo Li,

182
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,870
you can't win after all.

183
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,080
Do you really think that the Purple Moon's protection of the Polar Region

184
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,700
will safeguard those Eternals and demons for a lifetime?

185
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,430
No one can stop me

186
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,070
from doing what I want.

187
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,900
Shuo and Fan Yue won't sit back and do nothing.

188
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,080
I'm sure they'll find a way to restrain you.

189
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,990
Really?

190
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,230
I'm afraid the Human Race can't wait till then.

191
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,350
What do you mean?

192
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,870
The humans are unaware of the Eternals, the demons,

193
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,210
or the Polar Region,

194
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,230
nor do they know about the impending catastrophe in the world.

195
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,630
They're still at the same place,

196
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,890
living their peaceful lives.

197
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,400
The Purple Moon can barely safeguard the Polar Region as it is.

198
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,690
How can it protect the entire Human Race?

199
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,820
You're...

200
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,760
You're actually planning to target the Human Race?

201
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,310
You're at least an ancient god.

202
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,380
How could you be this despicable?

203
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,060
In my eyes,

204
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,350
there is only success or failure.

205
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,340
There's no such thing as benevolence or otherwise.

206
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,030
Tomorrow,

207
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,870
I'll put on a good show for you.

208
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,600
Are you satisfied

209
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,980
with this show?

210
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,730
You want to use human blood

211
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,410
to break the Purple Lunar Barrier?

212
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,910
The Purple Moon's divine power is extremely yang,

213
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,670
while human blood is extremely yin.

214
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,120
Yin and yang neutralizes each other,

215
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,580
so why not?

216
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,750
Kill me if you dare!

217
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,570
Killing you would be too easy.

218
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,240
It's only fun if I torture you.

219
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,860
Offering the blood of thousands

220
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,480
will surely incur heaven's wrath

221
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,110
Heaven's wrath?

222
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,510
If the Heaven is capable of killing me,

223
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,300
I would have died 60,000 years ago.

224
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,520
Heaven has set a rule that only a Supreme Deity

225
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,750
can completely kill another Supreme Deity.

226
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,270
Even the Heaven has to follow its own rules.

227
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,280
Sacrifice?

228
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,950
Look at the scenery.

229
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,630
Blood staining the Polar Region.

230
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,490
How spectacular!

231
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,740
You'll face retribution.

232
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,240
You'll definitely face retribution!

233
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,250
Shut up!

234
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,530
I think I am already hearing

235
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,900
the blood currents climbing over the Purple Lunar Barrier.

236
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,730
Very soon...

237
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,220
Master.

238
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,340
All the Eternals and demons seeking refuge have been taken care of.

239
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,310
In the face of a powerful enemy,

240
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,310
both sides have set aside their past prejudices

241
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,520
and are living in peace.

242
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,330
Master.

243
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,470
What's wrong?

244
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,870
Are you not feeling well?

245
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,230
-Master!
-Fan Yue!

246
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,310
What's going on?

247
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,580
Human blood sacrifice?

248
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,210
The Purple Lunar Barrier has been broken.

249
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:47,920
Xi!

250
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,770
Shuo, I'm fine.

251
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,190
You're finally here.

252
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,180
Chong Zhao would never commit such a heinous act as a human blood sacrifice.

253
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,970
You are nothing like him.

254
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,960
How could a weak and incompetent Chong Zhao

255
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,710
ever compare to me?

256
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,320
The human blood broke the Purple Lunar Barrier so quickly.

257
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,500
It seems that you are no longer Jing Yuan.

258
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,410
Whether I'm Fan Yue or Jing Yuan,

259
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,780
I won't let you succeed.

260
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,880
The indiscriminate killing of

261
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,320
innocent humans is utterly inhumane.

262
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,380
Mo Li.

263
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,090
You don't deserve to be a deity.

264
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,990
That's not up to you to decide.

265
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,150
You all...

266
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,950
can't stop me from achieving my grand plan.

267
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,240
You've clearly overestimated your abilities.

268
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,930
You only have Xing Yue's Divine Mantle.

269
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,220
Now without the power of the Contemplation Stone,

270
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,349
you're nothing but an ant

271
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,119
in my eyes.

272
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,060
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

273
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,530
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

274
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,150
♫My love brought tears♫

275
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,350
♫Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completeness♫

276
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,400
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

277
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,810
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

278
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,000
♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

279
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,160
♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

280
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,160
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

281
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,250
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

282
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,490
♫The daylight burns through, and the stars shine bright♫

283
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,520
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

284
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,350
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

285
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,750
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

286
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,700
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

287
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,150
♫To protect the world for eternity♫

288
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,420
Where am I?

289
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,540
This is the Unbridled Pavilion.

290
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,010
Fan Yue took us back to Ning'an City.

291
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,940
Ning'an City?

292
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
I'm finally back.

293
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,430
Don't talk.

294
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,000
Let me give you some energy.

295
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,450
Shuo, don't cry.

296
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,990
In this lifetime,

297
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,670
it has been my greatest fortune

298
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,910
to be able to reunite with you.

299
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,310
But from now on,

300
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,070
I can't protect you any longer.

301
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,680
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

302
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,060
♫The flowers that bloomed once in a lifetime♫

303
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,290
No.

304
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,640
♫I remember that word of concern♫

305
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,390
We've only just reunited.

306
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,230
Didn't we agree to

307
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,510
♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

308
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,660
overcome difficulties

309
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,780
and start over together?

310
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,820
♫I remember that drop of tear♫

311
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,710
Don't leave me, will you?

312
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,970
♫It dried in the wind♫

313
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,820
I don't want you to leave you either, Shuo.

314
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,300
♫The one in the autumn wind♫

315
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,440
♫How many times have I seen you in my dreams?♫

316
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,020
But in this lifetime of mine,

317
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,700
I've done too much wrong.

318
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,680
♫That year, that year♫

319
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,580
I have to make up for it somehow.

320
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,020
The ten years spent in Cold Spring Palace

321
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,470
♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

322

♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

323
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,370
were like shackles

324
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,000

369
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,910
The dumplings are going to get cold if you don't eat.

370
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,500
Hurry up.

371
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,570
Hurry.

372
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,220
-Come on. Have a seat.
-Here.

373
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,200
-If you don't come back,
-Eat it while it’s hot.

374
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,540
Father wouldn't even let me eat.

375
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,670
Our dear Father

376
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,950
might not be the best with other dishes,

377
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,410
but these dumplings are at least decent.

378
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
Decent?

379
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,860
If it's just decent, then don't eat.

380
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,140
Give it to Xi.

381
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,170
Here.

382
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,690
Xi,

383
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,200
why aren't you eating?

384
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,940
Eat the dumplings while it's hot.

385
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,200
Eat your fill.

386
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,320
That's right.

387
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,250
Father.

388
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,640
What's wrong?

389
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,590
♫The last moonlight♫

390
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,780
It's nothing.

391
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,130
♫The water from my hometown flows gently♫

392
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,800
I just haven't seen you for a long time,

393
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,800
♫Sending me to the distant place♫

394
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,810
so I wanted to call you.

395
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,500
♫In this life, at this time♫

396
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,830
It's my fault.

397
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,140
I'm always busy with city's affairs,

398
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,310
♫I dare not look back♫

399
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,580
and I seldom spend time with you two.

400
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,790
Please don't blame me.

401
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,450
♫Is there the same moonlight♫

402
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,750
I don't blame you.

403
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,520
Why would I blame you?

404
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,540
♫On your path?♫

405
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,810
It's all my fault.

406
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,810
I've let you down.

407
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,410
♫I'm walking on a never-ending long road♫

408
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,070
I don't...

409
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,030
No, don't.

410
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,490
♫In the vast world, how can I get there?♫

411
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,740
Xi, what's wrong?

412
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,670
You...

413
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,570
You haven't even had a bite of my dumplings,

414
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,920
♫In the chaotic night wind, the melody stopped♫

415
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,230
and you are already crying just by the looks of it?

416
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,580
♫The moonlight is gentle♫

417
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,920
♫All the feelings turned into nothing but a dream♫

418
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,160
You're even crying your eyes out.

419
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,430
♫Reminiscing about the good old days♫

420
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,610
I was just thinking about some...

421
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,690
♫Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lost♫

422
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,650
some things I did before that hurt you.

423
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,370
♫Forget all about the past and leave it behind♫

424
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,270
♫Time after time♫

425
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,230
Since it's all in the past,

426
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:59,120
♫Oh, melancholy♫

427
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,740
then just let it go.

428
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,290
Have you forgotten what I've told you?

429
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,160
In our Bai family,

430
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,890
we don't stay angry overnight, and we don't hold grudges.

431
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,590
As a family, there's no need to apologize to each other.

432
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,120
-Right?
-Yeah.

433
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,660
Alright, stop crying.

434
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,170
Father.

435
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,110
Xi is back.

436
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,110
Xi will never leave you again.

437
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,280
Never.

438
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,090
All right.

439
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,130
Yes, you won't leave.

440
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,800
Since you've cried,

441
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,210
then just forget all the unhappy memories.

442
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,340
Hurry, try my dumplings.

443
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,920
Let's see if it's just decent.

444
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,940
Here, I'll get you another one.

445
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,120
Hurry.

446
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,970
How is it?

447
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,240
It's delicious.

448
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,270
Did you hear that?

449
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,240
It's delicious, not just decent.

450
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,150
If it's delicious, have some more.

451
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,630
Shuo.

452
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,370
If there's a next life,

453
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,610
let's stay together

454
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,350
as a family,

455
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,050
shall we?

456
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,300
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

457
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:09,090
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

458
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:19,180
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

459
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,150
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫

460
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,650
♫Across thousands of miles♫

461
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,100
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

462
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:59,130
♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

463
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,250
♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

464
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,190
It's the Xing Yue Divine Bow.

465
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,050
Bai Xi...

466
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,410
is the bow spirit of Xing Yue Divine Bow?

467
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,040
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

468
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,470
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

469
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,240
♫My love brought tears♫

470
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,290
♫Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completeness♫

471
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,540
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

472
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,170
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

473
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,000
♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

474
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,350
♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

475
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,160
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

476
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,190
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

477
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,570
♫The daylight burns through, and the stars shine bright♫

478
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,460
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

479
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,330
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

480
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,850
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

481
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,430
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

482
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,760
♫To protect the world for eternity♫

483
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,910
Why does my heart ache?

484
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:08,990
No.

485
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,630
I am not one to feel any heartache

486
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,160
nor shed any tears.

487
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,770
Chong Zhao.

488
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,090
It must be you!

489
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,270
You're indeed behind this.

490
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,570
Mo Li.

491
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,410
I'll kill you!

492
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,310
Do you really think

493
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,120
you're capable of hurting me?

494
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,850
Why did you kill her?

495
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,170
I had spared her life,

496
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,180
but she kept going against me

497
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,420
and was courting her own demise.

498
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,490
Chong Zhao.

499
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,700
Leaving you with your divine consciousness

500
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,520
is already a major grace from me.

501
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,220
It's best if you remain obediently

502
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,160
in the depths of this sea of consciousness.

503
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,840
If you dare to disturb me again,

504
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,490
I have no qualms of personally destroying

505
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,970
your last sliver of divine consciousness.

506
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,590
If you dare to destroy it, why haven't you done it yet?

507
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,780
As long as my divine consciousness is gone,

508
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,490
you will also be severely hurt.

509
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,060
If you don't destroy it,

510
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,350
I will.

511
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,060
Let go of me!

512
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,510
Destroying your own divine consciousness?

513
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,410
Dream on!

514
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,560
Why are you laughing?

515
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,060
I’m laughing because you’re pathetic.

516
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,810
You call yourself a deity,

517
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,110
but you have no idea what love is,

518
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,130
and no one loves you.

519
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,470
You keep saying you want to marry Xing Yue,

520
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,600
but that's only because you can't get her

521
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,990
and are trying to claim her through bloodshed.

522
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,560
But let me tell you,

523
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,880
you're wrong.

524
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,660
Love in this world can never come from possession.

525
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,890
You insignificant fools

526
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,700
are on the verge of death,

527
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,710
yet you dare speak of love in front of me.

528
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,880
How ridiculous.

529
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,520
Chong Zhao.

530
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,260
Xi!

531
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,290
Xi.

532
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,130
Xi!

533
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:58,870
♫If the wind intends to fill the sky with flowers♫

534
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,910
Xi.

535
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:05,920
♫The moon's brightness is also the result of stars falling into place♫

536
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,690
I've let you down.

537
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,600
I failed to protect you.

538
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,820
I'm sorry.

539
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,870
♫As the wind stirs, the clouds gather♫

540

♫As the clouds shift, the moon becomes full♫

00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,900
I'm sorry.

Chong Zhao.

♫Love is the hardest thing to understand♫

Don't cry, will you?

545
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,310
All of this is my personal choice.

546
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,610
The Divine Bow is emotionless.

547
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:28,800
♫I'm finally back to where it all started♫

548

593
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,960
why ten years ago,

594
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,190
when that demon tried to swallow me and Xi,

595
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,270

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,880
why Jin Yao couldn't kill her.

Don't you think Heaven is so heartless?

606
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,570
Did they bring Xi into this world

607
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,020
just for her to keep sacrificing herself for me?

608
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,100

not out of her mission as the Divine Bow,

00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,300
What happened?

632
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,630
Master used the Purple Lunar Power

633
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,070
to protect the entire Polar Region.

634
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,960
It has been consuming his divine power,

635
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,850
but with the addition of Mo Li's mass human blood sacrifice,

636
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,330
I'm afraid...

637
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,440
What will happen?

638
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,800
The Purple Moon is extremely yang, while human blood is extremely yin.

639
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,300
With Mo Li's sinister blood sacrifice,

640
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,520
human blood is now infused into the Purple Moon's divine power,

641
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,750
creating a force of both extreme yin and yang

642
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,400
that is clashing in Master's body.

643
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,590
Even with Master's divine body,

644
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,770
he's unable to bear the strain of these two opposing forces.

645
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,260
If this continues,

646
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,910
I'm afraid that Master...

647
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,180
I'm afraid Master's divine vein will snap,

648
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,060
and he will blow up and die.

649
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,610
Stay still!

650
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,300
Mo Li used the Heavenly Divine Miror

The power of you Eternals and demons

655
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,170
are no match for an ancient deity's divine power.

656

Mo Li.

657
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,720
Don't you dare assume we'll yield to you

658
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,420
just because you're stronger.

659
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,320
Whether a nobody like you surrenders to me

660
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,100
is of no importance to me.

661
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,350
Either way, I could crush you easily with a flick of my hand.

662
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,380
Why are you gathering all the Eternals and demons together here?

663

What are you trying to do?

or die

671
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,870

[To the esteemed Lady Tian Huo]

673
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Hidden Lord Mo Li, with the lives of all Eternals and demons at stake,

674
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,760
demands that Bai Shuo goes to Cold Spring Palace alone

675
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,350
within the next day.

676
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,200
If she does not arrive within the next day, or more than one person arrives,

677
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,380
he will kill all Eternals and demons.

678
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,500
We urge Lady Tian Huo to think carefully.

679
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,880
I've fed him the pill,

680
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,930
but he's still unconscious.

681
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,730
What's wrong?

682
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,900
Nothing.

683
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
Tian Huo.

684
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,720
At this point,

685
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,180
no matter what happens,

686
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,290
don't hide anything from me.

687
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,260
It's a letter from the demon warriors.

688
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,120
Mo Li has taken control of all the Eternals and demons

689
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,150
and sent word that

690
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,700
you are to go to Cold Spring Palace alone.

691
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,350
Otherwise, in one day,

692
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,110
he will kill all Eternals and demons.

693
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,860
You were always by my side during

694
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,510
every life-and-death moment in the past.

695
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,090
This time,

696
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,460
I'll have to face it myself.

697
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,590
Do you remember I once said that

698
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,790
the words "Xing Yue's Divine Mantle"

699
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,420
seems very light?

700
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,930
It seems so light that I could just assume it as a story,

701
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,730
but it also seems so heavy.

702
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,400
It's as though the fate of the entire world is weighing down on it.

703
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,230
I'm just a human.

704
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,640
I've never once thought of becoming a deity that could save the world.

705
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,140
But now, the world stands on the brink of catastrophe,

706
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,480
its safety suddenly hanging by a thread.

707
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,750
I cannot,

708
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,870
and will not run away.

709
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,130
Fan Yue.

710
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,610
Forgive me for leaving alone.

711
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,110
Have you really thought it through?

712
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,060
At this point,

713
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,610
I have no choice.

714
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,150
Fan Yue has almost expended himself

715
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,610
just to protect the Eternals and demons.

716
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,800
I won't back down either.

717
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,660
I have no idea if Fan Yue will ever wake up,

718
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,690
or when that might be.

719
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,010
But if he wakes up,

720
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,940
you mustn't let him go to Cold Spring Palace.

721
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,100
You may want to save the Eternals and demons,

722
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,800
but have you ever thought about yourself?

723
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,850
Mo Li is clearly targeting you

724
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,270
by demanding you go alone.

725
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,460
Back when my father was forced to die in Ning'an City,

726
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,380
I hated the world

727
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,490
when I was leaving.

728
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,920
I didn't believe in Eternals,

729
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,790
demons, humans,

730
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,450
and even deities.

731
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,400
But along the way,

732
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,000
I found that among all races,

733
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,800
there are still kindness.

734
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,180
There are countless beings

735
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,500
steadfastly upholding justice and their purpose.

736
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,690
They shouldn't be destroyed this way,

737
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,830
nor should the world end this way.

738
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,960
But the Outlander King's Sword is already broken.

739
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,740
Even if you have the Divine Bow,

740
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,350
you don't have usable arrows.

741
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,280
With just this trace of spiritual power left in you,

742
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,620
your journey

743
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,250
could very easily end in death.

744
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,850
In this world,

745
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,740
it's not always about being certain of success

746
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,830
or guaranteeing that nothing will go wrong before we take action.

747
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,930
Many times, we may not have the upper hand

748
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,590
or any certainty of success,

749
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,860
but we still risk it all

750
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,480
to protect

751
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,940
what matters to us,

752
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,240
don't we?

753
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,770
Everyone has their own responsibilities to fulfil.

754
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,710
Though the physical form of deity Xing Yue may have perished,

755
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,300
its Divine Mantle remains undiminished.

756
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,180
Perhaps, it's also for this very purpose.

757
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,870
Bai Shuo.

758
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,630
Tian Huo.

759
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,290
You've never feared death,

760
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,690
whether it was for Fan Yue

761
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,570
or Bright Moon Palace.

762
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,920
You definitely would know

763
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,110
and understand this feeling.

764
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,970
Right?

765
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,200
Don't worry.

766
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,490
I cherish my life,

767
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,740
and I generally have good luck.

768
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,440
I won't die so easily.

769
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,390
Tian Huo.

770
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,230
It has been my honor

771
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,980
to have known you

772
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,630
and journeyed with you.

773
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,760
Thank you

774
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,130
for everything along the way.

775
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,640
If I ever make it back,

776
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,400
let's have a drink together.

777
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,850
Bai Shuo is here.

778
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,250
She really came.

779
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,170
I didn't expect her to come.

780
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,250
You really came.

781
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,360
What?

782
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,320
Did Fan Yue not stop you?

783
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,680
Or is he simply too weak to stop you?

784
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,060
Let them go.

785
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,280
Both the Eternals and demons have never been nice to you.

786
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,650
They either look down on you

787
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,190
or have been itching to fight or kill you.

788
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,490
And yet, you still want to save them?

789
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,400
There's no need for all this nonsense.

790
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,520
You set the terms,

791
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,180
and I showed up as agreed.

792
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,560
I have done what I needed to do.

793
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,710
You should keep your promise too.

794
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,700
Fine.

795
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,430
As long as you promise me one thing,

796
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:58,070
I will spare all of them.

797
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,180
Bai Shuo.

798
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,530
Don't believe him.

799
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,650
Mo Li is ruthless.

800
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,370
He won't give up so easily.

801
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,030
How noisy.

802
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,720
Where did they go?

803
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,680
Don't worry.

804
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,340
They went back to where they came from.

805
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,210
Their lives are mine

806
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,090
to take at any moment, anyway.

807
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,680
What do you want me to do?

808
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,960
The wedding that was left unfinished 60,000 years ago

809
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,070
should now be completed.

810
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,920
I'm not Xing Yue.

811
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,860
It doesn't matter.

812
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,710
I just want to finish

813
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,820
what I didn't finish 60,000 years ago.

814
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,120
So regardless whether you are Xing Yue or not,

815
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,470
simply just with your face,

816
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:36,340
I must marry you.
