00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,900
[Jin Yao]

20
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,650
The Ming bell rings

21
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,260
and the soul lantern is out.

22
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,250
That's not right.

23
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,190
There is no war in Lanling today.

24
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,130
Why would the soul lantern go out?

25
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,310
Let's go.

26
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,700
Let's go to the soul lantern room.

27
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,800
Okay, let's go.

28
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,190
Impossible... Impossible!

29
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,610
How could our Sect Leader's soul lantern go out?

30
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,840
Impossible...

31
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,900
How could Sect Leader...

32
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,120
No one can kill our Sect Leader

33
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,990
and seniors in the entirety of the Eternal realm.

34
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,650
No, no.

35
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,340
This...

36
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,010
This lantern must be broken.

37
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,830
It must be a mistake!

38
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,030
I don't believe it!

39
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,590
The soul lantern is real.

40
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,750
It's true that it's extinguished.

41
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,850
If something really happened to Sect Leader...

42
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,160
If he's alive, I want to see him in person;

43
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,480
if he's dead, I want to see his body.

44
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,530
Nonsense!

45
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,600
I don't believe it!

46
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,700
Impossible!

47
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,620
Why is this happening?

48
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,640
The Five Contemplations have been gathered.

49
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,720
Why can't the power of the divine stone

50
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,750
still can't wake you up?

51
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,180
Fan Yue...

52
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,720
Hang in there.

53
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,180
I will save you.

54
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,300
How is Master?

55
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,350
Prepare the alchemy furnace for me.

56
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,330
Why can't we save him when all Five Contemplations have already been gathered?

57
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,080
Prepare the alchemy furnace for me!

58
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,470
If you won't,

59
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,159
I'll do it myself.

60
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,280
Bai Shuo!

61
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,710
Before you left,

62
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,700
you would protect him with your life.

63
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,930
I trusted you!

64
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,950
You have to tell me what happened.

65
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,560
How did this happen?

66
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,270
If you want to be sad or ask who should be accountable,

67
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,680
put them at the back of your mind for now.

68
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,680
Prepare the alchemy furnace.

69
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,730
I have to save him.

70
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,040
Fan Yue can't die.

71
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,980
I won't let him die.

72
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,790
Master.

73
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,230
Please bless me so that I can cultivate a first-grade elixir.

74
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,530
The barrier is broken?

75
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,680
It seems that the hidden power in Chong Zhao

76
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,650
is not a coincidence.

77
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,740
Did something big happen?

78
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,220
Hidden power?

79
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,060
Chong Zhao killed you.

80
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,850
Seems like your secret

81
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,440
is no longer a secret.

82
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,740
But you deserve to die.

83
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,730
Your death

84
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,520
at least proves one thing–

85
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,770
that the Divine Lord

86
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,210
is finally coming back.

87
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,429
Hidden power?

88
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,309
You can control it?

89
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,100
Who are you?

90
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,870
Chong Zhao.

91
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,200
Chong Zhao, how are you?

92
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,290
I killed my master.

93
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,000
I killed my master...

94
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,120
It's okay.

95
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,550
I killed my master.

96
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,590
Calm down.

97
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,310
We are no longer in Bodhi Village.

98
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,850
We are in Bright Moon Palace.

99
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,470
And Jin Yao is not your master.

100
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,690
He is your enemy.

101
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,470
He killed the Eternal Race.

102
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,170
You killed him to save people.

103
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,240
You did nothing wrong.

104
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,770
I called him Master for 10 years.

105
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,710
I... I killed him myself.

106
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,200
-I...
-I killed him myself.

107
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,240
I understand.

108
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,030
I've also called Zhen Yu

109
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,530
Master for 10 years.

110
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,990
While seeing the truth

111
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,370
is painful,

112
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,040
it's not a bad thing.

113
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,740
But with my power,

114
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,700
how could I kill Jin Yao?

115
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,110
I remember he mentioned something like the hidden power.

116
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,340
You once said

117
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,460
there is a power

118
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,020
that is not demonic power on Zhen Yu.

119
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,440
If my guess is right,

120
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,600
that's hidden power.

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,360
What he injected into your body

122
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,620
was not only demon power,

123
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,830
but also hidden power.

124
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,210
Hidden power is the power of the Hidden Race from 60,000 years ago.

125
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,330
It has long disappeared with them.

126
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,410
Is Zhen Yu a Hidden Race from back then?

127
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,530
Why did he inject this

128
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,480
in my body?

129
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,430
Maybe...

130
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,440
Oh no.

131
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,490
If Jin Yao died, his soul lantern would go out.

132
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,760
Lanling would ring the Nether Bell.

133
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,300
I have to send a message to Lanling

134
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,120
to tell everything that happened in Bodhi Village.

135
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,310
If anything happened to Sect Leader,

136
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,900
Lanling would be in chaos.

137
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,150
Chong Zhao.

138
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,970
I hope you are not the third child

139
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,450
Zhen Yu is looking for.

140
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,250
I hope you have nothing to do

141
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,820
with the Hidden Lord.

142
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,010
[Master, I have something important to report.]

143
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,630
I knew

144
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,270
you would inform Lanling.

145
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,590
[Jin Yao and Luan Zhu have been executed.]

146
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,960
Do you think you can be peaceful

147
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,610
in Bright Moon Palace?

148
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,270
The plan has started.

149
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,040
The end is coming.

150
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,890
No one can escape.

151
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,730
Why?

152
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,660
Why is it still not working?

153
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,050
Why can't I make it?

154
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,630
Shuo.

155
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,290
Take a rest.

156
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,170
In Ning'an City,

157
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,630
everyone called me the big bully.

158
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,760
With my father's status

159
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,650
and my wits,

160
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,090
I thought I could do anything.

161
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,450
I thought I was the best in the world.

162
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,180
But I am nothing after all.

163
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,270
Master gave me his tortoise shell,

164
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,470
but I still can't make a first-grade elixir.

165
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,270
I can't save Fan Yue and you.

166
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,320
I really think I'm useless.

167
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,690
Don't be

168
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,560
too anxious.

169
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,110
Don’t force yourself.

170
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,500
The first-grade elixir's recipe has long been lost.

171
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,170
It's not easy to make it.

172
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,170
Even if you fail,

173
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,480
it's not your fault.

174
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,410
Okay?

175
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:22,930
No.

176
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,640
I can't give up.

177
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,800
Xi.

178
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,320
If I don't do my best

179
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,600
to save you and Fan Yue,

180
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,810
I will hate myself for the rest of my life.

181
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,330
How is it?

182
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,030
Any news about Sect Leader?

183
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,120
I've sent my disciples to inquire around.

184
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,590
There is no trace of Sect Leader.

185
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,960
I haven't found

186
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,200
any news about Sect Leader either.

187
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,620
Why?

188
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,840
How could the Sect Leader of Lanling

189
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,470
disappear into thin air?

190
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,900
I don't believe that Sect Leader is dead.

191
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,250
Someone must have

192
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,800
plotted this.

193
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,010
When I find out who they are,

194
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,170
I will kill them!

195
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,860
Sect Leader went to look for Chong Zhao himself.

196
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,720
But he didn't bring Chong Zhao back,

197
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,130
nor did he even mention Chong Zhao.

198
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,220
Could something

199
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,970
have happened then?

200
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,450
After Chong Zhao left Cold Spring Palace,

201
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,780
he was still in contact with Sect Leader.

202
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,450
We have never seen Chong Zhao.

203
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,960
After such a big accident happened in Lanling,

204
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,770
no matter what,

205
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,400
we must summon Chong Zhao back.

206
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,790
At least let him know

207
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,380
something happened to Sect Leader and Senior.

208
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,600
Cut the crap!

209
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,720
Go look for Chong Zhao!

210
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:44,790
Let’s go!

211
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,710
Chong Zhao!

212
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,690
Chong Zhao!

213
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,400
He's not here.

214
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,580
There's no dust.

215
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,490
It means Chong Zhao lived here.

216
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,870
He hasn't left for long.

217
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,230
Come and take a look!

218
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,660
This flower pattern...

219
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,450
It's from Cold Spring Palace's Fu Ling.

220
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,500
There are traces

221
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,680
of female perfume in his cabinet.

222
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,130
Could it be that

223
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,040
Fu Ling lived here?

224
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,060
What's going on between Chong Zhao

225
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,710
and Fu Ling?

226
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,870
No matter what,

227
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,600
we must ask Chong Zhao for an explanation!

228
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,760
When Sect Leader came to the steamed bun stall

229
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,770
to look for Chong Zhao, did he notice Fu Ling?

230
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,190
Why didn't he mention it?

231
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,670
I always feel

232
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,430
Sect Leader is hiding something.

233
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,120
It seems that only by finding Chong Zhao

234
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,930
can we know what happened.

235
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,370
Xi.

236
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,700
Xi.

237
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,320
How are you, Xi?

238
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,470
It's fine.

239
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,960
It's fine.

240
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,830
Shuo will be able to cultivate a first-grade elixir.

241
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,540
Shuo will save you.

242
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,760
It doesn't hurt.

243
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,090
It doesn't hurt anymore.

244
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,900
It doesn't hurt anymore.

245
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,690
It's the alchemy furnace!

246
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,170
I made it!

247
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,430
A first-grade elixir.

248
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,860
I made it!

249
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,619
Xi.

250
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,670
Xi.

251
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,520
-Xi!
-Xi!

252
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,069
What I just spit out

253
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,849
was poisonous blood.

254
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,140
I can feel

255
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,849
the spiritual vein in my body is smooth

256
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,150
and the pain disappearing.

257
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,460
Shuo.

258
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,630
Chong Zhao.

259
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,760
My body has been detoxified

260
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,340
of the Heart Devouring Poison.

261
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,700
The Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal

262
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,730
is caused by the cultivation of demonic magic.

263
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,550
It's unlike Heart Devouring Poison.

264
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,010
If...

265
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,800
If this first-grade elixir can’t save him,

266
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,300
what should we do?

267
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,660
I don't think about ifs.

268
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,000
I just do my best.

269
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,490
I believe he will wake up.

270
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,430
He said

271
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,480
he wouldn't leave me alone.

272
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:49,660
♫If the wind intends to fill the sky with flowers♫

273
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:56,040
♫The moon's brightness is also the result of stars falling into place♫

274
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,280
♫As the wind stirs, the clouds gather♫

275
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,650
♫As the clouds shift, the moon becomes full♫

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:11,480
♫Love is the hardest thing to understand♫

277
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,990
Maybe one first-grade elixir is not enough.

278
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,290
I'll continue to make more.

279
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:18,870
♫I'm finally back to where it all started♫

280
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:26,050

♫All the answers are already explained♫

293
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,050
I heard from the demons that

♫I'll owe you all of my life♫

295
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,400
a bear demon from Donglu, Polar Region,

00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,980
♫But we're destined to part♫

297
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,720
and a panther demon from Sun Mountain

298
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,590
fell in love with the same girl.

299
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:03,110
♫How can I downplay this?♫

300
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,280
Thus, they fought.

301
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,660
The Bird Clan and Moth Clan

302
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,550
burned bridges because they fought over

303
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,870
♫When you engrave your love into my heart♫

304
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,830
caterpillars,

305

saying they would never talk to each other again.

306
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,370
♫When my star falls only for you♫

307
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,610
The leader of the Rat Clan

308
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,790
took bribes in your name

309
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,660
♫When the heavens fall♫

310
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,920

♫I can still connect with you through the waning moon♫

312
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,120
He even cried for injustice every day.

Look.

314
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,460
♫When my pain blurs my eyes♫

315
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,390
There are so many things waiting for you to deal with in Bright Moon Palace.

♫Out of the countless stars, I see only you♫

♫As you turn into a falling star and crash into my heart♫

♫When you engrave your love into my heart♫

Fan Yue.

339
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,460
I dreamed of you again.

340

When will you wake up?

What else can I do to wake you up?

Shuo.

343
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,420
It's not a dream.

Fan Yue.

00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,100
Is it really you?

346
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,810
You're awake.

♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

Be good.

Don't cry.

357
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,340
So...

358
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,060
You were cured by the first-grade elixir?

359
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,840
You woke me up.

360
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,720

♫Across thousands of miles♫

But suddenly, a force stopped me.

♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,090
I promise you.

377
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,070
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

378
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,330
I will never leave you.

379
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,370
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

380
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,220
♫My love brought tears♫

381
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,190
♫Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completeness♫

382
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,440
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

383
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,070
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

384
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,900
♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

385
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,250
♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

386
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,600
Should I

387
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,550
call you Bai Xi or Fu Ling?

388
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,500
They are just names.

389
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,530
It's up to you.

390
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,880
Every time we met, we'd be at each other's necks.

391
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,680
I never thought I could

392
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,460
talk to you so calmly.

393
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,870
I used to think

394
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,460
I would only come here for one reason:

395
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,390
to attack Bright Moon Palace.

396
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,400
What a coincidence.

397
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,010
I used to only think of

398
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,730
destroying Cold Spring.

399
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,590
Tian Huo.

400
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,420
I'm sorry.

401
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,830
I'm sorry for what heppened

402
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,210
in the Outlanders' City

403
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,540
and at the Fox Clan.

404
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,360
I killed your family

405
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,590
and those you love.

406
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,580
I should atone

407
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,830
for my sins.

408
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,990
So you came to me today

409
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,650
to seek death?

410
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,130
Atonement,

411
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,500
not death.

412
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,870
You think I wouldn't kill you?

413
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,350
I didn't tell anyone

414
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,650
I asked you to meet here.

415
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,480
No one will know

416
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,790
what you do.

417
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,280
I have thought about killing you more than once.

418
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,440
But your life

419
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,310
was saved by Bai Shuo.

420
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,770
Bai Shuo saved Master.

421
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,350
I appreciate her kindness.

422
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,400
I don't want to make things difficult for her

423
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,000
nor make things difficult for Master.

424
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,450
Don't mention

425
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,790
what shouldn't be mentioned in the future.

426
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,620
What are you waiting for?

427
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,290
Take the dagger back.

428
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,910
I'm sorry.

429
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,150
And...

430
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,820
Thank you.

431
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,950
I think I know

432
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,450
what's behind Jin Yao's death.

433
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,770
The hidden power in Chong Zhao

434
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,960
was given by Zhen Yu.

435
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,470
Have you heard of

436
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,930
how to dissolve the hidden power?

437
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,110
Hidden power

438
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,580
goes back to ancient Divine Region.

439
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,440
I don't know more than you.

440
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,160
Back then, the Hidden Lord tried to destroy the world.

441
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,560
He took spiritual power

442
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,860
through hidden power.

443
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,140
Even today,

444
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,310
various tribes are still scared of the hidden power.

445
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,030
So,

446
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,360
the fact that Chong Zhao has the hidden power

447
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,050
has to be kept a secret.

448
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,590
Why are you staring at me like that?

449
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,030
Aren’t you going back to rest?

450
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,010
Although your Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal is gone,

451
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,440
it will take some time to recover.

452
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,140
I'm afraid you won't take the medicine.

453
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,360
Are you afraid that I won't take the medicine

454
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,190
or are you reluctant to leave me?

455
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,420
I just want to be with you.

456
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,200
What's wrong with that?

457
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,030
You are just like the

458
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,060
♫The person standing far away♫

459
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,060
the domineering Bai Shuo I first met.

460
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,940
You're not much better.

461
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,630
♫Don't be afraid♫

462
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,650
The invincible Demon King.

463
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,750
When we first met,

464
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,950
♫The stars will guide you to me♫

465
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,060
you wanted to bite me.

466
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:55,220
♫Walk towards me♫

467
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,220
Cang Shan was still around back then.

468
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,580
We met a lot of people

469
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,890
and went through a lot.

470
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,800
♫My heart feels so...♫

471
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,610
There's also Ling Long,

472
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,020
Rong Xian,

473
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:06,260
♫It's pounding as I wait for you♫

474
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,290
Mu Jiu,

475
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,660
and Master.

476
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,290
Sometimes I think

477
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,850
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

478
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,640
if I didn't want to be an immortal,

479
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,470
and didn't try gathering the Five Contemplations,

480
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,920
would all these

481
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,440
have not happened?

482
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,780
♫You are my distant call♫

483
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,830
Then they wouldn't have...

484
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:24,030
♫You are my first and last♫

485
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,070
Shuo.

486
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,170
Everyone has their own fate.

487
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:30,490
♫My heart is trembling for you♫

488
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,230
Even without you,

489
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,010
some things would happen.

490
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,840
You have to believe

491
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,010
♫In this moment where we embrace each other♫

492
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,840
those who left,

493
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,580
as long as we don't forget them,

494
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,510
♫Let's never let go♫

495
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,410
then they have never left.

496
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,000
Fortunately, you are still here.

497
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,390
Xi and Chong Zhao are also in Bright Moon Palace.

498
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,460
Although Chong Zhao has hidden power,

499
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,540
I believe we can find a way to dissolve it.

500
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,090
Everything

501
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,190
will turn out fine,

502
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,510
right?

503
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,540
♫We're destined to be together forever from the first sight♫

504
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,640
It will.

505
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,530
You have the Five Contemplations now.

506
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,930
The power of the Contemplation Stone is taking shape too.

507
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,560
♫Goodbye, loneliness♫

508
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,700
You will continue to become stronger.

509
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,850
♫The one who was slightly late♫

510
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,150
When you become stronger,

511
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,880
you may face a new challenge.

512
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,020
♫You came towards me, closer and closer♫

513
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,510
But no matter what the future holds,

514
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,160
you must always

515
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,580
be the free Bai Shuo.

516
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:26,260
♫You enriched my life♫

It's almost anniversary

519
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,030
of the establishment of Bright Moon Palace

520
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,550
by Tian Huo, Cang Shan, and me.

521
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,160
We'd celebrate within the palace

522
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,700
for the anniversary every year.

523
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,970
♫You are the light I yearn for♫

524
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:35,730
I'll go arrange for it.

525
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,320
You just recovered.

526
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,870
You should take a good rest.

527
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:43,000
♫You are my determined way home♫

528
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,410
I'll prepare it this time.

529
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
After all these obstacles,

530
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,910
I also found Xi.

531
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,180
Let's hold a gathering

532
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:49,080
♫Let this moment stay forever♫

533
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,100
for everyone

534
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,320
to make peace for next year.

535
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,460
Do you know how to prepare the celebration of a Demon Race?

536
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,760
It's all the same thing.

537
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,440
♫I'm hugging you in the crowd♫

538
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,840
Just wait and see.

539
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,150
I will give you the most unforgettable celebration.

540
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,250
♫Let's never let go♫

541
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,210
It's cold at night.

542
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,790
Why are you sitting here alone?

543
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,680
I'm just doing some reflection.

544
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,630
In the past,

545
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,730
you were an immortal;

546
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,440
you were irreconcilable with the Demon Race.

547
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,130
I was the Young Lord of Cold Spring Palace.

548
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,940
There's only one possibility between me and Fan Yue:

549
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,520
only one of us can live.

550
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,450
I didn’t expect

551
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,130
the Bright Moon Palace

552
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,110
to be the only place that can protect us now,

553
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,620
and that Fan Yue and us

554
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,140
would become friends.

555
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,190
My parents,

556
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,110
Master and seniors taught me that

557
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,240
eternals and demons are irreconcilable

558
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,670
like water and fire.

559
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,120
But in fact, you were a human,

560
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,530
but you became a demon.

561
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,820
I'm an immortal,

562
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,850
but I have demonic power and hidden power.

563
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,900
Fan Yue is a demon,

564
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,620
but he protects everyone.

565
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,800
Shuo is human,

566
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,150
but she's as strong as eternals and demons.

567
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,030
It doesn't matter

568
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,000
what we are.

569
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,530
What matters is

570
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,580
what we choose to be.

571
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,940
Judging from what you said,

572
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,490
you seem to be implying something.

573
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,990
I know you're worried about me

574
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,410
and my hidden power,

575
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,180
afraid I'll be controlled by it.

576
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
Don't worry.

577
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,760
I won't be controlled by my hidden power.

578
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,060
I know who I am

579
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,160
and what I should do.

580
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,360
I won't let you down.

581
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,000
Of course I trust you.

582
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,060
The Chong Zhao I know

583
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,270
is upright and righteous,

584
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,610
kind and unyielding.

585
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,900
How could he be affected by his hidden power?

586
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,290
Guess

587
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,690
what I'm thinking.

588
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,570
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

589
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,190
-The steamed bun stall.
-The steamed bun stall.

590
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,850
♫The flowers that bloomed once in a lifetime♫

591
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,790
I often think of

592
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,520
♫I remember that word of concern♫

593
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,720
when you taught me how to make steamed buns.

594
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,520
Chong Zhao.

595
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,280
♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

596
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,250
I miss the days in Ning'an City.

597
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,870
♫I remember that drop of tear♫

598
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,760
♫It dried in the wind♫

599
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,350
When everything is settled,

600
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,070
♫The one in the autumn wind♫

601
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,750
I'll take you home.

602
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,180
♫How many times have I seen you in my dreams?♫

603
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,640
But with only the two of us in the steamed bun stall,

604
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,470
♫That year, that year♫

605
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,930
it would be boring.

606
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,050
Shall we

607
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,380
have a few children?

608
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,370
♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

609
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,950
How about two?

610
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,260
One like you...

611
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,240
♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

612
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,820
♫They unfold, one page after another♫

613
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,930
Who said I was going to have babies wit you?

614
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,740
♫That year, that year♫

615
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,660
Yes.

616
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,390
One like you

617
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,650
and the other like me.

618
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,570
♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

619
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,280
You teach them swordsmanship.

620
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,460
I...

621
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,380
♫Falling to the mud, burying the memories♫

622
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,160
I'll teach them how to steam buns.

623
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:56,410
♫Layer after layer♫

624
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,550
Okay.

625
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,730
I'll teach them swordsmanship.

626
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,780
♫Another year passed♫

627
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,250
You teach them how to steam buns.

628
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,610
♫Another year passed♫

629
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,770
Soul Lotus:

630
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,120
it's a healing flower

631
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,900
with infinite life.

632
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,360
Although your divine soul is dead,

633
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,880
your body is still alive.

634
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,610
It can be used by me

635
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,780
and help me get the Divine Lord back.

636
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,470
You didn't live for 60,000 years in vain.

637
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,400
My lord,

638
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,260
your Destiny Regalia is too powerful.

639
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,600
I didn't expect

640
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,740
even if with Soul Lotus,

641
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,490
it's still difficult to repair.

642
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,180
Turn left.

643
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,220
Yes.

644
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,890
Is that okay?

645
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,830
A little to the right.

646
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,620
This should be okay now, right?

647
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,500
What are you looking at?

648
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,010
Feels like something is missing.

649
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,590
The decoration is fancy enough,

650
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,020
but it's not lively enough.

651
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:52,820
Little Demon,

652
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,780
go to the back mountain and bring all the flowers here.

653
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,460
Go.

654
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,180
-Yes.
-Yes.

655
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,760
Lady Tian Huo,

656
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,530
you're very cooperative today.

657
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,460
Don't act like that.

658
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,890
I'm not cooperating with you.

659
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,630
I must do my best

660
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,130
for Bright Moon Palace's anniversary.

661
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,910
So much so

662
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,940
you're willing to hang lanterns under my command.

663
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,850
Actually, saving Fan Yue is my wish.

664
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,490
You don't have to thank me.

665
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,050
Stop making wild guesses.

666
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,550
If you ruin the celebration,

667
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,740
I'll teach you a lesson.

668
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,970
"I'll teach you a lesson."

669
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,360
Ms. Bai,

670
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,020
the osmanthus cakes you wanted are done.

671
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:35,780
Thank you.

672
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,920
Take a break.

673
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,710
I asked the chef to make osmanthus cakes.

674
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,820
Try it.

675
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,380
All I heard this morning

676
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,410
is your voice around the palace.

677
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,320
How big is this ceremony going to be?

678
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,460
This is the first anniversary we celebrate together.

679
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,850
Of course it should be

680
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,030
as lively as it can be!

681
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:04,970
The first?

682
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,100
You mean

683
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,090
you want to spend the second and third one with me,

684
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:09,990
forever and ever?

685
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,820
What else?

686
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,970
Who else do you want to celebrate it with besides me?

687
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,170
No one else

688
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,310
but you.

689
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,450
That's more like it.

690
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,140
I shan't waste my time with you.

691
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,410
I'm going to supervise them.

692
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,360
Take a good rest.

693
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,650
Don't wander around.

694
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,680
Okay.

695
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,930
-Be careful.
-Okay.

696
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,420
Make it straight.

697
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,970
To the left.

698
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:52,050
♫Writing wishes in the night sky♫

699
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,250
This is the first time I've attended the celebration of a Demon Race.

700
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,770
♫The clouds seal their approval for me♫

701
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,480
The Cold Spring Palace has always been cold.

702
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,960
There are no friendships,

703
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:01,140
♫You walk towards me slowly♫

704
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,820
much less celebrations.

705
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,710
I don't know how to celebrate either.

706
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,140
♫Time stops♫

707
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,720
Let's take a good look at

708
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,430
what the celebration of Bright Moon Palace is like.

709
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:10,320
♫The brightest star in the night sky♫

710
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,530
♫Is willing to extinguish for you♫

711
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,310
♫Because the starlight in your eyes♫

712
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,390
♫Lights up my long night♫

713
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,280
♫I'm afraid tomorrow is too far♫

714

♫I'll always be by your side♫

717
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,150
It's already pretty lively outside.

718
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,470
Let's go.

719
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,870
You're going just like this?

720

♫I'll fulfill this promise with my life♫

721
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,570
How else should it be?

722
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,210
Today is a big day for the palace.

723
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,550
♫Once in a lifetime, forever♫

724
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,060
You're Demon King of the Polar Region and Master of Bright Moon.

725
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,700
Of course you should be different.

726
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,880
How?

♫I'll fulfill this promise with my life♫

732
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,900
is more flamboyant than I would normally be.

733
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,360
I did it on purpose.

♫Once in a lifetime, forever♫

735
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,950

how beautiful

737
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,200

My lord.

742
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,880
We did it.

743
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:02,990
We did it!

744
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,150
We did it!

745
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,710
Fan Yue.

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,290
Fan Yue.

747
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,380
What happened?

748
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,410
The seven stars are all gone.

749
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,030
I didn't manage to escape after all.

750
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,760
No.

751
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,510
I'll go make more

752
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,570
first-grade elixir.

753
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,070
Even without Master's tortoise shell,

754
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,800
I can definitely still cultivate it!

755
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,340
My demonic power...

756
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,550
is exhausted...

757
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,400
Where is your demonic power?

758
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:08,840
How did this happen?

759
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,850
I thought God

760
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,670
gave us one more chance.

761
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:15,360
I thought I could continue keep you company.

762
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,530
I didn't expect...

763
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,900
I still can't change the ending.

764
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,560
Stop saying that.

765
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,870
I don't want to hear it.

766
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,600
You promised me

767
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,020
you'll always be by my side.

768
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,650
I'm here, Shuo.

769
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:37,760
I'll always be here.

770
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,840
Do you remember what I told you?

771
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,670
Every one of us

772
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,380
has their own fate.

773
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,040
But what happened

774
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,630
will never be meaningless.

775
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:53,060
If meeting you

776
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,850
was fate,

777
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,380
I won't resent fate

778
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,420
for letting our encounter

779
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,580
be so short.

780
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:04,930
Because...

781
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,310
Fan Yue meeting Bai Shuo

782
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,830
and falling in love with Bai Shuo

783
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,090
is the luckiest thing in my life.

784
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,020
Promise me.

785
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,230
Don't be sad.

786
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:30,260
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

787
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:33,230
Everyone has been looking forward to tonight.

788
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,460
I have too.

789
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:39,200
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

790
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,020
Let's not be party poopers

791
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,310
and enjoy

792
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,680
this anniversary celebration, shall we?

793
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:49,440
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

794
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:55,560
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫
