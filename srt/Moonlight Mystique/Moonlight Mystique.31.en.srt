1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,000
[Episode 31]

19
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,530
Why do I always feel like

20
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,010
you're different today?

21
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,150
If she's not Xi,

22
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,020
why did she risk her life to save me?

23
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,550
Give her some time,

24
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,130
and give yourself some time too.

25
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,830
I'll go and decoct the medicine for my master first.

26
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,420
Shuo!

27
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,050
What did you see?

28
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,570
The last Contemplation is in Bodhi Village.

29
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,870
I saw the vision.

30
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,660
I saw myself offering my blood to a cauldron.

31
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,590
As long as we can fulfill the prophetic vision,

32
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,890
we can gather the fifth Contemplation.

33
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,700
Offering blood to a cauldron?

34
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,460
Every prophetic vision

35
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,950
carries hidden danger.

36
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,770
It's not necessarily a good thing to fulfill the vision.

37
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,230
We've already gone through Ning'an City,

38
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,760
Outlanders' City, the Fox Clan, and the Stone Clan.

39
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,600
In fact, every prophetic vision,

40
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,450
whether we intend it or not,

41
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,060
whether we push it or prevent it,

42
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,620
will eventually be fulfilled.

43
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,510
It's as if

44
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,760
there's an unseen hand pushing everything forward.

45
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,380
I think this time will be no different.

46
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,410
Fan Yue,

47
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,470
we can never know what will happen

48
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,220
after the prophetic vision is fulfilled.

49
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,790
But we can never give up.

50
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,760
After we separated at the Old Turtle's place,

51
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,470
did something happen?

52
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,020
Have you already fulfilled the vision in the Contemplation Stone?

53
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,820
But if it's already been fulfilled,

54
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,350
why didn't you mention it to me?

55
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,480
What are you looking at?

56
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,890
Nothing.

57
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,260
How did you hurt your hand?

58
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,150
I accidentally cut it while decocting medicine for my master.

59
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,760
Accidentally?

60
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,170
What's wrong?

61
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,760
Nothing.

62
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,170
Go to sleep.

63
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,550
Her actions are unusual,

64
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,560
but there's no abnormality in her spiritual aura.

65
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,310
Shuo,

66
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,540
what's really going on with you?

67
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,140
Fan Yue,

68
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,670
you underestimated the power of time.

69
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,800
I've existed for 60,000 years.

70
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,020
How could you possibly uncover

71
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,780
what I want to hide so easily?

72
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,530
From now on, I will be Bai Shuo.

73
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,630
And the only one who can stay by your side

74
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,310
is me.

75
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,020
Keep your position in mind.

76
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,250
Don't forget,

77
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,500
everything you have today was given by me,

78
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,560
and I can take it back at any time.

79
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,810
The view of Heart-guarding Cliff is quite nice.

80
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,570
But I heard that

81
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,640
Heart-guarding Cliff

82
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,030
is a place for repentance in Lanling.

83
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,960
What?

84
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,650
The esteemed Sect Leader of Lanling

85
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,360
needs to repent too?

86
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,190
Zhen Yu,

87
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,070
you must be quite audacious

88
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,130
to trespass into Lanling's territory.

89
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,110
What about you?

90
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,990
You stepped over the corpses of your own clan

91
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,590
to rise to where you are today.

92
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,170
You are quite audacious too.

93
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,300
Nonsense.

94
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,350
Calm down.

95
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,380
Once you and I start fighting

96
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,920
and make too much noise,

97
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,250
aren't you afraid that

98
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,850
the secret of Bodhi Village

99
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,630
will be made public?

100
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,570
You're astonished, aren't you?

101
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,420
Fine.

102
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,890
Let me make it clear.

103
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,090
A few days ago,

104
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,350
I happened to visit a place

105
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,960
called Bodhi Village

106
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,280
and found the barrier outside the village quite peculiar.

107
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,310
Among

108
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,640
all the Eternals,

109
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,740
only you have the ability

110
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,910
to set up that barrier.

111
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,120
I don't know what you are talking about.

112
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,980
Today, you trespassed into Lanling and slandered the leader of the Eternals.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,800
As long as I give the signal,

114
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,390
all the Eternals will come,

115
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,380
and Zhen Yu,

116
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,710
you won't stand a chance of surviving.

117
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,710
If you really wanted to make a move,

118
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,409
you would have given the signal long ago.

119
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,280
It's obvious that, rather than killing me,

120
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,900
you're more afraid

121
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,980
of your secret

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,760
being discovered by other Eternals.

123
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,740
That day,

124
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,690
after I left Bodhi Village,

125
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,190
driven by curiosity,

126
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,010
I sent someone to investigate.

127
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,180
It led me to discover something

128
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,880
quite interesting.

129
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,740
Would you like to know what it is?

130
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,000
For nearly a century,

131
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,450
or rather,

132
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,370
since you became the Sect Leader of Lanling,

133
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,040
every so often,

134
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,590
someone from the Eternal Race disappears

135
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,600
while carrying out a demon-slaying mission,

136
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,820
and then

137
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,080
their soul lantern extinguishes,

138
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,460
signifying their death.

139
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,240
But strangely,

140
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,930
their bodies

141
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,920
are nowhere to be found.

142
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,920
Do you think this is just a coincidence,

143
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,860
or is someone behind it, doing it on purpose?

144
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,850
And how is the secret hidden behind this

145
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,630
related to Bodhi Village?

146
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,220
Do you think

147
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,980
I should kindly remind the Eternals?

148
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,420
But don't worry.

149
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,760
I understand

150
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,310
that everyone in this world has their secrets.

151
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,300
I will keep yours

152
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,560
for you.

153
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,570
Actually,

154
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,140
I'm here today

155
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,200
to discuss

156
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,530
a collaboration with you.

157
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,540
As

158
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,040
the leader of the Eternals,

159
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,950
how could I collaborate with demons?

160
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,000
The leader of the Eternals?

161
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,520
How impressive.

162
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,850
But what's the use?

163
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,950
Do you have strong influence?

164
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,930
Stop deceiving yourself.

165
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,550
Among the 72 Sects of the Eternals,

166
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,990
how many people truly respect

167
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,440
and admire you?

168
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,650
Today,

169
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,550
I brought you a gift.

170
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,940
This map records

171
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
the location of every major demon clan

172
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,830
and their vital weak points.

173
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,330
I believe

174
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,720
it will help you

175
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,900
make new contributions

176
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,260
and elevate your prestige.

177
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,910
From now on,

178
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,470
no one in the Eternal Race will dare challenge you.

179
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,310
What do you want from me?

180
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,530
It's simple.

181
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,090
You just need

182
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,470
to exterminate the Demon Race

183
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,190
and establish unparalleled achievements;

184
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,470
as for me,

185
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,310
I only need

186
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,160
a small amount of demonic power to heal my wounds.

187
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,140
Heal your wounds?

188
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,030
Isn't that like raising a snake to bite us?

189
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,750
Once we cooperate,

190
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,130
I won't be

191
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,590

is that we can cooperate.

00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,980
During this time,

378
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,210
I feel like I'm finally living like a person again.

379
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,350
♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

380
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,700
So now, I'm not afraid at all.

381
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,840
And you shouldn't be afraid either,

382
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,950
okay?

383
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,260
♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

384
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,610
♫They unfold, one page after another♫

385
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,760
♫That year, that year♫

386
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,940
We've already missed too much time.

387
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,440
♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

388
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,720
So,

389
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,920
let's cherish

390
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,550
the last moments we have together.

391
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,250
♫Falling to the mud, burying the memories♫

392
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,830
I hope you can respect my decision.

393
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,050
♫Layer after layer♫

394
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,810
♫Another year passed♫

395
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,420
♫Another year passed♫

396
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Okay.

397
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,670
Okay.

398
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,040
♫That year, that year♫

399
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,870
♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

400
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,690
♫Falling to the mud, burying the memories♫

♫Layer after layer♫

402
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,530
The food has gone cold.

403
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,600
I'll go heat it up.

404
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,810
No need.

405
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,960
Fu Ling doesn't have much time left.

406
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,030
Why do you act like you don't care at all?

407
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,370
Then what do you think I should do?

408
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,070
Her poison has no cure.

409
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,320
I was telling the truth.

410
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,510
Rather than deceive Chong Zhao,

411
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,290
it's better to let him face the truth.

412
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,200
Aren't you afraid Fu Ling really is Bai Xi?

413
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,290
She didn't admit it herself.

414
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,340
Even if she really is Bai Xi,

415
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,310
she doesn't have much time left.

416
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,080
We will eventually be separated.

417
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,770
No matter how reluctant I am,

418
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,330
what can I do?

419
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,990
Shuo would never say such things.

420
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,500
Who exactly are you?

421
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,690
The spiritual power infused this time

422
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,070
is enough to keep her asleep for a while longer.

423
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,410
Divine Maiden, please don't worry.

424
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,410
She's sleeping well here.

425
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,980
We didn't show any flaws.

426
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,590
Flaws?

427
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,540
I'm never afraid of flaws.

428
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,790
So what if they suspect me?

429
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,050
Now that I've occupied Bai Shuo's body

430
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,520
and am protected by divine power,

431
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,870
what can they do to me?

432
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,980
I can tell

433
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,230
you're angry.

434
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,930
You think that by doing this,

435
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,690
you'll get Fan Yue?

436
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,030
Dream on.

437
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,120
You probably don't know

438
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,480
that last night, I was already in bed with Fan Yue,

439
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,140
lying close together.

440
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,640
I will get

441
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,190
everything you can get

442
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,740
and everything

443
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,160
you can't.

444
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,370
I will take everything that belongs to you.

445
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,900
It sounds like

446
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,240
you didn't take my body

447
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,050
only for Fan Yue.

448
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,260
Why do you have such strong hostility towards me?

449
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,410
Because I hate you.

450
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,750
I've hated you for a very long time.

451
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,080
What do you mean?

452
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,470
We've met before?

453
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,020
Keep an eye on her.

454
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,840
Yes.

455
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,250
You haven't answered my question!

456
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,620
A long time ago?

457
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,120
How long ago?

458
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,630
I've brought it for you.

459
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
[Wangyou City] [Ning'an City]

460
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,620
[Wolf Clan]

461
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,930
[Wolf Clan] [White Ape Clan]

462
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,460
It's so late.

463
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,000
Instead of staying with Fu Ling,

464
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,440
why did you ask me out?

465
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,650
I need to go to the Cold Spring Palace.

466
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,480
To find Zhen Yu?

467
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,450
Only he has the antidote for Heart Devourer.

468
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,810
Zhen Yu is one of the Demon Kings.

469
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,390
Though he's not fully healed now,

470
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,770
you still can't defeat him.

471
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,610
Do you know the consequences of going there?

472
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,740
I don't know if I'll be able to come back,

473
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,360
so there's something

474
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,770
I think I should tell you.

475
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,780
Actually,

476
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,570
Fu Ling is Bai Xi.

477
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,780
So you knew it all along.

478
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,230
You've been hiding it from me.

479
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,580
I didn't say it before out of respect for her wishes.

480
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,110
I thought it would be best if the rift between you two sisters

481
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,660
could be resolved by yourselves.

482
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,710
But I might not be able to return this time.

483
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,250
Given her personality,

484
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,070
she will probably

485
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,980
never admit that she is Bai Xi in this lifetime.

486
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,110
I don't want you sisters to end up

487
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,950
not recognizing each other,

488
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,440
and I don't want her

489
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,370
to be alone anymore.

490
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,310
You really

491
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,140
love her so much.

492
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,790
She was in the Cold Spring Palace all by herself for ten years.

493
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,940
During her ten years of suffering,

494
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,830
I was growing up in the Governor's Mansion, worry-free and well-fed.

495
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,260
Every time I think about that, I feel more guilty.

496
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,050
She worked so hard to gain her freedom.

497
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,610
She shouldn't end up like this.

498
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,030
I must go find Zhen Yu and get the antidote.

499
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,260
If I don't come back,

500
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,600
please, you must take good care of her.

501
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,170
The world is vast.

502
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,000
Maybe there are other ways to cure the poison.

503
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,150
If Fu Ling really is Bai Xi,

504
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,220
then I should be the one to go.

505
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,160
I know the Cold Spring Palace better than you.

506
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,080
You two sisters have finally reunited.

507
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,300
You should spend more time with her.

508
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,930
But right now, there is a fog surrounding the village.

509
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,930
That is the barrier set by the Divine Maiden.

510
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,240
You can't get out.

511
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,070
Unless...

512
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,690
unless the Divine Maiden no longer exists,

513
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,380
in which case her barrier

514
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,970
will naturally be lifted.

515
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,690
Senior, you're truly

516
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,090
insightful,

517
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,550
able to foresee everything and win from miles away.

518
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,150
Under your strategic deployment,

519
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,990
those demons had no way to escape.

520
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,720
Even those demon head disciples

521
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,760
who had been wanted by the 72 Sects for many years

522
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,010
were slain by our Lanling Sword Technique.

523
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,630
This time,

524
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,130
Lanling can finally

525
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,040
hold its head high.

526
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,940
Remember to stay humble.

527
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,810
Do not act too conspicuously.

528
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,670
As the leading sect of the Eternals,

529
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,650
Lanling must eradicate the demons

530
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,160
and protect the world.

531
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,220
Yes.

532
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,860
I know. Of course I know.

533
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,750
It just that...

534
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,080
Senior, did you get some secret information

535
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,880
from the Demon Race?

536
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,410
Is it from Chong Zhao?

537
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,770
Let me take a look too.

538
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,830
So nosey.

539
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,170
You're not doing anything yourselves.

540
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,110
Do you want me

541
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,950
to just waste my days like you?

542
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,670
Sect Leader,

543
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,970
you are wise and powerful.

544
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,840
Sect Leader,

545
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,100
you're so decisive.

546
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,410
I'll take my leave now.

547
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,490
So mysterious.

548
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,940
Why so serious?

549
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,150
Seriously.

550
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,670
Yu Feng,

551
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:36,160
are you trying to look elegant and charming again?

552
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,230
Let me ask you something.

553
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,570
How do you see the fact

554
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,270
that the sect leader has been winning

555
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,550
battle after battle these days?

556
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,570
Don't tell anyone else.

557
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,320
-Okay.
-Closer.

558
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,930
I see it with my own eyes.

559
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,440
Why're you leaving? We haven't finished talking.

560
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,270
My mouth doesn't want to talk about it.

561
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,940
I'm just kidding.

562
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,860
What's wrong?

563
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,420
Is there something you can't figure out?

564
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,500
No.

565
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,750
I just have a feeling.

566
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,570
I feel like,

567
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,700
after so many years of tension between the Eternals and demons,

568
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,140
with both sides always on guard,

569
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,230
don't you think it's been a bit too easy for us

570
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,320
to win...

571
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,990
all these battles recently?

572
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,850
Did you catch a fever and lose your mind?

573
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,640
Why are you talking nonsense if you don't have a fever?

574
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,420
Lanling's victories

575
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,260
have made the demons tremble

576
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,010
and have established our reputation among the Eternals.

577
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,990
Isn't it a good thing?

578
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,780
It is,

579
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,390
-but…
-Then isn't that enough?

580
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,700
Sect Leader

581
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,960
worked diligently,

582
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,720
putting his heart and soul into this,

583
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,070
and earned this glory.

584
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,980
How...

585
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,750
How can you question him?

586
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,490
I'm overthinking it, okay?

587
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,170
Your worries

588
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,900
are heavier than your weight.

589
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,160
I won't talk to you anymore.

590
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,550
I'm going back to my room to get some good sleep.

591
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,230
I can't give up.

592
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,840
Fan Yue is still out there waiting for me.

593
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,110
And there's Xi.

594
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,590
I need to go back and cure her poison.

595
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,210
Stop wasting your energy.

596
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,480
This sea of consciousness is created by my divine power.

597
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,690
You can't break through it.

598
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,190
Your face really is useful.

599
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,410
Now Fan Yue cherishes and cares for me.

600
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,840
All his thoughts

601
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,070
are on me.

602
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,640
Do you think

603
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,660
I'll believe you?

604
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,620
I know Fan Yue.

605
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,020
You can't deceive him.

606
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,610
He will definitely find me.

607
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,360
You don't have a chance now.

608
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,900
I no longer need Luan Zhu's body.

609
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,780
Once my body dies,

610
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,080
your soul will vanish with it.

611
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,220
Bai Shuo,

612
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,870
soon everything you have

613
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,950
will belong to me.

614
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,430
You said you've hated me for a long time.

615
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,350
But before I entered Bodhi Village,

616
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,630
I had never seen you.

617
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,680
Luan Zhu,

618
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,930
is it really me

619
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,200
that you hate?

620
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,670
Of course.

621
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,870
You've forgotten your past,

622
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,190
but I haven't.

623
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,450
I will never forget

624
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,080
what you did.

625
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,470
My past?

626
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,970
Is my past somehow

627
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,150
related to the Divine Race?

628
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,980
So what?

629
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,930
You're about to die.

630
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,270
Bai Shuo,

631
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,390
just watch yourself slowly fade away

632
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,840
in this dark place.

633
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,920
I will become you,

634
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,240
replace you,

635
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,320
and take everything that belongs to you.

636
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,830
Be clear with me.

637
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,070
What past do I have?

638
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,160
What grudge do we have between us?

639
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,220
The Divine Race?

640
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,060
Why am I related to the Divine Race?

641
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,470
Divine Lord, you are the star of this world,

642
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,890
and I, Yuan,

643
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,050
deeply admire you.

644
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,110
I think our Xing Yue Pavilion is too lonely.

645
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,450
From today on,

646
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,800
you'll be my divine attendant.

647
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,610
Divine Lord,

648
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,000
this is the most mysterious and splendid

649
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,900
Lunar Hidden Sea of our Lunar Race.

650
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,480
We've spent 100 years together, sharing the same feelings.

651
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,110
In the past 100 years,

652
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,370
have you ever

653
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,330
truly cared for me?

654
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,080
Don't!

655
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,190
Why do I have these memories?

656
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,880
Who is the person

657
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,900
in my memories?

658
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,910
Who am I?

659
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,180
Luan Zhu.

660
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,430
She must know the whole truth.

661
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,050
I must get out of here.

662
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,990
Chong Zhao has already begun to suspect you two.

663
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,860
-Divine Maiden, please forgive us.
-Divine Maiden, please don't be angry.

664
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,090
Stop it.

665
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,170
Since there are already suspicions,

666
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,270
there's no need to drag it out any longer.

667
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,220
Coincidentally, Jin Yao also has a request.

668
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,280
Tonight,

669
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,830
you two will go and kill Fu Ling.

670
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,490
What about Chong Zhao?

671
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,950
His life is still of use to me.

672
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,570
Divine Maiden,

673
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,070
should we also kill that old turtle

674
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,660
locked in the back mountain?

675
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,870
Why are you in such a hurry?

676
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,530
His skills

677
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,880
will eventually be yours.

678
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,380
Thank you, Divine Maiden.

679
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,870
Watch over my body

680
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,720
and don't let anyone get close to it,

681
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,730
except for Chong Zhao.

682
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,400
Yes, Divine Maiden.

683
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,200
Luan Zhu's spiritual power is profound.

684
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,500
I'm this close to her, yet she shows no reaction.

685
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,590
Has she truly fallen into a deep sleep?

686
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,640
Why don't you do it?

687
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,290
Shuo?

688
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,980
Why are you here?

689
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,390
I was afraid you might be in danger.

690
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,100
The mist barrier was set by her.

691
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,820
Before she can resist,

692
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,740
Chong Zhao,

693
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,010
kill her.

694
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,360
Only by killing her

695
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,750
can you leave the village to find Zhen Yu

696
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,430
and get the antidote to save Xi.

697
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,780
To harm others to achieve one's goals

698
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,290
is not the way of an Eternal.

699
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,230
Without the antidote,

700
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,890
Xi will surely die within ten days.

701
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,430
Don't you care about Xi?

702
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,540
Chong Zhao,

703
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,850
there's only one way,

704
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,950
and you have no choice.

705
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Kill her.

706
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,000
Since you want to kill her so badly,

707
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,720
why don't you do it yourself?

708
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,110
What do you want?

709
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,390
Why are you here?

710
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,570
Are you looking for me?

711
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,430
Did you meet Bai Shuo?

712
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,130
Yes.

713
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,610
What did she tell you?

714
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,550
Are you suspecting Bai Shuo?

715
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,990
The fact that you asked this question

716
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,660
means you're suspecting her too.

717
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,730
I originally planned to go to the Cold Spring Palace to find the antidote.

718
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,230
I went to say goodbye to Bai Shuo

719
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,540
and tell her that Fu Ling is actually Bai Xi.

720
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,770
But she told me that I could only leave Bodhi Village

721
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,600
by killing Luan Zhu.

722
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,170
But Bai Shuo would never ask me to kill anyone.

723
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,650
She's not Bai Shuo.

724
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,400
Then who is she?

725
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,820
Where is the real Bai Shuo?

726
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,300
There is a soul possession technique

727
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,530
to seize one's body and exchange souls.

728
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:34,880
Soul possession?

729
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,770
The Contemplation Stone once showed a prophetic vision.

730
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,600
Bai Shuo saw herself offering her blood to a cauldron in the vision.

731
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,060
I did find a wound on her finger.

732
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,380
If I'm not mistaken,

733
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,530
her strange behavior

734
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,230
began from there.

735
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,180
And before she met with you,

736
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,350
she went alone to Luan Zhu's place.

737
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,460
Luan Zhu?

738
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,570
You think Luan Zhu's the one who did it?

739
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,210
In this Bodhi Village,

740
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,570
whether it's Old Turtle,

741
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,640
your parents,

742
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,070
or anyone else,

743
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,990
they all act weird.

744
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,810
This village is under Luan Zhu's protection.

745
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,310
It's impossible

746
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,610
that she's not involved.

747
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,760
Since you've come to me,

748
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,250
you must already have a plan.

749
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,510
To save Bai Shuo,

750
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,389
we must first break through the fog in front of us.

751
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,989
Since the other side has already made their move,

752
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,920
let's turn their own tactics against them.

753
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,170
I didn't expect

754
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,010
I would lose because of this.

755
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,780
You didn't lose because of this wound,

756
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,230
but because of your mindset.

757
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,330
The real Bai Shuo wouldn't ignore lives.

758
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,350
She would never incite murder to achieve her goals.

759
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,760
Where is Bai Shuo?

760
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,510
Change her back.

761
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,489
With the same face,

762
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,770
I can stay by your side too,

763
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,270
just like I did 60,000 years ago.

764
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,090
I'll give you one last chance.

765
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:55,380
The seven stars on your body have dwindled to just one,

766
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,850
and this is your final opportunity.

767
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,410
You want to gather all Five Contemplations.

768
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,840
Why don't you ask me?

769
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,690
The power of the Divine Maiden

770
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,020
can glimpse divine Contemplations.

771
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,390
Fan Yue,

772
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,630
I know where the last Contemplation is.

773
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,700
If you promise to give up on Bai Shuo

774
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,280
and be with me from now on,

775
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,500
I'll tell you where the final Contemplation is.

776
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,560
What do you think?

777
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,120
Compared to breaking the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal,

778
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,750
I want Shuo back.

779
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,300
To protect her,

780
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,100
you're even willing to die?

781
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,460
My business

782
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,390
is none of your concern.

783
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,670
It's so late.

784
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,730
You don't have to bring a knife

785
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,340
to visit me, do you?

786
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,140
Do you think that,

787
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,880
with the same face as theirs,

788
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,630
you can deceive me?

789
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,130
When it comes to those closest to you, it's not their face you recognize—

790
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,390
it's their heart.

791
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,850
So what if you know

792
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,090
we're fakes?

793
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,420
None of you

794
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,460
will leave Bodhi Village.

795
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,250
Have you heard of the ruthless Lady Fu Ling

796
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,920
from the Cold Spring Palace?

797
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,930
It hurts!

798
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,140
You really were created using puppetry.

799
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,110
You can't defeat the Divine Maiden.

800
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,060
A puppet made of silk threads

801
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,030
is not afraid of knives.

802
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,190
But is it afraid of fire?

803
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,270
Don't do it.

804
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,320
What do you want to know?

805
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,670
I...

806
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,000
I'll tell you.

807
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,880
Then tell me everything honestly.

808
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,260
Who is Luan Zhu?

809
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,030
And what secret is hidden in Bodhi Village?

810
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,680
Alright.

811
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,660
I'll confess.

812
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:24,850
I'll confess everything.

813
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,640
Someone is breaking the barrier?

814
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,170
Fan Yue,

815
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,420
you don't need to answer me right now.

816
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,660
I'll give you time.

817
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,000
Think about it.

818
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,000
Shuo is trying to break through the restriction.

819
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,930
If she forces it, she'll easily suffer backlash.

820
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,920
Let's guard her now!

821
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,600
This is the secret of Bodhi Village?

822
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,390
Mystery Turtle?

823
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,610
Mystery Turtle!

824
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,630
Wake up!

825
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,340
Mystery Turtle!

826
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,630
Who are you?

827
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,190
I'll get you out first.

828
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,390
How do you feel?

829
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,410
With your demon power,

830
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,400
it's supposed to be impossible for you to break through the barrier.

831
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,320
Shuo,

832
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,590
why are you here?

833
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,860
This village is dangerous.

834
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,070
Leave now!

835
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,580
I haven't seen you for a long time.

836
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,960
Of course I should visit you.

837
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,450
She's not Bai Shuo.

838
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,670
You...

839
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,700
Jin Yao couldn't kill you,

840
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,380
and the barrier couldn't stop you.

841
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,890
Fu Ling,

842
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,270
it seems you're not simple either.

843
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:19,990
You...

844
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,500
You're Luan Zhu.

845
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,770
You really are a 1000-year-old Mystery Turtle.

846
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,270
Though I've absorbed most of your spiritual power,

847
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,090
you can still see through the truth at a glance.

848
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,170
What did you do to my disciple?

849
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,520
Can't you tell?

850
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,670
I'll use her body.

851
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,550
And I'll use everything that belongs to her.

852
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,520
You...

853
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,120
Don't hurt her.

854
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,190
You two are sisters.

855
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,080
But why are you so different from each other?

856
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,030
Should I call you Fu Ling

857
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,830
or Bai Xi?

858
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,860
You are Bai Xi?

859
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,040
Kill me if you want!

860
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,020
Of course I will kill you.

861
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,450
But without Bai Shuo witnessing it,

862
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,910
I feel like it'll be missing some of the fun.

863
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:13,570
What did you do to my disciple?

864
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,520
Shuo! Shuo!

865
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,470
Bai Shuo,

866
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,280
this is such a great show;

867
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,290
you really should watch it.

868
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,340
Luan Zhu,

869
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,390
if you dare harm my master and Fu Ling,

870
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,940
I will not let you go!

871
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,410
You can't even protect yourself.

872
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:51,040
What do you think you can do to me?

873
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,940
Luan Zhu,

874
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,050
just absorb my spiritual power.

875
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,170
Let my disciple go.

876
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,560
I do plan to absorb your spiritual power.

877
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,990
Jin Yao has been hesitating

878
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:05,570
and hasn't brought in new Eternals yet.

879
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,620
Your 1000 year of spiritual power

880
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,690
is the best supplement right now.

881
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,980
Master!

882
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,140
Stop!

883
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,760
Bai Shuo,

884
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,040
I want you to watch

885
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,310
as your closest ones die one by one right in front of you.

886
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:45,970
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

887
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:54,760

You're back.

911
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,070
Let's go to the cave now.

912
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,370
My master is in danger!
