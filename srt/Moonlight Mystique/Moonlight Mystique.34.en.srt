so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040

Attention, everyone!

There's another

23
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,910
important matter in the palace today.

24
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,290
What is it?

25
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,660
I don't know.

26
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,070
What important matter?

27
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,120
-Bravo!
-Wow!

28
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,770
Look!

29
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,520

Please make way, everyone.

Ms. Bai.

Master prepared these flowers for you.

35
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,970
Master prepared it for her?

36
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,020
You asked me to prepare the festival,

37
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,470
but you secretly prepared these.

38
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,510
Now it seems

39
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,100
it's a bit inappropriate.

40
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,740
What do you mean?

41
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,210
It's perfect.

42
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,920
I'll take the flowers if you won't.

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,700

Nothing. I'm just over the moon.

113
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,770
There must be another way.

114
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,750
I'll order all the demons to search the Polar Region

115
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,620

Bright Moon Palace needs its master.

122
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,920

Cang Shan,

127
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,510
or any one of them,

128
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,760
no one should just live for me.

129
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,830
You should do what you want

130
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,230
according to your wishes.

131
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,260
Our wish is to follow you, Fan Yue.

132
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,270
But my wish is

133
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,340
for you to have your own wishes,

134
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,550
own bliss,

135
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,910
and own direction.

136
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,670

00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,150
death and parting.

Tian Huo.

141
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,720
These are very common things in life.

142
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,040
It's a long journey.

143
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,370
We must learn to accept that

144
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,410
every meeting entails parting,

145
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:51,810
right?

146
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,370
I used to only come here

147
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,980
whenever I was in a bad mood.

148
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,120
I'd never really enjoyed the scenery in front of me.

149
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,260
I never imagined that

150
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,380
there'd be such a bustling day in the Polar Region.

151
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,300
Shuo.

152
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,710
Because of you,

153
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,270
I could witness such splendor

154
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,030
and understand the meaning of life.

155
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,540
We still have a chance.

156
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,910
I used to be

157
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,960
obsessed with revenge.

158
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,390
It's only now that I've realized

159
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,320
how many things I've yet to accomplish.

160
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,320
What do you want to do?

161
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,000
Tell me.

162
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,360
I hope Bright Moon Palace

163
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,630
will always be as peaceful and blissful

164
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,550
as today.

165
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,910
I hope there's no more

166
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,060
fighting in the world.

167
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,120
I also want to see every scenery on the Eastern Continent.

168
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,500
I want to go to Nanhai City to see ice crystals.

169
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,760
I want to go to Phoenix Island

170
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,490
to see sycamore flowers

171
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,140
and go to Misty Island

172
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,050
to collect red corals.

173
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,840
Shuo.

174
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,790
Can you accomplish these things for me in the future?

175
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,540
Can you?

176
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,520
Nanhai is filled with sunshine.

177
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,670
Ice crystals are hard to come by.

178
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,810
Sycamore flowers are rare,

179
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,410
blooming once in thirty years.

180
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,120
The oldest red coral in the world

181
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,370
isn't even ten thousand years old.

182
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,830
To accomplish any one of it,

183
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,630
it'll take at least over a decade.

184
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,170
Fan Yue.

185
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,320
I understand your intention.

186
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,120
You want me to live on well,

187
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,360
right?

188
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,360
You're still as smart as ever.

189
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,270
So will you be a part

190
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,200
of this last plan?

191
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,830
Don't worry.

192
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,550
I cherish my life.

193
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,870
I won't do anything stupid.

194
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,990
I'll continue to live well.

195
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,270
I'll live for a long,

196
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,630
long time.

197
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,440
That's great.

198
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,090
Give me a hug, Shuo.

199
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,700
Shuo.

201

203
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,200

My consciousness is back at Lunar Hidden Sea?

245
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,380
You're finally here.

246
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,430
It's you.

247
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,890
Who are you?

248
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,130
Are you an Eternal, demon, or deity?

249
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,230
Since you're in the Divine Realm,

250
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,670
of course I'm a deity.

251
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,850
Bai Shuo.

252
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,970
My name is Xiu Yan,

253
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,450
[Xiu Yan, Lunar deity]

254
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,610
a Lunar deity.

255
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,970
Since you're a deity,

256
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,390
send me out of the sea of consciousness.

257
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,130
You can save Fan Yue, right?

258
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,800
This is not the sea of consciousness.

259
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,470
The assembly of the Five Contemplations

260
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,010
activated the Divine Realm.

261
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,099
This is

262
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,890
the real Lunar Hidden Sea.

263
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,329
Since you've entered the Lunar Hidden Sea,

264
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,560
it means the time has come.

265
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,109
Bai Shuo.

266
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,390
You should know who you are.

267
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,400
I've always known who I am.

268
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,849
I'm Bai Shuo,

269
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,069
not anyone else.

270
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,420
And I won't be anyone else.

271
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,839
I don't care where this is

272
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,090
and what secrets are hidden here.

273
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,150
I don't care why you have this pendant.

274
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,270
No matter why you pretended

275
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,540
to be my benefactor,

276
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,960
at this moment,

277
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,300
I just want Fan Yue to live.

278
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,020
Can you save him?

279
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,890
He's already dead.

280
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,670
His Seven Stars are gone.

281
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:47,920
I can't save him.

282
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,350
Aren't you a deity?

283
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,090
Why can't you save him?

284
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Because 60,000 years ago,

285
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,650
I've already died.

286
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,870
Now,

287
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,460
I'm just a thread of divine soul,

288
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,880
who exists to protect

289
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,450
the Lunar Hidden Sea and you.

290
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,330
You're dead?

291
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,670
Yes.

292
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,810
I only exist

293
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,320
just for you.

294
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,140
I've been waiting for you here,

295
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,260
waiting for the day you get here

296
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,770
after assembling the Five Contemplations.

297
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,100
Bai Shuo.

298
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,220
Only when you understand the meaning of the Lunar Hidden Sea

299
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,450
can you get a glimpse of the Divine Way

300
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,050
and break out of the Divine Realm

301
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,320
to return to reality

302
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,840
and do everything you're destined to do.

303
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,000
After going through so many things,

304
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,710
I've gone through countless hardships

305
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,900
and lost my loved ones.

306
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,090
Even if I understand everything now

307
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,610
and see the Divine Way,

308
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,680
do you think it's still meaningful to me?

309
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,160
So many people sacrificed themselves to send you here.

310
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,110
Don't you want to know why

311
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,510
everything's the way it is?

312
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,750
If you don't enter the Divine Way,

313
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,550
how can you accomplish

314
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,560
everything you promised to Fan Yue?

315
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,310
Okay.

316
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,030
Then tell me

317
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,100
why the Lunar Hidden Sea exists.

318
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,710
What are these so-called

319
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,540
Divine Realm

320
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,320
and Divine Way?

321
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,400
60,000 years ago,

322
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,030
the so-called Divine Realm you talk about

323
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,110
wasn't on land

324
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,810
but in the sky.

325
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:27,880
In the sky?

326
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,440
To be precise,

327
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,570
it was within the vast galaxy

328
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,270
in the expanse of the universe.

329
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,140
The Heaven controls everything.

330
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,960
In the vast universe,

331
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,500
there were three divisions in the Divine Region,

332
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,770
which were the three races

333
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:55,990
[Lunar Race, Divine Region]

334
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,980
[Demon Race, Divine Region]

335
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,310
of the Lunars,

336
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,880
demons, and Hiddens.

337
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,390
[Hidden Race, Divine Region]

338
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,920
The Hiddens were cruel and bloodthirsty.

339
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,480
The demons were arrogant and unruly.

340
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,780
Only the Lunars focused on

341
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,290
keeping the peace of the Divine Region

342
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,880
and protecting the people.

343
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,380
For many years,

344
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,550
the demons and Hiddens repeatedly provoked each other

345
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,930
and fought endlessly,

346
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,930
yearning to dominate the Divine Region.

347
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,350
But the Lunar Race had the most powerful weapon in the Divine Region,

348
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,740
the Xing Yue Divine Bow.

349
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,630
Against the Divine Bow,

350
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,930
even the Demon Lord Jing Yuan and the Hidden Lord Mo Li

351
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,700
were helpless.

352
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,190
So for thousands of years,

353
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,510
both the demons and Hiddens did everything

354
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,870
to try to destroy the Bow.

355
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,380
Luckily, the Bow was guarded by one person

356
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,120
such that no one could approach it.

357
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,620
That person

358
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,160
[Xing Yue, Divine Lunar Supreme Deity]

359
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,080
was the Supreme Deity Xing Yue.

360
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,340
Xing Yue?

361
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,110
Yes.

362
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,510
Supreme Deity Xing Yue,

363
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,130
the most powerful of the Lunars

364
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,340
and the most admirable Supreme Deity.

365
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,920
She was in command of the Contemplation Stone that controlled the Bow's barrier.

366
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,420
She was also the only one

367
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,580
who knew where the Xing Yue Divine Bow was.

368
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,730
Since she was the most powerful being

369
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,770
and had the help of the Bow,

370
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,830
why did she die in the end

371
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,090
and why were the deities annihilated?

372
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,330
Everything

373
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,290
started from an encounter.

374
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,590
Whose encounter?

375
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,770
Xing Yue

376
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,380
and Jing Yuan.

377
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,700
Greetings, Lunar Lord.

378
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,110
Greetings, Lunar Lord.

379
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,840
Lunar Lord.

380
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,340
The Vault of Heaven Battle is over.

381
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,370
The two elders have chosen

382
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,500
the three strongest young generals in the race.

383
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,890
Please choose your attendant.

384
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,920
The Vault of Heaven Battle

385
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,200
is highly competitive

386
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,640
and perilous.

387
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,950
Answer me this.

388
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,830
Why are you running for the divine attendant?

389
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,560
The Xing Yue Bow is a Heavenly weapon.

390
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,750
It's my lifelong wish

391
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,160
to guard it with you.

392
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,440
You once saved my life on the battlefield.

393
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,590
I'm willing to follow you

394
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,480
till my death.

395
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,330
What about you?

396
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,760
Why do you have to be my attendant?

397
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,620
You're akin to the stars in the world.

398
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,980
I, Yuan,

399
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,700
deeply admire you.

400
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,700
From now on,

401
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,710
you'll be my divine attendant.

402
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,880
This Flaming Moon token

403
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,560
represents your rank.

404
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,730
Thank you, Lunar Lord.

405
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,470
From now on,

406
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,050
where there's the Lunar Lord,

407
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,240
there will be the Flaming Moon

408
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,130
and me, Yuan.

409
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,770
Lunar Lord likes the quiet and simplicity.

410
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,070
Don't come near her for no reason

411
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,050
or offend her

412
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,400
or talk nonsense.

413
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,580
Talk nonsense?

414
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,190
What do you mean?

415
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,840
What you said today

416
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,210
was nonsense.

417
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,150
Fine, I won't talk nonsense.

418
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,810
Your name's Yuan, right?

419
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,840
Sleep in that room.

420
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,270
Xing Yue Pavilion's attendant

421
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,770
is meant to guard the Divine Bow.

422
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,710
But we can't

423
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,690
rely on you anyway.

424
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,440
Just don't cause any trouble.

425
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,740
What do you think Lunar Lord likes?

426
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,680
She likes it when no one disturbs her.

427
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,060
Move, move.

428
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,960
What are you doing?

429
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,880
Didn't you say she likes the quiet?

430
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,780
I'll just watch her from here.

431
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,780
You'd better only do that.

432
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,460
Go! Go away!

433
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,730
Lunar Lord!

434
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,110
Lunar Lord.

435
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,830
I think Xing Yue Pavilion is too cheerless.

436
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,200
Do you like this?

437
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,080
So you don't like flowers.

438
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,780
Then tell me what you like.

439
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,650
I'll get you whatever you want.

440
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,200
Lunar Lord.

441
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,170
You're the Supreme Deity of the Lunar Race,

442
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,520
♫Writing wishes in the night sky♫

443
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,330
but you're still a woman.

444
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,070
Don't you have any interest in things

445
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,540
like jewelry and dresses?

446
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,260
♫The clouds seal their approval for me♫

447
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,500
-Lunar Lord!
-Don’t worry!

448
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,720
-I won’t let him disturb you again!
-If you don’t like flowers,

449
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,420
♫You walk towards me slowly♫

450
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,310
I'll get you something else tomorrow!

451
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,110
Get what else?

452
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,090
You'd better stop this!

453
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,420
Fine, fine.

454
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,510
♫Time stops♫

455
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,000
I'll leave her alone.

456
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,700
I told you

457
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,680
not to disturb her in her quiet.

458
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:49,900
♫The brightest star in the night sky♫

459
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,470
Got it.

460
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,770
Are you sure?

461
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,940
♫Is willing to extinguish for you♫

462
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,770
Since you don't like jewelry,

463
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,800
♫Because the starlight in your eyes♫

464
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,240
what about novels?

465
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,820
I spent a lot of time choosing them.

466
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,980
♫Lights up my long night♫

467
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,660
♫I'm afraid tomorrow is too far♫

468
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,370
Didn't you say you wouldn't disturb her?

469
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,790
♫Love you at every moment♫

470
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,630
I said that for yesterday, not today.

471
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,700
You...

472
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,880
♫Don't miss me♫

473
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,130
♫I'll always be by your side♫

474
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,900
S-Stop right there!

475
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:27,020
♫I'll fulfill this promise with my life♫

476
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,730
♫Once in a lifetime, forever♫

477
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,210
♫Every starlight♫

478
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,660
♫Is a kiss from me to you♫

479
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,500
Lunar Lord.

480
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,290
I heard that on the Eastern Continent,

481
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,240
there's something called the Lantern Festival.

482
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,470
They fly sky lanterns

483
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,710
and admire the full moon.

484
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,020
Why don't we...

485
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,690
I've been in command of the stars for 30,000 years.

486
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,950
I don't care for watching the moon and stars.

487
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,250
This will do.

488
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,560
What does she mean?

489
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,240
What do you think she likes?

490
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,130
Wine.

491
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,250
Got it.

492
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,280
Where are you going?

493
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,880
Lunar Lord.

494
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,730
I don't know where Yuan is slacking off.

495
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,330
I haven't seen him the whole afternoon.

496
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,230
He's not coming back.

497
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,350
He's not?

498
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,390
But he is your attendant.

499
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,770
How could he leave just like that?

500
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,070
Where are his manners?

501
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,850
Was he

502
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,560
discouraged by the scoldings?

503
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,410
Jing Yuan

504
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,300
didn't show up for days.

505
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,050
The place he made lively

506
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,720
was back to its usual silence.

507
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,380
The Lunar Lord was still as noble and cold as ever.

508
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,440
She looked the same.

509
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,290
But something...

510
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,780
seemed to have changed in her.

511
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:39,950
Lunar Lord.

512
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,640
The elders are waiting.

513
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,740
They want to discuss about the Hidden Lord with you.

514
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,190
Lunar Lord.

515
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,150
These are the good wine I found for you

516
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,240
after scouring the Divine Region.

517
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,660
Want to try some?

518
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,610
You like wine,

519
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,030
but why don't I ever see you drink?

520
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,530
You don't have to

521
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,650
do what you like every day.

522
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,360
You also don't have to

523
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,220
get what you like every day.

524
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,270
Have you

525
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,720
always been living such a boring life?

526
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,920
Boring?

527
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,070
Then what is fun?

528
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,910
There are many fun things,

529
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,960
as long as you're willing to do them.

530
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,640
For example?

531
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,690
For example,

532
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,230
riding the wind

533
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,920
and admiring the galaxy.

534
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,160
Lunar Lord.

535
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,340
This is the most mysterious

536
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,470
and splendid Lunar Hidden Sea of the Lunar Race.

537
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,580
This is where I cultivate.

538
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,980
I know what it is.

539
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,590
You've been seeing this view of the galaxy, sun, and moon

540
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,890
for 30,000 years.

541
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,450
Is it any different

542
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,960
today?

543
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,220
Yes.

544
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,000
How so?

545
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,260
Because I'm with the Demon Lord

546
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,560
this time.

547
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:39,170
[Jing Yuan, Divine Demon Supreme Deity]

548
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,460
All the stars are under my control.

549
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,640
Being here where the stellar power of us Lunars

550
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,750
is at its peak

551
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,420
is our only way to trap you, the Demon Lord.

552
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,020
How did you determine that

553
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,840
I'd bring you here?

554
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,220
You are unruly.

555
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,630
The harder it is,

556
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,760
the more eager you are.

557
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,950
Since I told you I don't like the stars, sun, and moon,

558
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,680
I knew that no matter what,

559
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,830
you'd bring me to see this.

560
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,450
I restrained my demonic aura before entering the Lunar division.

561
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,790
When did you discover my identity?

562
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,210
Was it that night

563
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,960
when I invited you to admire the moon

564
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,200
that you detected my aura?

565
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,110
With the Xing Yue Divine Bow

566
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,940
in the Lunars' Divine Region,

567
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,670
no one can hide their aura from me.

568
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,440
I knew who you are

569
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,230
the first time I saw you.

570
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,790
Then why did you still take me in as your attendant?

571
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,700
Weren't you worried that

572
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,240
I'd really get the Contemplation Stone

573
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,680
and find the Xing Yue Bow?

574
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,860
No Lunar apart from me

575
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,970
can stop you.

576
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,070
Since you're here for the Xing Yue Bow,

577
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,970
keeping you by my side is the best guarantee that nothing goes wrong.

578
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,620
I thought I was the mastermind.

579
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,080
But I was

580
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,070
actually already in a trap.

581
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,190
You're right.

582
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,000
I came here

583
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,340
to destroy the Xing Yue Divine Bow.

584
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,000
Are you trapping me here now

585
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,010
because you want to kill me?

586
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,720
I can only trap you

587
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,550
with the Heavenly stellar power.

588
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,690
If I had murderous intent,

589
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,130
I'm afraid more than half

590
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,940
of our sacred land must be destroyed.

591
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,640
I have an appointment to fulfill.

592
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,350
To keep you from making trouble,

593
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,290
you'll have to make do

594
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,990
and stay here.

595
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,360
I know what you're going to do.

596
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,270
You and Hidden Lord Mo Li

597
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,880
agreed to fight every thousand years.

598
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,960
Today

599
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,530
is the day of the fight.

600
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,170
So what if it is?

601
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,040
I just want to remind you this.

602
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,290
Hidden Lord's been in seclusion for three years.

603
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,680
Rumor has it that he was practicing a secret technique.

604
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,790
The Hiddens have always used evil techniques.

605
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,310
Lunar Lord.

606
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,810
Be careful.

607
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,300
You don't have to worry about me.

608
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,160
[Mo Li, Divine Hidden Supreme Deity]

609
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,960
Xing Yue.

610
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,470
It's been a thousand years,

611
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,700
but you're still so cold and beautiful.

612
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,650
We agreed to fight every thousand years.

613
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,750
Bring it on.

614
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,550
You're so powerful. Must you go against me?

615
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,580
Marry me

616
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,690
and become the Hiddens' Divine Queen.

617
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,230
We'll annihilate the demons and share the Divine Region!

618
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:19,280
Isn't that nice?

619
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,870
Mo Li.

620
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,830
Back then, we made a divine agreement

621
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,320
to fight every thousand years,

622
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,870
where the loser can't wage war in the Divine Region.

623
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,960
Between the two of us, apart from this battle,

624
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,840
there's nothing to talk about.

625
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,920
Then let me see how much stronger

626
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,830
you've become in the past thousand years.

627
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,210
As expected of you, Xing Yue.

628
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,270
You're really merciless.

629
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,300
Mo Li,

630
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,690
you lost.

631
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,960
Remember your promise.

632
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,980
Sooner or later,

633
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,520
you'll be mine.

634
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,000
Hidden Lord?

635
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,150
Why does he look exactly like Chong Zhao?

636
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,930
How's Chong Zhao

637
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,360
related to the Hidden Lord?

638
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,380
You've already guessed it,

639
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,850
right?

640
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,830
Among the three children Zhen Yu is looking for,

641
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,800
two of them have the Divine Mantle of Xing Yue and Jing Yuan.

642
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,370
The third one

643
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,180
has the Divine Mantle of the Hidden Lord,

644
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,720
that is Chong Zhao.

645
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,600
But Chong Zhao is an Eternal.

646
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,560
He is kind and righteous.

647
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,650
How could he have anything to do with the Hidden Lord?

648
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,120
Many things

649
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,090
are written in the stars.

650
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,410
Just like how you had to experience

651
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,000
so much to get here.

652
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,310
And just like how you

653
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,970
have to understand what happened 60,000 years ago

654
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,410
before you can break through this Realm.

655
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,980
Bai Shuo.

656
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,480
You need to know the cause

657
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,160
to understand the consequence.

658
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,830
I will tell you everything.

659
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,370
Be patient.

660
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:44,860
Okay.

661
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,890
I'll finish listening to your story first.

662
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,550
She's injured!

663
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,180
Since the Xing Yue Divine Bow was so powerful,

664
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,880
why was Xing Yue injured?

665
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,760
The Bow contains the Heavenly stellar power.

666
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,970
Among the Lunars,

667
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,560
only Supreme Deity Xing Yue can command it.

668
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,540
But commanding the most powerful divine artifact in the world

669
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,860
meant that even a Supreme Deity like her had to pay the price

670
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,440
of equal weight.

671
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:38,770
What price?

672
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,510
Only by suppressing her desires

673
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,630
and severing her emotional bonds

674
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,860
could she control

675
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,330
the Xing Yue Divine Bow.

676
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,850
You mean...

677
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,840
The Lunar Lord wasn't born heartless,

678
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,200
but for the Divine Region

679
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,530
and the people,

680
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,580
she sealed her emotions and desires

681
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,660
in the Contemplation Stone.

682
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,320
That's why

683
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,560
the Stone has such overwhelming divinity.

684
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,360
So the subsequent annihilation of

685
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,480
the Divine Region and the deities

686
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,710
was because Xing Yue

687
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
fell in love?

688
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,970
Hidden power?

689
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,200
I warned you not to

690
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,620
underestimate the enemy.

691
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,770
She actually hid the Divine Bow here?

692
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,050
Both her and Mo Li must've been

693
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,670
hurt from their battle today.

694
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,630
As long as I destroy the Bow,

695
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,950
the Demon Race will send troops to the other two races at once.

696
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,580
From then on,

697
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,670
the demons will dominate the Divine Region.

698
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,360
I've been in command of the stars for 30,000 years.

699
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,230
I don't care for watching the moon and stars.

700
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,530
This will do.

701
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,480
Xing Yue.

702
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,090
Even if I want to take over the Divine Region,

703
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,920
I have to defeat you fair and square.

704
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,230
Why can't I absorb this Hidden power?

705
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,810
Looks like I can only suppress it with divine power.

706
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,190
She's always so cold.

707
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,950
This is a rare moment

708
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,570
where she's unlike her usual self.

709
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:51,470
♫If the wind intends to fill the sky with flowers♫

710
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:57,950
♫The moon's brightness is also the result of stars falling into place♫

711
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,550
Xing Yue, oh, Xing Yue.

712
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,230
I'm really curious.

713
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,590
Were you born so heartless?

714
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,210
♫As the wind stirs, the clouds gather♫

715
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,460
♫As the clouds shift, the moon becomes full♫

716
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:13,200
♫Love is the hardest thing to understand♫

717
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:20,880
♫I'm finally back to where it all started♫

718
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:27,870
♫All the answers are already explained♫

719
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,340
♫I'll owe you all of my life♫

720
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,240
Lunar Lord, bad news!

721
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,760
The Contemplation Stone is weakening!

722
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,340
Lunar...

723
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,590
Shut up!

724
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:44,930
You...

725
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:46,570
You...

726
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,640
G-Get out!

727
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,830
Wait.

728
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,990
Why are you dressed like a demon?

729
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:03,840
Demonic power?

730
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,560
You're a demon?

731
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,010
Shut up.

732
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,010
What does he want?

733
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,560
Is he going to kill me?

734
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,590
Stay here.

735
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,240
I'll be back soon.

736
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,800
Where did he go?

737
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,670
He went to the Snow Cave of the Divine Region

738
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,090
to get a flower.

739
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,590
What flower?

740
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,230
The Soul Lotus,

741
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,340
which is Luan Zhu's essence.

742
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,770
Luan Zhu's essence?

743
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,640
The Soul Lotus

744
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,030
has infinite vitality.

745
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,150
It's a great healing flower.

746
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,170
It's also why

747
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,000
Luan Zhu survived in the Divine War

748
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,550
back then.

749
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,970
Luan Zhu said

750
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,740
he accompanied Jing Yuan for a century.

751
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,380
Is that true?

752
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,590
Sometimes,

753
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,640
the key to

754
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,240
discerning the truth

755
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,960
is how you see it.

756
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,130
Lunar Lord, watch out.

757
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
He's a demon!

758
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,620
You left out one word,

759
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,330
"Lord."

760
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,800
Demon Lord Jing Yuan?

761
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,290
Demon Lord!

762
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,880
Don't you dare act recklessly in our Lunar division!

763
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,240
Lunar Lord!

764
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:42,970
It's fine.

765
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:43,960
You may leave.

766
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,090
Remember this, Xiu Yan,

767
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,710
only the attendant Yuan is here.

768
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,680
Yes,

769
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,820
Lunar Lord.

770
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,070
Mo Li's power is just on par with mine.

771
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,790
Even if he'd cultivated the secret technique,

772
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:57,650
you have the Xing Yue Divine Bow.

773
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,830
Why did you get hurt?

774
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,340
Why didn't you destroy the Bow last night?

775
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,260
You're unpredictable.

776
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,810
How would I know

777
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,270
if it wasn't another trap?

778
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,850
This Lotus can nourish your divine energy

779
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,140
and purify you of the Hidden power.

780
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,680
You just need to meditate here every day.

781
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,860
In a few days,

782
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:26,960
you'll recover.

783
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:31,000
The Soul Lotus

784
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,850
grows in the Snow Cave of the Divine Region

785
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,900
and is protected by the prehistoric Nine-Head Serpent.

786
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,610
It must've taken you a lot of effort

787
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,120
to get this flower.

788
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,850
What do you want in exchange?

789
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,010
In exchange?

790
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,430
It seems you still don't understand me.

791
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,140
If I really want something,

792
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:49,660
I don't trade for it.

793
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,300
I just

794
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:52,450
take it.
