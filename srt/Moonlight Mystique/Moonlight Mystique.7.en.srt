so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,010

truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

What's the most important thing

You're very smart.

you promised Fan Yue to teach me Eternal skills.

Or alchemy?

If you can't even protect yourself,

how can you live long enough to grow stronger?

80
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:06,900

If you don't want to learn,

109
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,270
Since

110
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,820
you've called me Master,

111
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,580
today,

112
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,460
we should

113
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,690
set a rule.

114
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,540
What rule?

115
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,420
Just tell me.

116
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:11,890
To become my disciple,

117
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,630
you need to pay first.

118
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,250
It's not what I want either.

119
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,350
I'm just staying here temporarily in Lanling,

120
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,620
and I have to pay for accommodation every month.

121
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,520
Otherwise, they would've kicked me out long ago.

122
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,400
They are so stingy.

123
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,620
Why are you still staying here?

124
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,800
Do you think I want

125
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,800
to be exploited by those old fossils?

126
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,040
I've been making elixirs every day,

127
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,680
and it...

128
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,810
and it has made my turtle shell almost crack.

129
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,220
But I'm the only 1000-year-old spirit turtle

in the whole Eastern Continent.

131
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,220
Everyone knows I'm skilled in divination,

132
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,960
and everyone wants to capture me to predict the future for them.

133
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,790
In this vast world,

134
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,080
only Lanling

135
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,750
can protect

136
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,450
my turtle body!

137
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,310
It's it.

138
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,460
There are four steps:

139
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,970
look, smell, touch, and taste.

140
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,600
These are the ways to identify medicinal herbs.

141
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,300
My disciple, as the saying goes,

142
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,560
make the most of what's around you.

143
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,960
Since you've come to this mountain,

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
you should learn to make use of what others consider useless.

145
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,850
What's the effect of the old tree bark?

146
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,750
It clears heat and disperses blood stasis.

147
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,730
Smart!

148
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,670
Let's go.

149
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,750
How do you make it?

150
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,800
Turn up the heat.

151
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,070
Don't underestimate this alchemy furnace.

152
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,120
It's older than me.

153
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,160
It was forged from meteoric iron that fell from the sky.

154
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,159
Have you understood?

155
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,360
Good.

156
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,140
Wait.

157
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,620
Can you understand it?

158
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,850
I can.

159
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,030
What does the letter say?

160
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,120
They also refused to come.

161
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,310
Among the 72 Sects,

162
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,160
except for Kunlun Sect and the Wuliang Sect,

163
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,680
none are willing to start a war.

164
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,070
Then how can we conquer the Cold Spring Palace?

165
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,960
Be gentle.

166
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,810
This table was just repaired.

167
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,420
I know.

168
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,570
I held back my strength.

169
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,680
The 72 Sects

170
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,240
each have their own philosophy.

171
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,419
Some seek worldly engagement,

172
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,929
some are reclusive;

173
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,070
[When the Lanling Sect and others discuss the matter of the conquest, our sect will definitely spare no effort]

174
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,070
[Our sect fully agrees and is willing to work together to discuss the strategy for the conquest]

175
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,490
some value culture, some value martial arts;

176
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,610
some are radical, some are conservative.

177
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,820
The different philosophies lead to disagreements.

178
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,020
Since the truce between the Eternals Race and the Demon Race 100 years ago,

179
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,390
the Human Race has been living in peace.

180
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,180
It's understandable that the Eternals

181
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,710
don't want to break this peace.

182
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,870
Sect Leader, since you know this,

183
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,000
why did you send letters to them?

184
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,860
I thought that

185
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,770
even if some sects don't like war,

186
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,310
among the 72 sects,

187
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,480
there would still be at least

188
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,060
30% supporting it.

189
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,890
But I didn't expect that

190
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,550
I couldn't find even three sects.

191
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,670
As you all know,

192
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,360
these sects are spread across the Eastern Continent.

193
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,960
It was...

194
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,190
It was exhausting.

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,440
But that's not the main problem.

196
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,550
The real problem is that

197
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,870
we spent a lot of money

198
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,720
from the treasury to send the letters this time.

199
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,430
It's becoming increasingly empty.

200
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,780
You should stop using the term "treasury."

201
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,300
Otherwise,

202
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,960
people will think we're rich.

203
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Well, why don't you start some new business?

204
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,980
Back then,

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,080
when Chong Zhao was running that steamed bun stall,

206
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,090
he made quite a lot of money.

207
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,070
Yes.

208
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,130
Speaking of Chong Zhao,

209
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,420
he's already been punished

210
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,810
and has completed his self-reflection.

211
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,600
I think it's time to let him back.

212
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,700
Although he can no longer serve as an Eternal Envoy,

213
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,930
he is, after all,

214
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,830
the head disciple of Lanling Sect.

215
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,730
We can't just let him stay on that mountain forever.

216
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,950
Master Turtle!

217
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,850
Master Turtle!

218
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,030
Master Turtle!

219
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,790
Master Turtle, are you there?

220
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,240
I'll be out in a minute! Wait for me in the yard!

221
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,740
Hurry up and find a place to hide.

222
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,270
Coming!

223
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,550
Master Turtle!

224
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,360
Master Turtle!

225
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,480
Coming!

226
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,270
I'm here.

227
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,360
-Thank you, Master Turtle.
-Thank you, Master Turtle.

228
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,670
There's no need.

229
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,930
What's going on lately?

230
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,470
Why do you suddenly need such a large amount of elixirs?

231
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,390
Well,

232
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,960
it's because of Chong Zhao.

233
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,870
They all say that Chong Zhao

234
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,190
is a once-in-a-century genius in Lanling

235
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,500
with limitless potential.

236
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,470
But now he has been given 300 lashes

237
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,930
and sent to Heart-guarding Cliff.

238
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,470
However, with him gone,

239
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,820
the position of the Eternal Envoy in Ning'an City is now vacant.

240
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,520
The Sect Leader said there will be a martial arts competition,

241
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,350
and the winner

242
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,600
will become the new Eternal Envoy.

243
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,360
We expend spiritual power during training,

244
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,720
so we came to ask you

245
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,150
for some elixirs to replenish it.

246
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,030
Chong Zhao

247
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,650
is the Sect Leader's direct disciple.

248
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,920
How did he end up like this?

249
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,750
Well,

250
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,930
he brought it upon himself.

251
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,440
If he had had no other choices,

252
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,580
it would have been acceptable.

253
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,070
But to save someone, he delayed reporting

254
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,900
the news of the Demon Race harming the Human Race

255
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,360
by a day.

256
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,000
Otherwise,

257
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,940
the Demon Race wouldn't have had the chance

258
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,240
to wreak havoc in Ning'an City.

259
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,560
I heard that the person

260
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,460
is the daughter of the governor of Ning'an City.

261
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,690
Do you think Chong Zhao

262
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,150
has fallen in love?

263
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,740
He actually made such a huge mistake for a woman.

264
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,670
Alright.

265
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,340
The high-up Eternals are waiting.

266
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,720
Let's take the elixirs back first.

267
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,600
Master Turtle.

268
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,510
-We're leaving.
-See you.

269
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,510
Go ahead.

270
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,450
What did they mean by 300 lashes?

271
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,670
And what is the Heart-guarding Cliff?

272
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,820
Master.

273
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,420
Have you learned anything these days?

274
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,880
Of all the hardships in the world, guarding the heart is the hardest.

275
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,610
Master,

276
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,510
my resolve

277
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,600
seems to be wavering.

278
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,880
The Eternals are also made of flesh and blood.

279
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,600
On this long journey,

280
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,790
confusion and doubt

281
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,710
are natural things.

282
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,730
The true self-cultivation

283
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,430
is not in the mountains,

284
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,300
but in the bustling world.

285
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,630
Go down the mountain.

286
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,300
Experience what you must experience,

287
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,680
and bear what you must bear.

288
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,170
Right and wrong,

289
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,840
good and evil, cause and effect—

290
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,860
in the end,

291
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,560
you will find the answer.

292
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,570
Master.

293
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,510
Do you still think there is

294
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,660
nothing suspicious about my parents' death?

295
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,640
After your parents' incident,

296
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,150
the entire Lanling Sect was mobilized

297
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,020
and investigated for a whole year,

298
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,390
but in the end, the result was the same.

299
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,790
Chong Zhao,

300
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,320
some things should be let go

301
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,740
when it's time.

302
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,440
Otherwise,

303
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,320
you'll suffer.

304
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,160
Recently, Cold Spring Palace has been very active.

305
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,970
Within three months, they've wiped out three clans.

306
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,980
Zhen Yu has taken the internal elixirs of the three chiefs

307
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,830
to heal the wound from his severed tail.

308
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,550
Being so impatient,

309
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,190
he must be planning to stir up trouble again.

310
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,520
With me here,

311
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,200
Zhen Yu won't stir up any big trouble.

312
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,830
What's the situation at Jingyou Mountain?

313
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,560
The Jingyou Fox Clan has always stayed out of external conflicts.

314
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,000
They didn't make any moves.

315
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,840
The top priority now

316
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,250
is still to help Bai Shuo gather the Five Contemplations.

317
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,730
As for everything else, we can just watch from the sidelines.

318
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,200
Master, I've been wanting to ask you a question.

319
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,250
You compromised with Bai Shuo so many times.

320
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,500
Is it really just because of the Desireless Stone?

321
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,440
Master, I'm boldly reminding you.

322
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,430
Don't let Bai Shuo become your weakness.

323
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,150
Since the day I became the Demon King,

324
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,200
I've had no weaknesses.

325
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,510
Aren't you afraid of the Master punishing you?

326
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,570
Whether you're an Eternal or a Demon,

327
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,890
no matter how strong your sorcery is,

328
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,640
once you fall in love,

329
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,450
you'll have a weakness that can be exploited.

330
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,710
Don't worry.

331
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,790
Our Master

332
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,200
will never fall in love.

333
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,350
No matter what,

334
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,980
if Bai Shuo causes any trouble in the future,

335
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,380
even if it means risking the Master's punishment,

336
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,730
I'll clear the obstacle.

337
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,080
Are you still

338
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,630
thinking about Chong Zhao?

339
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,920
Don't drink too much.

340
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,540
The peach blossom wine is rare.

341
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,170
I've only kept a few bottles.

342
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,120
Alright, alright.

343
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,480
Keep going.

344
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,790
You're my disciple after all.

345
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,720
You can drink as much as my wine you want.

346
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,670
Where is

347
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,890
Heart-guarding Cliff?

348
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,800
The Desireless Stone is still inside you.

349
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,390
You can't run around.

350
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,730
And Chong Zhao delayed reporting the demon situation because of you.

351
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,590
If something happens to you in the Eternal Race,

352
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,560
and he ends up clashing with the sect for you,

353
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,770
what should we do?

354
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,000
Because of me?

355
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,570
For me,

356
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,300
he almost got an entire city killed.

357
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,550
If it hadn't been for the Five Eternals of Lanling arriving in time,

358
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,730
and if my father hadn't sacrificed his life to exchange for Kindness,

359
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,350
the whole city would have been destroyed.

360
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,670
I honestly wish he had never done it for me.

361
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,170
If the Five Eternals had arrived earlier,

362
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,500
maybe the city wouldn't have fallen into chaos,

363
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,280
and maybe my father wouldn't have...

364
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,560
But what right do I have to blame him?

365
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,500
After all,

366
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,870
everything that happened in Ning'an City

367
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,680
was because of me.

368
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,460
Girl,

369
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,250
there are many things in this world

370
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,950
that can't be judged right or wrong.

371
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,700
No one can foresee everything in the world.

372
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,670
Most of the time,

373
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,300
we just

374

375
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,800
The past cannot be changed.

376
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,680
We must look forward.

377
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,160
Yeah.

378
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,280
I can't go back to the past.

379
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,870
To the bright moon,

380
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,290
to the night sky,

381
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,920
to this miserable life,

382
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,520
♫Don't linger, don't regret♫

383
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,130

00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,610

Why did you say that your life is miserable?

♫In this life, at this time♫

394
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,890
I can't tell you

life

401
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,839
is the process of going from having nothing

♫on your path?♫

403
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,440

♫The night wind is chaotic, and the sound of the Qin is broken♫

411

don't torment yourself,

416
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,790
don't force things,

♫I listen to the past, never enough♫

I don't know

♫I ended up with desolation♫

428
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,260
how much you've really taken in.

429
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,410
Fine.

430
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,800
Everyone

431
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,700
has to walk their own path.

432
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,190
Whether it's good or bad,

433
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,180
only by experiencing it yourself

434
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,590
will you truly understand.

435
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:03,410
[On the 22nd of June, in the 9th year of Chenghuai, my husband Chong Tai and I went to the Western Mountain]

436
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,270
[On the 18th of June, in the 9th year of Chenghuai, my husband Chong Tai and I patrolled a remote area in the southern part of the city at night]

437
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,260
[On the 11th of April, in the 9th year of Chenghuai, my husband Chong Tai and I patrolled the city]

438
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,520
On the 7th of May, in the 9th year of Chenghuai,

439
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,040
my husband Chong Tai and I were patrolling the southeast.

440
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,620
We saw a village in the distance,

441
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,850
with paths crisscrossing

442
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,460
and people coming and going.

443
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,920
[Chong Tai, Eternal, Lanling Sect]
[Meng Ning, Eternal, Lanling Sect]

444
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,780
-Look.
-We wanted to enter the village to investigate,

445
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,880
but when we stepped forward, the scene and the people suddenly vanished.

446
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,590
Could this be the mirage in the legend?

447
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,090
That's weird.

448
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,910
Yes.

449
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,210
On the 14th of June, in the 9th year of Chenghuai,

450
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,400
my husband Chong Tai and I were passing through Qingyao Mountain

451
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,000
when we saw a snake demon kill more than ten people.

452
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,300
So we tried to kill the demon,

453
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,060
but she was pregnant.

454
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,950
In the end, we let the baby snakes return to the forests.

455
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,460
I don't know whether what we did was right or wrong.

456
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,950
All the Eternals know that your parents were killed

457
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,100
by a scorpion demon ten years ago.

458
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,210
But do you know

459
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,090
that two days before your parents were killed,

460
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,310
Qian Yin had already died?

461
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,860
You've been investigating for years but have found nothing.

462
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,230
Do you know why?

463
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,800
Because

464
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,440
you've never set foot in the Demon Race.

465
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,810
What you see now

466
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,390
may not be the truth.

467
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,630
And in places you can't see,

468
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,130
the truth

469
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,640
might be right there.

470
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,030
On the 15th of July, in the 9th year of Chenghuai,

471
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,710
the Eternals and demons fought a great battle,

472
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,590
and we lost more than half of our forces.

473
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,660
While we were cleaning up the bodies of the Eternals,

474
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,300
two of them showed no signs of demon injuries.

475
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,170
Since they weren't killed by demons,

476
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,050
how did they die?

477
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,650
Did my parents uncover something

478
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,270
that led to their deaths?

479
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,000
It seems

480
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,740
I really need to visit the Demon Race.

481
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,020
You came after all.

482
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,180
Why do you always want to get physical every time you see me?

483
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,330
I do miss the you

484
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,320
who saved me in Ning'an City.

485
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,040
Don't even mention Ning'an City!

486
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,020
Just the fact that you used the Nether Poison to harm the Human Race

487
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,580
is enough for me to execute you right now!

488
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,140
Is that so?

489
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,680
So today, are you here in the Cold Spring Palace's territory

490
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,190
to kill me

491
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,870
or to beg me?

492
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,600
Take me to see Qian Yin's grave.

493
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,580
How dare you show disrespect to my guest?

494
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,510
Sorry for startling you.

495
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,300
Just like humans,

496
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,490
demons who die

497
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,300
would be buried by their family members,

498
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,200
and monuments would be erected

499
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,350
in their memory.

500
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,210
That

501
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,650
is Qian Yin's grave.

502
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,850
He died on the 15th of July, ten years ago,

503
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,670
and your parents

504
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,180
died on the 17th of July.

505
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,260
You expect me to believe you with just a tombstone inscription?

506
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,200
You've come here with me.

507
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,180
You still won't admit that you believe me?

508
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,920
Ten years of Fortunei

509
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,350
and seven years of wintergreen

510
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,760
can be used to make a fourth-grade elixir,

511
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,030
which can gather spiritual energy.

512
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,790
Twenty years of withered Poria

513
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,330
and thirty years of perilla leaves

514
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,780
can be used to make a third-grade elixir,

515
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,870
which can expand spiritual veins.

516
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,140
A hundred years of refined ice and a thousand years of Snow Lotus

517
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,270
can be used to make a second-grade elixir,

518
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,510
which can refine spiritual foundations.

519
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,160
Master,

520
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,910
why is there no record of first-grade elixirs?

521
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,940
First-grade elixirs?

522
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,270
That's a legend from ancient times.

523
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,000
No one has ever seen one.

524
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,070
Tell me more about it.

525
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,520
Maybe I can make it.

526
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,440
I'm not underestimating you.

527
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,490
A first-grade elixir can even

528
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,600
withstand the thunder tribulation of a high-up Eternal ascending.

529
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,800
It's not an ordinary thing.

530
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,200
I've never made one myself.

531
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,470
You?

532
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,160
Forget it.

533
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,660
If I really manage to make it,

534
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,740
what will my reward be?

535
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,840
You can't make it.

536
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,660
Tell me what the reward will be first.

537
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,140
How about you tell me what reward you want first?

538
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,000
If I make it,

539
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,330
lend me your turtle shell.

540
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,980
The shell of a 1000-year-old Mystery Turtle

541
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,100
can make divination more accurate.

542
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,180
You want my shell?

543
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,340
Don't even think about it.

544
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,470
You're not after my shell,

545
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,570
you're after my life.

546
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,460
If a turtle loses its shell,

547
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,900
it can be easily killed by anyone.

548
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,610
Then where did this shell

549
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,510
come from?

550
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,120
It's the shell of a dead turtle.

551
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,250
You gave me someone's remains?

552
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,960
What's so strange about it?

553
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,180
After I die,

554
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,140
my remains

555
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,820
will be yours too.

556
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,240
How long will that take?

557
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,060
You're really wishing for my death, aren't you?

558
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,640
Of course not.

559
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,390
I just think that a turtle like you

560
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,770
might live longer than I will.

561
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,640
I can't count on

562
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,920
your remains.

563
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,420
Good that you know.

564
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,730
Where are you going?

565
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,090
Going back to sleep.

566
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,670
So you little troublemaker

567
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,750
won't try to get my shell

568
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,130
while I'm asleep.

569
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,720
Now that Old Turtle has left,

570
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,030
the long night

571
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,420
does seem a bit boring.

572
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,400
It's so late now.

573
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,390
I wonder if that Demon King is asleep yet.

574
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,330
Fan Yue?

575
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,410
He really is asleep.

576
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,330
What?

577
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,570
Nothing.

578
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,360
I'm staying up late

579
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,490
making elixirs.

580
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,060
So?

581
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,270
So?

582
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,830
Don't ask me like it's none of your business.

583
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,920
It was supposed to be you teaching me.

584
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,850
But you sent me to Old Turtle

585
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,430
and now you're just sitting back,

586
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,580
enjoying your free time.

587
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,650
Enjoying my free time?

588
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:35,770
What else would you be doing?

589
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
What are you doing?

590
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,760
Are you busy

591
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,560
fighting over territory with the Cold Spring Palace?

592
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,990
Fan Yue.

593
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,460
I'm listening.

594
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,380
Let me tell you,

595
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,430
my alchemy skills are pretty good now.

596
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,530
If I make a first-grade elixir,

597
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,810
even Old Turtle will have to call me Master.

598
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,660
It's said that first-grade elixirs are very powerful.

599
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,970
Once I make one and take it,

600
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,510
both Eternals and demons will be afraid of me.

601
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,320
So will you.

602
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,630
Really?

603
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,530
Just you wait.

604
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,630
♫We're destined to be together forever from the first sight♫

605
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,000
I also learned some divination techniques from Old Turtle.

606
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,730
But I'm not used to

607
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,370
♫Goodbye, loneliness♫

608
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,280
this turtle shell,

609
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,920
♫The one who was slightly late♫

610
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,120
so I haven't been able to get any predictions.

611
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,820
Do you think he's deceiving me?

612
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,440
Deceiving you?

613
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,530
♫You came towards me, closer and closer♫

614
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,590
He's a 1000-year-old turtle.

615
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,770
He's really cunning.

616
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,800
There's a moon here,

617
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,660
a crescent moon.

618
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:34,150
♫You enriched my life♫

619
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,720
Is there one over there?

620
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,610
So, both the Eternals and demons

621
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,460
are looking at the same moon.

622
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,240
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

623
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,380
All the races live on the same land.

624
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,310
Naturally, they see the same moon.

625
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,730
♫You are the light I yearn for♫

626
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,380
You talked a lot today.

627
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,770
What exactly are you trying to say?

628
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,190
♫You are my determined way home♫

629
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,510
Didn't I tell you?

630
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,420
Staying up late making elixirs is very boring.

631
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,340
Boring?

632
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:56,920
♫Let this moment stay forever♫

633
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,960
Am I just your entertainment?

634
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,760
Not really.

635
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,590
It's just that when I'm bored,

636
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,480
♫I'm hugging you in the crowd♫

637
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,070
I naturally think of a boring person.

638
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,110
Bai Shuo.

639
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,480
I have things to do. I have to go.

640
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,240
♫Let's never let go♫

641
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,070
Master.

642
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,970
Master.

643
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,600
Why are there still so many?

644
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,140
Previously, when you went to Ning'an City,

645
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,630
matters piled up in the Polar Region.

646
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,310
Everyone is waiting for you to make decisions.

647
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,260
Then why

648
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,250
were even trivial matters like disputes

649
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,640
presented to me?

650
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,710
There's no choice.

651
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,770
Among the ten thousand demons in the Polar Region,

652
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,280
no one respects anyone else.

653
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,860
The only one they respect is you, the Master.

654
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,560
If you don't decide the outcome or make a ruling,

655
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,300
they'll keep fighting forever.

656
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,250
So, Master,

657
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,230
please bear with it

658
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,350
and finish reading these files.

659
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,470
Wait.

660
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,140
What can I do for you?

661
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,490
I have a question.

662
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,550
What do you think of when you're bored?

663
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,090
When I'm bored?

664
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,150
Drinking, fighting and sleeping.

665
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,560
I mean, what person do you think of?

666
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,290
I do think of someone.

667
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,120
Who is it?

668
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,430
Can I not tell you?

669
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,620
Why?

670
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,400
I'm embarrassed to tell you the person I like.

671
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,180
Master, I'll leave you to your work.

672
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,250
I'll put these over there for you.

673
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,750
The person she likes?

674
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,540
You killed him?

675
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,490
Yes.

676
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,880
Zhong Zhao trespassed into the Cold Spring Palace's territory.

677
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,190
Lady Fu Ling, not only didn't you capture him,

678
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,730
but you also killed one of your own.

679
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,380
What exactly are you planning to do?

680
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,850
I'm getting more and more confused.

681
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,300
I don't need you to understand.

682
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,760
What?

683
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,580
Is the life of the bear demon not worth anything?

684
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,970
Or is it that

685
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,590
in your heart,

686
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,540
you only care about Chong Zhao's life?

687
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,080
When you used little demons to practice,

688
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,100
did you ever care about their lives?

689
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,170
Besides,

690
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,220
this bear demon almost ruined my plan.

691
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,420
He deserved to die.

692
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,710
For such a trivial matter,

693
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,970
you actually came to report to the Grand Master.

694
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,080
I really underestimated how petty you are.

695
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,260
Enough.

696
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,400
Are you done?

697
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,170
Fu Ling,

698
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,920
tell me about your plan.

699
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,350
Grand Master, you once taught us

700
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,670
that when someone wants something,

701
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,010
we should give it to them.

702
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,090
Even if it's fake,

703
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,680
it must be convincing.

704
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,880
Chong Zhao is investigating the truth behind his parents' deaths,

705
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,300
but he has no leads.

706
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,530
At this point, if I give him a clue—

707
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,220
whether it's real or not—

708
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,890
he will cling to it.

709
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,240
As long as he wants to investigate,

710
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,940
he will have no choice

711
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,010
but to fall into my trap.

712
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,990
Lady Fu Ling,

713
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,000
you truly are a master of strategy.

714
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,200
But don't say I didn't remind you.

715
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,650
You'd better settle this quickly

716
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,160
to avoid future complications.

717
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,180
And don't let any other thoughts take root,

718
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,550
or you might disgrace your identity as the Young Lord of Cold Spring Palace.

719
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,210
Alright.

720
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,430
Since

721
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,550
he has an obsession he can't let go of,

722
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,690
we'll help him strengthen it.

723
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,900
Once he has an inner demon,

724
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,900
he will

725
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,170
be of use to the Cold Spring Palace.

726
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,150
Fu Ling,

727
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,110
I want you

728
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,050
to use every means possible

729
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,160
to force him to abandon being an Eternal, become a demon,

730
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,590
and join

731
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,800
our Cold Spring Palace.

732
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,470
Yes.

733
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,240
Master!

734
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,260
Master!

735
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,000
What happened?

736
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,800
Did

737
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,340
the alchemy furnace explode again?

738
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,270
I made it!

739
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,630
Not bad, my disciple.

740
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,280
You can make a second-grade elixir already!

741
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,560
I didn't misjudge you after all.

742
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,300
This time,

743
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,140
I can give Fan Yue a report.

744
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,810
Why should you report to him?

745
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,330
If she fails to learn anything,

746
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,120
I'll strip you of your 1000-year-old turtle shell.

747
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,310
Luckily, your comprehension is exceptional.

748
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,480
It looks like my 1000-year-old turtle shell is safe now.

749
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,440
Today is a good day.

750
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,600
I'll go and get a couple of bottles...

751
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,720
of nectar.

752
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,750
Let's celebrate.

753
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,030
Again?

754
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,790
Yes!

755
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,960
Didn't you go to get the nectar?

756
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,570
How did you come back so quickly?

757
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,770
Bai Shuo?

758
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,790
It's you?

759
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,580
You escaped from the Demon Race?

760
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,760
Are you here to seek help from our Eternal Race?

761
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,270
No, wait.

762
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,640
You are a human.

763
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,360
How did you enter the Eternal Sect?

764
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,160
And why are you hiding here with Old Turtle?

765
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,340
Tell me!

766
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,570
What happened?

767
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,960
Sir, you sure have a big temper.

768
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,500
You just saw me, and now you want to get physical already.

769
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,250
That day, you were kidnapped by Master Bright Moon.

770
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,640
The Eternal Sect sent countless disciples to search for you in the Polar Region.

771
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,290
Now that you've appeared in the Eternal Sect,

772
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,820
come with me to meet the Sect Leade!

773
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,210
You're not looking for me.

774
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,130
You're looking for the Desireless Stone.

775
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,770
The Desireless Stone belongs to the Eternals!

776
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,640
It should stay in Lanling!

777
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,030
But I don't belong to the Eternals.

778
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,110
It makes no difference!

779
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,440
You're carrying a demonic object.

780
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,380
Who are you trying to send a message to?

781
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,000
Is it Master Bright Moon?

782
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,920
I've always said that humans are hard to predict,

783
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,760
and they're easily controlled by demons.

784
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,660
You're a human carrying the Desireless Stone.

785
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,360
Don't even think about leaving!

786
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,200
Chong Zhao!

787
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,150
Get out of my way!

788
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,170
Bai Shuo is innocent.

789
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,570
Uncle Master, you can't kill her!

790
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,400
Shut up!

791
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,880
Don't forget who you are.

792
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,210
She carries the Desireless Stone

793
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,320
and is colluding with the Demon Race.

794
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,310
She is an enemy to our entire Eternal Race!

795
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,840
Don't be so blind!

796
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,590
I'm not the one who's blind.

797
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,860
You are!

798
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,730
Are you saying I'm blind to right and wrong?

799
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,260
I dare not disobey you.

800
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,940
But if you insist on this,

801
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,610
I will have no choice but to go against you!

802
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,880
You are beyond help!

803
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,750
Enough!

804
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:23,890
Chong Zhao,

805
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,570
this has nothing to do with you.

806
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,730
Entering the Demon Palace that day

807
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,360
was my own choice.

808
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,520
Just like now, I choose not to stay with the Eternals.

809
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,660
As an Eternal, you want to kill a human.

810
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,170
As long as you're at peace with it,

811
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,320
go ahead.

812
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,810
Stop.

813
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,350
Sect Leader, you came at just the right time.

814
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,340
Bai Shuo is colluding with the Demon Race

815
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,030
and sneaked into Lanling. Her intentions must be malicious.

816
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,300
She must be eliminated!

817
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,670
Sect Leader, are you going to kill me too?

818
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,580
Lanling Sect will not kill an innocent person.

819
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,890
I know you didn't do anything wrong.

820
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,360
So, are you willing to let me go?

821
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,010
Of course,

822
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,480
that's impossible.

823
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,860
The Desireless Stone concerns the peace of the world.

824
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,920
As the Sect Leader of Lanling,

825
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,230
I can never allow it to fall into the hands of the demons.

826
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,920
Master!

827
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,489
What do you want?

828
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,909
Rather than letting you return to the Demon Race,

829
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,170
it's better to...

830
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,469
make you forget it.

831
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,400
West sun mountain.

832
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,310
East moon river.

833
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,409
A snake slithers across the grass.

834
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,310
A fish leaps above the sandy sea.

835
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,120
The earth knows, but the sky does not.

836
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,720
Only by stepping in can you find the way.

837
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,710
The head of the Eternal Sect

838
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,430
actually laid hands on a human.

839
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,310
I think

840
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,250
Lanling Sect

841
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,150
should just change its name to Lanling Evil Sect.

842
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:28,900
Fan Yue!

843
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,860
How dare you break into our Eternal Sect?

844
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,480
Give us Bai Shuo!

845
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,650
I'm here to take you back.

846
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,720
Shuo!

847
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,630
You can't go back to the Demon Race with him!

848
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,930
Fan Yue,

849
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,560
are you really going to go against the entire Eternal Sect?

850
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,500
Bai Shuo is mine.

851
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,770
I allowed her to stay temporarily in the Eternal Sect,

852
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,500
but that doesn't mean Lanling Sect has the right to keep her here.

853
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,140
Sect Leader,

854
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,290
that turtle shell...

855
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,950
It looks familiar.

856
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,760
So familiar.

857
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,890
Sect Leader, I'm innocent!

858
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,400
I was forced by Fan Yue to become Bai Shuo's teacher

859
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,670
for a few days as a way of repaying his favor.

860
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,760
The fact that the Desireless Stone was stolen

861
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,480
has nothing to do with me!

862
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,540
Stop making excuses.

863
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,980
If you hadn't given him the turtle shell,

864
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,090
how could he have broken into our Lanling Sect?

865
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,280
When I gave him the shell to repay his kindness,

866
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,580
I didn't know he was the Demon King.

867
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,520
Your words alone aren't enough to prove it!

868
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:37,770
Sect Leader,

869
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,360
I'm utterly loyal to Lanling.

870
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,710
Heaven and Earth are my witness.

871
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,020
I didn't betray you!

872
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,320
Please, spare me!

873
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,560
Master,

874
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,230
Old Turtle has been making elixirs for the Eternals for many years.

875
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,900
This time, he was forced by Fan Yue.

876
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,690
Master, please forgive him.

877
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,640
You have no right to plead for Old Turtle!

878
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,130
You dared to attack your teacher,

879
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,440
and you even said I can't tell right from wrong.

880
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,660
It seems the 300 lashes weren't enough for you!

881
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,150
You need a few more!

882
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,180
I didn't mean to offend you.

883
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,150
But if you try to kill Bai Shuo,

884
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,970
I can't just stand by and watch.

885
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,160
I believe

886
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,100
killing innocent people is not something the Eternals should do.

887
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,160
Sect Leader, did you hear that?

888
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,900
He said I kill innocent people!

889
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,990
Alright, Jing Lei.

890
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,140
Stop making things difficult for Chong Zhao.

891
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,920
We've watched him grow up.

892
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,190
We know him very well.

893
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,240
As for Old Turtle…

894
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,680
Lanling

895
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,710
has been using

896
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,290
the black turtle as our totem.

897
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,710
If we really punish him,

898
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,360
we'll become

899
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,760
the laughingstock of the 72 Sects.

900
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,110
So, I'm the bad guy now?

901
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,070
Are you saying we won't punish either of them?

902
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:33,920
Then tell me, what should we do?

903
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,590
Calm down.

904
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,760
Keep your voice down.

905
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,900
You're about to burst my eardrums.

906
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Old Turtle,

907
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,280
let me ask you.

908
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,720
Since Fan Yue

909
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,910
was able to use your turtle shell to enter our Lanling,

910
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,550
can we use the same shell

911
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,980
to find the Bright Moon Palace?

912
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,590
I've sensed it.

913
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,340
Fan Yue has already

914
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,210
destroyed the teleportation turtle shell he gave me.

915
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,870
Now, no one can pass through.

916
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,040
You contacted our enemies

917
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,270
and leaked our techniques.

918
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
What's the use of keeping you?

919
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,760
He's not entirely useless.

920
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,080
Old Turtle's alchemy skills

921
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,880
are considered one of the unique arts of us Eternals.

922
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,940
The elixirs he makes,

923
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,450
if sold to the villages down the mountain,

924
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,930
could bring us some more money.

925
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,800
You want to spare him for just a little money?

926
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,260
A little money?

927
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,480
Senior Jing Lei,

928
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,340
why don't you make some money and show me?

929
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,050
Okay!

930
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,880
Sell it!

931
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,500
Give it to her!

932
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,370
Give it to her!

933
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,110
Give it to her!

934
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,670
-Give it to her!
-Stop it!

935
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,440
Listen to me! Give it to her!

936
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,440
Stop it!

937
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,070
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

938
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,650
Old Turtle,

939
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,960
how about this?

940
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,200
You've been in the sect for years.

941
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,410
You haven't made any significant contributions,

942
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,440
nor have you put in much effort.

943
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,640
You'll be punished

944
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,760
by making 100 more Great Restoration Elixirs every month.

945
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,750
The money from selling them will be used to support the sect.

946
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,850
That's all for now.

947
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,750
100 elixirs?

948
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,640
Doesn't that mean I'll be worked to death?

949
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,960
You're reluctant, aren't you?

950
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,900
In that case,

951
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,220
we'll have to strip off your turtle shell,

952
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,250
break your spiritual bone,

953
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,070
and then...

954
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,160
Say no more.

955
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,930
I'm willing.

956
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,120
I'm willing.

957
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,710
Go!

958
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,180
Sect Leader,

959
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,600
Bai Shuo can activate the Desireless Stone,

960
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,080
and she doesn't align with the Eternals.

961
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,500
Please give the order,

962
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,240
and I'll immediately lead the troops to the Demon Race

963
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,220
and bring Bai Shuo back.

964
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,440
I also request to go.

965
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,010
Last time, we sent disciples

966
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,970
to investigate the location of the Bright Moon Palace,

967
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,220
but we still haven't made any progress.

968
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,330
This Fan Yue,

969
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,150
relying on the fact that the Eternal Race can't find him,

970
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,370
is too arrogant.

971
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,810
Is Fan Yue only relying on the fact that the Eternal Race can't find him?

972
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,590
There are only a few of us here.

973
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,180
Let's face the truth.

974
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,020
Even if we find the Bright Moon Palace,

975
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,780
we still won't be able to get Bai Shuo back.

976
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,530
-Feng Yu.
-You…

977
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,040
Can you stop always discouraging everyone?

978
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,110
You should encourage us more.

979
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm just telling the truth.

980
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,200
It's better than you guys

981
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,130
deceiving yourselves.

982
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,330
Come on, you...

983
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,270
Alright.

984
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,480
Feng Yu was right.

985
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,270
The key to this matter is not Fan Yue,

986
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,120
but Bai Shuo herself.

987
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,960
Alright, dismiss.

988
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,880
Well, Sect Leader...

989
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,220
Dismiss.

990
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,200
Fine.

991
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,270
What else do you want to say?

992
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,790
I feel like

993
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,230
you're deliberately avoiding

994
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,170
bringing back Bai Shuo and the Desireless Stone.

995
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,850
I, Jin Yao, the 68th Sect Leader of Lanling,

996
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,720
am here to respectfully hear the ancestral teachings of the sect.

997
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,830
Lanling Sect Leader, listen to the order.

998
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,880
The Desireless Stone will be awakened by a human girl.

999
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,990
She is the only one in this world who can activate the divine stone.

1000
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,550
If she appears,

1001
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,930
Lanling must assist her in activating the Desireless Stone.

1002
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,330
This divine decree

1003
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,750
is known only

1004
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,290
to the Sect Leaders of Lanling.

1005
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,670
I will obey the divine decree.

1006
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,800
The ancestral teachings of Lanling

1007
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,550
have been passed down for tens of thousands of years.

1008
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,840
We have been waiting for the human girl

1009
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,940
who can activate the Desireless Stone.

1010
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,440
Now that

1011
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,340
Bai Shuo can awaken the Desireless Stone,

1012
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:31,110
she must be the fated one

1013
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,880
in the divine decree.

1014
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,270
Isn't this Wutong Heart Flame?

1015
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,660
Could the next Contemplation appear in Yi City?

1016
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,310
Wutong Heart Flame?

1017
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,530
Yi City?

1018
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,620
Wutong Heart Flame only appears in Yi City.

1019
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:48,820
And Yi City

1020
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,590
is where the Yi Clan lives.

1021
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,820
Yi Clan?

1022
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,330
I've never heard of it.

1023
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,340
Yi Clan is naturally strong,

1024
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,300
with incredible strength.

1025
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,470
However, due to their limited bloodline,

1026
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,620
their cultivation is mediocre.

1027
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,410
No matter how hard they try,

1028
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,530
they can only cultivate the lowest-level magic.

1029
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,250
They have always been discriminated against by the Eternals and demons,

1030
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,950
so they live far away in Yi City.

1031
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,960
Then what are we waiting for?

1032
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,900
Let's depart immediately.

1033
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,340
Yi City

1034
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,390
is a moving city in the desert,

1035
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,810
with its location constantly shifting.

1036
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,150
It is usually invisible and impossible to find.

1037
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,680
It only opens during the annual

1038
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,750
Wutong Martial Arts Contest,

1039
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,520
and only on that day

1040
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,870
can everyone know its exact location.

1041
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,060
So mysterious?

1042
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,130
What is Wutong Martial Arts Contest?

1043
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,230
A thousand years ago, the Eternal Race and Demon Race

1044
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,260
fought endlessly, battling over territories with heavy casualties.

1045
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,680
So, the Eternal Lord and Demon King at the time

1046
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,630
proposed that the two races

1047
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,820
hold an annual martial arts contest to settle their territorial disputes.

1048
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,960
The King of Yi,

1049
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,620
wanting to reconcile with the Eternals and demons,

1050
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,690
agreed to host the contest in Yi City,

1051
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,590
with three spirit pills made from Wutong Heart Flame

1052
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,940
as the prize for the winner.

1053
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,930
Wutong Spirit Pill

1054
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,510
is an extremely pure and sacred treasure.

1055
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,320
Those who use it

1056
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,570
can greatly increase their spiritual power

1057
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
and improve their cultivation.

1058
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,810
In the Desireless Stone, I foresaw

1059
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,840
many disciples from both the Eternal Race and Demon Race gathering in Yi City.

1060
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,340
It seems they are preparing for the second Contemplation.

1061
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,360
We not only need to enter Yi City,

1062
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,790
but we also have to hold the Wutong Martial Arts Contest,

1063
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,140
allowing disciples from both races

1064
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,640
to enter the city as well.

1065
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,370
It has been seven years since Yi City last held the Wutong Martial Arts Contest.

1066
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,120
Why has it suddenly stopped?

1067
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,480
Could something have happened in Yi City?

1068
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,310
Why do you have so many questions?

1069
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,730
I'm not only doing this for myself;

1070
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,140
it's also to help your Master.

1071
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,820
Are you still going to keep things from me?

1072
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,960
No one is keeping anything.

1073
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,160
No one knows why Yi City is closed,

1074
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,570
nor does anyone know

1075
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,560
where Yi City is now.

1076
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,970
You just said

1077
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,600
Yi City is a moving city in the desert?

1078
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,420
That's right.

1079
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,560
What if I tell you

1080
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,110
I might know where it is?

1081
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,090
How could you possibly know?

1082
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,770
The Desireless Stone showed me

1083
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,100
a desert

1084
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,450
and a children's rhyme.

1085
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,330
Not everything in this world can be explained

1086
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:45,940
or answered clearly.

1087
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:46,970
I'm doing this

1088
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,720
for my reasons.

1089
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,250
Chong Zhao,

1090
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,840
do you trust me?

1091
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,340
Of course I do.

1092
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,320
But Shuo is with the Demon Race.

1093
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,150
I'm worried about her.

1094
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,300
Don't worry.

1095
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,070
Master Bright Moon

1096
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,810
needs her to activate the Desireless Stone.

1097
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,810
He won't harm her for now.

1098
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,320
All we need to do now

1099
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,400
is wait for the right opportunity.

1100
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,440
Do you understand?

1101
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,400
You seem troubled.

1102
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,100
Is there something else?

1103
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,450
Master,

1104
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,050
I found Qian Yin's tombstone.
