1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,000
[Episode 38]

19
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,360
Jing Yuan, the Demon Lord,

20
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,220
has actually reappeared in the world.

21
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,020
So Fan Yue

22
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,740
actually has the Divine Mantle of the Demon Lord.

23
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,920
Those who hurt her

24
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,120
and want to hurt her

25
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,410
will all die.

26
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,790
No.

27
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,970
You used a self-destructive method to damage the Hidden Heart

28
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,020
and hurt yourself so badly.

29
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,670
You've lost all the power of the Five Contemplations,

30
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,540
and all your meridians are damaged.

31
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,260
You really don't care about your life.

32
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,110
As long as I'm here,

33
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,940
I won't let you

34
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,520
die again.

35
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,380
They say there are no deities left in this world.

36
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,880
But unexpectedly,

37
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,230
the Divine Mantles

38
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,390
of the three Supreme Deities still exist.

39
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,980
And now, the Demon Lord has suddenly returned.

40
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,680
It seems everything has its own fate.

41
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,589
Nothing is absolute.

42
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,940
Indeed.

43
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,720
We tried to bring down Bai Shuo,

44
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,520
but today, it was Bai Shuo who saved us all.

45
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,480
And who could have imagined

46
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,190
that Chong Zhao, the boy we raised ourselves,

47
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,980
has the Divine Mantle of the Hidden Lord?

48
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,210
Although the Hidden Heart was severely damaged by Bai Shuo,

49
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,960
Zhen Yu took it away

50
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,230
along with Chong Zhao.

51
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,330
If the Hidden Lord truly returns,

52
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,960
the Eternal Sects will be in peril,

53
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,470
and so will all living beings.

54
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,090
High Eternals,

55
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,400
are we just going to sit and do nothing?

56
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,230
The Eternals exist to protect the world.

57
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,080
These aren't just empty words.

58
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,230
If Chong Zhao

59
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,020
truly becomes the Hidden Lord,

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,400
we, the four High Eternals of Lanling,

61
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,020
will unite the full strength of the Eternals

62
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:07,930
to kill him.

63
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,060
That's easy for you to say.

64
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,730
That's a deity.

65
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,920
How do we kill him?

66
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,140
If you're so afraid of dying,

67
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,280
you can just

68
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,630
find a cave and hide.

69
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,330
High Eternal Jing Lei, you speak so righteously now,

70
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,650
but Lanling

71
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,780
still owes everyone

72
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,710
an explanation as to what Jin Yao did.

73
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,910
Indeed.

74
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,830
Jin Yao is the sect leader of Lanling,

75
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,690
yet for his own personal gain,

76
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,550
he brutally killed Eternal disciples.

77
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,990
Lanling must give us an explanation.

78
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,920
Otherwise,

79
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,560
how can it continue to be the head of the Eternal Sects?

80
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,470
-Well,
-You...

81
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,630
Lanling will look into

82
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,980
Jin Yao's crimes.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,320
But tell me, are you blaming us

84
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,960
to seek justice for the victimized Eternals

85
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,659
or to become the new head of the Eternals?

86
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,610
Virtue unfit for status invites disaster.

87
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,710
Shouldn't Lanling take responsibility

88
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,860
for what Jin Yao did?

89
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,050
Lanling will not shirk

90
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,710
any responsibility that we should bear.

91
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,620
But don't forget—

92
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,810
when the demons launched a full-scale attack

93
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,520
and the Eternals suffered defeat after defeat,

94
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,060
who was it

95
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,590
that led his disciples back to the battlefield,

96
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,810
turned the tide,

97
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,000
and restored the Eternals'

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,410
prestige and status in front of the demons?

99
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,080
Lanling may have achieved victory in battle,

100
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,780
but being great once doesn't mean you can be great forever.

101
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,660
Still better than those of you

102
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,320
who couldn't even win a fight!

103
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,830
You...

104
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,090
High Eternal Jing Lei,

105
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,760
is Lanling trying to suppress others by force?

106
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,720
You want a duel?

107
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,730
I'll just use one hand.

108
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,610
Is that enough?

109
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,780
Or I won't use either hand!

110
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,490
Enough!

111
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,010
If we're really going to assign blame,

112
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,840
everyone here

113
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,350
should be blamed.

114
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,590
Over the years,

115
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,700
the 72 Sects have each kept to themselves,

116
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,110
maintaining a facade of harmony.

117
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,060
But when it mattered,

118
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,970
everyone just looked out for their own interests.

119
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,230
Every time, it was Lanling that stepped up first.

120
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,210
If we hadn't

121
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,090
only cared about our own survival,

122
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,700
how would Jin Yao

123
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,990
have had so many chances to commit crimes?

124
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,070
That's right.

125
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,640
Bei Chen.

126
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,200
Don't be so disrespectful to your elders.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,240
I may be bold and rude,

128
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,320
but I'm just saying the truth.

129
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,730
Bei Chen is right.

130
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Nan Wan!

131
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,650
Master, if you want to punish me,

132
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,840
I'll accept it.

133
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,870
But there are things I must say today.

134
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,580
We Eternals exist

135
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,360
to protect people and the world.

136
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,120
But at some point,

137
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,310
we became obsessed with fame and fortune,

138
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,800
weighing gains and losses,

139
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,730
taking credit but dodging blame,

140
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,900
and seeking benefits while avoiding risks.

141
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,310
I want to ask,

142
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,780
are these still the Eternal Sects you once pledged yourselves to?

143
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,720
What do you two young men know?

144
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,680
Shut up!

145
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,590
What we know comes from what we've seen.

146
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,520
Back when Zhen Yu wreaked havoc in Ning'an City,

147
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,510
Lanling sent word and asked for our help to fight Cold Spring.

148
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,250
Yet all the sects made excuses to avoid the battle.

149
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,300
Later, during the Wutong Contest,

150
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,350
when Zhen Yu tried to kill Eternals and demons in the Outlanders' City,

151
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,860
we still didn't dare to step in

152
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,980
and let Zhen Yu grow unchecked step by step,

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,920
causing more and more disasters.

154
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,120
Now, Zhen Yu has taken the Hidden Heart

155
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,340
and captured Chong Zhao.

156
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,880
A calamity is coming!

157
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,330
Do you all,

158
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,490
as Eternals,

159
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,300
really believe this is the fault of just one sect?

160
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,620
He has a point.

161
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,450
Indeed.

162
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,790
He's right.

163
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,040
They are right.

164
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,510
If the 72 Sects could work together,

165
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,690
be honest and open with each other,

166
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,270
and move forward hand in hand,

167
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,500
there wouldn't have been such grave mistakes.

168
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,010
The Eternals are one family.

169
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,490
Internal matters are trivial.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The priority right now

171
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,860
is to stop the return of the Hidden Lord.

172
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,390
-Yes. Yes.
-Yes.

173
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,840
-Yes.
-Yes.

174
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,390
You're awake?

175
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,580
Zhen Yu,

176
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,650
what do you want to do?

177
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,150
Haven't you already figured out

178
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,760
what I want to do?

179
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,900
You've known all along that I carry the Divine Mantle of the Hidden Lord.

180
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,030
That's why you made me a demon

181
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,390
and injected the Hidden power into me.

182
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,070
You want to awaken Mo Li.

183
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,000
That's right.

184
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,530
I'm not him!

185
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,720
I'm Chong Zhao,

186
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,960
not that demon!

187
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,890
You're the Hidden Lord.

188
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,200
You've simply

189
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,780
forgotten who you truly are.

190
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,590
Now that the Demon Lord has returned,

191
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,530
once he saves Bai Shuo's life,

192
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,870
he'll undoubtedly find a way to destroy the Hidden Heart.

193
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,490
I must bring back the Hidden Lord

194
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,740
as soon as possible.

195
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,010
The Hidden Heart is damaged.

196
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,130
It's impossible to bring back Mo Li.

197
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,230
Give it up.

198
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,490
Give up?

199
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,840
I've been planning this

200
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,570
for 60,000 years.

201
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,300
I will never give up.

202
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,130
No one in this world can stop me

203
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,960
from bringing him back.

204
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,920
Chong Zhao.

205
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
Xi.

206
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,510
You escaped Cold Spring Palace

207
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,050
in the chaos that day,

208
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,860
but today, you've come back willingly to die.

209
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,340
Good.

210
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,150
I raised you for 10 years. It's time to repay that kindness.

211
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,620
You raised me?

212
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,590
Back then, you deceived me into leaving my family,

213
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,320
turned me into a demon,

214
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,030
and used me as your weapon

215
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,060
for 10 whole years.

216
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,900
How dare you call that kindness?

217
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,040
No one can escape the blame for my father's death.

218
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,060
I deserve to die,

219
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,450
and you

220
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,060
should pay with your life too!

221
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,180
If you want someone to blame,

222
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,720
blame that old turtle.

223
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,940
Three children,

224
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,090
one in the Bai family

225
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,500
and one in the Bai Ze Clan.

226
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,590
You had spiritual energy back then,

227
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,780
while Bai Shuo

228
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,400
seemed utterly ordinary.

229
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,400
Anyone would have believed

230
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,360
you were the one with Xing Yue's Divine Mantle.

231
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,930
If not for the heavenly law that only a Supreme Deity can kill another Supreme Deity,

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,030
I wouldn't have kept you

233
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,180
and Chen Ye by my side.

234
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,180
I was waiting for His Lordship's return

235
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,900
to get rid of both of you.

236
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,210
If I had known this,

237
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,200
I would have killed you both a long time ago

238
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,470
to prevent future trouble.

239
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,010
One wrong step

240
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,340
led to another.

241
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,900
But luckily,

242
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,810
it's not too late to fix everything now.

243
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,180
How dare you hurt her?

244
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,620
I'll kill you!

245
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,420
Today, here,

246
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,120
you won't need to kill me.

247
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,000
You're actually using your own heart to mend the Hidden Heart.

248
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,380
As long as I can bring His Lordship back,

249
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,120
it's all worth it.

250
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,380
It's been 60,000 years.

251
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,700
I'm finally back.

252
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,690
Welcome back, my lord.

253
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,150
You gave your life to bring me back.

254
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,620
Do you regret it?

255
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,400
When nobody knew about me,

256
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,590
I was nothing but

257
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,840
a lonely, small snake,

258
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,970
dying after being attacked by a pack of snakes on South Mountain.

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,690
It was you, my lord, who saved me.

260
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,110
My life was yours

261
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,130
to begin with.

262
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,970
Now that…

263
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,460
I've brought you back,

264
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,070
I

265
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,770
have no regrets.

266
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,630
Rest assured.

267
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,310
Those who killed you

268
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,260
and betrayed me,

269
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,610
I won't let go of any of them!

270
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,000
There were things left unfinished 60,000 years ago.

271
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,070
It's time

272
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,650
to finish them now.

273
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,540
You're Bai Xi,

274
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,080
the elder sister of Xing Yue in this life,

275
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,820
and the one Chong Zhao loves.

276
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,200
The sky looks eerie.

277
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,630
The Hidden Lord has returned.

278
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,120
How could Zhen Yu have repaired

279
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,520
the damaged Hidden Heart so quickly?

280
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,670
A great calamity has come,

281
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,810
and there's no avoiding it.

282
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,080
Since we can't escape,

283
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,440
we have to face it.

284
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,160
Sect Leaders,

285
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,510
please return at once

286
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,730
and protect your disciples and the humans.

287
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,580
Be ready to fight to save the world.

288
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,720
Don't worry, High Eternal.

289
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,320
Though the Eternals have been divided for years,

290
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,760
we know where to stand

291
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,730
when it truly matters.

292
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,570
We'll head back now

293
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,730
and stay ready.

294
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,910
Take care.

295
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,300
You too.

296
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,930
Do you think

297
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,380
we'll survive this catastrophe?

298
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,360
The road ahead is unclear,

299
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,790
but no matter what,

300
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,690
we'll stand firm until the very end.

301
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,910
He's back.

302
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,670
-You're awake.
-You're back.

303
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,780
-Xing Yue.
-Fan Yue.

304
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,130
The Demon Lord,

305
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,100
Jing Yuan?

306
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,040
60,000 years ago,

307
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,180
I used the divine power of the Demon Lord to bind the Hidden Heart.

308
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,640
Today, when the Contemplation Stone was shattered

309
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,830
and the Hidden Heart was damaged,

310
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,540
my divine power returned to me,

311
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,730
so I woke up.

312
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,610
What about Fan Yue?

313
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,870
You hope the one who woke up

314
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,710
was him?

315
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,680
Xi and Chong Zhao

316
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,820
are in danger.

317
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,870
It's too late.

318
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,900
Mo Li has already returned.

319
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,110
Even if the Hidden Lord has come back,

320
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,390
Xi is still there.

321
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,640
I need to save her.

322
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,500
Mo Li and I are evenly matched in power.

323
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,630
We can't defeat each other.

324
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,550
Mo Li knows this as well.

325
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,590
That's why he hasn't made a move

326
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,110
against Bright Moon Palace yet.

327
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,740
But the same

328
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,080
goes for me.

329
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,510
Without the Xing Yue Divine Bow,

330
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,870
we can't kill Mo Li,

331
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,420
destroy the Hidden Heart,

332
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,700
or save anyone.

333
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,300
We can't win,

334
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,320
so we'll just do nothing?

335
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,990
You've met Xiu Yan,

336
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,090
so you should know

337
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,900
if you want to save your sister,

338
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,530
wake Chong Zhao up,

339
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,320
and save this world,

340
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,340
you have to find the Xing Yue Divine Bow first.

341
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,670
It's the only way.

342
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,570
Don't worry too much.

343
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,750
I'm here.

344
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,230
We faced this together 60,000 years ago,

345
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,870
and we'll face it together now.

346
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,760
60,000 years ago, the one by your side

347
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,730
was Xing Yue.

348
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,460
You are Xing Yue.

349
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,570
But I'm Bai Shuo.

350
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,380
Chong Zhao.

351
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,780
You truly love him.

352
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,410
The first thing you do upon waking up is call out his name.

353
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,020
You're not Chong Zhao.

354
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
You can tell right away.

355
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,660
You do know him well.

356
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,610
Where is Chong Zhao?

357
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,040
What have you done to him?

358
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,100
He's still here,

359
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,820
kept in the deepest part of the sea of consciousness.

360
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,760
Let him go!

361
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,020
And if I don't?

362
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,920
Perhaps you don't know this—

363
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,970
this body of his

364
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,790
was created for me to begin with.

365
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,650
It's his honor

366
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,280
that I'm using it now.

367
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,180
As for you,

368
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,310
if you don't want Chong Zhao to completely disappear,

369
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,340
you'd better stay right here.

370
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,600
Why…

371
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,040
why don't you just kill me?

372
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,770
You're Xing Yue's sister.

373
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,040
If I kill you,

374
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,220
she'll be angry.

375
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,100
Remember,

376
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,980
I don't like noise.

377
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,290
Don't run around. Don't make a fuss.

378
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,640
Stay quiet.

379
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,680
After 60,000 years,

380
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,750
the auras of Eternals and demons on the Eastern Continent

381
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,720
have grown much stronger.

382
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,770
Mo Li, what are you going to do?

383
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,660
Zhen Yu waited for me for 60,000 years.

384
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,450
Shouldn't someone accompany him in death?

385
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,020
The Eternals and demons will join forces to kill you.

386
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,680
It seems you still don't understand

387
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,400
how powerful a deity is.

388
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,920
To Eternals and demons, humans are nothing

389
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,350
more than insignificant ants.

390
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,250
And to me, Eternals and demons

391
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,530
are just insignificant ants too.

392
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,550
Even if you don't fear Eternals and demons,

393
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,220
the Demon Lord has returned,

394
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,400
and he won't let you

395
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,830
get anything you want.

396
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,460
Jing Yuan's divine power originates from the Purple Moon,

397
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,540
and Xing Yue's divine power originates from the stars.

398
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,390
Do you know why my divine power originates from

399
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,170
this ancient mirror?

400
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,660
The Purple Moon and the stars illuminate the world,

401
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,930
seemingly vast and far-reaching.

402
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,830
This Divine Mirror, the size of a plate,

403
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,300
seems too small.

404
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,670
But that's far from the truth.

405
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,060
The Heavenly Divine Mirror

406
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,870
reflects the whole world.

407
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,360
In terms of vastness,

408
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,250
there is a whole world in the Divine Mirror.

409
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,000
That's truly vastness!

410
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,180
With the power of the entire world as my source,

411
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,700
what do I have to fear?

412
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,110
As long as I absorb enough power from the Eternals and demons,

413
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,490
no one will be able to stop me!

414
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,470
Stop!

415
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,210
Do you really think you can

416
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,670
break the restraints of the Hidden Race's Supreme Deity?

417
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,960
If you're so powerful,

418
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,740
why do you bother imprisoning me here?

419
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,330
You've trapped me here

420
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,240
because you can't kill me either.

421
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,150
After all, this body belonged to me,

422
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,530
and you've just borrowed it to return.

423
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,250
If you kill me,

424
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,580
you'll hurt yourself.

425
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,690
You're too noisy.

426
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,280
Much quieter now.

427
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,000
Tian Huo,

428
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,180
you've finally returned.

429
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:58,900
He...

430
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,000
I've already heard.

431
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,540
Other demons told me.

432
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,960
The Demon Lord, Jing Yuan,

433
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,330
has returned.

434
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,760
During this trip,

435
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,230
I uncovered some things.

436
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,850
I searched all the sects and clans

437
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,780
of Eternals, demons, and humans

438
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,880
but found nothing.

439
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,750
In the end, I found a clue in the Eastern Sea.

440
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,710
According to ancient records there,

441
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,490
when the Divine Region collapsed,

442
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,540
several pieces of meteoric iron fell from the sky,

443
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,510
scattering along the shores of the Eastern Sea.

444
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,980
The Eastern Sea… Meteoric iron?

445
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,630
I remember you once said

446
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,380
the Outlander King's Sword was forged by the first King of Outlanders

447
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,520
using meteoric iron found by the Eastern Sea.

448
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,700
That's right.

449
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,090
I returned to the Outlanders' City,

450
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,040
scoured records from 1,000 years ago,

451
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,450
and finally found the original form of the meteoric iron from back then.

452
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:46,790
It seems the Xing Yue Arrow

453
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,470
was already fractured and melted

454
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,230
when it fell from the Divine Region,

455
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,400
losing its original form.

456
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,720
No wonder it remained undiscovered for so long.

457
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,000
So the Outlander King's Sword is the Xing Yue Arrow.

458
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,430
What about the Xing Yue Divine Bow?

459
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,180
Any clues?

460
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,790
Not yet.

461
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:04,850
Report!

462
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,490
Bad news!

463
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,450
The Hidden Lord, Mo Li,

464
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,270
used the Heavenly Divine Mirror to absorb power from countless Eternals and demons.

465
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,770
Lanling issued a proclamation to rally against the Hidden Lord

466
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,880
but was attacked by him instead.

467
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,060
The four High Eternals of Lanling

468
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,360
have been taken to Cold Spring Palace.

469
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,720
It's your first time in Cold Spring Palace, right?

470
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,130
Lanling always boasts about protecting the world

471
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,480
and defending justice against evil.

472
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,480
Yet Cold Spring Palace,

473
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,030
a place steeped in wickedness and cruelty,

474
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,550
has stood untouched by you for all these years.

475
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,690
Instead, you let Chong Zhao become a demon to infiltrate it.

476
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,770
How ridiculous.

477
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,990
It is ridiculous.

478
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,490
The head disciple of Lanling turns out to be the Hidden Lord.

479
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,670
I said before,

480
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,580
if Chong Zhao truly becomes the Hidden Lord,

481
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,170
I'll kill you

482
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,310
even if it costs me my life!

483
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,910
Kill me?

484
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,270
Jing Lei!

485
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,400
-Jing Lei!
-Senior.

486
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,050
I hate fools who overestimate themselves the most.

487
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,980
What you're doing is against Heaven.

488
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,180
If I can't stop you,

489
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,980
someone else will.

490
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,580
Still so delusional

491
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,530
even in the face of death.

492
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,390
Chong Zhao, wake up!

493
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,380
He's your Uncle Jing Lei!

494
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,500
Jing Lei!

495
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,070
Senior!

496
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,720
Jing Lei!

497
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,360
Enough of your fantasies.

498
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,030
I'm not Chong Zhao.

499
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,060
Even if you kill us all,

500
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,100
you still won't be able to kill

501
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,950
Xing Yue or Jing Yuan!

502
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,170
You returned at the same time.

503
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,540
It shows Heaven's constraints on you!

504
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,800
Is that so?

505
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,990
Without the Xing Yue Divine Bow,

506
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,000
they're no threat to me.

507
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,350
I'll show you

508
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,720
how they'll pay the price for everything they did

509
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,270
in the past!

510
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,610
You actually managed to wound me.

511
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,640
It seems you're indeed not ordinary.

512
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,160
I spared your life,

513
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,300
and yet you tried to kill me.

514
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,490
Is this what you and Chong Zhao call true love?

515
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,670
You demon,

516
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,890
you don't deserve to mention his name!

517
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,200
If not for me,

518
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Chong Zhao wouldn't even exist in this world.

519
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,700
You should thank me

520
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,120
for giving you the chance to meet him,

521
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,420
shouldn't you?

522
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,310
If you're going to kill me, then do it.

523
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,360
Stop disgusting me with Chong Zhao's face.

524
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,920
He's nothing like you.

525
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,580
He's loyal and righteous,

526
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,490
unlike you—

527
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,690
your hands are stained with the blood of your fellow disciples!

528
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,890
Fellow disciples?

529
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,150
The people of Lanling are nothing to me.

530
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,910
Have you killed fewer Eternals than I have?

531
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,790
Do you really think

532
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,950
just because you want to be kind,

533
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,400
your bloody past can be erased

534
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,880
and your sins can be forgiven?

535
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,840
Lady Fu Ling.

536
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,690
Do you remember what you said to Chong Zhao

537
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,740
when you brought him to Cold Spring Palace?

538
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,750
You said you were in hell

539
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,110
and wanted him to stay with you.

540
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,450
You've gotten your wish now.

541
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,770
And I can promise you this—

542
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,180
you and Chong Zhao will stay in hell forever,

543
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,920
never to see the light of day.

544
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,600
You know everything

545
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,130
about Chong Zhao?

546
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,180
Yes.

547
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,230
And it only confirms that he's a loser.

548
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,050
He talks endlessly about justice,

549
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,960
but he doesn't understand

550
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,910
that evil is the true nature of this world.

551
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,320
Go ahead, keep trying to kill me,

552
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,300
if you think you can succeed.

553
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,190
You're keeping someone

554
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,180
who wants to kill you by your side.

555
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,000
Are you really that confident,

556
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,420
or do you have some ulterior motive?

557
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,520
The unfinished business from 60,000 years ago

558
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,630
isn't just ruling the world.

559
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,470
It's also marrying Xing Yue.

560
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,050
In this whole world,

561
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,280
you

562
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,970
are the perfect witness for this union,

563
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,540
aren't you?

564
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,170
Are you planning to ruin your hands

565
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,990
before you shoot Mo Li?

566
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,640
It's just a small injury.

567
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,980
I can handle it myself.

568
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,570
When I learned martial arts from my father,

569
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,110
among all martial skills,

570
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,360
I was never really interested in archery

571
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,550
and hardly practiced it growing up.

572
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,160
Who would've thought that one day,

573
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,290
I'd have to rely on a Divine Bow to kill my enemy?

574
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,630
I just want to hone my archery

575
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,890
before we find the Divine Bow.

576
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,470
The Bow and you are in perfect harmony.

577
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,780
Where the heart points,

578
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,230
the arrow will follow.

579
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,110
You don't need practice to hit your mark every time.

580
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,860
Someone once told me,

581
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,850
it's not easy to defeat the strong

582
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,230
when you're weak.

583
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,650
Besides learning the tricks,

584
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,420
you also need relentless training.

585
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,510
I'm not gifted,

586
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,570
and now I've lost the power of the Five Contemplations.

587
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,970
To be safe,

588
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,520
it's better to practice hard.

589
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,660
Practice is fine,

590
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,850
but don't push yourself too hard.

591
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,960
Thank you.

592
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,720
Why are you thanking me all of a sudden?

593
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,790
10 years ago, on the night of the Lantern Festival,

594
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,930
you saved Xi and me.

595
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,940
I've spent the last 10 years seeking immortality,

596
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,600
just so I could repay you.

597
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,190
There's no need for thanks

598
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,540
and even less need for repayment.

599
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,670
It's almost laughable.

600
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,860
When I saved you that night,

601
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,970
I didn't know you carried Xing Yue's Divine Mantle.

602
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,960
Not all immortals pity mortals.

603
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,790
You're lucky

604
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,600
to have eyes resembling hers.

605
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,930
But if I had recognized you that day,

606
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,200
perhaps things wouldn't have...

607
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,720
Actually, I've always wondered something.

608
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:11,050
60,000 years ago, the Divine Region collapsed,

609
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,389
and all deities died.

610
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,190
So why were you still in this world 10 years ago?

611
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,770
My physical body was indeed destroyed

612
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,320
60,000 years ago,

613
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,440
but the Divine Mantles of the three Supreme Deities never perish.

614
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,710
I was so desperate to find Xing Yue

615
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,739
that I forcibly tore apart my Divine Mantle.

616
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,030
Half of it went to Bai Ze,

617
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,909
and the other half stayed in the world, continuing the search,

618
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,949
until the 15-year-old Fan Yue accidentally fell off a cliff,

619
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,500
forcing the two halves of my Divine Mantle to reunite.

620
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,020
Only then did I enter his body,

621
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,650
but the shock of the reunion caused me to lose my memory.

622
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,320
You tore apart your Divine Mantle,

623
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,440
wandered the world alone,

624
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,489
and searched for her like that

625
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,580
for 60,000 years?

626
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,429
Her?

627
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,190
Why not say I was searching for you?

628
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,130
You are her.

629
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,270
Perhaps you haven't noticed it.

630
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,460
Other than the moment I awoke, when you called me Xing Yue,

631
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,450
you haven't called me my name since.

632
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,910
Is it because you think it's unnecessary,

633
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,270
because you're avoiding it,

634
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,080
or because…

635
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,090
you yourself haven't figured out

636
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,790
who I am now?

637
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,440
You're right.

638
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,840
I can't let myself collapse

639
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,340
before I defeat the Hidden Lord.

640
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,100
I'm going back.

641
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,550
You should get some rest too.

642
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,630
Under the stars tonight,

643
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,880
with friends and loved ones by our side,

644
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,070
and the ten thousand miles of the Polar Region as our witness,

645
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Fan Yue,

646
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,510
will you marry me?

647
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,970
Side by side in the heavens;

648
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,420
bound together on earth.

649
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,110
Two hearts as one,

650
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,120
unchanging for all eternity.

651
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,570
You've accepted my flowers,

652
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,920
so you're mine now.

653
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,750
Okay.

654
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,750
Fan Yue,

655
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,150
you share the same Divine Mantle,

656
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,690
the same body,

657
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,330
and the same face.

658
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,060
But does that really make him you?

659
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
Master has returned.

660
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,190
You should be happy.

661
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:44,790
But you seem…

662
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,810
Are you struggling with

663
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,760
whether to see him as Master

664
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,940
or the Demon Lord?

665
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,110
What about you?

666
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,450
To me, Master just has

667
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,190
the memories of the Demon Lord now.

668
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,000
He's just stronger

669
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,580
and colder.

670
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,570
In my eyes,

671
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,510
he's both my master and the Demon Lord.

672
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:07,920
But this version of him

673
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,900
means different things to me than to you.

674
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,650
I thought I could do it.

675
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,700
I thought I could see him as Fan Yue.

676
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,290
But it turns out that some feelings

677
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,650
just can't coexist.

678
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,490
I have the Divine Mantle of Xing Yue,

679
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,250
and I've learned Xing Yue's life story

680
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,030
in the Lunar Hidden Sea.

681
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,770
But in the end, I am Bai Shuo,

682
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,400
not Xing Yue.

683
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,440
I didn't spend those long centuries

684
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,620
with Jing Yuan in the Divine Region,

685
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,880
nor did I share with him

686
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,050
the joy and sorrow of those days

687
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,880
and all those life-and-death situations.

688
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,260
The one who lived through everything with me

689
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,780
and faced death with me

690
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,430
was Fan Yue.

691
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,090
Then,

692
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,480
what are you going to do?

693
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,850
He's the Demon Lord,

694
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,390
but he's also Master.

695
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,460
I don't know.

696
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,950
Tian Huo,

697
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,060
can you leave me alone for a while?

698
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,150
Looking at the stars in the night sky,

699
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,140
what do you feel?

700
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,260
The stars shine,

701
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,570
illuminating the world

702
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,970
and guiding the people.

703
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,290
What you see is a sky full of stars,

704
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,600
but to me,

705
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,910
every single star in the sky

706
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,990
is a reflection of Xing Yue.

707
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,350
Bai Shuo was right.

708
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,030
I've been deliberately avoiding it

709
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,830
because I really,

710
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,290
really want to see her as Xing Yue.

711
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,260
So,

712
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,530
you're finally admitting it.

713
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,300
Bai Shuo is Bai Shuo,

714
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,940
and Xing Yue is Xing Yue.

715
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,640
Actually, I know everything between you and Bai Shuo;

716
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,490
just like in the Outlanders' City,

717
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,110
you knew everything between Mu and Bai Shuo.

718
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,050
Why bring up Mu again?

719
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,510
I just think the situations are similar.

720
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,850
It seems you really don't like him.

721
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,060
Just like you don't like me.

722
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,520
We have the same Divine Mantle.

723
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,760
I can feel it.

724
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,430
You're angry with me too.

725
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,300
Of course I am.

726
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,140
Without you,

727
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,880
she wouldn't have to make a choice.

728
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,340
But if you didn't exist,

729
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,440
Bai Shuo might already be dead,

730
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,740
my Divine Mantle wouldn't have awakened,

731
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,220
and this reunion wouldn't have been possible.

732
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,670
You don't truly hate Mu,

733
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,160
and I don't see you as an enemy either.

734
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,560
On the contrary, I should thank you.

735
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,690
Fan Yue,

736
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,370
thank you for existing.

737
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,510
Thank you for protecting her all this time.

738
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,970
I protect her because I love her.

739
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,190
I don't need your thanks.

740
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,690
Yes,

741
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,180
you love Bai Shuo,

742
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,230
and I love Xing Yue.

743
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,230
Only when the right people meet at the right time

744
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,150
can they be together forever.

745
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,450
Once things are out of alignment,

746
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,190
everything falls apart.

747
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,740
I spent 60,000 years

748
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,150
searching for Xing Yue,

749
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,330
but only now do I realize that

750
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,100
Xing Yue, the Night Lord,

751
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,260
is long gone.

752
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,360
Then Jing Yuan, the Demon Lord,

753
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,290
has no reason to stay in this world.

754
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,800
Have you thought it through?

755
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,310
Being able to see her one last time,

756
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,770
I'm content.

757
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,130
Perhaps my awakening

758
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,900
was meant to bring you two together after 60,000 years.

759
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,860
I'll leave my power to you

760
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,150
and return Fan Yue to Bai Shuo.

761
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,230
From now on, the Demon Lord Jing Yuan will no longer exist in this world.

762
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,390
There will only be the Demon Lord Fan Yue.

763
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,080
Promise me,

764
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,950
keep her safe.

765
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,150
Don't let the regrets between Xing Yue and me

766
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,340
fall upon you and Bai Shuo.

767
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,500
The stars are so beautiful tonight.

768
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,570
Xing Yue,

769
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,600
I'm coming to find you.

770
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,570
Bai Shuo.

771
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,380
♫The person standing far away♫

772
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,430
♫Don't be afraid♫

773
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:44,170
♫The stars will guide you to me♫

774
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:51,650
♫Walk towards me♫

775
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,540
♫My heart feels so...♫

776
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,870
♫It's pounding♫

777
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,830
Shuo.

778
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,870
You're back.

779
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,010
Yes.

780
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,200
I'm back.

781
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:15,040
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

782
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,990
♫You are my distant call♫

783
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:27,020
♫You are my first and last♫

784
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,640
♫My heart is trembling for you♫

785
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,000
♫In this moment where we embrace each other♫

786
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:41,740
♫Let's never let go♫

787
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,510
You're finally back.

788
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,540
What about him?

789
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:50,880
He's gone.

790
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,980
He's headed to the starry sky

791
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,900
to search for the one he loves.

792
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,630
Will he find Xing Yue?

793
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,610
Among the eternal, dazzling stars,

794
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,480
none of them are her,

795
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,210
yet all of them are her.

796
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,630
He'll surely find his Xing Yue

797
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,100
in another way.

798
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:24,430
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

799
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:30,670
♫You are the light I yearn for♫

800
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:35,780
♫You are my determined way home♫

801
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:41,760
♫Let this moment stay forever♫

802
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,100
♫I'm hugging you in the crowd♫
