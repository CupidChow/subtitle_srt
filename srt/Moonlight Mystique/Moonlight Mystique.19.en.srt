so shall we.

00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

Eternals and demons walk different paths.

You and she are ultimately different.

00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,560
I thought...

35
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,380
I thought I'd never see you again.

I'm so glad you're okay.

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,100

You aren't trapped?

You can't fool me with these tricks.

41
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,460
Chang Mei really underestimated me.

42
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,010
Master.

43
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,690
What's going on?

44
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,760
Why is my spiritual power so weak?

45
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,500
Chang Mei's curse is powerful.

46
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,370
You've temporarily lost all your spiritual power.

47
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,680
Rest here for a while.

48
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,980
Chang Mei sent you to stall me

49
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,820
to deal with Bai Shuo, right?

50
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,120
It's easy for me to kill you,

51
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,480
but Bai Shuo told me

52
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,640
you're innocent.

53
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,820
Chang Wu,

54
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,330
instead of killing us,

55
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,760
wouldn't you rather know

56
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,830
why Qi turned into a man-eating tree?

57
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,940
Don't you want to know what secrets he had

58
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,030
with Chang Mei back then?

59
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,440
How do you know that?

60
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,190
Come with me to the Emotion Tree,

61
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,120
and you'll understand.

62
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,620
Let's go.

63
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,050

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,030

-without assistance…
-Don't worry.

66
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,890
I know what to do.

67
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,640
Just take care of yourself.

He's also the first to find out that something happened to you.

Some people are too important to miss,

73
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,370
like Qi and Wu,

74
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,980

You're not the only one with schemes.

91
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,240
I can talk terms with your people.

92
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,040
For example, the truth behind Qi's death.

93
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,770
Elder Chang Wu must want to know about it.

94
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,740
Master Chang.

95
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,630
I've done what you asked.

96
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,140
Can you now tell me

97
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,050
how Qi died

98
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,790
and where the Weak Water Stone is?

99
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,850
Are you

100
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,230
suspecting me?

101
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,870
I'm not suspecting you.

102
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,340
I just want the truth.

103
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,070
That day, Elder Chang Wu said,

104
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,640
since I could make Rong Xian's resentment fade,

105
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,150
I could also help Qi

106
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,870
let go of his obsession.

107
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Rong Xian's resentment was from regret.

108
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,430
He regretted killing his wife and child,

109
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,990
so he couldn't forgive himself even in death.

110
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,620
So what was

111
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,940
Qi's obsession?

112
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,380
If he had died for the Fox Clan willingly,

113
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,090
why would he have lingered here for a thousand years?

114
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,440
Unless…

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,660
he was killed by someone.

116
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,820
Like, perhaps, you.

117
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,659
Nonsense!

118
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,720
Master!

119
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,170
Master.

120
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,810
At this point,

121
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,510
there's no need to keep hiding it.

122
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,410
Is what Ms. Bai said true?

123
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,670
How did my brother die?

124
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,300
Qi and I were deeply in love.

125
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,190
How would I have killed him?

126
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,610
You wouldn't,

127
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,570
but love would.

128
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,740
Qi knew very well about your bond

129
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,340
with Ling Long.

130
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,910
When you chose to steal

131
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,380
the Weak Water Stone for Mu Jiu,

132
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,320
you had already made your choice.

133
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,520
It wasn't you who killed Qi,

134
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,330
but his love for you.

135
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,590
Ling Long died,

136
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,370
but the spiritual embryo in her didn't.

137
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,350
It's already strange that this child survived.

138
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,270
How could you steal the Weak Water Stone

139
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,560
to make up for his deficiencies?

140
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,570
The way you love him is wrong.

141
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,090
The one who's wrong is Rong Xian,

142
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,540
not me.

143
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,460
Jiu is Ling Long's only child.

144
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,150
For 200 years, he's remained a baby.

145
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,430
Without the power of the Weak Water Stone,

146
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,480
he will die.

147
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,840
But you can't save him at the cost of everyone else's life.

148
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,620
You're the chief of the Fox Clan.

149
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,270
But I'm Ling Long's sister first.

150
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,670
Ling Long used all her spiritual power

151
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,340
to give birth to Jiu.

152
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,950
I have to protect him.

153
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,840
As for Jingyou Mountain

154
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,510
and the Fox Clan,

155
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,120
I don't care about them now.

156
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,720
If it weren't for Ling Long

157
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,490
to rest in peace,

158
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,150
I wouldn't want to face those people

159
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,720
who spent all their time backstabbing

160
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,360
and cursing her behind her back.

161
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,410
Wu.

162
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,340
Just answer me this:

163
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,830
Will you help me

164
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,500
or the Fox Clan?

165
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,000
Of course I'll help you.

166
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,430
Good.

167
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,460
Then keep the Weak Water Stone's matter

168
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,110
a secret for me.

169
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,440
No one can find out

170
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,660
that I've placed it inside Jiu's body.

171
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,060
How can that be kept a secret?

172
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,300
In a few days,

173
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,940
the Emotion Tree will wither completely.

174
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,060
By then,

175
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,920
the whole clan will know,

176
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,340
and everyone

177
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,300
will hate you for what you've done.

178
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,250
I don't care, and I'm not afraid.

179
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,010
Jiu is my life.

180
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,260
He's the only reason why I'm still alive.

181
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,950
Whoever tries to harm him,

182
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,540
I won't let them off.

183
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,800
The Weak Water Stone is lost.

184
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,030
The Fox Clan won't let him go.

185
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,660
Jiu is so young.

186
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,000
Do you want him to hide his identity

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,390
and live in hiding for the rest of his life?

188
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,970
Wu.

189
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,750
Listen to me.

190
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,010
There must be another way

191
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,430
to save Jiu.

192
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,450
Return the Stone.

193
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,950
If you really put the Emotion Tree

194
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,530
and the whole clan in danger,

195
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,210
you'll definitely regret it one day.

196
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,030
I got it.

197
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,080
In the end, you're just unwilling to help me.

198
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,080
It's not like that.

199
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,480
I should have known!

200
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,480
Love is the most unreliable thing

201
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,910
in this world.

202
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,570
Ling Long was foolish.

203
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,800
I was even more foolish.

204
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,730
I shouldn't have trusted you!

205
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,490
Wu.

206
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,720
Be reasonable!

207
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,830
Saving Jiu is a personal matter.

208
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,850
You're now the chief.

209
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,220
You can't only think of yourself!

210
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,550
Ling Long made this mistake.

211
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,850
Why do you have to repeat it?

212
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,670
Fine.

213
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,840
You're upright, kind,

214
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,200
and devoted to Jingyou Mountain.

215
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,440
Ling Long and I are selfish

216
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,950
and unfit to be the chief.

217
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,500
You're no different from those people!

218
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,630
Go away!

219
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:54,550
Wu.

220
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,410
If you insist on taking Jiu's life,

221
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,130
then kill me along with him!

222
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,950
Wu,

223
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,060
stop this nonsense!

224
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,160
Wu.

225
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,810
Wu.

226
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,240
You know I love you.

227
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,550
How could I kill you?

228
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,050
If you doubt my love for you too,

229
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,910
fine,

230
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,760
I'll prove it to you.

231
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,100
It's my fault that he died.

232
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,640
If I hadn't argued with him that day

233
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,480
or said those things to him,

234
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,100
Qi wouldn't have died.

235
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,550
Love is a knife that kills.

236
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,400
It's the most hurtful thing in the world.

237
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,160
If I hadn't argued with him that day,

238
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,800
he wouldn't have done such a foolish thing.

239
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:57,350
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

240
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,280
Qi!

241
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:06,370
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

242
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:05,900
Qi...

243
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,020
Wu,

244
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,220
my biggest regret

245
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:16,300
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

246
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,790
is never seeing you wear that wedding dress.

247
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,650
Don't do anything foolish.

248
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,500
Saving Jiu is my own decision.

249
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,180
It's not your burden to bear!

250
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:22,540
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫

251
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,130
Since I was born,

252
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,760
I've been your guard.

253
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,070
My only wish in life has always been

254
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,600
for you to be happy.

255
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,500
I love you

256
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,550
more than my life, more than anything.

257
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,550
I care for you not one bit less than you did for Ling Long.

258
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,640
Since she died,

259
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,180
you haven't smiled once.

260
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,100
My heart

261
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,550
died along with yours long ago.

262
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,750
No, no.

263
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,960
To save Jiu,

264
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,290
you'll endanger the Fox Clan.

265
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,400
But I'll get whatever

266
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,620
you want for you,

267
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,100
no matter the cost.

268
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,060
Qi!

269
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:52,880
Qi!

270
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,550
Qi!

271
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,850
Qi!

272
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,300
No.

273
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,680
No!

274
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,230
♫The flowers flew away♫

275
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,760
♫My tears are streaming down like rain♫

276
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:27,640
♫Light my heart's lamp, cast away attachments, and ask the world♫

277
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:34,380
♫On the vast sea, you and I♫

278
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,130
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

279
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,790
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

280
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,610
♫My love brought tears♫

281
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,610
♫Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completeness♫

282
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,540
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

283
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,970
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

284
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,200
♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

285
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,340
♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

286
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,430
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

287
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,420
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

288
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,700
♫The daylight burns through, and the stars shine bright♫

289
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,610
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

290
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,160
So my brother

291
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,790
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

292
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,470
died for you.

293
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,030
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

294
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,470
Then why did he resent it?

295
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,910
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

296
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,960
Why did he become a Tree Spirit

297
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,500
♫To protect the world for eternity♫

298
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,010
and linger here for so many years?

299
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,860
That shadow

300
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,480
is not Qi's resentment.

301
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,520
It's Wu's.

302
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,570
If I'm not mistaken,

303
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,650
after Qi died,

304
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,530
Wu has been racked with guilt.

305
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,890
All you think about is that you killed Qi.

306
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,360
You think he should hate you

307
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,190
and haunt this place, unwilling to leave.

308
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,960
Because of your guilt,

309
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,030
you come here every day,

310
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,290
telling Qi how much you miss him.

311
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,250
What you can't let go of has become resentment.

312
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,220
That resentment has lingered on the Emotion Tree,

313
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,910
making it a tree that eats people.

314
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,340
I never thought

315
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,590
the resentment on the Tree was from Chang Mei's guilt.

316
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,280
If she hadn't felt guilty,

317
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,380
perhaps this tree wouldn't have eaten people.

318
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,990
Young Lord.

319
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,710
Bad bug!

320
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,360
Come chase me!

321
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,230
Isn't it fun?

322
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,350
This fabric looks so nice for clothes.

323
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,650
I think it'd make a great cloak too.

324
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,750
Yeah, very beautiful.

325
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,840
-Am I fast?
-Yes!

326
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Faster!

327
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,240
Look.

328
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,630
What a beautiful lantern.

329
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,270
Your handwriting is terrible.

330
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,890
Your handwriting is worse!

331
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,380
Young Lord.

332
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,540
Young Lord, what's wrong?

333
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,050
Young Lord, are you okay?

334
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:08,920
I'm fine.

335
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,660
I think

336
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,599
I just saw something.

337
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,869
What did you see?

338
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,710
It happened too fast.

339
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,970
I couldn't see clearly.

340
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,079
Didn't I tell you to stay at Cold Spring Palace?

341
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,450
Why are you here?

342
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,720
You left me all alone at Cold Spring Palace.

343
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,420
Chen Ye kept bullying me.

344
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,420
I was worried about you, so I sneaked out.

345
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,359
Put the insect away.

346
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,270
Chong Zhao will be in danger.

347
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,200
Let's go find him.

348
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,110
Young Lord,

349
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,740
why do you still care about Chong Zhao?

350
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,090
He only cares for Bai Shuo

351
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,920
and has no idea what deal you made

352
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,790
with Grand Master to help him. You...

353
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,610
Enough!

354
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,510
Since I was young,

355
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,770
I've never lived life the way I wanted.

356
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,890
Now that I've made my choice,

357
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,740
I won't regret it.

358
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,190
Master Chang.

359
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,900
You can't bring back the dead.

360
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,980
Back then, you had no choice.

361
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,240
Qi never blamed Wu.

362
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,210
Qi died

363
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,270
so you could have a better life.

364
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,360
What he wanted was to help you.

365
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,200
If you turn his help

366
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,000
into a cage that traps you,

367
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,900
his sacrifice wouldn't have been worth it.

368
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,110
With just a few words about him

369
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,480
in Rong Xian's illusion,

370
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,440
you think you understand what he truly felt?

371
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,320
Qi's heart was filled with love,

372
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,750
but it was all wrongly placed on me.

373
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,540
He must hate

374
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,290
and resent me.

375
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,730
I have never met the real Qi,

376
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,070
but I know

377
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,070
any couple who truly loves each other

378
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,510
and is willing to protect each other with their lives

379
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,050
won't resent the sacrifices made.

380
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,820
Love should not be torment

381
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,760
but mutual salvation

382
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,330
and fulfillment.

383
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,750
Master.

384
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,680
Ms. Bai is right.

385
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,070
My brother did for you

386
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,920
what you plan to do for Mu Jiu.

387
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,850
Now,

388
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,110
to keep the secret

389
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,690
that the Weak Water Stone is in Young Master,

390
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,690
you're also planning to sacrifice yourself to nourish the Emotion Tree

391
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,890
so he can live better.

392
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,050
It's been 1,000 years.

393
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,250
I'm tired of living.

394
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,390
When Ling Long was alive,

395
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,000
life was carefree.

396
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,120
After she died,

397
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,810
everything in Jingyou Mountain changed.

398
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,320
I still remember,

399
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,620
when I first held Jiu

400
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,520
as a baby,

401
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,220
I just wanted to protect him

402
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,510
and give him everything that should have belonged to Ling Long.

403
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,830
That's why you want Mu Jiu

404
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,820
to become the chief

405
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,120
on Ling Long's death anniversary?

406
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,950
Yes.

407
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,980
The Fox Clan owes Ling Long that,

408
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,230
so it should be returned to Mu Jiu.

409
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,010
But I...

410
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,400
I protected Mu Jiu,

411
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,810
but I failed Qi.

412
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,330
Even if he didn't resent me,

413
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,000
I hate myself.

414
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,410
I shouldn't still be alive.

415
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,950
But what my brother wished for

416
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,820
was for you to live.

417
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,160
Master.

418
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,290
No.

419
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,650
Sister-in-law.

420
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,970
Young Master is too young

421
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,530
to bear such heavy responsibility.

422
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,140
If you die like this,

423
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,140
have you thought about what he'll do after?

424
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,360
This thousand-year tragedy

425
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,610
should have ended long ago.

426
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,680
Ms. Bai once said,

427
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,770
death isn't scary.

428
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,090
What's scary is that the last person

429
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,590
who remembers you also passes away.

430
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,480
I never knew the truth,

431
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,170
and now I don't have the courage

432
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,920
to mourn over another person.

433
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,960
So Master,

434
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,120
please remember us.

435
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,700
Elder Chang Wu, no!

436
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,110
Ba!

437
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,680
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

438
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,980
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

439
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,830
♫My love brought tears♫

440
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,800
♫Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completeness♫

441
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,050
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

442
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,680
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

443
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,510
♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

444
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,860
♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

445
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,800
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

446
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,700
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

447
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,080
♫The daylight burns through, and the stars shine bright♫

448
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,970
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

449
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,080
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

450
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,360
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

451
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,150
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

452
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,800
♫To protect the world for eternity♫

453
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,090
Ba has suffered for years for his brother.

454
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,640
Now, he's used his death

455
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,600
to hide the secret of Mu Jiu's identity.

456
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,070
Is love

457
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,040
something that brings happiness,

458
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,490
or something that causes endless torment?

459
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,420
The two generations of the Fox Clan

460
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,810
both suffered a lot for love.

461
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,700
What's happened in Jingyou Mountain

462
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,880
feels like a heavy weight on my chest,

463
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,420
making me upset.

464
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,810
Tell me.

465
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,720
If we hadn't

466
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,680
changed the course of things in the realm of resentment,

467
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,270
would these tragedies still have happened?

468
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,560
If we hadn't,

469
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,860
then Mu Jiu wouldn't even exist.

470
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,430
All cultivation

471
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,150
is a fight against fate.

472
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,810
Even if there's only a slim chance,

473
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,010
we have to take it.

474
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,260
The matter with the Emotion Tree is settled,

475
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,200
but the vision from the Contemplation Stone

476
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,480
hasn't come true.

477
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,110
I'm worried that something else will happen tonight.

478
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,730
There's nothing to worry about.

479
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,200
No matter what happens,

480
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,130
I'll be here.

481
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,410
As you said,

482
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,880
any couple who truly loves each other

483
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,750
and is willing to protect each other with their lives

484
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,080
won't resent the sacrifices made.

485
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,820
Love shouldn't be torment

486
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,240
but mutual salvation

487
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,030
and fulfillment.

488
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,240
What

489
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,900
do you mean?

490
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,670
Playing dumb with me?

491
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,770
I can't be too clever

492
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,530
about certain things

493
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,960
in case it's just all in my mind.

494
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,950
♫If the wind intends to fill the sky with flowers♫

495
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,290
♫The moon's brightness is also the result of stars falling into place♫

496
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,280
♫As the wind stirs, the clouds gather♫

497
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,630
♫As the clouds shift, the moon becomes full♫

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,560
♫Love is the hardest thing to understand♫

499
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:00,890
Shuo.

500
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,960
I...

501
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,370
I didn't mean to hurt you.

502
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,800
♫I'm finally back to where it all started♫

503
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,610
Let him go.

504
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,080
I just want to take you with me.

505
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,050
Fan Yue is just using you.

506
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,510
Staying by his side will only put you in danger!

507
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:17,040
♫All the answers are already explained♫

508
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,970
Aren't you the one

509
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,080
putting me in danger now?

00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,760
♫I'll owe you all of my life♫

511
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,940
You've already allied yourself with Cold Spring Palace.

512
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,490
You may even be one of them now.

513
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,760
♫But we're destined to part♫

514
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,000
As much as I don't want to believe it,

515
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,400
the truth is right in front of me.

516
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:31,500
♫How can I downplay this?♫

517
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,290
You're with the people who killed my father.

518
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,730
How can you say

519
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,070
you still care for me?

520
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,320
♫When you engrave your love into my heart♫

521
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,790
Chong Zhao,

522
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,290
there's so much

523
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,630
I don't want to ask

524
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,810
♫When my star falls only for you♫

525
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,330
because I want to preserve the last bit of our bond.

526
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,000
These past few days,

527
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,190
♫When the heavens fall♫

528
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,790
I've been waiting for an explanation from you,

529
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,630
♫I can still connect with you through the waning moon♫

530
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,160
but you haven't said a word.

531
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,640
You lied to me once

532
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,780
and twice.

533
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,150
It wasn't your fault,

534
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,970
♫When my pain blurs my eyes♫

535
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,800
but if I trust you a third time,

536
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:54,490
♫Out of the countless stars, I see only you♫

537
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,050
that will be my mistake.

538
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,680
Don't come to me again.

539
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:04,030
♫As you turn into a falling star and crash into my heart♫

540
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,920
Let's go.

541
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,680
Shuo.

542
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,410
Let me explain.

543
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,300
Fan Yue,

544
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,440
one day, I will defeat you.

545
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,520
To deal with both Fan Yue and Chang Mei at the same time,

546
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,950
I have to use the Emotion Tree once again

547
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,910
to provoke a fight between the two sides.

548
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,500
The demonic power Grand Master gave me before

549
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,530
comes in handy now.

550
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,470
It's enough to make the Emotion Tree wither again.

551
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,940
We can't keep this deadlock going.

552
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,330
Jingyou Mountain doesn't want to be enemies with Bright Moon Palace.

553
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,670
Lord Cang Shan, do you really want this?

554
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,190
If I step back,

555
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,550
are you going to get Mu Jiu back

556
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,960
and make him the chief?

557
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,370
Elder!

558
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,650
Fu Ling from Cold Spring Palace.

559
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,660
Elder, it's her.

560
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,330
She's the one who injured our people.

561
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,560
L-Lord Cang Shan.

562
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,820
Let's work together

563
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,070
to kill this…

564
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,470
Elder!

565
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,070
Elder! Elder!

566
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
He's dead,

567
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,360
and no one will help Chang Mei hide her secrets.

568
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,830
You're seeking death.

569
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,490
Fu Ling,

570
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,580
what does Cold Spring Palace want?

571
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,330
I can give you a quick death,

572
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,430
but if you fall into Chang Mei's hands,

573
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,870
it won't be that simple.

574
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,640
Why don't you all go take a look at the Emotion Tree?

575
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,540
See what your chief, Chang Mei,

576
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,440
has done in alliance

577
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,310
with Bright Moon Palace.

578
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,950
Nonsense!

579
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,100
Chang Mei.

580
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,920
What is wrong with the Emotion Tree?

581
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,180
Chang Sheng is dead,

582
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,890
and Chang Wu is missing.

583
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,550
What have you and Bright Moon Palace done to the Emotion Tree?

584
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,190
The Emotion Tree's withering

585
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,840
has nothing to do with Bright Moon Palace,

586
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,830
nor with anyone else.

587
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,830
It's all because I failed to protect Jingyou Mountain.

588
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,980
I'm not afraid of death,

589
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,130
but there are a few words I've been holding in

590
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,540
for 1,000 years.

591
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,330
You people

592
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,730
have cultivated for so many years,

593
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,200
but none of you have amounted to anything.

594
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,310
Today, because of a few words from an outsider,

595
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,930
you came to me asking for an explanation,

596
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,710
acting like

597
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,590
you care so much about the Fox Clan.

598
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,240
It has always been me

599
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,160
who has to step in and solve every problem.

600
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,120
It was like this when Ling Long was the Saintess;

601
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,560
it's the same now,

602
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,830
and I'm afraid it'll still be like this in the future!

603
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,770
Ba was right.

604
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,470
It's been 1,000 years.

605
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,360
We've lived for too long.

606
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,920
From start to finish,

607
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,740
I'm the only one who's carried the burden of Ling Long's sins.

608
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,930
You've never truly resented her.

609
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,170
You just want a scapegoat to blame

610
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,680
when things go wrong!

611
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,180
Now…

612
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,520
it's my turn.

613
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,260
Qi,

614
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,010
wait for me

615
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,750
under the Emotion Tree.

616
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,090
What?

617
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,440
The Fox Clan has rebelled

618
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,480
and wants Chang Mei to sacrifice her life for the Emotion Tree?

619
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,090
But didn't Elder Chang Wu just sacrifice himself

620
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,880
to revive the Love Tree?

621
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,250
Why has it withered so quickly again?

622
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Last night, I followed Fu Ling

623
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,320
into the depths of the forest,

624
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,580
but I lost her again.

625
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,850
However, I saw a strong evil aura around the Emotion Tree.

626
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,050
It must have been her doing.

627
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,850
Cold Spring Palace's target is me.

628
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,600
It seems

629
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,560
I've dragged Master Chang down.

630
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,860
All her loved ones are gone.

631
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
Chang Mei no longer has any will to live.

632
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,030
Now, she wants to die for the Tree

633
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,650
to keep things from escalating

634
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,610
and to forever bury the secret that the Weak Water Stone

635
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,840
is in Mu Jiu's body.

636
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,110
Don't blame yourself.

637
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,770
This has nothing to do with you.

638
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,910
The Weak Water Stone is in Mu Jiu's body?

639
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,510
Then Bai Shuo's illness…

640
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,440
The most urgent thing now is not my condition.

641
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,680
Since the night we entered Jingyou Mountain,

642
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,420
all the visions from the Contemplation Stone

643
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,980
have been related to the Emotion Tree.

644
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,880
Do you think that means

645
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,020
only if we help the Fox Clan

646
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,440
solve the Emotion Tree's crisis

647
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,720
can we get the next Contemplation?

648
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,900
I can't believe you're still

649
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,360
thinking about Contemplations.

650
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,820
Do you want to die?

651
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,590
I don't want you to die.

652
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,590
I'll find another way to break

653
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,240
the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal.

654
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,810
If there were another way,

655
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,760
you wouldn't have suffered for so many years!

656
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,400
I have my own plans.

657
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,150
How do you know I can't get through this?

658
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,680
Bai Shuo, can you just listen to me once?

659
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,000
Stop being so stubborn!

660
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,140
This wedding dress looks old,

661
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,790
but its color is still as bright as new.

662
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,180
It must be something your aunt cherishes.

663
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,190
You should return it to her.

664
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,970
Auntie placed a curse on you.

665
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,820
I apologize on her behalf.

666
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,400
No need.

667
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,480
Though I've just been here for a short time,

668
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,800
I can see how much she cares for you.

669
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,460
I lost my mother too.

670
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,360
If possible,

671
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,430
I'd want someone to protect me the way she protects you.

672
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,720
I think,

673
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,640
no matter what she did,

674
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,230
it was all for your sake.

675
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,780
Auntie

676
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,010
has indeed been very nice to me.

677
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,510
Her wanting me to take her position

678
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,990
was also to protect me.

679
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,050
Unfortunately,

680
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,780
I have to disappoint her this time.

681
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,330
Well, Huo,

682
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,280
once I help you find the Weak Water Stone,

683
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,130
I'll leave with you,

684
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,960
okay?

685
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,820
Is it true?

686
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,280
Master is going to sacrifice herself?

687
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,560
Of course it's true.

688
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,080
Elder Chang Wu is missing,

689
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,780
and the elders in the clan are all saying

690
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,130
he was eaten by the Emotion Tree.

691
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,980
They also say the one behind it is Master

692
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,470
and want her to pay with her life.

693
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,750
Master…

694
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,560
What should we do?

695
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:44,700
Auntie.

696
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,940
They're saying you're going to sacrifice yourself.

697
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,190
What does that mean?

698
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,560
You came just in time.

699
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,470
Give me the dress.

700
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,430
There are many things

701
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,700
I haven't told you.

702
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,750
Now, it's time to tell you.

703
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,900
Come.

704
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,220
Master, I don't understand.

705
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,010
The Weak Water Stone is inside Mu Jiu's body.

706
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,810
To save Bai Shuo,

707
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,190
why not just take it out?

708
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,080
If it were that simple,

709
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,610
Chang Mei wouldn't need to sacrifice herself.

710
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,540
Chang Mei told me that

711
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,840
200 years after Mu Jiu was born,

712
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,630
he was still an infant.

713
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,890
Without the spiritual power of the Weak Water Stone,

714
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,690
he would have died long ago.

715
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,680
But Mu Jiu was weak

716
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,960
and needed to slowly absorb the Weak Water Stone's power.

717
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,460
So Chang Mei

718
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,430
sealed him in ice for over 700 years.

719
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,330
20 years ago,

720
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,680
Mu Jiu's spiritual power

721
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,710
finally merged completely with the Weak Water Stone's power,

722
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,830
and he began to grow.

723
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,850
Now, he shares his life with the Weak Water Stone.

724
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,500
If we take it out now,

725
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,340
he will die for sure.

726
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,510
If he dies,

727
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,790
what should Tian Huo do?

728
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,820
But if we don't take it out,

729
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,990
Bai Shuo will die.

730
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,330
What should you do then?

731
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,480
So,

732
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,690
I'm Ling Long's child?

733
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,890
Rong Xian is my father?

734
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,030
I've seen them in the Outlanders' City.

735
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,160
I've seen them in Outlanders' City, Auntie!

736
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,830
All these years,

737
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,190
I should have told you everything,

738
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,970
but I couldn't let anyone know

739
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,690
the secret of the Weak Water Stone.

740
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,920
When I found out that Fan Yue

741
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,720
came for the Weak Water Stone,

742
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,880
I feared Tian Huo would harm you.

743
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,250
Jiu,

744
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,900
everything I did

745
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,960
was just to protect you.

746
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,290
The Emotion Tree can't wither,

747
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,400
and I can't die.

748
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,920
So you've kept everything a secret

749
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,260
for so many years.

750
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,180
Now, to keep my secret buried,

751
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,220
you're going to sacrifice yourself!

752
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,860
Silly boy.

753
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,230
I'm just tired.

754
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,940
To live

755
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:12,650
means to have something to look forward to.

756
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,330
When Ling Long first passed away,

757
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,820
there was a question I thought about for a long time.

758
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,159
At that time, Rong Xian

759
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,850
pierced her body with his sword.

760
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,199
If she had the strength

761
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,820
to make you survive,

762
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,940
why didn't she save herself?

763
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,969
♫Don't linger, don't regret♫

764
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,790
She used her strength

765
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,570
to save me.

766
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:37,460
♫The last moonlight♫

767
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,860
Not only that.

768
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,620
I later learned that,

769
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:42,010
♫The water from my hometown flows gently♫

770
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,940
at that time,

771
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,250
her heart had already died.

772
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:45,969
♫Sending me to the distant place♫

773
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,300
If the heart is dead,

774
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,290
what's the point of keeping the body alive?

775
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,610
♫In this life, at this time♫

776
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,469
After Qi died,

777
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,320
♫I dare not look back♫

778
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,469
my heart also died.

779
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,320
♫Is there the same moonlight♫

780
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,950
But I couldn't die.

781
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,590
If I died, what would happen to you?

782
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,550
♫On your path?♫

783
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,660
So I wanted you to grow up quickly

784
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,420
♫I'm walking on a never-ending long road♫

785
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,490
and learn magic

786
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,460
so you could protect yourself.

787
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,690
I wanted you to be sensible and strong

788
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,200
♫In the vast world, how can I get there?♫

789
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,320
so that one day, when I was gone,

790
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,760
you'd be able to protect yourself.

791
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,930
♫In the chaotic night wind, the melody stopped♫

792
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,540
Auntie.

793
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,140
♫The moonlight is gentle♫

794
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,320
I was wrong.

795
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,190
♫All the feelings turned into nothing but a dream♫

796
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,280
I should've listened to you and trained harder.

797
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,740
If I had, maybe things wouldn't…

798
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,110
♫Reminiscing about the good old days♫

799
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,010
No.

800
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,630
I was wrong.

801
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,690
♫Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lost♫

802
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,760
I only wanted to make you strong

803
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,830
but forgot to make you happy.

804
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,540
♫Forget all about the past and leave it behind♫

805
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,660
If it weren't for Ms. Bai who reminded me,

806
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,730
♫Time after time♫

807
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,960
I'd have forgotten it.

808
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:36,360
♫Oh, melancholy♫

809
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,010
Before Ling Long died,

810
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,280
she didn't want me to return to Jingyou Mountain.

811
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,400
She wanted me to live the life I wanted.

812
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,660
But I didn't treat you the same way.

813
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,330
It doesn't matter, Auntie.

814
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,650
It doesn't matter anymore.

815
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,950
When I was young

816
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,010
♫Don't linger, don't regret♫

817
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,920
and others mocked me

818
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,880
because I had no parents,

819
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,400
♫The last moonlight♫

820
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,900
I'd always follow you around and ask you

821
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,840
♫The water from my hometown flows gently♫

822
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,750
who my parents were.

823
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,520
Back then, you told me

824
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,490
it doesn't matter who my parents are;

825
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,580
♫Sending me to the distant place♫

826
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,270
what matters is who I am.

827
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:07,190
♫In this life, at this time♫

828
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,990
I've kept those words in my heart.

829
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,010
In the past, I was always told what to do,

830
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,960
♫I dare not look back♫

831
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,140
so I wanted freedom.

832
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:12,920
I had no parents,

833
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,360
♫Is there the same moonlight♫

834
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,070
so I wanted a family.

835
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,650
But now,

836
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,300
♫On your path?♫

837
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,040
I have everything.

838
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,140
♫I'm walking on a never-ending long road♫

839
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,740
I'm living the life I've always wanted.

840
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,970
♫In the vast world, how can I get there?♫

841
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,280
♫In the chaotic night wind, the melody stopped♫

842
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,470
♫The moonlight is gentle♫

843
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:35,130
♫All the feelings turned into nothing but a dream♫

844
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,540
Ling Long gave me life,

845
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:39,340
♫Reminiscing about the good old days♫

846
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,280
and Fan Yue saved me,

847
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,030
♫Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lost♫

848
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,550
but it was you, Auntie, who raised me.

849
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,720
♫Forget all about the past and leave it behind♫

850
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,900
♫Time after time♫

851
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,510
♫I'm walking on a never-ending long road♫

852
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,300
I'm sorry for being a bad son,

853
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,220
♫In the vast world, how can I get there?♫

854
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,020
Mother.

855
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,530
♫In the chaotic night wind, the melody stopped♫

856
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,530
♫The moonlight is gentle♫

♫Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lost♫

860
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,810
♫Forget all about the past and leave it behind♫

861
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,510
Young Lord,

862
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,030
we can kill humans to refine

863
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,280
the evil insect for you.

864
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,200
You don't have to come in person.

865
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,760
The evil insect will be fully grown soon.

866
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,570
I must witness

867
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,480
the moment of its completion.

868
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,420
There are so many human cities.

869
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,220
Why have you chosen Ning'an City specifically?

870
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,830
Don't you find this city interesting?

871
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,330
It's a small city,

872
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,650
but a divine stone appeared here;

873
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,150
its people survived the Nether Poison;

874
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,420
a local girl absorbed the divine stone;

875
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,540
and a Demon King opened a restaurant here.

876
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,350
I've heard a lot about the luxurious Unbridled Pavilion.

877
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,270
[Unbridled Pavilion]

878
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,170
Since I'm out,

879
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,540
I have to check it out myself.

880
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,850
After all,

881
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,970
the new battle is about to begin.

882
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,800
Governor.

883
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,460
Greetings, Governor.

884
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,020
How's business been recently?

885
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:32,930
Business is good.

886
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,350
Bai Xun died

887
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,710
in the Nether Poison chaos,

888
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,420
and there's a new governor so soon.

889
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,050
Take a look.

890
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,400
In a few years,

891
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,670
who will even remember Bai Xun's name?

892
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,180
No one will care for anyone forever.

893
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,870
If you give your life for someone unworthy,

894
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,340
it'll just end up

895
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,340
as a joke.

896
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,870
If we take this new governor's life

897
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,850
to complete the evil insect's refinement,

898
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,970
at least his death will have meaning.

899
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,640
Governor, there's a bug.

900
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,670
It's poisonous.

901
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,120
An Eternal!

902
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,250
Let's go.

903
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,600
Sir,

904
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,410
you look kind.

905
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,200
Is this your first time visiting Ning'an City?

906
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,590
It's really you,

907
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,300
a demon from Cold Spring Palace.

908
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:05,000
Instead of staying in your sect,

909
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,780
why have you come to this small city?

910
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,890
If I hadn't come,

911
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,830
you'd be harming the humans here.

912
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,170
Tell me!

913
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,980
Were you the one behind the murders

914
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,170
in the three cities to the west?

915
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,250
Only someone like me

916
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,480
could pull off

917
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,650
such a masterpiece.

918
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,840
How arrogant!

919
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,390
I'll kill you right here today

920
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,190
to eliminate any future threat!

921
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,200
This cup of tea

922
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,800
is for my years of unfilial behavior.

923
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,200
You've loved me unconditionally

924
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,280
and never reproached me.

925
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,720
This cup

926
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,460
is for my foolishness in youth,

927
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,610
which led to so many troubles.

928
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,420
You've shielded me from all storms.

929
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,020
The last cup

930
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,130
is for you sacrificing everything

931
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,630
so I could live these 20 years without worry.

932
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,830
There shouldn't have been Mu Jiu in this world.

933
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,470
There should have been only Wu.

934
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,680
Mu Jiu was born,

935
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,880
but Wu died.

936
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,700
It shouldn't have been me who was innocent and carefree.

937
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,760
It shouldn't have been me who could travel around

938
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
with the person I love.

939
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,790
I'm sorry.

940
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,710
Silly boy.

941
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,210
Go now.

942
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,960
I should have let you go long ago.

943
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,170
And then leave you here to die alone?

944
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,540
Should I live the rest of my life in guilt,

945
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,030
just like you did?

946
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,020
I don't want that.

947
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,890
I've already lost my mother.

948
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,040
This time,

949
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,590
I won't let you die.

950
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,770
Jiu,

951
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,320
the tea…

952
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,180
I'm sorry, Auntie.

953
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,840
I placed a curse in the tea.

954
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,500
I shouldn't have taken advantage of your trust,

955
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,310
but I also want to protect you,

956
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,190
even if only this once.

957
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,140
No.

958
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,150
Jiu, no.

959
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,210
This time,

960
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,700
let me protect you.
