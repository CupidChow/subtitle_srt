1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,990
[Episode 6]

19
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,470
Without me,

20
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
the Desireless Stone

21
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,000
is useless to you.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,750
Since it's in my body,

23
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,280
I have the final say

24
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,960
who it belongs to.

25
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,840
Your acting is pretty good.

26
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,830
Bai Shuo.

27
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,530
You know clearly that

28
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,020
I need you to gather the Contemplations

29
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,820
and activate the Desireless Stone.

30
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,120
Not only will I not kill you, but I'll also protect you.

31
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,490
However, the Eternals

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,780
will only try to kill you to retrieve the Desireless Stone

33
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,180
or lock you up with the Desireless Stone

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,670
for the so-called "bigger picture."

35
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,910
So it might seem that I took you away with me,

36
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,280
but in fact, you voluntarily followed me.

37
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,690
Am I right?

38
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,520
Bai Xun was killed by the Demon Race.

39
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,940
I know you want to become stronger

40
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,250
and seek revenge,

41
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,640
but you can't count on the Human Race.

42
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,670
You can only choose between the Eternal Race and the Demon Race.

43
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,310
You've seen the incompetence of the Eternal Race.

44
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,250
The Eternal Race is not your first choice.

45
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,280
You know very well that

46
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,700
only the Bright Moon Palace

47
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,860
can truly help you.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,800
But you wouldn't admit defeat to me.

49
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,610
Now that I brought you back,

50
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,010
I've given you an excuse to save face,

51
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,740
right?

52
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,960
Don't be so conceited.

53
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,360
Without the Bright Moon Palace,

54
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,910
I can still kill Zhen Yu and Fu Ling.

55
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,550
Good.

56
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,640
I like the way you act tough.

57
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,829
Don't you want to seek revenge on your own?

58
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,510
Come on.

59
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,350
I'll stand right here

60
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,080
and won't move a step.

61
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,720
If you could do me even the slightest harm,

62
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,630
I'll let you go immediately,

63
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,810
and I won't ask about the Desireless Stone anymore.

64
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,200
You said it yourself.

65
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,360
Again.

66
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,390
Do you think us Three Kings of the Demon Race

67
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,630
got our title for nothing?

68
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,040
Zhen Yu is no weaker than me.

69
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,630
You can't even get close to me,

70
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,040
yet you dream about killing him?

71
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,660
Your mediocre skills

72
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,300
may be more than enough to fight among the Human Race,

73
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,480
but in the face of absolute power,

74
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,780
you are nothing.

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,010

♫I've missed too much time in my life♫

80
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,330

♫I'll throw myself into this flame for you♫

You're considered smart

89
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,310
among humans.

90
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,390
Although you wouldn't admit

91
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,200
what I said just now is true,

92
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,810
you know very well that

93
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,830
only when you become strong enough to intimidate your opponent

94
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,980
can your revenge begin.

95
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,200
What if I want to kill you too?

96
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,440
As long as you can.

97
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,480
You've got something to say?

98
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,510
Why did you do that, Master?

99
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,790
I just don't want her to run around with the Desireless Stone.

100
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,060
If it's just to control her,

101
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,580
there are many ways.

102
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,280
Why did you choose the most troublesome one?

103
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,330
What are you trying to say?

104
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,760
I just want to remind you, Master,

105
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,480
not to be swayed by some momentary compassion.

106
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,010
There are only three stars left on the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal.

107
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,760
If the stars are all gone, even if Bai Shuo doesn't kill you,

108
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,930
there will be no Master of the Bright Moon Palace in the world anymore.

109
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,630
I know what I'm doing.

110
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,430
She's a human who broke into the fight between Eternals and demons.

111
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,380
She must learn the abilities to protect herself.

112
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,070
Otherwise, how can she be my ally?

113
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,990
Bai Shuo can activate the Desireless Stone?

114
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,770
Sect Leader.

115
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,870
Please allow me

116
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,750
to lead troops to the Polar Region to bring Bai Shuo back.

117
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,190
Of course we must retrieve the Desireless Stone.

118
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,120
It's just the Polar Region stretches for hundreds of thousands of miles.

119
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,350
To this day, no one knows where the Bright Moon Palace is.

120
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,510
We can only send disciples

121
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,880
to locate the Bright Moon Palace first.

122
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,690
Once they find it,

123
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,160
they'll bring Bai Shuo back.

124
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,830
I thought you

125
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,570
went to negotiate with Fan Yue, Sect Leader.

126
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,390
When you came back, you even said Fan Yue was nice,

127
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,690
and that he would let Bai Shuo make her own choice.

128
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,590
But look what happened. Where is she?

129
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,550
Who can help me out here?

130
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,320
The Demon Race is fickle

131
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,270
and has no moral principles.

132
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,370
This is not something Sect Leader could have predicted.

133
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,310
Sect Leader.

134
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,430
Where is Chong Zhao?

135
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,920
Why haven't I seen him since he came back?

136
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,310
He knew he was at fault,

137
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,750
and he petitioned for a self-imposed punishment of 300 Red Bone Whips.

138
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,570
300 Red Bone Whips?

139
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,550
The Red Bone Whip is Lanling's punishment for felonies.

140
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,630
Every whip will hurt the bone.

141
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,590
It may seem to cause physical injuries,

142
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,540
but it actually tortures the soul.

143
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,440
Since you can't bear to see him like that, Sect Leader,

144
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,170
why did you agree to his petition

145
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,560
and let him be punished so heavily?

146
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,730
He should be punished for his mistake.

147
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,190
He cannot be let off the hook for the chaos he brought to Ning'an.

148
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,030
Besides the 300 Red Bone Whips,

149
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,200
he also needs to reflect on his mistakes at the Heart-guarding Cliff.

150
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,320
That being said,

151
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,890
the real sinner is the Cold Spring Palace.

152
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,810
The Cold Spring Palace violated the iron law between Eternals and demons

153
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,450
and harmed the Human Race. Of course it should be executed.

154
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,470
Yan Huo.

155
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,430
Send a letter to the 72 Sects

156
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,340
and invite all Sect Leaders here

157
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,650
to discuss the crusade against the Cold Spring Palace.

158
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,620
Yes.

159
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,410
Go.

160
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,850
Now,

161
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,390
the Desireless Stone has been brought to the Bright Moon Palace by Fan Yue.

162
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,290
It won't be easy if we want to take it by force.

163
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,250
Then it depends on whether my beloved disciple, Fu Ling,

164
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,230
can make Chong Zhao defect or not.

165
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,720
Grand Master, so you want to take advantage of Chong Zhao's relationship

166
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,170
with Bai Shuo?

167
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,160
Before he dies,

168
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,220
if

169
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,850
he can really

170
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,820
lure out Bai Shuo and the Desireless Stone for me,

171
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,370
that will be

172
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,240
his last glory.

173
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,530
I'll choose

174
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,010
my own path.

175
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,330
No one has the right to make decisions for me.

176
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,990
Master.

177
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,390
Master.

178
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,680
Maybe you should go check on Bai Shuo.

179
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,330
She hasn't eaten or drunk anything for two days.

180
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,220
She may die anytime.

181
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,040
She knows what she wants.

182
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,390
She won't let herself die.

183
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,770
Then why is she so stubborn?

184
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,340
It takes time to give in

185
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,910
to someone you hate.

186
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,320
I'm in no rush.

187
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,690
Here's the best medicine

188
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,520
and the sharpest knife in the Bright Moon Palace.

189
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,930
Whether you live or die,

190
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,240
it's your own choice.

191
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,060
The Bright Moon Palace never feeds half-dead losers.

192
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,560
You choose to die?

193
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,320
I can help you.

194
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm the only one who can activate the Desireless Stone.

195
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,710
You dare not kill me,

196
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,300
nor can you.

197
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,510
What?

198
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,200
Are you really going to

199
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,240
rely on a lifeless thing for the rest of your life?

200
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,460
I thought you were a woman of character.

201
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,430
If I were you, I would choose the medicine.

202
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,170
After all, your pride is worthless now.

203
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,120
If you can really hide in silence in front of your enemies

204
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,630
and kill them with one strike,

205
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,000
I might think better of you.

206
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,460
I'll return it to you.

207
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,790
I'll wait.

208
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,970
Weren't you worried that she might choose the knife?

209
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,150
She's not as weak as you think.

210
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,160
Although she's a human,

211
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,510
the fact that she dared to step into the Bright Moon Palace

212
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,360
shows that she's braver than

213
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,790
most people in the world.

214
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,960
Why do I sense some

215
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,280
admiration in your words?

216
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,300
[Heart-guarding Cliff
Lanling Sect, Eternal Race]

217
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,720
You want to detoxify,

218
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,390
yet you refuse to report it to Lanling Sect.

219
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,340
Why is that?

220
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,840
Because you're scared.

221
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,500
The human with the Desireless Stone in her body

222
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,050
should be killed!

223
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,160
If you're not capable enough, even if you use your sword,

224
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,360
you'll only embarrass yourself.

225
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,670
Logically,

226
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,230
I have no right to blame you.

227
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,610
But emotionally,

228
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,510
I cannot help but blame you.

229
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,920
From now on,

230
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,880
we go

231
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,480
our separate ways.

232
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,260
Being distracted when practicing martial skills.

233
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,160
Do you want to die, Divinity?

234
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,480
It's you.

235
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,020
I'll kill you!

236
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,260
In Ning'an City,

237
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,190
I saved you twice.

238
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,500
Instead of thanking me,

239
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,690
you want to kill me?

240
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,610
I should have killed you in the clinic.

241
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,980
Exactly. So

242
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,640
why did you save me that night?

243
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,170
You probably don't know that

244
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,840
I killed the doctor in the clinic.

245
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,700
I had no choice. He peeked at my body

246
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,000
without permission.

247
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,900
Tell me.

248
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,460
Who do you think caused his death?

249
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,210
You witch.

250
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,030
You gave up a city for one person.

251
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,020
Chong Zhao.

252
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,590
How are you different from demons?

253
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
The Eternal Race is truly cruel.

254
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,260
You just made a tiny mistake,

255
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,170
yet they erased your past achievements and exiled you here.

256
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,500
The Heart-guarding Cliff is at the border of Lanling.

257
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,920
If you take another step,

258
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,970
you'll be out of the territory of the Eternal Race.

259
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,230
Chong Zhao.

260
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,650
Why don't you leave Lanling

261
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,190
and join my Cold Spring Palace?

262
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,360
Dream on!

263
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,240
During Ning'an Xunyuan Lantern Festival,

264
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,480
inexorable doom befell the Lanling Eternal Envoys.

265
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,640
They never came back.

266
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,000
Who is waiting for their return?

267
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,410
How do you know these?

268
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,610
I was bored

269
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,200
and inquired about you.

270
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,350
I found something strange.

271
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,360
Ten years ago, during the Xunyuan Lantern Festival,

272
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,710
the Human Race was attacked by the Demon Race, and hundreds of humans got killed or injured.

273
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,340
The Eternal Envoy of Lanling, Chong Tai,

274
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,200
and his wife, Meng Ning, were ordered to investigate,

275
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,540
but they were killed by the scorpion demon, Qian Yin.

276
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,930
His son, Chong Zhao,

277
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,590
suspected the cause of death of his parents,

278
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,060
yet he found nothing after years of investigation.

279
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,640
What are you trying to say?

280
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,110
The entire Eternal Race knows that your parents

281
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,260
were killed by a scorpion demon ten years ago.

282
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,470
But do you know that

283
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,320
two days before your parents were killed,

284
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,410
Qian Yin already died?

285
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,560
You've been investigating for so many years, but you found nothing.

286
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,790
Do you know why?

287
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,450
Because

288
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,050
you've never stepped on the territory of the Demon Race.

289
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,620
Chong Zhao.

290
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,290
What you see now

291
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,950
may not be the truth.

292
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,920
But somewhere you can't see,

293
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,150
the truth

294
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,910
might be right there.

295
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,250
Clarify it!

296
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,400
I'll wait for you in the Cold Spring Palace

297
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,630
for a talk, Divinity Chong Zhao.

298
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,730
Master.

299
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,330
My parents were the best Eternal Envoys of Lanling.

300
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,390
They killed countless demons.

301
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,540
How could they have been

302
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,470
killed by a scorpion demon?

303
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,630
That's impossible!

304
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,870
Kid.

305
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,280
Didn't you see it with your own eyes?

306
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,160
Your parents' soul lamps have gone out.

307
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,170
It's all my fault.

308
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,710
I underestimated the demonic power of Qian Yin

309
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,730
and sent your parents to hunt him down,

310
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,530
which ended up getting them killed.

311
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,470
No!

312
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,890
My father said

313
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,280
that even if they encountered any danger,

314
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,860
♫That year, that year♫

315
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,060
one of them would come back alive.

316
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,540
They wouldn't leave me behind.

317
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,590
♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

318
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,870
They said it.

319
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,840
♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

320
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,460
Don't worry.

321
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,230
♫They unfold, one page after another♫

322
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,440
I will kill Qian Yin myself

323
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,150
and avenge your parents.

324
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,310
♫That year, that year♫

325
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,790
Cultivate well

326
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,360
and live well.

327
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,900
♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

328
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,600
That'll be the best solace

329
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,600
♫Falling to the mud, burying the memories♫

330
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,440
to your parents' souls in heaven.

331
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,570
♫Layer after layer♫

332
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,180
♫Another year passed♫

333
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,110
♫Another year passed♫

334
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,700
I thought you were dead.

335
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,280
Sorry to disappoint you.

336
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,420
I would only be disappointed if you really died.

337
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,560
Whether I have the Desireless Stone or not,

338
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,150
I won't let myself die.

339
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,990
Tell me then.

340
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,270
What do you plan to do?

341
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,720
I want to learn sorcery.

342
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,350
Teach me yourself,

343
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,860
or have someone else teach me.

344
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,680
Why should I agree to that?

345
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,890
Because I have the Desireless Stone in me.

346
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,260
I may see the second image of foresight

347
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,650
at any time.

348
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,960
If you want to know where the next Contemplation will be born,

349
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,170
you must agree to this.

350
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,680
Are you threatening me?

351
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,349
It's not a threat.

352
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,490
As always,

353
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,670
it's a deal.

354
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,660
While the Desireless Stone is still inside you,

355
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,920
you want to learn sorcery to protect yourself and strengthen your power.

356
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,950
Only with bargaining chips can you do what you want.

357
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,740
You have a clear mind

358
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,319
and the right strategy.

359
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,680
However,

360
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,010
since you can make a deal out of the gathering of Contemplations,

361
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,450
why don't you just ask me to avenge you?

362
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,610
I must seek revenge in this world

363
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,550
on my own.

364
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,710
My father's suffering,

365
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,000
the blood he shed,

366
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,600
and the life he lost.

367
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,880
One day,

368
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,310
I will take it all back from them with my own hands.

369
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,370
So, Master,

370
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,580
will you teach me

371
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,670
or not?

372
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,030
Most of these weapons were

373
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,690
left behind by the demons that were killed.

374
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,940
So each weapon carries certain demonic power.

375
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,000
Which weapon is the strongest?

376
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,820
Greed won't do you any good.

377
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,090
Since I want to practice,

378
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,630
I'll practice with the most powerful weapon.

379
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,680
This is a fire-wheel cane that was tempered

380
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,640
by volcanoes for thousands of years.

381
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,880
It weighs over 1,000 catties.

382
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,410
The cane is covered with fire patterns.

383
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,280
It's not something that ordinary people can lift up.

384
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,830
They might even get hurt by the fire patterns

385
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,440
and the demonic power within.

386
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,160
Are you sure you want to practice with it?

387
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:26,970
Yes.

388
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,690
She actually lifted it up.

389
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,140
Could it be that the Desireless Stone is helping her?

390
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,590
I suggest you put it down now.

391
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,820
I've said,

392
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,720
I'll only practice with the most powerful weapon.

393
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,400
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

394
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,700
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

395
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,150
If you don't put it down now,

396
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,540
♫My love brought tears♫

397
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,620
your hands will be crippled.

398
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,720
♫Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completeness♫

399
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,740
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

400
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,080
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

401
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,580
♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

402
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,400
♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

403
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,430
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

404
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,670
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

405
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,710
♫The daylight burns through, and the stars shine bright♫

406
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,900
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

407
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,830
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

408
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,120
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

409
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,860
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

410

Please bless the world♫To protect the world for eternity♫

411
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,400
Tian Huo.

412
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,500
Escort her back.

413
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,100
I haven't said I couldn't do it.

414
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,260
I said,

415
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,150
go back.

416
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,660
I never said I couldn't do it.

417
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,200
Are you moved by yourself?

418
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,020
In my eyes,

419
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,420
you're just foolish.

420
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,630
I just don't want to give up.

421
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,470
My injuries will heal,

422
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,950
but the training can't stop.

423
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,050
It takes a lot more than bravery

424
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,360
to achieve great things.

425
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,040
If you get your hands crippled,

426
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,620
I won't teach you anymore.

427
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,080
Tian Huo.

428
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,630
Escort her back.

429
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,130
You're cold and distant,

430
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,180
and your dressing skills are average.

431
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,420
I don't think our relationship is so close

432
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,660
that we can talk about this.

433
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,610
Let me remind you again.

434
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,620
Outside the Bright Moon Palace is the Polar Region that stretches for hundreds of thousands of miles.

435
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,830
There are demons and monsters everywhere.

436
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,400
Don't wander around.

437
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,840
I won't be responsible if you lose your life.

438
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,600
I don't need your reminder.

439
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,680
I have more important things to do with my life.

440
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,160
That would be the best.

441
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,870
Don't make Master worry about you.

442
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,800
You care about Fan Yue a lot?

443
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,250
Everyone in the Bright Moon Palace

444
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,980
cares a lot about Master.

445
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,510
So just stay here and be good.

446
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,900
Master will teach you when he wants to.

447
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,640
Don't have any ulterior thoughts.

448
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,080
Ulterior thoughts?

449
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,860
Does the thought of killing him count?

450
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,750
Before you kill him,

451
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,520
I'll kill you.

452
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,500
Even if I have to die with you.

453
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,470
I see.

454
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,480
Please see yourself out.

455
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,990
I haven't achieved anything, yet my hands are already injured.

456
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,720
Brute force alone

457
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,330
is indeed useless.

458
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:45,570
♫Love is the hardest thing to understand♫

459
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,260
I'm done practicing.

460
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,530
You were the one who said you wanted to learn,

461
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:53,140
♫I'm finally back to where it all started♫

462
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,550
and now you are the one who wants to give up.

463
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,230
How can my daughter be such a loser?

464
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,240
Can I learn it well if I don't give up?

465
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:59,350
♫All the answers are already explained♫

466
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,780
♫I'll owe you all of my life♫

467
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,970
Shuo.

468
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,610
♫But we're destined to part♫

469
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,390
You may not succeed if you don't give up.

470
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,050
But if you give up, you'll definitely fail.

471
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:14,450
♫How can I downplay this?♫

472
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,750
I believe in you.

00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,390
Father.

476
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,180
Sorry.

477
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,060
♫When the heavens fall♫

478
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,620
I've chosen to work with demons.

♫I can still connect with you through the waning moon♫

480
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,120
I'm not sure where I'm headed yet.

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,060

♫When my pain blurs my eyes♫

483
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,440
I will step on it,

take the revenge

485

♫Out of the countless stars, I see only you♫

486
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,610
and repay the kindness that is due

487
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,110
step by step.

488

♫As you turn into a falling star♫

489
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:39,960
Don't worry.

490
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,880
I will forge my own path.

491
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,940
Get out of my way.

492
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,280
Where is Fan Yue?

493
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,680
Do you think Master's whereabouts

494
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,980
is something you can inquire about casually?

495
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,310
He promised to teach me sorcery,

496
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,720
but I haven't seen him for days.

497
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,030
Did he regret it?

498
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,240
Since Master said he would teach you,

499
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,510
of course he won't break his promise.

500
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,820
But he also said

501
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,300
if your hands were crippled,

502
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,640
he wouldn't teach you anymore.

503
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,120
My hands have recovered.

504
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,810
Then wait for him to come and teach you.

505
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,420
He will come when he wants to.

506
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,340
It's supposed to be a deal, and we should be equal.

507
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,090
Why is the Bright Moon Palace so overbearing?

508
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,910
It can't be helped. You are in the Bright Moon Palace now,

509
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,140
so the final say is Master's.

510
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,650
You're obviously abusing your power and bullying me.

511
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,890
In the Demon Race,

512
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,630
power is gained through

513
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,750
countless fights

514
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,350
with fists or swords.

515
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,730
Don't you think

516
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,640
it's reasonable for us to use our power to bully others?

517
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,570
What kind of logic is that?

518
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,070
That's the logic of the Demon Race.

519
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,390
If you are unhappy about it,

520
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,010
either become stronger yourself,

521
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,600
or go back to your Human Race.

522
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,680
Since you have the intention to teach her, Master,

523
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,320
why have you been ignoring her for so many days?

524
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,570
She's too eager for success.

525
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,010
No matter what she practices, it will be counterproductive.

526
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,790
So you're doing this for her own good, Master?

527
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,280
For her good?

528
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,920
I just don't want

529
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,110
a useless ally with crippled hands and feet.

530
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,790
You think she is useless, Master,

531
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,190
yet you still treat her as your ally.

532
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,650
So untrustworthy.

533
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,000
Breaking his promise.

534
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,460
If he didn't want to teach me, why didn't he just refuse?

535
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,310
If it goes on like this,

536
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,000
when will I ever become stronger?

537
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,370
This won't do.

538
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,790
I can't wait like this any longer.

539
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,570
I'll go ask Fan Yue to explain this to me.

540
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,660
Where is he going at such a late hour?

541
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,850
What is this place?

542
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,240
So secretive.

543
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,740
Could this be a secret place for cultivation?

544
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,870
Or,

545
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,400
maybe it's a treasure trove?

546
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,290
What are these?

547
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,170
Ju Ying.

548
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,410
You Nan.

549

550
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,840
They all seem to be names.

551
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,550
Why are they hung here?

552
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,770
They look quite old.

553
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,770
Are these antiques collected by Fan Yue?

554
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,880
Fan Yue?

555
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,860
Why is his name also on it?

556
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,210
Come out!

557
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,750
How did you get in here?

558
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,110
How did I get in?

559
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,590
I followed you in.

560
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,110
Get out.

561
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,330
Fan Yue.

562
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,800
You've ignored me for so many days. That should be enough, right?

563
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,050
Or are you teasing me on purpose?

564
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,560
You promised to teach me,

565
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,460
but you've been nowhere to be found all day.

566
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,200
I didn't expect to see you

567
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,140
admiring your antiques here.

568
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,550
What's so precious about these that you need to collect them?

569
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,200
I allowed you to stay here and walk freely in the Bright Moon Palace.

570
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,680
That doesn't mean you can break into my secret chamber

571
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,960
and pry into my secrets!

572
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,550
Those who talk too much should be killed,

573
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,970
those who are reckless deserve to die,

574
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,740
and those who are overly curious have no right to live!

575
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,720
Don't try to challenge my tolerance.

576
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,070
If this happens again,

577
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,240
even if I have to give up the Desireless Stone,

578
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,860
I will destroy you.

579
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,430
What about that thing you promised me?

580
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,480
You're only using the Demon Race's logic to bully me

581
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,070
because you are strong.

582
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,580
So what's wrong with me wanting to become stronger?

583
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,890
I used to understand the feeling of wanting to become stronger even better than you.

584
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,680
You're not the only one

585
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,270
who has experienced tremendous changes, Bai Shuo!

586
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,190
Don't think you're so special.

587
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,490
If you want to become stronger, you have to endure the process of it.

588

You want to accomplish it at one stroke?

589
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,830

If you have so much free time,

714
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,140
maybe you should think about

718
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,270
It does seem too cowardly.

I followed you into the secret chamber yesterday on purpose,

727
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,850
and the purpose was to get something on you

728
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,200
so that I could force you to teach me sorcery.

729
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,810
You suddenly came clean to me?

730

I couldn't hide it from you in the first place,

in the forbidden chamber mean to you,

734
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,350
but I did pry into your privacy.

735
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,650
I apologize.

736
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,660
You can really yield in order to become stronger.

737
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,930
So, Master,

738
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,400
are you willing to teach me this time?

739
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,720
Go back first.

740
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,060
I'll think about it.

741
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,690
I hope it won't take you too long, Master.

742
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,280
Stop pretending.

743
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,020
I don't buy it.

744
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:36,800
Bai Shuo.

745
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,270
Tell me.

746
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,110
What did you do?

747
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,110
What do you think I could do?

748
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,190
What is this?

749
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,780
This is the trace left by demonic power's devoration.

750
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,800
Tell me the truth already.

751
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,949
What on earth did you do?

752
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,360
What do you think I could do?

753
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,670
I just practiced

754
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,480
the mental cultivation methods of the Demon Race secretly.

755
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,110
You're really something, Bai Shuo.

756
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,300
I was just too impatient.

757
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,010
So what happened to me?

758
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,650
You can't cultivate demonic power.

759
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,050
Why?

760
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,940
Maybe it's because of the Desireless Stone.

761
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,969
Isn't the Desireless Stone a divine object?

762
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,730
Could it prevent people from becoming stronger?

763
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,590
Maybe it's exactly because

764
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,889
the Desireless Stone is a divine object that it caused this.

765
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,440
What do you mean?

766
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:55,239
The current mental cultivation methods of the Demon Race are passed down from the ancient Demon Race,

767
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,920
while the mental cultivation methods of the Eternal Race are passed down from the ancient Lunar Race.

768
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,460
The Desireless Stone is the sacred object of the Lunar Race.

769
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,010
It's against the Demon Race's methods.

770
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,740
That's why

771
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,520
the more you cultivate the mental methods of the Demon Race,

772
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,540
the more serious the devoration you'll suffer.

773
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,980
I only heard there are gods and demons in this world.

774
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,190
What are the ancient

775
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,600
Lunar Race

776
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,660
and Demon Race?

777
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,120
Sixty thousand years ago, there was the ancient Divine Race,

778
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,260
which was divided into three sections, namely Lunar, Demon, and Hidden.

779
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,620
Later, Hidden Lord, Mo Li, caused a catastrophe to the world.

780
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,250
In the end, he was killed by Lunar Lord, Xing Yue, and Demon Lord, Jing Yuan.

781
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,940
But in this Divine War, the Divine Region was destroyed,

782
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,410
and all deities fell.

783
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,070
From then on, there were no more deities in the world.

784
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,100
You mean

785
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,550
if I want to become stronger,

786
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,230
I can only practice the methods of the Eternal Race?

787
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,220
Why do I sense betrayal

788
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,930
in your eyes?

789
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,110
You're overthinking it.

790
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,620
Even if I defect to the Eternal Race,

791
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,890
those old men of the Eternal Race won't avenge me.

792
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,620
They'll control me instead.

793
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,190
And you won't let me off the hook, either.

794
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,480
If I join the Eternal Race,

795
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,830
it won't be worth it.

796
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,090
You're quite wise.

797
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,560
Get up.

798
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,720
I'll take you to a place.

799
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,000
Where?

800
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,510
Lanling Sect.

801
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,190
What's that supposed to mean?

802
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,420
Are you colluding with your enemy as Master of the Bright Moon Palace?

803
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,040
Didn't you say that

804
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,370
either I teach you

805
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,150
or I find someone to teach you?

806
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,330
Who're you going to ask to teach me?

807
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,440
You'll know when you get there.

808
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,040
[Old Turtle
1000-year-old Mystery Turtle, Eternal Race]

809
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,430
This is the territory of Lanling.

810
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,130
Why can you go in and out freely?

811
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,350
I have my own way.

812
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,900
The master you got for me

813
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,080
is not an Eternal of Lanling, is he?

814
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,630
Eternals and demons have always been enemies.

815
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,010
Why are you so close?

816
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,270
The rules are fixed,

817
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,560
but those who enforce them can be flexible.

818
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,840
That's not wrong.

819
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,550
Why aren't we going in?

820
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,030
He already ran away.

821
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Where are we going?

822
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,880
To catch the tortoise.

823
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,990
Put me down!

824
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,110
Stop it!

825
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,710
If you keep pulling the thread, my shell will crack.

826
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,610
Is this the Eternal you talked about?

827
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,770
A real tor...

828
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,200
Turtle.

829
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,990
He's the 1000-year-old Mystery Turtle.

830
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:34,970
He's lived longer

831
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,850
than the Five Eternals of Lanling.

832
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,320
Given his species, he can't die young even if he wants to.

833
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,140
My old...

834
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,250
I once saved your life in the Eternal Race.

835
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,200
Now,

836
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,410
I'm here to collect the debt.

837
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,700
Fan Yue.

838
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,960
Why did you come to the Eternal Race's territory

839
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,620
instead of staying in the Polar Region?

840
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,280
Demon King of the Polar Region.

841
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,320
Master of the Bright Moon Palace.

842
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,400
Here comes another demon king.

843
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,490
Zhen Yu.

844
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,780
I feel like you're actually regressing.

845
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,910
As the Demon King,

846
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,410
you actually chased after a turtle?

847
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,440
I'm the 1000-year-old Mystery Turtle.

848
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,320
The one in Lanling?

849
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,670
He knows me!

850
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,070
He...

851
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,520
I can do whatever I want.

852
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,400
What?

853
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,460
Today,

854
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,820
you want to get involved

855
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,300
and help the Eternal Race?

856
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,690
So what if I help them?

857
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,090
The Jingyou Mountain has been silent for years.

858
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,180
Word has it in the Demon Race that the Three Kings have been fighting.

859
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,510
But it seems to me that

860
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,280
it's just a fight between you and me.

861
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,250
I will save

862
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,640
whoever you want to kill.

863
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,220
And I'll oppose

864
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,610
whatever you want to do.

865
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,230
Haughty.

866
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,170
Good.

867
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,850
Let me see

868
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,450
whether you, the new king of the Demon Race,

869
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,060
deserve

870
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,000
your arrogance.

871
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,440
Zhen Yu.

872
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,880
You are too old.

873
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,580
If you ask me,

874
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,170
there doesn't have to be Three Kings

875
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,850
in the Demon Race.

876
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,590
Fan Yue, don't get cocky too soon.

877
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,980
One day,

878
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:59,030
I'll avenge the loss of my tail.

879
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,800
The teleportation formation I gave you back then

880
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,840
was for you to come to Lanling to see me anytime.

881
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,070
But look at you.

882
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,070
You haven't come to see me even once over these years.

883
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,880
You even stole the Desireless Stone with the treasure I gave you.

884
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,150
Public morals are indeed degenerating with each passing day.

885
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,840
Demons are heartless.

886
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,370
Why do I remember

887
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,710
we made the plan to steal the Desireless Stone together?

888
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,260
Don't talk nonsense!

889
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,590
It has nothing to do with me.

890
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,230
You stole it yourself.

891
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,960
But Jin Yao must be very curious

892
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,280
how I broke through all the barriers of the Eternals

893
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,370
and walked so freely in Lanling, don't you think?

894
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,840
What exactly do you want?

895
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,090
Use your elixir

896
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,240
to cure her devoration.

897
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,880
What devoration?

898
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,070
The devoration caused by the conflict between the Desireless Stone and the demonic power.

899
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:46,710
You...

900
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,550
So you're the human who absorbed the Desireless Stone?

901
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,440
You...

902
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,360
Are you going to treat her or not?

903
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,590
Sure. Sure I will.

904
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,230
Also,

905
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,190
teach her the Eternals' sorcery.

906
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,870
You may as well tell Jin Yao

907
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,780
that I let you in.

908
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,720
I'll only lose a layer of my shell for colluding with the enemy.

909
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,430
But if I teach her, I'm afraid I won't live to be a 1000-year-old tortoise.

910
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,630
I wouldn't dare to offend those five Eternals

911
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,450
at the same time.

912
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,190
Aren't you the 1000-year-old Mystery Turtle

913
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,670
born from the spiritual energy of heaven and earth?

914
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,350
Why should you be scared of the Five Eternals?

915
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,630
The Five Eternals are not scary.

916
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,840
What's scary is the Desireless Stone.

917
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,320
You have the Desireless Stone in you,

918
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,590
so all the Eternals and demons in the world want you.

919
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,030
Even if I'm a 1000-year-old tortoise,

920
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,510
I wouldn't be able to handle it.

921
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,320
Alright.

922
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,280
Cut the crap.

923
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,340
Either

924
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,330
teach her,

925
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,380
or

926
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,860
give your life back to me now.

927
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,020
Calm down. Calm down.

928
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,440
I'll teach her.

929
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,550
Are you sure you want this turtle who knows no bounds

930
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,670
to be my master?

931
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,360
What do you think he can teach me?

932
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,880
Eat this.

933
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,840
Your devoration will subside soon.

934
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,790
Is it that powerful?

935
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,040
Of course.

936
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,800
If I rank second in healing,

937
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,120
no one dares to call themselves number one.

938
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,450
That's exactly what the quack who sold me fake medicine many years ago said.

939
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,110
How dare you compare me to those quacks?

940
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,880
Take it, or give it back to me.

941
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,400
I was just saying.

942
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,320
It's just I encountered too many swindlers

943
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,670
in the past.

944
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
Of course I trust

945
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,920
the person Master introduced to me.

946
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,480
How is it?

947
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,400
Is the demonic pattern gone?

948
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,310
Look.

949
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,350
Look.

950
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,480
Old Turtle, look.

951
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,670
It's gone. It's gone.

952
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,590
You're a girl. Watch your behavior.

953
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,760
What's wrong with my behavior?

954
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:58,920
Catch it.

955
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,070
What is it?

956
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,670
Stay here with Old Turtle and learn from him.

957
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,220
Contact me with this conch if anything happens.

958
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,880
I have to stay here alone?

959
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,110
What if the Eternal Race finds out?

960
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,210
That's why I'm giving you this conch.

961
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,230
Take it with you wherever you go.

962
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,150
Don't lose it

963
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,000
or give it to others.

964
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,320
Otherwise, if you lose your life,

965
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,670
don't blame me for not reminding you.

966
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,320
There's no need to warn me.

967
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,800
I'll teach her since you brought her here.

968
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,870
Let's start.

969
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,470
What do you mean start?

970
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:34,880
Bow to me and take me as your master first.

971
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:38,150
I, Bai Shuo, only bow to my parents, heaven and earth.

972
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,230
I've never bowed to anyone else.

973
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,360
If you want me to take you as my master,

974
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,590
you have to show me your real skills first.

975
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,880
I won't teach you if you don't bow to me.

976
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,900
Really?

977
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,880
Master.

978
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,110
Go ahead.

979
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:53,320
Your Highness.

980
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,150
I'll teach you.

981
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,550
I surrender.

982
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,780
Nothing.

983
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,540
I just wanted to ask

984
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,880
if you got home safely.

985
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,470
I'll work hard and learn from Old Turtle.

986
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,630
When I finish my studies,

987
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,180
remember to come and pick me up.

988
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:12,880
Okay.

989
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,280
Am I a good friend or not?

990
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,230
I didn't tell on you.

991
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:22,160
As the 1000-year-old Mystery Turtle,

992
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,180
you must have a lot of special skills.

993
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,420
What will you teach me first?

994
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:31,820
Watch

995
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,880
carefully.

996
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:50,730
Did you get it?

997
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,720
What?

998
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,360
Breath holding.

999
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,590
Are you sure this is a skill of the Eternals?

1000
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,630
My disciple.

1001
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,880
What's the most important thing

1002
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,670
in a duel?

1003
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,630
To defeat the enemy.

1004
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:03,610
Wrong.

1005
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,410
It's to survive.

1006
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,070
What I taught you just now is my secret technique,

1007
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,580
Turtle's Breath.

1008
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:10,510
But of course,

1009
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,400
you can also call it

1010
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,360
Playing Dead.

1011
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:22,760
I'll teach you something else.
