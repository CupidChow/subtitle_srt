00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

18
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,000
[Episode 35]

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,850
If I really want something,

20
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,030
I don't trade for it.

21
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,780
I just

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,690
take it.

23
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,220
Since you know what I did

24
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,350
was a trick,

25
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,820
why aren't you leaving?

26
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,190
Didn't you say

27
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,620
I'm arrogant

28
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,720
and that the harder something is,

29
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,990
the more I want to do it?

30
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,500
Then

31
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,440
I suddenly don't want to leave.

32
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,160
So, you still want to destroy the Xing Yue Bow?

33
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,860
Then I can't let you stay in the Lunar Race's territory.

34
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,370
I've decided not to use any tricks to defeat you.

35
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,620
I'm going to have a fair fight with you.

36
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,160
If you win,

37
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,490
I will never think

38
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,210
about destroying the Xing Yue Divine Bow again.

39
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,590
Besides, the Demon Race

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,790
will never fight against the Lunar Race again.

41
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,100
Of course,

42
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,860
you can't use the Xing Yue Divine Bow.

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,510
Otherwise, it'll be too unfair.

44
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,410
Why should I agree to that?

45
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,740
I saved you last night.

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,850
I don't think you want to owe me a favor.

47
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,160
When shall we fight?

48
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,579
I'm still staying in that small room.

49
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,070
When the Hidden power inside your body is gone,

50
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,720
it will be the day of our battle.

51
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,070
Okay.

52
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,140
You haven't promised me.

53
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,910
If you lose...

54
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,690
There's no need.

55
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,250
I won't lose.

56
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,860
My Lord,

57
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,760
are you really letting the Demon Lord stay in our territory?

58
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,700
He's here to destroy the Xing Yue Divine Bow!

59
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,900
Since I promised him,

60
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,520
I should have a fair fight with him.

61
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,340
My Lord,

62
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,360
don't be tricked by him.

63
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,560
Across the three parts of the Divine Region,

64
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,380
the Demon Lord is famous for being impetuous and conceited.

65
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,840
He never cares about any divine rules.

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,159
He's no different from the Hidden Lord.

67
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,310
Besides,

68
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,320
if the elders know

69
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,690
you let the Demon Lord stay here...

70
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,530
Xiu Yan,

71
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,480
what are you worried about?

72
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,750
My Lord.

73
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,220
The Contemplation Stone's Divine Contemplations are unstable.

74
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,240
Your mind...

75
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,890
is wavering.

76
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,510
Don't worry.

77
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,550
I know what I'm doing.

78
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,040
-My Lord...
-You may leave.

79
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,800
I can't believe you're feeding the Soul Lotus with your blood.

80
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,290
Shut up.

81
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,090
It's none of your business.

82
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,280
How exactly do you feel

83
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,990
about the Lunar Lord?

84
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,230

How long did that last?

121
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:20,980
100 years.

122
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,580
100 years?

123
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,470
100 years wasn't enough

124
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,870
to remove the Hidden power inside Xing Yue's body?

125
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,410
What was hard to remove was not the Hidden power

126
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,000
but love.

127
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,790
The Demon Lord watered the Soul Lotus

128
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,610
with his blood every night

129
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,550
to help it produce spiritual energy more quickly.

130
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,670
The Hidden power inside the Lunar Lord's body

131
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,940
had been removed in the 10th year.

132
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,630
In the next 90 years,

133
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,380
day after day,

134
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,710
they never fulfilled their promise to fight.

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,240
I know

136
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,210
it's not that they couldn't.

137
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,550
They just didn't want to.

138
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,750
One was a Lunar,

139
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,460
the other a demon.

140
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,060
They were on different sides, after all.

141
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,580
That promise

142
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,280
might be their only excuse

143
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,470
to stay together for 100 years.

144
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,920
For humans,

145
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,280
100 years is a long time.

146
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,000
It may be the length of their whole life.

147
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,190
But for deities,

148
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,500
100 years is just a moment.

149
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,970
Before they noticed it,

150
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,310
they were already deeply in love

151
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,630
with each other.

152
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,850
In that case,

153
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,240
why didn't they just be together?

154
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,450
Wasn't partnering up

155
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,720
also a way to protect the world?

156
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,920
Because

157
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,350
Heaven didn't allow it.

158
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,440
The Soul Lotus seems to have gained spiritual consciousness.

159
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,540
It's inherently

160
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,940
spiritual.

161
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,370
After basking in the stellar power for 100 years,

162
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,630
it's not surprising

163
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,890
that it has gained spiritual consciousness.

164
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,440
It's been 100 years.

165
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,110
You've stayed in the Lunar Race's territory for 100 years.

166
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,180
Have the elders from your race urged you to go back?

167
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,390
They sent me letters every day to ask about my return date.

168
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,210
I think it's time for me to go back.

169
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,710
Are you going to go back first

170
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,700
or fulfill the promise of a fight first?

171
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,140
The promise of a fight?

172
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,500
Do you think it's still necessary for us to fight?

173
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,960
The tides of the Lunar Hidden Sea have ebbed and flowed for tens of thousands of years,

174
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,300
creating some crystals.

175
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,870
I found them interesting and collected them.

176
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,050
You don't like jewelry,

177
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,480
but this is made of stone.

178
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,110
You're not going to refuse it, are you?

179
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,970
Since you are about to leave,

180
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,560
why are you suddenly

181
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,560
giving me a gift?

182
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,250
If you want to know why,

183
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,370
go somewhere with me.

184
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,050
The Purple Moon.

185
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,600
The Demon Race?

186
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,650
You've never been to our territory, have you?

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,680
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

370
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,090
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

371
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,980
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

372
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,640
♫To protect the world for eternity♫

373
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,160
My Lord!

374
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,460
My Lord,

375
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,630
even though you made a divine pact with the Demon Lord

376
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,000
to help him gather his divine soul

377
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,310
and transfer the divine punishment from the Xing Yue Divine Bow

378
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,000
to yourself,

379
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,510
you can't make his feelings for you disappear.

380
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,560
As long as he is by your side,

381
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,250
and you two still love each other,

382
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,440
the divine punishment from the Xing Yue Divine Bow

383
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,160
will come again.

384
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,090
Then I'll destroy his love

385
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,870
for Xing Yue.

386
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,030
His divine power is too strong.

387
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,810
I could only seal his memory of tonight.

388
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,510
When he wakes up,

389
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,170
he won't remember the appearance of the Xing Yue Divine Arrow.

390
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,410
Xiu Yan,

391
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,170
never let him know

392
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,080
what happened tonight.

393
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,120
My Lord...

394
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,180
After tonight,

395
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,520
Xing Yue will become

396
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,320
the person

397
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,020
the Demon Lord hates the most.

398
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,180
The Lunar Lord restored everything

399
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,390
and pretended nothing had happened.

400
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,460
Jing Yuan had no memory of being hurt by the Divine Bow.

401
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,310
He followed his heart

402
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,090
and confessed his love to the Lunar Lord again.

403
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,010
That night,

404
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,610
it snowed at the Lunar Hidden Sea for the first time

405
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,050
in tens of thousands of years.

406
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,520
I heard it hasn't snowed here for tens of thousands of years.

407
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,380
We happen to see the first snow today.

408
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,730
As we see the first snow together, we can grow old together.

409
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,300
Perfect.

410
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,370
Xing Yue.

411
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,300
I want to be with you forever.

412
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,310
Will you be my partner?

413
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,470
Don't you think

414
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,150
that's a ridiculous question?

415
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,560
A deity's life is long.

416
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,200
I let you stay in Xing Yue Pavilion

417
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,590
because it's boring.

418
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,100
I don't believe that.

419
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,810
We were together for 100 years

420
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,560
just because you were

421
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,190
bored?

422
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,050
Indeed, that's not all.

423
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,520
I don’t like killing.

424
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,940
So I am willing to spend 100 years

425
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
to talk to the you

426
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,880
and become friends.

427
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,550
If you're willing to surrender

428
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,610
and protect peace in the Divine Region,

429
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,570
we can be

430
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,120
friends.

431
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,540
But what you want

432
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,750
is too much.

433
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,130
Too...

434
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,690
Too much.

435
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,870
I'm the Lunar Supreme Deity.

436
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,850
I rule the stars

437
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,560
and am as important as the heavens.

438
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,530
In my eyes,

439
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,760
everyone is

440
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,030
the same to me.

441
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,180
For peace in the Divine Region,

442
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,060
I can make friends

443
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,290
with you.

444
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,540
But if you want me to lower myself to marry you,

445
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,330
Demon Lord,

446
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,460
you're crossing the line.

447
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,580
There are so many beings...

448
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,290
There is no difference...

449
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,740
For the peace of the Divine Region,

450
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,540
you can be my friend?

451
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,270
Xing Yue.

452
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,590
We've spent 100 years together, feeling the same for each other.

453
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,500
Was it just to keep me in Lunar Race?

454
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,770
Yes.

455
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,530
What if I refuse to believe it?

456
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,880
Since you don't believe me,

457
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,650
let me tell you

458
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,730
what is important in my heart.

459
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,910
Why did you...

460
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,390
You want to know

461
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,900
why I can summon your Purple Moon

462
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,460
and even control it?

463
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,550
Because I knew

464
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,290
your power originated from Purple Moon.

465
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,270
The 100 years you've been in Xing Yue Pavilion,

466
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,970
I've been using stellar power

467
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,650
to secretly put up the stellar formation in your body.

468
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,880
So much so I can fully control the source of your divine power.

469
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,210
That's impossible.

470
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,060
Why didn't I notice it?

471
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,170
Of course you didn't.

472
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,160
You cultivate the Soul Lotus with your divine blood every day

473
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,680
and thus your divine soul is unstable.

474
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,810
While it's not easy

475
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,330
to hide it from you

476
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,790
and control your weakness,

477
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,600
it's not difficult either.

478
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,180
You know...

479
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,930
You know what I do every day?

480
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,530
You took advantage of the time I–

481
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,440
It doesn’t matter.

482
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,490
As long as I can

483
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,530
achieve my goal.

484
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,630
Very well...

485
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,820
Good.

486
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,230
Good...

487
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,930
Xing Yue.

488
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,390
Even if you kept me in Xing Yue Pavilion for 100 years

489
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,350
just to control the source of my divine primal power...

490
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,720
Even if you did all this

491
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,370
just for the so-called peace of the Divine Region...

492
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,790
What about our companionship over these 100 years?

493
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,100
We've been together for 100 years.

494
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,110
What am I to you?

495
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,790
In these 100 years...

496
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,130
Have you ever...

497
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,490
truly cared for me?

498
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,600
No.

499
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,150
Never.

it's meaningless...

515
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,770
I don't intend to start a fight between the Three Races.

516
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,400
Purple Moon will return to its owner.

517
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,920
You just need to remember

518
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,950
as long as you don't start a war

519
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,700
and help me protect the peace of the Divine Region,

520
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,360
I will never activate

I fell in love,

534
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,820
ignoring your punishment.

535
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,230
Please punish me by sealing off my Contemplations!

536
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,320
Divine Lord!

537
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,500
Stop it!

538
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,440
You received divine punishment in Demon Lord's place.

539
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,220
If you use the power of the Divine Bow to seal your Contemplations now,

540
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,700
you will die!

541

No one from the Lunar Race is allowed here.

549
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,310

But your body...

554
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,130
I'm fine.

555
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,760
♫Love is the hardest thing to understand♫

556
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,620
Why didn't you tell Demon Lord the truth?

557
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,870
Why must you bear it all by yourself?

558
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:56,290
♫I'm finally back to where it all started♫

559
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,480
He doesn't know

560
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,810
what you did for him.

561
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,930
He doesn't even know he had died once

562
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,640
under the divine punishment of

563
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:03,270
♫All the answers are already explained♫

564
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,620
the Xing Yue Divine Bow.

565
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,730
You suffered everything for him,

566
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,570
but he only has hate for you.

567
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,040
♫I'll owe you all of my life♫

568
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,690
Is it worth it?

569
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,810
♫But we're destined to part♫

570
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:17,620
♫How can I downplay this?♫

571
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,150
The world is not this simple.

572
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,070
It can't be measured that way.

573
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:21,489
♫When you engrave your love into my heart♫

574
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,370
He's not wrong.

575
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,590
It's my fault that

576
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,989
♫When my star falls only for you♫

577
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,409
Heaven doesn't accept him.

578
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,300
♫When the heavens fall♫

579
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:32,860
♫I can still connect with you through the waning moon♫

580
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,480
Divine Lord.

581
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,120
♫When my pain blurs my eyes♫

582
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,830
♫Out of the countless stars, I see only you♫

583
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:49,900
♫As you turn into a falling star and crash into my heart♫

584
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,110
Xing Yue.

585
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,860
I will remember

586
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,679
what you said today.

587
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,450
When I get out of here,

588
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,040
I'll get back at you

589
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,400
for all the humiliation you've put me through today.

590
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,150
Mo Li!

591
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,360
You cultivated with evil magic

592
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,380
and harmed the people.

593
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,490
When the Divine Region finds out,

594
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,090
they will punish you!

595
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,980
No one will know about this

596
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,340
before I succeed.

597
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,410
Because those who know

598
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,260
will die.

599
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,490
Divine Lord.

600
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,650
Demon Lord challenged Night Lord

601
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,230
and was seriously injured in Lunar Hidden Sea.

602
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,810
It has spread throughout the Divine Region.

603
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,950
Got it. Take your leave.

604
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:40,970
Yes.

605
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,670
Jing Yuan...

606
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,340
Even I can't win her heart.

607
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,870
Do you think the Xing Yue will fall in love with you

608
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,860
just by being with her for a hundred years?

609
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,890
How can you do

610
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,800
what I can't do?

611
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,910
Where have you been?

612
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,400
Took you long enough to come back.

613
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,800
The stellar power hasn't subsided yet.

614
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,530
It's not enough.

615
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,080
I need to absorb

616
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,510
more Lunar and demon divine souls.

617
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,840
The Lunar Race has been in charge of the world for thousands of years.

618
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,050
It's time for a  change.

619
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,540
Hidden power can destroy everything?

620
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,640
People only know that the Three Races of the Divine Region have different powers

621
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,050
and are incompatible.

622
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,730
But no one ever thought that

623
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,230
by combining the divine souls and. power of Three Races

624
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,000
can produce the power to destroy everything.

625
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,470
And this evil magic

626
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,620
was seen by Mo Li.

627
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,570
He used evil magic to strengthen his Hidden Power

628
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,520
and sowed the seeds of destruction.

629
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,150
What about Xing Yue?

630
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,440
Can't she stop it?

631
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,230
Didn't she use the power of the Xing Yue Divine Bow

632
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,670
to seal off the Love Contemplation again?

633
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,960
Love Contemplation is not a static thing.

634
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,110
Sometimes people can't control themselves either.

635
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,130
The Divine Lord has been trying to remove her love for Jing Yuan.

636
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,800
But her love for Jing Yuan is way too deep;

637
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,400
just like spring grass in the wilderness,

638
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,980
it's infinite

639
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,450
and indestructible.

640
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,910
She didn't expect that

641
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,030
even the strongest power in the world

642
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,670
can't stop her feelings.

643
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,100
The love between Xing Yue and Jing Yuan

644
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,850
is so deep.

645
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,670
Since Divine Lord was

646
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:14,400
unable to seal her Contemplations,

647
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,110
her divine power began to deteriorate.

648
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,840
She was originally transformed by the power of heaven and earth.

649
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,620
The decline of her divine power

650
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,670
means

651
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,790
deities will fall.

652
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,360
But the only person who can help her

653
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,870
became the person who hates her the most.

654
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,960
What did Jing Yuan do?

655
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,870
Jing Yuan entered the Demon Race's secret realm

656
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,220
and cultivated in seclusion.

657
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,580
The Demon Race's secret realm contains strong spiritual energy.

658
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,730
It can help cultivate demonic power quickly.

659
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,730
But 100,000 fierce beasts are also trapped in there.

660
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,800
Those who enter the secret realm

661
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,740
can never survive.

662
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,210
But in order to remove the stellar power within the Purple Moon,

663
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,190
Jing Yuan has been in the secret realm for three years.

664
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,550
In those three years,

665
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,630
due to the decline of divine power,

666
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,310
Divine Lord was sleeping most of the time.

667
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,340
The existence of a Divine Lord

668
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,660
is the foundation of peace in the Divine Region.

669
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,130
She can't let anyone know about this.

670
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,300
Unexpectedly,

671
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,360
after Jing Yuan left the secret realm,

672
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,520
he started the Divine War with the Lunar Race.

673
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,110
The Lunar Race was defeated

674
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,900
and Elder Chang Qing was captured.

675
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,280
Those of the Lunar Race didn't know about Divine Lord's situation

676
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,620
and asked for her

677
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,080
to save Chang Qing.

678
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,510
Divine Lord, you can't go to the Demon Race.

679
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,660
How long did I sleep this time?

680
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,650
10 days.

681
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,860
Divine Lord,

682
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,070
I'll go to the Demon Race in your stead

683
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,600
to save Elder Chang Qing.

684
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,820
I can feel that

685
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,640
he has erased my seal on the Purple Moon.

686
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,570
It's useless for you to go.

687
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,820
But now Demon Lord hate you so much.

688
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,310
In your current condition,

689
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,720
you will definitely lose

690
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,000
in a fight with him.

691
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,710
It's just win or lose.

692
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,660
He just wants to get back at me.

693
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,620
I owe him.

694
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:09,450
Divine Lord,

695
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,470
if you are trapped there

696
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,780
and can't return to Xing Yue Platform to seal your Contemplation,

697
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,690
your divine power will disappear faster.

698
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,870
I know.

699
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,450
I knew you would come.

700
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,240
But I didn't expect it to be so soon.

701
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,900
It seems that not everyone is insignificant

702
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,930
in your eyes.

703
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,480
Where is Chang Qing?

704
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,100
Since I promised to exchange his life for you to come,

705
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,610
he is still alive.

706
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,250
In that case,

707
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,160
Demon Lord,

708
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,750
let's fight.

709
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,220
You're not using the Xing Yue Bow

710
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,870
to fight with me?

711
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,760
Are you overestimating yourself

712
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,930
or are you despising me?

713
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,150
I have an old agreement

714
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,590
with you.

715
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,030
If we were to fight,

716
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,550
it will be fair.

717
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:11,930
An old agreement?

718
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,820
If you said this three years ago,

719
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,770
I might think it's because

720
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,630
you love me deeply

721
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,140
and you're pitying me out of that.

722
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,970
Therefore, you couldn't bear to hurt me.

723
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,210
But I've seen

724
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,060
your true colors three years ago.

725
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:48,250
It's really memorable.

726
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
I dare not forget it for even a day.

727
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,620
Since you still remember,

728
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,800
there's no need to waste time to reminisce the past.

729
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,230
I have a lot to do.

730
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,920
I have no time to waste here.

731
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,300
Jing Yuan.

732
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,140
Where is Chang Qing?

733
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,490
Why so anxious?

734
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,780
I put so much effort in asking you here.

735
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:16,160
Of course there's a big gift I have for you.

736
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,890
Why does this look like...

737
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,470
Xing Yue Pavilion?

738
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:41,960
With Purple Moon in the sky,

739
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,810
this is still my demonic realm.

740
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,880
This is

741
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,410
I made it after  Xing Yue Pavilion.

742
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,680
Do you like it?

743
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,910
Jing Yuan.

744
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,710
What are you trying to do?

745
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,840
I want you to tell the Divine Region that

746
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,520
the Supreme Deity Xing Yue will be marrying into the Demon Race.

747
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,850
In 10 days,

748
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,420
you'll be marrying me.
