00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,910
[Episode 14]

19
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,650
One.

20
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,970
Given Chong Zhao's current situation,

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,190
it'll be difficult for him to break through the encirclement of the Outlander Palace.

22
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,400
Fan Yue has taken the last pill today.

23
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,430
His memory might return tonight.

24
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,410
Two.

25
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,120
As long as we can hold on until then,

26
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,330
there will be a chance,

27
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,570
and Chong Zhao and the others

28
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,430
will survive too.

29
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,610
Three.

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,150
Fan Yue!

31
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:11,750
Fan Yue!

32
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,410
I choose Fan Yue.

33
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,170
See?

34
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,640
At the critical moment,

35
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,310
Bai Shuo eventually chose Fan Yue.

36
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:31,420
What she cares about the most has never been you.

37
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,320
You've never been

38
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,710
in her heart.

39
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,990
Chong Zhao,

40
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,890
you should see that now.

41
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,160
No matter whether it's Eternals or Humans,

42
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,180
you've been protecting them,

43
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,890
but when have they ever truly protected you?

44
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,060
When have they ever cared about your thoughts?

45
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,780
It would be better to join the Cold Spring Palace.

46
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,360
Not only can you survive,

47
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,640
but you can also do

48
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,450
whatever you want from then on.

49
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,140
Lady Fu Ling, have you enjoyed yourself?

50
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,200
Master!

51
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,400
General, it's all thanks to

52
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,840
the elixir you made for me

53
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,720
that I can temporarily use spiritual power.

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,970
I've been researching this elixir for many years.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,230
It's only today

56
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,300
that I managed to succeed in making it.

57
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,370
My Lady,

58
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,010
it's time to get down to business.

59
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,710
What do you want?

60
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,490
You should return the spiritual bone you owe Hua Yong now.

61
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,250
As for the interest from these seven years,

62
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,010
your life will serve as payment.

63
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,220
Using the Heart Flame as the catalyst,

64
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,560
and the bloodline as the sacrifice,

65
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,590
the fusion of Eternal and demon blood

66
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,590
can forge a deity!

67
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,880
The Outlanders' City

68
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,490
will soon have its own deity!

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,470
Creating a deity?

70
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,740
The Contemplation Stone is a divine object

71
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,710
from ancient times, belonging to Goddess Xingyue of the Lunar Race.

72
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,840
60,000 years ago, during the Divine War, the deities perished,

73
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,420
the Contemplation Stone was damaged,

74
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,940
and no one has been able to activate it since.

75
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,580
-Humans
-Boss,

76
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,930
-are the most complex beings in the world.
-are you an Eternal?

77
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,730
How dare you ask me

78
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,130
if I am an Eternal?

79
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,800
Silver Sea?

80
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,850
Is this the legendary

81
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,930
Lunar Hidden Sea?

82
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,220
How to activate the Contemplation Stone?

83
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,960
Divine visions.

84
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,250
The Contemplation Stone is a divine object.

85
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,960
To reactivate the Contemplation Stone,

86
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,210
we must gather

87
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,370
the Five Contemplations—love, hate, kill, greed,

88
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,510
and kindness.

89
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,310
Let go of me!

90
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,080
Young Master?

91
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,150
These bastards!

92
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,370
Why did you get captured too?

93
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,409
Something major happened in the Underground Palace.

94
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,240
Tonight,

95
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,159
all the Eternals and demons

96
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,400
will become Hua Yong's sacrifices.

97
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,430
What? Sacrifices?

98
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,110
Sacrifice?

99
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,740
I did it.

100
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,800
Hua Yong,

101
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,260
come here.

102
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,980
I'm your master.

103
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,710
Didn't the master say that

104
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,100
even if Hua Yong becomes a deity,

105
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,570
he would still recognize me as his master

106
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,720
and work for me?

107
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,960
Why is there no response?

108
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,820
That's because...

109
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,660
the formation was wrong.

110
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,770
The formation was wrong?

111
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,200
The formation was wrong? The formation was wrong?

112
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,980
What Grand Master taught you

113
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,860
is not a formation to create a deity,

114
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,230
but a formation to kill.

115
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,630
Gathering the will to kill

116
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,970
and creating a killing weapon.

117
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,080
And Hua Yong

118
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,110
happens to be that weapon.

119
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,270
Wu Zhao,

120
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,870
actually, from the beginning,

121
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,870
you were just a tool

122
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,770
that could be discarded at any time.

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Crawl! Crawl!

124
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,480
Crawl!

125
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,810
Crawl harder!

126
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,350
Crawl! Crawl!

127
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,150
Crawl!

128
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,200
Keep crawling!

129
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Why did you stop?

130
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,870
-Crawl! Crawl!
-Keep crawling!

132
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,410

It can't be eaten now.

134
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,130
My name is Mei Han.

135
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,300
What's your name?

136
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,950
It's so cold outside.

♫The pain of parting lingers♫

138
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,130

142
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,320
Why Hua Yong of all people?

143
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,060
It was all thanks to you.

144
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,370
Hua Yong has undergone a mutation.

145
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,150
He's the best vessel for killing intent.

146
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,640
He'll grow strong enough

147
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,460
to pull out the Outlander King's Sword.

148
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,180
Your goal is not in the Outlanders' City.

149
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,110
What's the use of pulling out the Outlander King's Sword?

150
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,070
Of course, it's to open your heart

151
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,450
and obtain the Contemplation Stone.

152
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,890
This Outlander King's Sword

153
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,080
was forged by the first King of Outlanders

154
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,480
using meteoric iron imbued with divine power.

155
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,790
No other weapon can do it,

156
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,320
but this sword can.

157
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,040
Hua Yong,

158
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,060
pull out the sword.

159
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,400
Fu Ling,

160
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,480
stop him!

161
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,860
Using a divine sword to get the divine stone.

162
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,140
Dying here today

163
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,450

Killing Contemplation.

168
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,260
The Outlanders' City restricts magic.

169
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,150
How can you still use spiritual power?

170
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,900
The biggest mistake you made

171
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,190
was daring to harm my girl.

172
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,860
What happened?

173
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,870
Why is the Outlanders' City shaking?

174
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,320
Shuo!

175
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,860
Zhao!

176
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,710
The Underground Palace is about to collapse!

177
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,040
How can we stop the collapse?

178
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,120
We need to put the Outlander King's Sword back into its sword stand!

♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

190
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,370
♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

191
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,030
Is this...

192
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,780
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

193
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,910
formed by the power of the Outlander King's Sword?

194
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,840
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

195
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,140
♫The daylight burns through, and the stars shine bright♫

196
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,210
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

197
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,100
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

198
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,420
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

199
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,390
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

200
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,890
♫To protect the world for eternity♫

201
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,240
Fan Yue!

202
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,450
Fan Yue!

203
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:58,870
Master!

204
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,490
Aren't you a Demon King?

205
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,000
How could a Demon King die?

206
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,520
Fan Yue!

207
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:10,780
Fan Yue!

208
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,070
Fan Yue!

209
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,570
Fan Yue!

210
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,300
Fan Yue?

211
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,260
Fan Yue?

212
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,510
Fan Yue? Fan Yue!

213
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,780
Stop shaking me.

214
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,130
I'm just a little tired.

215
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,090
I want to take a nap.

216
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,140
You have tamed the Outlander King's Sword.

217
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,670
The spirit of the Outlander King's Sword has turned into a ring and recognized you as its master.

218
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,110
Bai Shuo,

219
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,530
you can become the new King of Outlanders.

220
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,910
I never wanted to be a king.

221
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,910
I just want to walk my own path.

222
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,109
It's a good thing if she takes the Outlander King's Ring.

223
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,220
From now on, this city

224
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,349
will no longer be caught up in the struggle for power.

225
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,510
Hua Yong,

226
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,020
you can walk your own path now.

227
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,210
[Sihai Inn]

228
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,390
[Rejuvenation Pill]

229
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,290
The Formation Key to Rong Xian's realm of resentment has been removed,

230
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,750
and the city's barrier has been opened.

231
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,280
Nan Wan has also brought the Wutong Spirit Pill

232
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,750
back to his younger brother.

233
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,830
We can leave now.

234
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,520
The Outlanders' City restricts magic.

235
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,240
Why was he able to unleash spiritual power?

236
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,320
Why did he

237
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,620
become like this?

238
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,150
I'm not sure either.

239
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,220
Ask him when he wakes up.

240
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,890
Take care of him.

241
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,440
I'll go...

242
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,640
You want to save Chong Zhao?

243
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,120
He was taken by Fu Ling?

244
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,610
I've already sent a disciple named Le Zhu

245
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,670
to inform Lanling.

246
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,910
Chong Zhao is the head disciple of Lanling.

247
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,510
It would be much more effective

248
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,710
to have the Five Eternals of Jin Yao save him.

249
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,710
Actually, you don't need to worry so much about his safety.

250
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,880
It seems someone would protect him.

251
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,330
What do you mean?

252
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,280
In the Underground Palace, the demonic flower armor that protected Chong Zhao

253
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,430
was transformed from Fu Ling's protective demon flower.

254
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,490
What kind of bond do you think

255
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,290
could make Fu Ling willing to save him like that?

256
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,210
Besides,

257
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,980
there's someone here who needs you more.

258
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,920
Tian Huo,

259
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,890
someone is looking for you outside.

260
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,720
Who is it?

261
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,790
I'm sorry,

262
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,480
Hua Yong.

263
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,450
Sister.

264
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,750
It's because of me that you had to endure so much pain.

265
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,620
If I had come back earlier

266
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,790
to face everything,

267
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,560
and if I

268
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,610
had trusted you back then,

269
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,580
maybe Father wouldn't have...

270
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,620
None of this is your fault.

271
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,750
When we were children,

272
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,670
I said I would protect you.

273
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,350
I failed.

274
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,110
No.

275
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,740
You've always been protecting me.

276
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,520
From the very beginning,

277
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,720
you were the best person.

278
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,810
Sister,

279
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,860
are you still leaving?

280
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,680
I have someone I must protect.

281
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,680
But I'll come back often to see you.

282
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,830
What are your plans

283
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,850
for the future?

284
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,880
The Outlanders' City needs to be rebuilt.

285
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,190
I want to rebuild it

286
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,340
with my people.

287
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,130
Does everyone really not plan to leave?

288
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,040
We used to be discriminated against,

289
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,170
so we harbored resentment

290
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,470
and felt inferior.

291
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,490
We always wanted to change the way Eternals and demons viewed us

292
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,430
and have them accept us.

293
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,690
But now I understand that

294
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,240
the meaning of the Outlanders' existence

295
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,470
isn't decided by others,

296
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,700
but by ourselves.

297
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,450
As long as we live confidently

298
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,080
and with integrity,

299
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,590
we don't need to care about how other races view us.

300
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,220
Moreover, the divine power of the Contemplation Stone

301
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,810
has now merged into the Outlander King's Sword,

302
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,050
allowing the Outlanders' City to continue forever.

303
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,420
Our people are more willing to stay

304
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
and rebuild the city.

305
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,450
You've really grown up.

306
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,760
Aren't you the same?

307
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,100
Actually, I'm here

308
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,470
to ask Ms. Bai to become the king of the Outlanders' City.

309
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,980
The spirit of the Outlander King's Sword recognized Ms. Bai as its master,

310
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,200
and she saved the Outlanders' City.

311
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,190
We all hope

312
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,910
she will become the new king of the Outlanders' City.

313
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,710
The Outlanders' City already has a new king.

314
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,760
It's you.

315
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,640
How could I?

316
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,730
Why not?

317
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,590
Compassion,

318
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,250
justice,

319
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:36,880
and mercy

320
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,680
are the most important qualities for a ruler.

321
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,830
You have them all.

322
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,380
You love your people more than anyone else.

323
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,300
Compared to me,

324
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,190
You're more suited to be the King of Outlanders.

325
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,280
Hua Yong,

326
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,510
I believe you can lead the Outlanders' City

327
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,030
down a different path.

328
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,400
Besides,

329
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,270
I have things I must do

330
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,120
and can't stay here.

331
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,940
Ms. Bai,

332
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,770
Sister,

333
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,700
I will protect this city well.

334
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,140
If one day,

335
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,540
you're tired from your travels,

336
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,810
remember,

337
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,080
this city is your home too.

338
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,520
Fan Yue!

339
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,520
Wait a moment.

340
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,370
You go out first.

341
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,990
Wait.

342
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,170
-Go.
-What's wrong with him?

343
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,500
Master.

344
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,400
Master!

345
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,170
Fan Yue!

346
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,600
What should we do?

347
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,390
Another one has fallen.

348
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,870
Now there are only two stars left.

349
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,140
Can Master hold on until the Five Thoughts are gathered?

350
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,260
Don't say such discouraging things!

351
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,150
Until the last moment,

352
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,740
there is always hope.

353
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,100
What exactly is this thing on him?

354
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,570
I've seen it before.

355
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,960
I thought it was just a totem.

356
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,140
But it's not,

357
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:05,900
right?

358
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,200
At this point,

359
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,430
are you still not gonna tell me?

360
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,790
He's currently taking my medicine,

361
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,880
so he's my patient.

362
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,460
If you want me to cure him,

363
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,090
you have to tell me the cause of his illness.

364
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,450
Otherwise, how could I possibly cure him?

365
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,810
Master's illness can't be cured by elixirs.

366
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,280
What does this mean?

367
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,510
Shi Tou.

368
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Take care of Master.

369
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,740
Come with me.

370
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,900
Do you still remember

371
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,310
the secret room you broke into

372
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,510
at the Bright Moon Palace?

373
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,420
Yes.

374
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,590
There were many nameplates

375
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,130
with names engraved on them.

376
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,550
Those names represent

377
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,660
Master's deceased clan members.

378
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,490
[Qi Feng]

379
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,850
I guessed some things when I was in the Outlanders' City.

380
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,080
And I understood

381
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,780
why he was so angry at that time.

382
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,770
But how does this relate to his illness?

383
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,460
To seek revenge,

384
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,250
Master forced himself to grow stronger.

385
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,070
He practiced

386
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,440
all the powerful demonic techniques.

387
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,540
Different techniques clashed,

388
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,410
causing severe backlash.

389
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,630
This is similar to how you wanted to become stronger before.

390
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,180
But the difference is,

391
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,140
back then,

392
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,860
he was all alone,

393
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,260
with no one to teach or protect him.

394
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,980
All he could do was practice

395
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,650
day and night,

396
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,980
risking his life.

397
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,170
The Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal on his chest

398
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,320
is the backlash left from that time.

399
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,620
Every time a star falls,

400
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,760
Master has to bear the burning pain of his heart and soul,

401
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,760
just like now.

402
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,990
Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal?

403
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,010
The name was coined by Cang Shan.

404
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,970
Seven stars,

405
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,660
burning the soul.

406
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,760
It sounds simple,

407
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,590
but it's a deadly danger.

408
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,970
So now, only two stars are still shining.

409
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,660
What does it mean?

410
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,920
It means Master

411
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,630
only has two chances left before the stars fall completely.

412
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,560
Once all seven stars are extinguished,

413
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,920
he will perish.

414
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,640
How can I save him?

415
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,890
You're the only one who can save Master.

416
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,210
As long as the Five Contemplations are gathered

417
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,840
and the divine power of the Wunian Stone is activated,

418
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,090
the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal can be lifted.

419
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,070
This is why you must

420
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,790
activate the Contemplation Stone?

421
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,870
I thought you wanted the divine stone

422
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,010
for some other purpose.

423
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,960
All along this journey, it has been so difficult

424
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,960
and dangerous.

425
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,300
It turns out you just want to save his life.

426
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,340
Master's life is more important than anything.

427
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,570
No matter the cost,

428
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,130
I will do everything in my power to save him.

429
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,750
I've always been curious about one thing.

430
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,670
People all say that the Master of Bright Moon

431
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,990
is ruthless, cold-hearted,

432
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,460
and bloodthirsty.

433
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,240
As the Outlanders' princess,

434
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,990
you're willing to serve him

435
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,770
and remain loyal to him.

436
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,470
Have you never doubted him,

437
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,580
or questioned him?

438
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,170
That's because

439
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,870
you've never truly understood who he is.

440
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,430
Let's go.

441
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,520
You've gained a lot.

442
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,140
She's a beauty.

443
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,550
Hurry up.

444
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,870
Let's go.

445
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,920
When a person dies,

446
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,330
they become nothing more than a speck of dust in the world.

447
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,830
No one will care.

448
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,740
If you're unwilling to be humiliated

449
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,770
or be bullied,

450
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,340
then strive to live on.

451
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,680
Master,

452
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,350
today we, the Wolf Clan, come to pledge allegiance.

453
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,650
The lives of the Rabbit Clan

454
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,430
are our gift to you.

455
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,720
Everyone says that Master is bloodthirsty.

456
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,700
But they don't know

457
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,780
that sometimes he kills

458
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,620
to stop further bloodshed.

459
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,290
Everyone fears the Bright Moon Palace.

460
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,770
But what is truly powerful is never the demons

461
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,350
taken in by the Bright Moon Palace,

462
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,970
but Master himself.

463
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,810
Because only when he is strong enough

464
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,260
can he protect the homeless

465
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,700
and weak little demons

466
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,280
in the predatory Demon Race.

467
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,960
I follow Master,

468
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,290
not because of his strength,

469
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,060
but because of his compassion—

470
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,030
the compassion of Fan Yue, the Master of Bright Moon.

471
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,490
This time, after leaving the Outlanders' City,

472
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,870
Master chose to come to the Unbridled Pavilion

473
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:43,510
♫No matter if I'm drunk or not, I just want to be reckless once♫

474
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,310
because he didn't want the little demons

475
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,400
of the Bright Moon Palace

476
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,880
to see his weakness

477
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,850
and worry for him.

478
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,030
♫Because love is thrilling♫

479
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,300
His endurance

480
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,140
has never been just for you,

481
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,280
but for everyone.

482
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,250
♫If you tear open my heart♫

483
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,220
♫I can hold you a little tighter♫

484
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,280
It seems I've never truly understood him.

485
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:03,260
♫This pain will gradually fade♫

486
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,610
People live with a purpose.

487
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,660
Some live for dignity;

488
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,530
Some live for loyalty.

489
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,560
♫Time withers the moonlight♫

490
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,180
But Master just wants to survive.

491
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,220
I've been by his side for so many years,

492
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,480
♫All that's left is pitch darkness♫

493
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,550
and I used to think that

494
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,300
nothing could be more important to him than this.

495
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,540
♫I want to tear apart♫

496
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,240
♫This sky for you♫

497
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,960
But now, I'm not so sure.

498
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,530
What exactly are you trying to say?

499
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,120
♫A lifetime of guarding everything with you♫

500
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,430
You know what I'm talking about.

501
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,590
All the way here,

502
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,810
♫Crossing the abyss to fulfill our vow♫

503
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,580
you know better than I do whether Master

504
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,130
has seen you as a tool

505
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,930
♫I'll leap without a thought for tomorrow♫

506
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,720
or someone he cares about.

507
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,790
♫This moment feels like forever♫

508
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,280
I've put a lot of effort

509
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,910
into the scheme in the Outlanders' City.

510
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,050
I used the strategy of creating a deity to deceive Hua Lin,

511
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,490
the path to becoming king

512
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,950
to lure Wu Zhao,

513
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,370
and the power of the divine sword

514
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,850
to open her heart and take the stone.

515
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,830
Fu Ling,

516
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,560
tell me,

517
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,350
which step in my plan

518
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,380
has a flaw?

519
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,120
Grand Master, your plan

520
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,230
was meticulous

521
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:58,930
and flawless.

522
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,240
Flawless?

523
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,580
My biggest flaw

524
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,870
was sending you

525
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,660
to the Outlanders' City to oversee it.

526
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,770
It was my fault.

527
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,590
I'm willing to accept your punishment.

528
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,290
Although the plan failed,

529
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,930
it wasn't without gain.

530
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,930
We've already lost,

531
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,790
and you still have excuses?

532
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,260
It's still too early

533
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,700
to say we've lost.

534
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,630
Grand Master,

535
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,370
in the Outlanders' City,

536
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,020
I discovered Fan Yue's secret.

537
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,710
As everyone knows, the Outlanders' City restricts magic,

538
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,140
and spiritual power cannot be used there.

539
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,600
But at the last moment, Fan Yue broke through

540
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,460
the Magic Restriction, unleashed his spiritual power,

541
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,200
and destroyed the altar.

542
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,360
That caused the plan to completely fall apart.

543
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,110
The Wutong Martial Arts Contest has been ongoing for more than 1000 years,

544
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,540
and the Magic Restriction in the Outlanders' City is a 1000-year-old rule.

545
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,160
Although Fan Yue is a Demon King,

546
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,770
he shouldn't have such power.

547
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,030
Fu Ling,

548
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,340
deceiving Grand Master

549
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,760
is an even greater crime.

550
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,840
In the Underground Palace,

551
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,170
I saw with my own eyes

552
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,890
a Big Dipper-shaped totem

553
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,260
glowing on Fan Yue's chest,

554
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,890
with stars flashing on it.

555
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,090
After that,

556
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,890
Fan Yue unleashed his spiritual power.

557
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,650
A Big Dipper-shaped totem?

558
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,750
Yes.

559
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,080
It seems that

560
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,000
those stars

561
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,370
hide some mystery.

562
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,300
Get up.

563
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,610
Find out

564
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,020
what the deal with the stars is.

565
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,670
Yes, Grand Master.

566
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,180
Whether or not the stars were the reason

567
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,670
for Fan Yue's sudden unleashing of spiritual power,

568
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,520
as long as I cultivate this evil insect,

569
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,690
Fan Yue

570
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,200
will no longer be a threat.

571
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,880
Tell me.

572
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,710
This evil insect requires the marrow of 999 demons,

573
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,820
the veins of 999 Eternals,

574
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,600
and the lives of 999 humans

575
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,750
to be combined for its cultivation,

576
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,640
which can capture souls.

577
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,500
No matter how strong the opponent's spiritual power is,

578
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,510
they will be controlled by this evil insect

579
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,520
and become a puppet.

580
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,450
Look at him.

581
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,850
Although he doesn't leave the Cold Spring Palace,

582
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,060
he always helps alleviate my worries.

583
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,730
Since this evil insect

584
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,560
requires so many ingredients,

585
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,010
Fu Ling,

586
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,910
whether you can redeem yourself

587
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,310
depends on you.

588
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,170
Yes.

589
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,640
I will carry out the task.

590
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,760
I heard that Lady Fu Ling

591
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,640
brought a guest back to the Cold Spring Palace.

592
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:14,930
How about

593
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,330
we offer him as the first sacrifice

594
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,030
to the evil insect?

595
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,840
He is my guest.

596
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,350
I don't need you to meddle.

597
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,770
I promised you that

598
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,870
within a month,

599
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,300
I would make Chong Zhao become a demon.

600
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,260
There are five days left until the one-month deadline.

601
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
After five days,

602
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,110
if Chong Zhao hasn't joined the Cold Spring Palace,

603
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,520
I will

604
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,660
offer him to this evil insect myself.

605
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,370
If you fail again,

606
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,420
he will be the first sacrifice,

607
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,600
and you may be the second.

608
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,770
Your insect

609
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,510
can't eat me yet.

610
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,440
Zhao!

611
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,570
Shuo?

612
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,850
You abducted me here?

613
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,090
This is the Cold Spring Palace?

614
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,300
Abduct?

615
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,810
Have you forgotten?

616
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,060
In the Underground Palace of the Outlanders' City, a giant rock collapsed.

617
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,240
If it weren't for me,

618
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,290
you'd already be meat paste by now.

619
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,710
I want to go back to the Outlanders' City.

620
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,920
You're still thinking about going back to save Bai Shuo?

621
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,270
She only has Fan Yue in her heart.

622
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:56,930
When you were about to die,

623
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:57,750
did she even care about you?

624
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,450
My business is none of your concern.

625
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,550
None of your concern?

626
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,040
What is this?

627
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,760
My protective demon flower.

628
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,020
It saved you.

629
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:17,590
Chong Zhao,

630
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,250
you owe me a favor, whether you like it or not.

631
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,760
Even if I have to die,

632
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,870
I won't owe you anything.

633
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,570
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

634
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:48,679
♫The flowers that bloomed once in a lifetime♫

635
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,920
In the Underground Palace of the Outlanders' City,

636
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:53,310
♫I remember that word of concern♫

637
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,770
Bai Shuo chose for you to die.

638
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,110
But your heart is full of her.

639
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,050
♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

640
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,270
I let you survive,

641
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,960
but you hate me deeply.

642
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,490
Since that's the case,

643
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,450
♫I remember that drop of tear♫

644
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,670
I will destroy everything you care about.

645
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,700
You love Bai Shuo,

646
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,670
♫It dried in the wind♫

647
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,390
so I will make her beg for death.

648
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,670
You respect Lanling,

649
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,190
♫The one in the autumn wind♫

650
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,920
so I will make Lanling restless.

651
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:11,100
♫How many times have I seen you in my dreams?♫

652
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,510
What exactly

653
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,250
do you want?

654
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,150
♫That year, that year♫

655
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,500
What do I want?

656
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,030
♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

657
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,130
♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

658
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,480
♫They unfold, one page after another♫

659
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,540
Since I'm in hell,

660
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,750
♫That year, that year♫

661
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,310
Chong Zhao,

662
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,170
come and keep me company.

663
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,390
♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

664
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,150
♫Falling to the mud, burying the memories♫

665
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,140
This old worm is getting bolder.

666
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,920
He dared to harbor murderous intent

667
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,270
against all the Eternals and demons in the city,

668
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,690
and even captured our head disciple,

669
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,470
Chong Zhao.

670
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,670
Sect Leader, please give the order,

671
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,400
and I will immediately lead the troops to rescue Chong Zhao

672
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,580
and destroy the Cold Spring Palace!

673
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,950
Can you be quiet?

674
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,870
If destroying the Cold Spring Palace were really that easy,

675
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,580
the chaos in the Outlanders' City wouldn't have happened.

676
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,890
But the Cold Spring Palace has always been ruthless.

677
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,190
Will Chong Zhao

678
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,480
be...

679
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,980
No.

680
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,580
If Fu Ling truly wanted to kill Chong Zhao,

681
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,760
she wouldn't have gone through so much effort to save him.

682
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,790
Since the Cold Spring Palace saved Chong Zhao,

683
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,250
perhaps...

684
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
Perhaps what?

685
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,530
Perhaps

686
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,040
Chong Zhao is a part

687
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,640
of the Cold Spring Palace's plan.

688
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,570
A part of the plan?

689
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,070
Yan Huo's analysis was right.

690
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,010
The Cold Spring Palace's conspiracy

691
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,080
must be far more complex than it appears.

692
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,880
The sacrifice of all the Eternals and demons in the city

693
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,510
doesn't seem like a pure trick.

694
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,830
The motive behind Zhen Yu's desire to take the Contemplation Stone

695
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,300
must conceal other secrets.

696
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,860
There are too many unknowns

697
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,230
that need to be investigated further.

698
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,110
So, Senior, what's your plan?

699
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,900
This matter is too serious and requires careful consideration.

700
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,730
I will find an opportunity to infiltrate the Cold Spring Palace.

701
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,650
Once I see Chong Zhao,

702
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,310
I'll make a decision.

703
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,490
You're awake?

704
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,560
You've been here all this time?

705
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:47,910
Of course.

706
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,220
I mean,

707
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,310
of course I should stay by your side.

708
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,490
If you died,

709
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,030
who would help me activate the Contemplation Stone?

710
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,550
Shuo!

711
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,530
The Outlanders' City restricts magic.

712
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,410
How did you break the restriction?

713
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,790
It was just a coincidence.

714
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,810
A coincidence?

715
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,900
Just by coincidence,

716
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,990
you were able to break the thousand-year-old restriction of the Outlanders' City?

717
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,760
Fan Yue,

718
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,370
your ability to break the restriction

719
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,620
is related to your Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal,

720
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,490
right?

721
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,070
Did Tian Huo and Cang Shan told you this?

722
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,810
Don't blame them. I forced them.

723
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,230
Tell me the truth,

724
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,300
did you save me

725
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,330
at the cost of losing a star?

726
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,680
It wasn't just to save you.

727
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,220
If the Outlander King's Sword had been destroyed,

728
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,560
the Outlanders' City would have been destroyed too,

729
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,660
and everyone would have died.

730
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,800
But at that time, the Outlander King's Sword

731
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,270
had already been returned to its stand.

732
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,530
Even if you hadn't blocked for me,

733
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,250
I would have been the only one to die.

734
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,810
You've been asking so many questions.

735
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,280
What answer

736
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,650
are you hoping to hear from me?

737
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,160
How much do you remember about

738
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,470
what happened in the Outlanders' City?

739
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,310
I remember everything.

740
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,180
Then...

741
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,080
what about Mu?

742
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,140
I said I remember everything,

743
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,200
and that means I remember everything.

744
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,200
Master, you're awake?

745
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,520
Did I come at the wrong time?

746
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,900
What do you think?

747
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,250
I came at the wrong time.

748
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,310
You came at just the right time.

749
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,440
Let your master drink the medicine first.

750
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,110
I have something to do.

751
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:32,920
What is it?

752
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,200
Something that makes the most of things.

753
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,670
Is this what you call making the most of things?

754
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,150
You have such a large place in the Unbridled Pavilion

755
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,630
and you don't do business.

756
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,170
It's a waste to leave it empty.

757
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,800
I might as well use it for alchemy.

758
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,410
I bought this building.

759
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,280
If you want to borrow it,

760
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,580
you have to pay.

761
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,120
Lanling has been exploiting my master like this.

762
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,100
You demons are no different from the Eternals, are you?

763
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:08,820
Besides,

764
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,210
I'm not doing this for myself.

765
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,570
Then who are you doing it for?

766
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,250
I'm doing it for your master.

767
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,310
I don't like owing favors.

768
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,000
You saved me,

769
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,680
so I should find a way to save you.

770
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,940
Do you think your elixir will be useful?

771
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,850
There's no other way anyway.

772
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,140
Why don't you try mine?

773
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,340
It's better than waiting for your condition to worsen.

774
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,740
You may not trust my medicine skills,

775
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,570
but you trust my master's, right?

776
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,210
Through the turtle shell communication,

777
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,360
my master will guide me personally.

778
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,530
This ensures there will be no problems.

779
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,790
This Pavilion has been out of business for a long time,

780
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:02,970
so there's dust everywhere.

781
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:03,760
Tian Huo,

782
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,880
you don't need to stay here.

783
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,820
I can handle it myself.

784
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,820
Huo,

785
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,600
so you knew I was here.

786
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,860
I came here specifically to help you guys.

787
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,050
I can clean these.

788
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,840
It's one thing to follow me all the way from the Outlanders' City

789
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,880
to Ning'an City,

790
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,800
but now you even dare enter the Unbridled Pavilion.

791
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,510
Do you believe I'll break your legs?

792
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,070
So you knew I was following you all along.

793
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:29,890
That means

794
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,400
you still care about me.

795
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:33,910
Cang Shan,

796
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,040
kick him out.

797
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,370
Leave!

798
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:39,910
Leave!

799
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:40,910
What are you doing?

800
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,560
No, no, no!

801
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,630
No, no, no!

802
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,590
It hurts!

803
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,150
Leave!

804
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,590
It hurts so much!

805
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:02,820
No, no, no!

806
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:03,920
If you spill Master Fan's medicine,

807
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,100
it will be a great loss,

808
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:05,760
right?

809
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,110
I'm here

810
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,150
to work for free in the Unbridled Pavilion.

811
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,170
Washing clothes, cooking meals—

812
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,070
I can do anything.

813
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,260
You can just order me around.

814
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,880
If you don't respond to me,

815
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,010
I'll take it as a yes.

816
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,250
Let go of me.

817
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:29,450
Hero,

818
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,440
back in the Outlanders' City,

819
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,230
we went through life and death together.

820
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,630
Besides, I even gave the second Heart Flame

821
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,520
to Ms. Bai.

822
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,720
Is this how you treat an old ally?

823
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,600
Who's your ally?

824
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,190
You're just an annoying pest we can't shake off.

825
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:40,720
Ms. Bai,

826
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,450
please have Shi Tou put me down.

827
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,520
I'm not in charge here

828
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,670
at the Unbridled Pavilion.

829
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,440
You're being modest.

830
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,240
Back in the Outlanders' City,

831
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,820
even Master Fan listened to you.

832
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,880
If you keep being so noisy,

833
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,430
I'll have Cang Shan throw you out.

834
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,050
It has been three times.

835
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,150
Why did you follow us to the Unbridled Pavilion?

836
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,510
I like Huo.

837
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,550
I want to stay with her.

838
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,370
Do you want to die, you stupid fox?

839
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,430
If liking you means I have to die,

840
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,470
then go ahead and kill me.

841
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,810
Are all foxes

842
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,370
unable to keep their thoughts to themselves?

843
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,840
What's there to hide?

844
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,350
If you like someone,

845
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,490
then do your best to be with them.

846
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,330
Besides,

847
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,350
a fox's life is short.

848
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,470
I don't want to miss it.

849
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,390
But you still can't stay.

850
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,110
If you want to stay, you'll have to work.

851
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,670
You'll do all the dirty and tiring work

852
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,750
in the Unbridled Pavilion.

853
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:35,620
If you make any mistake,

854
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:36,930
you'll be kicked out immediately.

855
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,040
Master Fan, you're the best!

856
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,420
Thank you, Master Fan!

857
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:42,340
Huo.

858
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,180
Get to work.

859
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:49,930
Untie me first!

860
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,120
Ms. Bai,

861
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:55,960
from now on,

862
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,110
we'll be under the same roof.

863
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,000
Why is your nose bleeding?

864
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,760
Perhaps it's because I stayed up too late yesterday

865
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,820
and got overheated.

866
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:09,900
Overheated?

867
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,270
That's easy.

868
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,180
I'll make you some herbal tea.
