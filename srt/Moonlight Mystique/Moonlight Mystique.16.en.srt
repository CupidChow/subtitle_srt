May I be like the stars

00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Episode 16]

19
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,000
But I want something.

20
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,400
What is it?

21
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,960
The Weak Water Stone.

22
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
No problem.

23
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,220
I'll give it to you in three days.

24
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,430
Master.

25
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,520
Didn't I tell you to leave?

26
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,079
There's a human girl

27
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,640
who claims to be a friend of the Master of Bright Moon's.

28
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,600
No one dares to stop her.

29
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,840
Shall we let her in?

30
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,110
No fight

31
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,260
broke out?

32
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,600
This must be Ms. Bai,

33
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,900
the one carrying the Contemplation Stone.

34
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,860
I finally see you in person.

35
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,540
Who allowed you to come?

36
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,500
I know why you're here.

37
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,840
Let's go back and talk.

38
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,700
Don't take unnecessary risks.

39
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,100
Ms. Bai, you came at the right time.

40
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,470
Master Fan just agreed to stay here for three days.

41
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,520
Since you're here,

42
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,900
why not stay for a few days too?

43
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,930
Chang Wu,

44
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,070
escort our two honored guests to rest.

45
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,700
Treat them with care.

46
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,720
Yes.

47
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,940
This is getting interesting.

48
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,860
Huo,

49
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,040
my aunt was a bit harsh earlier,

50
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,820
but it wasn't about you.

51
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,600
It was because of me.

52
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,360
So don't take it to heart.

53
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,409
You'll know in time

54
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,030
what kind of person she is.

55
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,690
Why would I need to know what kind of person she is?

56
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,760
The three main demon branches rarely interact.

57
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,820
If she doesn't like me,

58
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,010
it's alright.

59
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,659
I'll just never see her again.

60
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,250
But...

61
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,720
We're going to be family after all.

62
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,420
Besides,

63
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,410
my aunt is like a mother to me.

64
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,140
You'll see each other often.

65
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,720
You can't just ignore each other forever.

66
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

67
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,950
Huo,

68
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,380
you've come with me to the Fox Clan.

69
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,400
Doesn't that mean you care about me?

70
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,600
Mu Jiu, you've misunderstood.

71
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,710
I'm here because I need to do something.

72
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,220
You need to do something?

73
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,620
Have you heard of the Weak Water Stone?

74
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,840
Weak Water Stone?

75
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,450
Forget it. Go back.

76
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,560
I'll go find it myself.

77
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,130
Huo.

78
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,350
I really like you.

79
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,530
You're all I think about.

80
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,640
I'm serious about you.

81
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,320
Mu Jiu,

82
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,790
do you even know what it means to like someone?

83
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,890
Of course I do.

84
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,230
I don't just like you.

85
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,450
I want to marry you.

86
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,790
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

87
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,980
Marry me?

88
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,850
Just because I saved you?

89
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,960
That's gratitude,

90
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,159
not love.

91
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,720
It's because of that gratitude

92
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,130
that you've developed

93
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,600
some fleeting feelings.

94
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,310
But over time,

95
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,630
those feelings will fade away.

96
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,920
When your heart changes,

97
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,250
you'll fall for someone else.

98
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,510
The vows you made

99
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,630
will end up meaning nothing.

100
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,390
I won't!

101
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,130
You will.

102
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,300
Everyone does.

103
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,390
Mu Jiu,

104
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,050
you're younger than me.

105
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,940
There's so much in this world you don't understand yet.

106
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,930
There are many beauties in the Fox Clan,

107
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,630
and there are countless demons out there

108
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,850
who are far stronger than me.

109
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,350
You and I just happened to cross paths,

110
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,090
spending only a few days together.

111
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,010
You don't even know my past.

112
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,870
So don't make jokes

113
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,680
like this again.

114
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,860
Huo.

115
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,540
Who told you that?

116
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,010
It doesn't matter.

117
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,380
Why do you want the Weak Water Stone?

118
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,470
You met Old Turtle, didn't you?

119
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:43,270
What else did he tell you?

120
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,370
Do we really need to

121
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,490
argue over everything we say to each other?

122
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,490
Fine.

123
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,850
I won't argue with you.

124
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,670
In three days,

125
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,600
Chang Mei will give the Weak Water Stone to me.

126
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,470
But in these three days, anything could happen.

127
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,680
It's dangerous here.

128
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,500
You should leave immediately.

129
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,310
Why is it so hard for you

130
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,220
to explain things clearly?

131
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,900
All you need to do is trust me.

132
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,290
I can trust you,

133
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,530
but trust goes both ways.

134
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,730
Fan Yue,

135
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,900
after what happened in the Outlanders' City,

136
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,930
I thought things were different between us.

137
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,770
But why are you still like this?

138
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,650
Haven't you always wanted to know

139
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,410
why Mu is better than you?

140
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,020
I can tell you now.

141
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,390
He's better because he held nothing back

142
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,630
and was open and honest with me.

143
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,170
He's better because we didn't have to doubt each other.

144
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,230
Do you understand?

145
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,810
Ms. Bai has got settled in.

146
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,360
Master.

147
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,890
Do you think the Master of Bright Moon

148
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,110
is angry?

149
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,310
Can't you tell?

150
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,920
He's as protective of that Ms. Bai

151
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,680
as if she were his eyes.

152
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,070
As long as

153
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,600
we treat her well over these three days

154
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,900
and take good care of her,

155
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,740
Fan Yue won't make a fuss.

156
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,700
I still think it's risky to keep them here for too long.

157
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:51,710
Master,

158
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,990
why don't we just let Tian Huo go

159
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,760
so we can get them off our back?

160
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,250
It's too late.

161
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,530
Fan Yue came here for the Weak Water Stone.

162
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,030
Even if we release Tian Huo, it won't change anything.

163
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,220
The Weak Water Stone?

164
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,810
But 800 years ago, it already…

165
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,500
What's between you and me

166
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,060
is not known by the Master of Bright Moon.

167
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,670
Once Jiu's matter is done,

168
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,310
we can just give him some random spiritual stone

169
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,290
and send him away.

170
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,480
Besides,

171
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,130
now that Ms. Bai is here,

172
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,010
even the almighty Master of Bright Moon

173
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,480
has a weakness.

174
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,580
Maybe

175
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,340
this could be the turning point

176
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,780
for the Emotion Tree.

177
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,960
Master.

178
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,000
Do you want to use the Master of Bright Moon

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
as a sacrifice for the Emotion…

180
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,600
Ms. Bai.

181
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,970
Master said

182
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,420
you're a friend of the Master of Bright Moon's

183
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,900
and an honored guest of Jingyou Mountain.

184
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,970
This is a small gift for you.

185
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,830
Please accept it.

186
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,320
This is...

187
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,030
It's clothing from the Fox Clan.

188
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,320
Since you've come all this way,

189
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:58,990
we'd like you to experience

190
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,090
the customs and culture of Jingyou Mountain.

191
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,540
Let me help you put it on.

192
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,030
Chang Mei

193
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,530
is Wu?

194
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,360
How much longer must we keep killing?

195
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,200
What's wrong?

196
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,560
Still not used to these blood-soaked days?

197
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,280
From the way you strike now,

198
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,150
it seems you've come a long way from the pain you felt

199
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,710
when you killed your first Eternal.

200
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,630
You've adapted faster than I expected,

201
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,900
transitioning from an Eternal to a demon.

202
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,640
I can no longer go back to the past.

203
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,530
Now that I've become a demon,

204
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,790
there's no need to cling to being innocent.

205
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Do you think Eternals are innocent?

206
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,960
Innocence can be faked.

207
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,080
Just like in Ning'an City,

208
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,440
when your master and the others

209
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,610
erased the memories of the humans

210
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,910
to cover up the truth

211
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,260
and went back to being noble, innocent Eternals.

212
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,930
Don't bring up the past.

213
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,230
Even if I've become a demon,

214
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,100
I won't join you in slandering Lanling.

215
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,300
So you still care for them.

216
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,910
It's that evil insect again.

217
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,630
What exactly are you trying to do

218
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,770
by feeding that evil insect?

219
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,740
Do you know what a puppet is?

220
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,220
Once the evil insect is fully grown,

221
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,560
no matter how powerful the opponent is,

222
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,190
it can control their mind

223
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,810
and turn them into a puppet.

224
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,550
So,

225
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,910
it's not fully grown yet?

226
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,100
When did you start taking an interest in things like this?

227
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,410
Could it be that

228
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,700
this is why you joined

229
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,950
Cold Spring Palace?

230
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,180
Just asking.

231
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,820
You don't need to answer.

232
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,130
I can tell you.

233
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,450
To refine the evil insect, it requires the lives of demons,

234
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,840
Eternals, and humans,

235
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,090
999 of each.

236
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,200
We've almost killed enough demons and Eternals

237
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,630
and just need to kill more humans.

238
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,950
The more you kill,

239
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,420
the greater the contribution you make,

240
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,100
and the more satisfied Grand Master will be.

241
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,090
Who knows?

242
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,260
He might summon you soon.

243
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,760
Feng Yu, Yan Huo,

244
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,190
deliver Chong Zhao's message

245
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,500
to all Eternal sects.

246
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,800
Tell them to carefully monitor

247
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,870
the whereabouts of their disciples.

248
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,570
Yes.

249
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,570
Be careful.

250
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,060
Jing Lei,

251
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,220
take the disciples of our sect

252
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,220
and head to the human cities under Lanling's protection.

253
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,230
Chong Zhao's message says

254
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,780
Cold Spring Palace's evil insect is nearing completion.

255
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,540
They'll surely target humans next.

256
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,810
Lanling has been guarding this land for years.

257
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,910
We can't let Zhen Yu do whatever he wants.

258
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,140
Rest assured, Sect Leader.

259
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,440
If that old dragon dares to come,

260
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,520
I'll definitely kill him.

261
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,760
You must be careful.

262
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,100
Don't act recklessly.

263
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,650
I'll keep that in mind

264
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,390
and play it by ear.

265
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,440
Good.

266
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,090
Go.

267
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,140
Senior, you're worried about Chong Zhao's safety, aren't you?

268
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,290
His parents passed away when he was young.

269
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,470
If it weren't for the dire circumstances,

270
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,380
I would never have sent him to Cold Spring Palace.

271
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,860
He's uncovered such a critical secret.

272
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,990
It seems he's managed to gain Zhen Yu's trust.

273
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,930
But Zhen Yu is a cunning and ruthless man.

274
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,500
How much suffering must he have endured?

275
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,110
Chong Zhao is clever

276
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,430
and righteous.

277
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,140
What you've done is for the sake of the world.

278
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,550
When the time is right,

279
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,030
we'll eliminate Cold Spring Palace once and for all.

280
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,070
Chong Zhao

281
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,220
will return.

282
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,130
I hope so.

283
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,470
Chang Mei agreed so easily?

284
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,930
I also find it strange.

285
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,490
No matter what, the Weak Water Stone is a treasure of the Fox Clan.

286
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,760
Chang Mei shouldn't have given it up so easily.

287
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,510
And earlier today, when I mentioned the Weak Water Stone,

288
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,450
her expression was anything but natural.

289
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,720
Ever since we entered the Fox Clan,

290
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,110
everything has felt strange.

291
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,220
It's no surprise that Chang Mei wants Mu Jiu to inherit

292
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,340
her position,

293
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,490
but why did she specifically set a three-day deadline?

294
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,970
For this, she even used the Weak Water Stone as bait

295
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,570
to keep us here for three days.

296
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,500
I'm afraid that after these three days,

297
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,370
something big will happen.

298
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,930
I think so too.

299
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,890
I'll go ask Mu Jiu again

300
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,040
and see if I can find any clues.

301
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,850
Wait.

302
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,910
I'll speak

303
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,340
with Mu Jiu myself.

304
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,690
Master,

305
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,630
are you worried I might agree to marry Mu Jiu

306
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,060
because of the Weak Water Stone?

307
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,600
I simply hope

308
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,690
that no matter what happens,

309
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,050
you won't make a decision that goes against your own will.

310
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,260
Why are you smiling?

311
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,470
Master, you've changed.

312
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,050
The things you say now

313
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,180
sound more and more like something Bai Shuo would say.

314
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,300
You didn't tell her the truth about her condition

315
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,820
because you didn't want to put her in a difficult position, did you?

316
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,790
You're used to solving

317
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,750
everything alone

318
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,170
and protecting others,

319
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,270
but you forget that Bai Shuo isn't fragile.

320
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,170
She's far stronger than we think.

321
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,530
I know.

322
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,530
She's no weaker than anyone else.

323
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,970
So her path shouldn't end here.

324
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,490
But aren't you afraid that hiding the truth

325
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,360
from her will hurt her feelings?

326
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,010
Heartbreak is far more damaging

327
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,090
than physical pain.

328
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,790
As to when I'll tell her,

329
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,580
I have my own considerations.

330
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,530
You came to the Fox Clan without permission.

331
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,860
Don't act on your own like this again.

332
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,710
Yes.

333
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,140
I'll follow your orders.

334
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,450
It's not just my orders.

335
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,920
Your safety is important too.

336
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,610
By the way, Master,

337
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,700
where is Cang Shan?

338
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,180
During the day, he and I entered the Fox Clan

339
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,090
and split up.

340
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,530
Judging by the time,

341
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,300
he should be back soon.

342
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,860
How strange.

343
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,160
I've searched all day

344
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,510
and checked every secret spot Master mentioned,

345
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,020
but I still couldn't sense the Weak Water Stone's aura.

346
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,650
Forget it.

347
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,280
I'll head back to meet Master

348
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,160
and let the smart ones figure it out.

349
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,420
This is…

350
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,100
the Weak Water Stone?

351
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,430
Chang Mei is Wu,

352
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,770
Ling Long's younger sister?

353
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,330
The earrings she wore—

354
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,660
I'd recognize them anywhere.

355
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,460
That's strange.

356
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,480
Ling Long only had one younger sister, Chang Mei,

357
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,060
but Mu Jiu calls her Auntie.

358
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,720
So who are Mu Jiu's parents?

359
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,640
Back in Rong Xian's illusion,

360
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,870
you were Chang Mei's guard, Qi,

361
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,829
and Bei Chen played another guard, Ba.

362
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,710
Speaking of which,

363
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,030
why are those two nowhere to be seen now?

364
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,160
Forget it.

365
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,710
For now, Chang Mei's matter isn't related to the Weak Water Stone.

366
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,589
No need to worry about it.

367
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:15,950
Bai Shuo.

368
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,790
There's something I need to tell you.

369
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,510
The reason I'm looking for the Weak Water Stone

370
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,050
is because…

371
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,200
What's wrong?

372
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,050
Bai Shuo.

373
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,790
Bai Shuo.

374
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,260
What did you see?

375
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,800
Fan Yue.

376
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,000
Don't go.

377
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,770
Bai Shuo.

378
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,020
Grand Master.

379
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,890
The last time we met

380
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,630
was in Ning'an City.

381
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,650
But at that time,

382
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,710
you greeted me

383
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,430
with your sword drawn.

384
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,040
Things have changed.

385
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,680
Greetings, Master.

386
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,570
Rise.

387
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,470
The head disciple of Lanling

388
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,940
knows when to bend and when to stand tall.

389
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,060
Very good.

390
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,250
I like it.

391
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,510
But I wonder

392
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,610
how much loyalty

393
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,310
lies beneath this flexibility.

394
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,070
You don't need to question

395
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,420
my loyalty.

396
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,260
You'll see it for yourself.

397
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,440
Chong Zhao,

398
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,680
mind your manners

399
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,550
before Grand Master.

400
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,380
It's fine.

401
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,880
I only value competence.

402
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,220
If he's useless,

403
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,860
no amount of smooth talk can make a difference.

404
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,740
Fu Ling.

405
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,050
You turned

406
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,830
Chong Zhao into a demon within a month.

407
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,040
You've done

408
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,160
a great job.

409
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,520
I thought Lanling's head disciple would hold out longer.

410
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,980
Turns out,

411
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,180
he's just another spineless coward.

412
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,220
Chen Ye.

413
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,060
From now on,

414
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,790
Chong Zhao

415
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,930
is one of us.

416
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,110
Be polite.

417
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,710
So this is Chen Ye?

418
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,220
I was rude just now.

419
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,370
From now on,

420
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,060
should I call you Divinity Chong Zhao

421
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,770
or Demon Lord Chong Zhao?

422
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,290
Since I've joined Cold Spring Palace,

423
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,820
I am, naturally, Demon Lord Chong Zhao.

424
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,630
Just get to the point.

425
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,980
Don't be sarcastic.

426
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,690
Grand Master.

427
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,900
According to the spy,

428
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,970
Fan Yue and Bai Shuo

429
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,480
entered Jingyou Mountain a day ago,

430
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,330
but there's been no word

431
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,180
of any conflict with Chang Mei.

432
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,380
If I'm not mistaken,

433
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,030
Chong Zhao,

434
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,180
you and Bai Shuo are old acquaintances, aren't you?

435
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,650
If I were to send you to Jingyou Mountain,

436
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,350
you'd have a better chance of bringing Bai Shuo back, right?

437
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,150
Grand Master, your target isn't Fan Yue,

438
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,180
but Bai Shuo?

439
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,850
Fan Yue is protecting her

440
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,760
only because of the Contemplation Stone.

441
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,800
Once she's in my hands,

442
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,730
he'll have no say.

443
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,650
Chong Zhao,

444
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,430
don't you want to

445
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,340
prove your loyalty to me?

446
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,770
I'll be watching.

447
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,790
I won't fail you, Master.

448
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,300
Her forehead mark has opened.

449
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,310
She must have seen another vision

450
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,590
from the Contemplation Stone.

451
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,110
Could the new Contemplation appear in the Fox Clan?

452
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,280
I must get the Weak Water Stone as soon as possible.

453
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,030
Cang Shan hasn't returned all night.

454
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,400
He must have encountered danger

455
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,550
while searching for the Weak Water Stone.

456
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,640
Tian Huo,

457
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,970
I'll go ask Chang Mei.

458
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,920
You watch over her here.

459
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,590
Don't leave.

460
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,550
Don't worry.

461
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,890
I won't let anything happen to you.

462
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,040
Master Fan, are you kidding?

463
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,590
When Tian Huo went missing,

464
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,590
you came to me for her.

465
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,480
Now that Cang Shan is missing,

466
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,640
you also came to me.

467
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,530
Do you think Jingyou Mountain is the backyard of Bright Moon Palace?

468
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,270
You're the one who's kidding.

469
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,060
Cang Shan did go missing here in Jingyou Mountain.

470
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,680
Since you don't know anything about it,

471
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,080
I'll search for him myself.

472
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,220
Fine.

473
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,750
Master Fan, you're new to Jingyou Mountain

474
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,670
and unfamiliar with many places here.

475
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,410
I'll have someone help you search.

476
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,260
Thank you.

477
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,190
As for the Weak Water Stone,

478
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,750
I have one question.

479
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,410
Since you've agreed to give it to me,

480
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,080
why wait another two days?

481
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,630
It's only two more days.

482
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,320
What's the harm in waiting?

483
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,260
It's a treasure,

484
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,090
so it naturally can't be taken out so easily.

485
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,260
If you take the treasure away

486
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,500
and Mu Jiu runs off with Tian Huo,

487
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,030
how am I supposed to catch him?

488
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,830
Mu Jiu has no desire

489
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,830
to inherit the position of chief.

490
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,310
Even if he becomes the chief,

491
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,350
he'll still run away.

492
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,640
I'm very curious.

493
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,610
Why are you so sure

494
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,070
that in just two days,

495
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,160
you can completely change Mu Jiu's mind?

496
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,160
Master,

497
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,750
bad news.

498
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,660
The Love...

499
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,250
Since you're busy,

500
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,610
I'll go look for Cang Shan

501
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,750
and disturb you no further.

502
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,860
Master.

503
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,700
Today,

504
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,150
I took the newborn foxes

505
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,460
to receive the blessing of the Emotion Tree,

506
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,800
but at the end of its strength,

507
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,070
the Tree couldn't bloom at all.

508
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,130
Some people have noticed something is wrong

509
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,230
and are privately discussing it.

510
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,410
Chang Sheng has gone to deal with it,

511
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,680
but I'm afraid this matter

512
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,750
can no longer stay hidden.

513
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,250
I see.

514
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,540
Also,

515
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,120
Cang Shan, the one with Fan Yue, has gone missing.

516
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,620
It's very likely the doing of the Emotion Tree.

517
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,140
I'll go check it out myself.

518
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,600
Keep an eye on Fan Yue.

519
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,250
Don't let him suspect anything.

520
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,080
Yes.

521
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,670
Yesterday, I was wrong.

522
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,130
I shouldn't have forced you to marry me.

523
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,190
But I've thought carefully

524
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,260
about everything you said.

525
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,290
I like you,

526
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,780
and it's definitely not just empty words.

527
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,910
Yes.

528
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,300
I'll say it like this to her later.

529
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,370
What are you doing?

530
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,070
I heard Ms. Bai is sick.

531
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,830
I don't know her condition

532
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,030
or what medicine humans take,

533
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,550
so I brought everything I could find.

534
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,040
Take a look.

535
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,870
I'm leaving.

536
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,860
Stop there.

537
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,440
I heard from Master about the inheritance.

538
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,540
You made a bet with your aunt

539
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,910
about whether you could marry me within three days.

540
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,510
To avoid being the chief,

541
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,920
you're actually betting on me.

542
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,090
Mu Jiu,

543
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,250
you're so bold.

544
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
No, no.

545
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,570
Huo, let me explain.

546
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,910
The inheritance has nothing to do with you.

547
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,450
It's my aunt...

548
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,090
Are you a child?

549
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
Blaming everything on your aunt.

550
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,240
Aren't you going to make me fall in love with you in three days?

551
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,030
There are only two days left.

552
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:17,860
Cat got your tongue?

553
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,450
♫The person standing far away♫

554
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,130
I know.

555
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,800
Because of what happened with your parents,

556
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,770
♫Don't be afraid♫

557
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,970
you don't want to think about love and relationships.

558
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I also know

559
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,350
♫The stars will guide you to me♫

560
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,810
that no matter how strong someone is,

561
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,560
there are times they feel lonely.

562
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:39,690
♫Walk towards me♫

563
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,780
I'm not that capable.

564
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,450
I can't beat you in a fight.

565
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,990
I'm not as good-looking as Fan Yue,

566
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:40,940
and I often

567
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,340
♫My heart feels so...♫

568
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,210
say nonsense

569
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,070
that annoys you.

570
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
But the thought of being separated from you

571
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:50,640
♫It's pounding as I wait for you♫

572
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,200
hurts me.

573
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,070
I don't want that!

574
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,730
Huo,

575
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,290
I really want to be with you.

576
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,620
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

577
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,190
I want to be with you forever!

578
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,380
When we're both old

579
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,620
♫You are my distant call♫

580
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,530
and gray,

581
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,640
♫You are my first and last♫

582
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,890
if you turn around,

583
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,150
you'll still see me here.

584
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,180
Will you then believe

585
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:15,110
♫My heart is trembling for you♫

586
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,750
that my feelings for you are real?

587
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,600
♫In this moment where we embrace each other♫

588
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,170
♫Let's never let go♫

589
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,820
Sorry.

590
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,070
I've said too much again.

591
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,910
I won't bother you anymore.

592
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,740
I'll go now.

593
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,320
Do you mean

594
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,090
what you said?

595
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,680
Of course!

596
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,540
Then I'll help you this time.

597
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,340
In two days, I'll marry you.

598
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,720
A fake marriage.

599
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,750
But after the wedding,

600
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,160
you can leave the Fox Clan

601
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,160
and live the free life you want.

602
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,750
When you can truly take charge of your life,

603
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,570
we'll talk about us again.

604
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,120
Us?

605
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,940
You mean,

606
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,410
you're willing to give me a chance,

607
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,240
right?

608
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,560
Think whatever you want.

609
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,360
Huo, rest assured.

610
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,770
As long as I'm alive…

611
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,180
No, even if I die,

612
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,530
I'll always love you.

613
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,160
You have my word!

614
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,010
The sap of the Emotion Tree is getting

615
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,230
more and more corrosive.

616
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,670
Master Fan.

617
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,610
That area up ahead is wild grasslands.

618
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,450
The trail ends here.

619
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:37,950
That…

620
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,290
Maybe some young foxes came here messing around.

621
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,570
Don't worry, Master Fan.

622
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,810
There's nothing special about this place.

623
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,290
Lord Cang Shan wouldn't have wandered here.

624
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,080
Who's there?

625
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,930
Cang Shan.

626
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:19,770
Master.

627
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,990
-Master.
-Be careful.

628
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,770
No need to stand up.

629
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,030
What exactly happened to you yesterday?

630
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,040
Yesterday, I…

631
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,650
I followed Master's order

632
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:34,090
and searched all over for the possible hiding spot of the Weak Water Stone.

633
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,800
But the Fox Clan's territory is massive,

634
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,580
and I didn't notice anything unusual anywhere.

635
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,530
I kept searching until night fell.

636
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,100
I was planning to return to report to you,

637
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,490
but at that moment,

638
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,960
I actually found

639
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,070
the Weak Water Stone.

640
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,840
The Weak Water Stone?

641
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,310
How did you know

642
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,480
it was the Weak Water Stone?

643
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,500
That's right.

644
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,880
I don't even know what it looks like,

645
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,620
so why did I feel like

646
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,760
I had found it?

647
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,640
Could it be an illusion

648
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,720
caused by some curse?

649
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,540
Maybe.

650
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,150
Then what?

651
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,490
How did you pass out?

652
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,520
I can't remember.

653
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:13,120
I only recall seeing a huge tree,

654
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,160
and then...

655
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,690
everything went black.

656
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,310
After that, I remember nothing.

657
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,500
According to the Fox Clan,

658
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,850
you were injured by the corrosive plants in the forest.

659
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,040
But Cang Shan is from the Stone Race.

660
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,230
His body is very tough.

661
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,660
Ordinary plants can't hurt him like this.

662
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,940
Could it be Chang Mei?

663
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,070
Why would Chang Mei harm Cang Shan?

664
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,090
Even if she's unwilling to give us the Weak Water Stone,

665
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,680
there's no need for her to deliberately hurt my man.

666
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,350
Today, in the strange forest,

667
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,060
I noticed something in Chang Wu's expression.

668
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,290
It felt like

669
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,230
someone deliberately moved Cang Shan there

670
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,190
for me to find.

671
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,730
If I'm not mistaken,

672
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,520
the truth behind Cang Shan's injuries

673
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,960
is the secret Chang Mei

674
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,580
is trying to hide.

675
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,210
It's that tree.

676
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,500
Why are you here?

677
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,200
How are you?

678
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,520
I'm fine.

679
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,940
Cang Shan is injured.

680
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:04,970
Let me treat him first.

681
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,700
Here.

682
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,130
Let me do it.

683
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,300
Here.

684
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,420
Last night, I saw another vision from the Contemplation Stone.

685
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,300
This time, it was in the Fox Clan.

686
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,290
As expected.

687
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,630
What did you see?

688
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,510
A very, very large tree,

689
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,760
right here in Jingyou Mountain,

690
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,860
shrouded in eerie white mist.

691
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:36,640
Yes, yes.

692
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,680
The tree she's describing is the one I saw!

693
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,470
That's not all.

694
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,390
I also saw you walking toward that tree,

695
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,000
and its trunk split open into a giant mouth

696
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,370
and swallowed you whole.

697
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,570
Fan Yue.

698
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,680
Cang Shan must have gone missing there.

699
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,250
With so many trees in Jingyou Mountain,

700
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,340
how are we supposed to find it?

701
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,510
Master Fan.

702
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,940
That area up ahead is wild grasslands.

703
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,240
The trail ends here.

704
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,220
I might know the way.

705
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,020
Cang Shan.

706
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,950
Take Bai Shuo back to Ning'an City.

707
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,500
Tian Huo and I will return after we're done here.

708
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,590
I'm not leaving.

709
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,270
The Contemplation Stone has shown me a vision.

710
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,690
If I leave, how will you get the Contemplation?

711
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,120
Then I won't!

712
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,510
What are you talking about?

713
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,440
Without the Contemplations,

714
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,410
how will you break the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal?

715
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,760
I'll figure out another way.

716
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,280
Cang Shan!

717
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,800
Take her away.

718
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,460
-Ms. Bai.
-I saw it with my own eyes.

719
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,340
You'll be in danger in Jingyou Mountain.

720
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,310
And yet, at this critical moment, you want me to leave?

721
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,830
What are you thinking?

722
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,260
Master.

723
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:51,020
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

724
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,830
She's already asking about it.

725
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,060
Just tell her.

726
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,130
You're a human after all.

727
00:31:54,180 --> 00:32:00,040
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

728
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,910
The more contemplation power the Stone absorbs,

729
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,810
the more likely your body will fail.

730
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,170
Last night, when the Stone was activated,

731
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,000
you bled and fainted

732
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,220
for the exact same reason.

733
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:10,040
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

734
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,830
I don't have the time to think about

735
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,330
the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal!

736
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,510
All I know is that if you keep absorbing Contemplations,

737
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,560
you won't live long enough to break the Seal!

738
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,840
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫

739
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,830
Bai Shuo.

740
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,750
I don't want you to die,

741
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,850
and I won't let you die.

742
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,010
For my sake,

743
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,950
leave this place.

744
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,450
♫Across thousands of miles♫

745
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:48,010
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

746
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,560
Master.

747
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,170
The Emotion Tree has run out of nutrients

748
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,680
and even begun to harm people.

749
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,240
Obviously, it has gained consciousness.

750
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,750
How much longer are you going to

751
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,880
delay solving this problem?

752
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,100
What's the hurry?

753
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,330
Even if you want to force me to die,

754
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,630
at least give me time to arrange my affairs first.

755
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,920
Please calm down, Master.

756
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,660
Elder Chang Sheng didn't mean to offend you.

757
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,340
He's just concerned…

758
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,120
Shut up!

759
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,910
If you hadn't helped her,

760
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,100
the Emotion Tree wouldn't have ended up like this!

761
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,600
800 years ago, the Weak Water Stone was lost,

762
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,390
and the Emotion Tree lost its source of nourishment.

763
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,380
No one in the clan knew about it.

764
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,300
If I hadn't become an elder,

765
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,890
I wouldn't have learned about it either.

766
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,310
May I ask, Master,

767
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,290
if you still remember

768
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,250
the promise you made to me

769
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,390
when I first learned the truth?

770
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,070
I said,

771
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,480
even without the Weak Water Stone,

772
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,950
the Emotion Tree

773
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,740
won't wither away under my reign.

774
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,090
The Fox Clan is skilled with curses.

775
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,120
If I were you,

776
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,670
I wouldn't follow them so closely.

777
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:10,850
Once discovered,

778
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,250
you won't even have the chance to fight back

779
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,670
before they knock you out with a curse.

780
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,780
Why are you here?

781
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,449
I was worried about you,

782
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,630
so I begged Grand Master

783
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:24,500
to let me come protect you.

784
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,639
You mean monitor me.

785
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,000
You were afraid I'd reveal

786
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,719
Cold Spring Palace's secret plan,

787
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,110
so you followed me here.

788
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,449
Think whatever you want.

789
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,150
If you fail to bring Bai Shuo back this time,

790
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,570
Grand Master won't let you off.

791
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,719
I'll do the dirty work you can't bring yourself to do.

792
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:38,300
You should thank…

793
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,730
Mind your own business.

794
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,659
I have my own way.

795
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,980
What way?

796
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,199
Talking with her about old times in Ning'an City?

797
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:48,380
Reminiscing about the late city governor?

798
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:49,900
Don't you dare disrespect Uncle Bai!

799
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,880
Chong Zhao,

800
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,389
you're now part of Cold Spring Palace.

801
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,140
The blood on your hands will never wash clean.

802
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,730
To Bai Shuo,

803
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,840
you're as good as someone who killed her father.

804
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,320
Do you think

805
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,050
she'll still care about the fragile bond you once had?

806
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,080
Our target this time is Bai Shuo.

807
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,600
In the Fox Clan, you must act secretly.

808
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,480
If Chang Mei and the others find out,

809
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,940
we'll only find ourselves in trouble.

810
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,050
One more thing.

811
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,130
Don't say I didn't warn you.

812
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,460
In Jingyou Mountain,

813
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,030
a confrontation between you and Bai Shuo is inevitable.

814
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,730
If you're still clinging to those old feelings,

815
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,150
your only fate

816
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,840
will be death.

817
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,590
Stay, not stay.

818
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,040
Stay, not stay.

819
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,970
Bai Shuo.

820
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,730
We should set off.

821
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,460
You know what?

822
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,700
The food here is actually pretty good.

823
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,800
Give it a try.

824
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,680
Try some.

825
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,480
We'll leave after you eat.

826
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,150
I have to say,

827
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,840
they're really tasty.

828
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,550
Don't worry.

829
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,400
It's just a pill

830
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,270
that temporarily paralyzes you.

831
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,490
It won't kill a demon.

832
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,510
At first, I thought

833
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,360
Fan Yue was looking for the Weak Water Stone

834
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,460
to break his Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal.

835
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,490
In the end, it's because of me.

836
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,500
If I continue gathering Contemplations, I'll die.

837
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,490
But if I stop gathering them, he'll die.

838
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,100
Either way, one of us is doomed.

839
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,370
He wants me to live,

840
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,570
so I should let him live too.

841
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,430
To activate the Contemplation Stone, we need to gather the Five Contemplations.

842
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,610
If he misses this one,

843
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,000
he might never find it again.

844
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,140
I've come to understand

845
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,770
Fan Yue's personality now.

846
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,640
Most of what he says

847
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,200
isn't truly what he feels.

848
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,930
He cares for Tian Huo,

849
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,800
making sure she doesn't go against her will.

850
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,620
He also cares for you,

851
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,590
asking the injured you to send me back.

852
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,300
But who will care for him?

853
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,150
That's why

854
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:29,650
I can't leave.

855
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,420
I have to protect him,

856
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,040
just like he's protected all of us.

857
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,510
Don't you agree?

858
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,580
Bai Shuo.

859
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:41,870
Bai Shuo!

860
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,280
Bai Shuo!

861
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,520
Chong Zhao?

862
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,550
Do I look good?

863
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,080
Wu,

864
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,960
I'll definitely marry you in the future.

865
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,110
And I'll give you

866
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,150
the grandest wedding the Fox Clan has ever seen.

867
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,720
Nonsense.

868
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,890
My sister would never let me marry you.

869
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,400
Really?

870
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,960
Yes.

871
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,110
But I don't care.

872
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,270
I'm going to marry you no matter what.

873
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,840
Wait a little longer.

874
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,970
After tomorrow,

875
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,860
I'll come to be with you.

876
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,430
Auntie!

877
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,000
Auntie!

878
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,630
Tian Huo finally agreed to marry me!

879
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,380
I'm going to marry her!

880
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,320
I've thought about this seriously.

881
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,450
Huo has a hard time believing in love

882
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,890
because of her parents.

883
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,580
I must seize this chance

884
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,860
and let her feel my sincerity.

885
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,170
Auntie, you've always spoiled me.

886
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,550
You have to help me

887
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,330
throw her the grandest wedding the Fox Clan has ever seen.

888
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,190
And then,

889
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,430
I'll swear in front of everyone in the clan

890
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,220
that I'll love her for the rest of my life!

891
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,730
You brat.

892
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,080
Throwing a wedding like that isn't so easy.

893
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,950
It'd take at least a month or so.

894
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,320
How about this?

895
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,720
Tomorrow, you'll attend the ceremony

896
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,080
to inherit the position of chief first,

897
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,580
and then...

898
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,400
Why am I still inheriting your position?

899
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,900
I'm getting married.

900
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,290
In the future, I'll travel across

901
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,580
the Eastern Continent with Huo.

902
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:42,900
Didn't we agree that

903
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,360
as long as Huo agreed to marry me,

904
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,390
I'd be free?

905
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,860
I remember it being somewhere around here.

906
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,110
The traces in the forest are completely gone now.

907
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,430
The Fox Clan must have deliberately covered them up.

908
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:59,880
Let's split up and search.

909
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,490
Find that tree as quickly as possible.

910
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,000
We can't delay this further.

911
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,680
You escaped from Cold Spring Palace?

912
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,730
Since you're fine,

913
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,510
why didn't you go back to Ning'an City to find me?

914
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,470
Have you forgotten what happened

915
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,970
in the Outlanders' City?

916
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,920
Between Fan Yue

917
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,160
and Chong Zhao,

918
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,720
pick one.

919
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,610
Whoever you choose,

920
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,940
I can let him go.

921
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,110
Fan Yue!

922
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,760
I choose Fan Yue.

923
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:39,030
♫No matter if I'm drunk or not, I just want to be reckless once♫

924
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,800
Back then, I chose him

925
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,320
because he had the best chance…

926
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,440
It was because he was powerful

927
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,820
and I wasn't as good as him.

928
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:46,440
♫Because love is thrilling♫

929
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,740
That's why you made that choice.

930
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,580
♫If you tear open my heart♫

931
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,690
♫I can hold you a little tighter♫

932
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,560
♫This pain will gradually fade♫

933
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,300
Chong Zhao.

934
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,030
♫Time withers the moonlight♫

935
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,580
I'm sorry.

936
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,140
At the time, it was a matter of expediency,

937
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,950
♫All that's left is pitch darkness♫

938
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,730
but I truly did

939
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,320
hurt your feelings.

940
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,260
♫I want to tear apart♫

941
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,830
You should blame me.

942
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,830
♫This sky for you♫

943
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,050
It's fine if you don't want to see me again.

944
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,560
But my concern for you is real.

945
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,680
♫A lifetime of guarding everything with you♫

946
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,290
I...

947
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,450
♫Crossing the abyss to fulfill our vow♫

948
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,290
♫I'll leap without a thought for tomorrow♫

949
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,050
♫This moment feels like forever♫

950
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,180
♫I've missed too much time in my life♫

951
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,290
♫I'll throw myself into this flame for you♫

♫Even if I'll perish♫

953
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,710
What's wrong?

954
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,630
♫At least I can still kiss your face♫

955
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,300
I'm fine.

956
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,180
♫Burn out my waning moon♫

957
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,400
I've been doing well recently.

958
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,610
Don't worry about me.

959
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:52,330
♫In exchange for a lifetime of passion♫

960
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,140
If you say that, then you definitely haven't been doing well.

961
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,960
You've encountered something difficult,

962
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,780
haven't you?

963
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,040
Also,

964
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,820
why are you here in the Fox Clan?

965
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,480
How did you know I was here?

966
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,640
What are you two doing?

967
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,170
Bai Shuo.

968
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,920
I told you to go back, but you didn't listen.

969
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,340
Now you're here flirting with him.

970
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,310
Bai Shuo,

971
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,160
you've really surprised me.

972
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,480
I...

973
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,840
Where Shuo wants to go

974
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,760
and what she wants to do

975
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,940
have nothing to do with you!

976
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,920
I'm talking with her.

977
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,170
Who are you to interrupt?

978
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,670
The two of us grew up together,

979
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,270
facing life-and-death situations side by side.

980
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,780
Her business is naturally my business.

981
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,360
Get over yourself.

982
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,810
Life-and-death situations?

983
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,320
You're nothing but a loser.

984
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,270
You're of no use to her in life-and-death situations!

985
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
You'd better go back to Lanling

986
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,780
and train for another few hundred years.

987
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,760
Fan Yue!

988
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,000
Don't take his words to heart.

989
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,350
Since we've run into each other,

990
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,570
you should come back with me.

991
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,190
♫A lifetime of guarding everything with you♫

992
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,110
No!

993
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:05,760
No need.

994

♫Crossing the abyss to fulfill our vow♫

995
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,760

997

Shuo.

998
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,400
I'll come to find you again.

Isn't that a question I should be asking you?

♫In exchange for a lifetime of passion♫

1009
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,190
Don't you think you owe me an explanation?

1010
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,720
Life-and-death situations?

1011
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,730
You're nothing but a loser.

1012
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,150

1015
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,800
Poor thing.

1016
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,760
You came all the way here to find her,

1017
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,880
like a stray dog returning to its old master.

1018
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,550
But unfortunately,

1019
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,510
a dog that left its home is just a wild dog.

1020
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,870
Even if it dies by the roadside,

1021
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,210
no one will spare it a glance.

1022
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,070
It was Zhen Yu who sent me to Jingyou Mountain,

1023
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:08,840
not…

1024
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,400
Grand Master sent you here to capture Bai Shuo.

1025
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,400
Have you made your move?

1026
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,510
It's not the right time yet.

1027
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,960
Timing isn't something you wait for.

1028
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,910
Tonight, I'll lure Fan Yue away,

1029
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,260
and you can take the chance to capture Bai Shuo.

1030
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,080
No!

1031
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,730
Tian Huo and Cang Shan are with Fan Yue.

1032
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,460
If you go alone, it'll be too dangerous.

1033
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,100
Then what do you suggest?

1034
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,180
I noticed Fan Yue rushing back

1035
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,640
from the depths of the forest.

1036
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:41,000
It seems they've come to Jingyou Mountain

1037
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,230
for a specific purpose.

1038
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,540
If we can sow discord between the two sides

1039
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,290
and have Chang Mei hold off Fan Yue,

1040
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:48,940
not only can we bring Bai Shuo back,

1041
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,280
but we might also

1042
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,090
get rid of Fan Yue for Cold Spring Palace.

1043
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,860
Divinity, I'm so impressed.

1044
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:56,730
When you're ruthless,

1045
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,500
even I, a demon, feel ashamed by comparison.

1046
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,130
But tell me,

1047
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,630
is killing Fan Yue

1048
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,570
for Cold Spring Palace,

1049
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:07,140
or is it your personal grudge at play?
