Though you have power now,

131

191
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,120
This is Ms. Bai, a human.

192
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,610
Master...

193
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,320
Master of Bright Moon?

194
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,330
Your mother said

195
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,540
you work for Bright Moon Palace.

196
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,250
That's actually true.

197
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,230
Master and Ms. Bai are here to help us.

198
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,370
Thank you, Master.

199
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,480
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

200
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,020
You're our guests.

201
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,290
We should treat you with hospitality.

202
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,790
But right now,

203
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
the Stone Clan…

204
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We understand.

205
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,980
Time is tight.

206
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,080
Please tell Mrs. Cang to take us

207
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,120
to see the bodies of the victims first.

208
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,870
No need to trouble Mrs. Cang.

209
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,930
I know where they are.

210
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,800
I'll take you there.

211
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:25,890
Master Fan.

212
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,870
Ms. Bai.

213
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,720
These are the bodies of the three murdered elders.

214
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,940
I'm fine.

215
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,960
Cang Shan,

216
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,250
examine the cause of death and the wounds on their bodies.

217
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,830
This one's bones are completely shattered.

218
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,310
This one too.

219
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,360
Master,

220
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,580
they weren't killed in one strike.

221
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,010
The murderer

222
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,630
shattered their bones first,

223
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,690
then tortured them to death.

224
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,850
It looks like the work of a vengeful enemy.

225
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,130
The Stone Clan has been living in the mountains for many years.

226
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,300
We don't have any enemies.

227
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,160
If it's not an enemy from another clan,

228
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,640
have you considered that the killer

229
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,160
might be from within the Stone Clan?

230
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,070
Impossible.

231
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,600
People here live in harmony.

232
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,650
There has never been any conflict.

233
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,770
No one would commit such a brutal act.

234
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,900
Not wanting to believe it doesn't mean it's impossible.

235
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,160
Before everything is clear,

236
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,040
everyone is a suspect.

237
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:09,750
In Ning'an City,

238
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,100
the Outlanders' City,  and Jingyou Mountain,

239
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,440
Young Lord saved and helped you again and again.

240
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
When the Fox Clan's mission failed,

241
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,950
she took the blame for you.

242
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,770
Without the demonic flower armor protecting her,

243
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,050
the punishment

244
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,190
made her suffer far worse than before.

245
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,550
It's not because you're so great

246
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,620
but because Young Lord has suffered too much since childhood

247
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,050
that she treasures the little warmth

248
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,140
you unknowingly gave her.

249
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,030
It's you.

250
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,220
How do you feel?

251
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,150
What did you make me eat?

252
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,900
Medicine for healing and pain relief.

253
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,100
It's a pill from Lanling?

254
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,920
I'll take you out first.

255
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,990
If Grand Master finds out,

256
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,480
do you know the consequences?

257
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,020
No matter what the consequences are,

258
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,600
I'll take you out first.

259
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,960
Have you thought this through?

260
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,100
If you save me,

261
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,090
you might be tortured by Grand Master until you're in pieces.

262
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,650
How can I hide behind you while you take the punishment

263
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,510
for the failed mission?

264
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,500
You've changed.

265
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,320
The world is full of uncertainties.

266
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,730
Whether things change or stay the same,

267
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,830
I'm just doing what I'm supposed to do.

268
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,220
But I don't understand one thing.

269
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,320
He treats you like this, making you suffer so much.

270
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,940
Why are you still so loyal to him,

271
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,550
still willing to risk your life for him?

272
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,360
Those who gave birth to you

273
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,720
despised you for being weak and sick

274
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,030
and abandoned you in the wilderness.

275
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,140
I pitied you,

276
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,320
brought you back to Cold Spring Palace, and raised you.

277
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,640
You were born useless,

278
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,270
unable to transform

279
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,550
or cultivate.

280
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,430
It was also me who put in so much effort

281
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,100
to make you who you are today.

♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

Living in pain

292
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,120
is better than facing death with no escape.

293
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,890
As long as I'm still useful to Grand Master,

294
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,390
a little suffering

295
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,730
is nothing.

296
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,250
It's because of this

297
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,400
that he tortures you again and again.

298
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
If he wants to punish me, I'll accept it.

299
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,900
I'd like to see

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,130
♫Another year passed♫

375
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,050
not everyone has a choice.

376
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,490
Chong Zhao, thank you.

377
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,320
You have feelings for Young Lord,

378
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,410
don't you?

379
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,750
Feelings are something

380
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,120
you can't see or touch,

381
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,180
and they change easily.

382
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,480
Don't jump to conclusions.

383
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
You and Young Lord are both stubborn.

384
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,270
No matter what,

385
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,440
you saved her this time.

386
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,960
I'll remember your kindness.

387
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,920
No need.

388
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,270
I've violated the palace rules

389
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,220
and privately freed Fu Ling.

390
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,920
Please punish me, Master.

391
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,850
You've come

392
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,700
sooner than I expected.

393
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,130
I deserve punishment.

394
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,390
All responsibility

395
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,540
falls on me alone.

396
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,800
I thought,

397
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,860
in your heart, there was only Bai Shuo,

398
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,800
but now, you seem to care for

399
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,980
Fu Ling as well.

400
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,000
I just didn't want to be indebted

401
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,540
to Fu Ling anymore.

402
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,430
I wanted to return her favors.

403
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,830
As for whatever happens next,

404
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,850
I'll just accept it.

405
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,190
Are you gambling on

406
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,480
my mercy?

407
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,250
What makes you think

408
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,840
I won't kill you?

409
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,750
Because Fu Ling is already useless in your eyes.

410
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,710
I believe

411
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,830
you need someone stronger by your side.

412
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,930
Who?

413
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,920
You?

414
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,550
I believe you have the answer.

415
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,640
The fact that I'm still standing here,

416
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,850
talking to you,

417
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,980
proves that you've already

418
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,600
made your choice.

419
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,980
Fine.

420
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,920
I'll let it slide this time.

421
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,470
Go return those favors.

422
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,690
After you're done,

423
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,320
there are many things here

424
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,890
that require someone like you—

425
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
someone stronger—to handle.

426
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,960
I've brought you

427
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,790
the person you want.

428
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,230
When will you let go of

429
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,410
the person I want?

430
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,690
The Stone Clan

431
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,790
doesn't look like a demon clan at all.

432
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,400
Life here is peaceful.

433
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,960
How could such a creepy thing happen here?

434
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,780
If everything in this world

435
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,980
could be as peaceful as it appears,

436
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,920
there wouldn't be so many injustices and killings.

437
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,200
The two remaining Contemplations

438
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,620
are greed and hate.

439
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,540
In a place like the Stone Clan,

440
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,410
do you think we'll find greed

441
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,690
or hate?

442
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,810
Murders out of revenge.

443
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,890
I'd say it's hate.

444
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,560
If it's hate,

445
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,210
there must be a reason.

446
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,640
If we find the root of it,

447
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,980
perhaps we can find a solution.

448
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,420
Mother,

449
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,640
where did you go in the middle of the night?

450
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,560
Where could I go?

451
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,520
With all these family matters,

452
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,520
I'm always bustling around

453
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,960
and making preparations.

454
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,950
The deaths of those victims look like an act of revenge.

455
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,310
Mother, tell me honestly.

456
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,330
Are their deaths

457
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,480
related to the event back then?

458
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,050
Stop talking nonsense!

459
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,870
That matter happened so many years ago.

460
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,500
If they wanted revenge, they would've come long ago.

461
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,130
Why wait until now?

462
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,970
Mother, do you guys all think

463
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,090
since that matter is in the past

464
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,220
and no one brings it up anymore,

465
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,190
everything can be forgotten as if it never happened?

466
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,520
We don't know if your father is still alive.

467
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,900
I don't want to argue with you over the past.

468
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,120
You're not allowed to bring it up again!

469
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,800
Why not?

470
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,860
Why not?

471
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:21,930
You harmed people back then.

472
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,910
Perhaps the consequences today are the retribution!

473
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,690
No matter what he did back then,

474
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,270
he is still your father.

475
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,800
Cang Shan,

476
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,830
your father isn't as bad as you think.

477
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,150
As the chief,

478
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,350
many things

479
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,310
were beyond his control.

480
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,670
You shouldn't speak of him like that.

481
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,950
Now,

482
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,580
the Stone Clan is in trouble,

483
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,310
and your father is missing.

484
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,330
Can't you let go of what happened back then?

485
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,150
I'll find the murderer,

486
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,890
and I'll find him.

487
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,880
But back then, you indeed

488
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,070
did something you shouldn't have.

489
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,330
No matter how hard you try to cover it up,

490
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,490
it won't change the fact that you did something horrible!

491
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,300
Young Lord, I'll go make you some medicinal soup.

492
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,370
The poison is from Grand Master.

493
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,910
No medicine can help.

494
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,850
At least it can ease the pain

495
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,940
and make you look a little less pale.

496
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,710
Do I look very pale?

497
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,550
Young Lord, I don't understand.

498
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,090
Why don't you tell Chong Zhao about the poisoning?

499
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,230
It's a poison with no cure.

500
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,050
What's the point of telling him?

501
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,020
Would it mean one more person worrying about me,

502
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,770
or one more person pitying me?

503
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,520
I don't need either.

504
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,580
It's me.

505
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,160
Young Lord, you two talk.

506
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,240
I'll leave.

507
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,310
Drink it while it's hot.

508
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,350
I'm quite curious.

509
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,190
How come Grand Master didn't punish you?

510
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,830
I'm already in Cold Spring Palace.

511
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,000
He can take my life at any time.

512
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,440
It seems Chen Ye isn't in the palace.

513
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,880
He's physically disabled.

514
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,190
I heard he's been making medicine and poison and studying weapons

515
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,250
in the palace all these years.

516
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,120
He's suddenly gone on a long trip.

517
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,410
It looks like he has something important to do.

518
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,480
I advise you not to inquire about it,

519
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,900
and don't pass information to Lanling again.

520
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,550
Every move in Cold Spring Palace

521
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,050
is under Grand Master's watch.

522
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,650
Just because he hasn't questioned you doesn't mean he doesn't know.

523
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,980
What a beautiful spiritual herb!

524
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,580
I'll take it back to help Young Lord recover.

525
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,150
How dare you!

526
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,680
That's a spiritual herb planted by Lord Chen Ye.

527
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,480
Put it down!

528
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,680
Lady Fu Ling is injured.

529
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,010
She needs this herb.

530
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,960
She's already fallen out of favor with Master.

531
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,310
She doesn't deserve this herb.

532
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,600
What are you doing?

533
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,760
Go away!

534
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,370
What's wrong with you?

535
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,300
Fu Ling!

536
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,450
Fu Ling!

537
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,990
Why is it so hot?

538
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,370
Fu Ling!

539
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,630
Fu Ling.

540
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,110
What's wrong with you?

541
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,710
[Follow the way of heaven as the way. Practice kindness, caution, and harmony.]

542
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,030
Follow the way of heaven as the way.

543
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
Practice kindness,

544
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,200
caution,

545
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,160
and harmony.

546
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,430
What did you say?

547
00:26:55,310 --> 00:27:00,930
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

548
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,370
How do you know that saying?

549
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,670
Who told you that?

550
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,010
Who told you that?

551
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:11,060
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

552
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,260
How do you know my family motto?

553
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:17,160
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫

554
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,640
Tell me!

555
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,950
Why do you know the Chong family's motto?

556
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,920
As an Eternal,

557
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,080
I should follow the way of heaven as the way;

558
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,160
practice kindness, caution,

559
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,240
and harmony.

560
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,640
Mother, Father,

561
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,000
am I right?

562
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,870
Good.

563
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,250
You recited it correctly.

564
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,700
This is the motto of the Chong family.

565
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,230
As you live and cultivate as an Eternal, it's the standard to follow.

566
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,120
Do you remember?

567
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,560
Yes.

568
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,800
♫Across thousands of miles♫

569
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,160
That motto is known only by my parents and me.

570
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,870
Do you know my parents?

571
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:49,590
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

572
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,510
What parents?

573
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,270
I don't have parents.

574
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,830
My parents abandoned me

575
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,110
ten years ago.

576
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:59,310
♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

577
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,460
It was Grand Master

578
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,330
who saved me and brought me to Cold Spring Palace.

579
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,870
Ten years ago...

580
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,640
You came to Cold Spring Palace ten years ago?

581
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,210
What about before that?

582
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,280
♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

583
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
I don't know.

584
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,270
What about before that?

585
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,440
I don't know!

586
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,660
I only have memories after coming to Cold Spring Palace.

587
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,050
My head hurts so much.

588
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:14,340
♫What kind of tree never takes root?♫

589
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,880
That dagger...

590
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,590
Why?

591
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,850
Why did I see Bai Shuo's dagger again?

592
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:22,170
♫What kind of roots never turn into trees?♫

593
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,140
Those two girls…

594
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,760
Those two girls…

595
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,240
Who are they?

596
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:32,250
♫To break the roots of love, to look at the past and seal one's heart♫

597
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,480
The dagger...

598
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,580
Two girls...

599
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,750
♫I'm your wanderer♫

600
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,480
Fu Ling,

601
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,300
who on earth are you?

602
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,890
How was last night?

603
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,100
Any more victims?

604
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,180
No.

605
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,580
I've checked every household.

606
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,270
Nothing happened last night.

607
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,110
No one died.

608
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,150
Perhaps

609
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,720
the murderer was afraid of Master Fan

610
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,740
and didn't dare to act.

611
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,400
He's obviously a trouble.

612
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,440
He's been here

613
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,270
for a long time.

614
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,000
Look. No one helped him.

615
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,400
Who is he?

616
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,790
-I don't know. 
-I don't recognize him.

617
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,230
I saw him down on the hillside

618
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,700
when I was out gathering firewood.

619
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,700
He must have fallen from the slope.

620
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,500
The clan is already in trouble.

621
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,610
We don't have the time

622
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,020
to help an outsider.

623
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,960
-Yeah. 
-Just throw him out.

624
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,880
Then throw him out.

625
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,680
-Right. 
-But he's still alive.

626
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
Let's save him first,

627
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,070
then kick him out.

628
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,510
If you want to save him, go ahead.

629
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,000
I don't want to get in trouble.

630
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,790
Master,

631
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,610
it's an outsider in a wheelchair

632
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,970
who fell from the mountain.

633
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,440
Let me check his injuries.

634
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,200
Don't interfere.

635
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,920
-Why save him?
-Exactly.

636
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Why help him?

637
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,480
Mind your own business.

638
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,350
I agree with you.

639
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,270
We should just get rid of him, right?

640
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,140
Guess what this is?

641
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:08,940
A vessel flute?

642
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,290
You can even play a leaf so well.

643
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,820
I've always wanted to make you a wooden flute.

644
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,010
Give it a try.

645
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,780
It's definitely better than a leaf.

646
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,090
♫I'm walking on a never-ending long road♫

647
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,860
♫In the vast world, how can I get there?♫

648
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,540
♫In the chaotic night wind, the melody stopped♫

649
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,110
♫The moonlight is gentle♫

650
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,710
♫All the feelings turned into nothing but a dream♫

651
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,470
♫Reminiscing about the good old days♫

652
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,710
♫Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lost♫

653
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,450
♫Forget all about the past and leave it behind♫

654
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,520
♫Time after time♫

655
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:06,550
♫Oh, melancholy♫

656
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,970
Qi Feng?

657
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,230
His new injuries are all external.

658
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,220
But the spiritual veins

659
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,810
in his legs are completely severed.

660
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,070
It looks like a serious injury from many years ago.

661
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,930
He must have suffered a lot these years.

662
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,660
Don't worry too much.

663
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,550
To see Qi Feng again

664
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,790
is already a gift from heaven.

665
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,440
I'll protect him well from now on.

666
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,830
I'll go prepare a decoction for Qi Feng.

667
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,100
Thank you.

668
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,000
He's your brother,

669
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,120
so I'll treat him like my own brother.

670
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,310
Thank you.

671
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,540
Bai Shuo.

672
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,790
Let me do it.

673
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,840
No need.

674
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,620
Qi Feng is Fan Yue's brother.

675
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,170
I must prepare this decoction myself.

676
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,720
Then,

677
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,560
I'll assist you from the side.

678
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,940
Cang Shan,

679
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,400
have there been any outsiders

680
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,840
who fell from the mountain here before?

681
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,170
I've been away from home for many years,

682
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,840
so I'm not very sure.

683
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,780
Logically speaking, the chances are small.

684
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,240
Maybe heaven thought

685
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,410
Qi Feng and Master had been apart for too long

686
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,320
and made them meet here in the Stone Clan.

687
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,230
You're awake.

688
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,070
Who are you?

689
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,550
Where am I?

690
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,700
Qi Feng,

691
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,070
I'm Yue.

692
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,100
Yue?

693
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,610
You're Yue?

694
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,430
Yue!

695
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Yue.

696
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,400
It's really you, Yue.

697
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,480
I forgot.

698
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,040
You're now the Demon King of the Polar Region,

699
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,220
Master of Bright Moon.

700
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,680
That's not appropriate.

701
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,790
You're Qi Feng.

702
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,310
I'm Yue.

703
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,830
That has never changed.

704
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,600
How did you escape from the Tiger Clan?

705
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,650
Where have you been all these years?

706
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,429
Back then,

707
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,310
after I was captured by the Tiger Clan,

708
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,159
I was locked in the dungeon.

709
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,150
One day, there was internal strife in the Tiger Clan,

710
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,820
and I escaped amidst the chaos.

711
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,420
After that,

712
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:20,929
I wandered from place to place.

713
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:24,989
Then your legs…

714
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,980
Who broke them?

715
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,400
That's not important anymore.

716
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,980
There have been too many demons who bullied me.

717
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,230
If I remembered every one of them,

718
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,190
there would be no hope left in living.

719
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,050
To be honest,

720
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,030
surviving in the demon world,

721
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,550
where the strong prey on the weak,

722
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,400
and only losing two legs

723
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,760
is already good enough.

724
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,420
Since you know I'm the Master of Bright Moon,

725
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:48,920
why haven't you come to me all these years?

726
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,650
With my weak demonic power,

727
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,000
if I stepped into the vast

728
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,870
Polar Region,

729
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,960
let alone meet the Master of Bright Moon,

730
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,460
I probably wouldn't even survive half a day.

731
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,000
Besides,

732
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,370
I'm a cripple now.

733
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,950
How could I dare approach you?

734
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,260
By the way,

735
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,690
on the day the Baize Clan was wiped out,

736
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,100
how did you survive?

737
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,650
It was Grandfather.

738
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,290
He gave me all his spiritual power.

739
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,320
Then a few years ago,

740
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,300
when the Tiger Clan was destroyed,

741
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,330
was that your doing?

742
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,670
You did that to avenge the Baize Clan,

743
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,320
didn't you?

744
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,880
No, it wasn't me.

745
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,450
Why?

746
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,470
You're the Master of Bright Moon, the strongest demon in the world.

747
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,260
Why didn't you avenge them?

748
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,960
I went to the Tiger Clan to seek revenge.

749
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,300
I also went there to look for you.

750
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,380
But by the time I arrived, the Tiger Clan had already been destroyed.

751
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,630
I searched the entire Tiger Clan,

752
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,830
but I couldn't find your body.

753
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,360
All these years, I've been searching for the one

754
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,510
who wiped out the Tiger Clan.

755
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,360
And I've never forgotten

756
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,900
the revenge of the Baize Clan.

757
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,580
Nor have I ever stopped looking for you.

758
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,350
Back then, the Tiger Clan specifically demanded you.

759
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,920
Why was that?

760
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,770
Some things

761
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,290
are better left unknown.

762
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,670
Qi Feng,

763
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,470
we're brothers.

764
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,980
You can tell me anything.

765
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,970
Knowing the truth won't do you any good.

766
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,590
It will only bring you more pain.

767
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,830
Please, don't ask.

768
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,530
Was what happened back then related to me?

769
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:23,700
Qi Feng,

770
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,650
tell me.

771
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,100
I want to know.

772
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,750
Actually,

773
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,510
the purple-eyed boy the Tiger Clan wanted back then

774
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,200
wasn't me.

775
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,350
It was you.

776
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,730
♫Don't linger, don't regret♫

777
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,910
♫The last moonlight♫

778
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,120
Yue.

779
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,730
♫The water from my hometown flows gently♫

780
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,350
Yue.

781
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,600
Yue.

782
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,130
Let's go out and play.

783
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,430
♫Sending me to the distant place♫

784
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:56,130
♫In this life, at this time♫

785
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,550
What's wrong?

786
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,650
You were born with purple eyes.

787
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,540
Even though you never said it,

788
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,950
♫I dare not look back♫

789
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,120
I knew it had always bothered you.

790
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,020
♫Is there the same moonlight♫

791
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,760
Later,

792
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,290
I secretly learned a technique to swap eyes

793
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:08,100
♫On your path?♫

794
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,990
and switched your purple eyes

795
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,900
with mine.

796
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,970
♫I'm walking on a never-ending long road♫

797
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,880
See?

798
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,820
Aren't I amazing?

799
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,970
♫In the vast world, how can I get there?♫

800
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,130
Not long after,

801
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,320
Grandfather discovered what I had done.

802
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,480
♫In the chaotic night wind, the melody stopped♫

803
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,960
♫The moonlight is gentle♫

804
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,760
Yue,

805
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,200
♫All the feelings turned into nothing but a dream♫

806
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,360
why didn't you ever tell me

807
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,430
that you didn't like your purple eyes?

808
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,080
♫Reminiscing about the good old days♫

809
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,620
Grandfather, I'm sorry.

810
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,010
♫Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lost♫

811
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,470
I...

812
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:31,740
Grandfather,

813
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,880
it was my idea to swap eyes with Yue.

814
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,930
♫Forget all about the past and leave it behind♫

815
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,090
It's not his fault.

816
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,960
♫Time after time♫

817
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,080
What's done is done.

818
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:42,640
♫Oh, melancholy♫

819
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,730
Perhaps it's fate.

820
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,630
Now that you've exchanged eyes,

821
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,170
they can't be restored.

822
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,130
Purple eyes are a natural gift

823
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,480
and never meant to be forcibly changed.

824
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,170
Since you two

825
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,640
have already made the exchange,

826
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,560
I will temporarily

827
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,180
conceal Qi Feng's

828
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,520
eye color.

829
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,410
I hope that in the future,

830
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,120
both of you

831
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,550
can be safe and sound.

832
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,590
♫I'm walking on a never-ending long road♫

833
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,840
Why don't I remember any of this?

834
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,710
It happened when you were 14.

835
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,370
♫In the vast world, how can I get there?♫

836
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,980
Have you forgotten?

837
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,110
At 15, you fell from a cliff

838
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,100
♫In the chaotic night wind, the melody stopped♫

839
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,580
♫The moonlight is gentle♫

840
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,820
and lost all your previous memories.

841
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,460
♫All the feelings turned into nothing but a dream♫

842
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,230
Then why didn't you tell the truth

843
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,320
when the Tiger Clan came

844
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,730
♫Reminiscing about the good old days♫

845
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,410
looking for the purple-eyed boy?

846
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,320
And why didn't Grandfather…

847
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,190
Because Grandfather and the rest of the clan

848
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,710
had already made their choice.

849
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,590
♫Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lost♫

850
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,040
What could I do?

851
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,390
♫Forget all about the past and leave it behind♫

852
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,450
♫Time after time♫

853
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:44,400
♫Oh, melancholy♫

854
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,690
Fan Yue!

855
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,930
You don't need to say anything.

856
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,710
Calm down first.

857
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,720
So, I'm the purple-eyed boy.

858
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,490
The one the Tiger Clan wanted to capture back then was me.

859
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,930
♫The person standing far away♫

860
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,840
How could that be?

861
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,310
♫Don't be afraid♫

862
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,230
Then Grandfather

863
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,920
and the Baize Clan…

864
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:56,370
♫The stars will guide you to me♫

865
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,460
Grandfather and the clan stayed silent

866
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,040
in order to protect me.

867
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,160
They all chose to sacrifice Qi Feng.

868
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:03,600
♫Walk towards me♫

869
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,710
Bai Shuo,

870
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,670
who am I really?

871
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,240
What does being the purple-eyed boy mean?

872
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:08,280
♫My heart feels so...♫

873
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,110
Why did everyone sacrifice themselves for me?

874
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,540
♫It's pounding as I wait for you♫

875
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,940
Everything I have now

876
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,000
was bought with Qi Feng's suffering

877
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,760
and pain.

878
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,430
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

879
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,530
Don't put all the blame on yourself.

880
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,470
No matter who you are,

881
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,390
♫You are my distant call♫

882
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,230
you were innocent back then.

883
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,610
Do you remember what Grandfather told you

884
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:32,340
♫You are my first and last♫

885
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,730
before he passed away?

886
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,920
He told you to live well.

887
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:39,160
♫My heart is trembling for you♫

888
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,090
One day,

889
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,020
you'll understand who you are.

890
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,580
You can't let Qi Feng's sudden return

891
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,470
♫In this moment where we embrace each other♫

892
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,520
erase all the pain you've endured

893
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:47,000
♫Let's never let go♫

894
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,240
and all the effort you've made.

895
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,270
What we need to do now

896
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,570
is uncover the truth behind everything,

897
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,490
protect those who need protecting,

898
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,260
and keep living.

899
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,080
That's what Grandfather

900
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,510
would want to see the most.

901
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:10,090
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

902
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,530
♫You are the light I yearn for♫

903
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:22,090
♫You are my determined way home♫

904
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,420
She came to Cold Spring Palace ten years ago.

905
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,860
She knows my parents

906
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,500
and the Chong family's motto.

907
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,610
More importantly,

908
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,770
she has memories of Bai Shuo's dagger.

909
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,180
Could it be…

910
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,150
she's Bai Xi, who went missing ten years ago?

911
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,870
Follow the way of heaven as the way.

912
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,540
Practice goodness,

913
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,840
caution,

914
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,920
and harmony.

915
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,920
If Fu Ling really is Bai Xi,

916
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,160
after she killed Uncle Bai

917
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,710
and has repeatedly tried to kill Shuo,

918
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,430
how could she possibly face the truth?

919
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,850
And for Shuo,

920
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,510
if she learns that the sister she's been missing every day

921
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,570
is actually the person she hates most,

922
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,690
how will she accept it?

923
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,810
But Bai Xi was a human,

924
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,220
while Fu Ling is a demon.

925
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,840
Why is that?

926
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,290
Fu Ling's identity isn't fully confirmed yet.

927
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,760
Telling Master now

928
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,910
might be too soon.

929
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,710
I hope I'm wrong.

930
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,810
A truth so cruel

931
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,590
might as well remain a mystery forever.

932
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,630
Sect Leader,

933
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,030
you want to see me?

934
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,030
I haven't received

935
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,880
any word from Chong Zhao in some time.

936
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,110
I wonder how things are going on his side.

937
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,250
The last time you saw that evil insect in Ning'an City,

938
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,110
it was almost fully grown.

939
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,250
By now, it's probably

940
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,010
already fully grown.

941
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,520
I've already notified other Eternal sects.

942
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,310
Their disciples have strengthened daily patrols and inspections.

943
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,080
No trace of the evil insect has been found.

944
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,780
I wonder what that old dragon from Cold Spring Palace

945
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,800
intends to do with the evil insect.

946
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:02,630
The evil insect was created by Chen Ye from Cold Spring Palace.

947
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,810
It's said that he's highly skilled in weaponry and poison-making.

948
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,880
I'm worried...

949
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,920
Sect Leader, are you worried

950
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,190
that once the evil insect is unleashed,

951
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:11,960
its harm

952
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,820
may rival the Nether Poison from back then?

953
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,570
I hope I'm overthinking it.

954
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,670
May what I fear

955
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,810
never come to pass.

956
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,500
Come in.

957
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:44,530
You are…

958
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:45,430
Bai Shuo.

959
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,460
You're injured.

960
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,550
I've brought some pills

961
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,550
specifically for you.

962
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,310
You're a physician?

963
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,840
I'm Fan Yue's friend,

964
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,230
and I know a little about medicine.

965
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,640
These pills

966
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,360
will help with your injuries.

967
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,760
That's very thoughtful of you. Thank you.

968
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,010
While you were unconscious, I examined your injuries.

969
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Your recent wounds are all external

970
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,820
and will heal quickly.

971
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,720
As for your legs,

972
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,920
I don't have a way to treat them right now.

973
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:10,950
I know.

974
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,510
My spiritual veins are all severed.

975
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,620
No medicine can help.

976
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,670
That's what the previous physicians said too.

977
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:16,830
It's fine.

978
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,090
I'm used to it.

979
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,330
Thank you for your concern.

980
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,290
Since you're Yue's friend,

981
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,720
then you're also my friend.

982
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,010
I don't have much to give,

983
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,330
just a few small handmade things.

984
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,710
I made this bamboo dragonfly myself.

985
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,570
I'd like to give it to you as a thank-you gift.

986
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,020
It's not as precious as these pills,

987
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:40,360
but it's a token of my appreciation.

988
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,390
It looks delicate.

989
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,170
I'm glad you don't find it too simple.

990
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,250
Is Yue okay?
