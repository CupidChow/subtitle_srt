1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

17
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,790
[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,000
[Episode 36]

19
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,000
I want you to tell the Divine Region

20
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,980
that Supreme Deity Xing Yue will marry into the Demon Race.

21
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:55,920
Ten days later,

22
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,870
she will marry me.

23
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,520
What did you say?

24
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,710
Your memories...

25
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,960
Killing you, hurting you,

26
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,840
or being killed by you

27
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,310
are all such boring options.

28
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,420
You're the high and mighty Supreme Deity Xing Yue who looks down on the world.

29
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,980
If you married me,

30
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,870
it'd be the greatest humiliation for you, no?

31
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,600
Of course,

32
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:23,190
you can also refuse.

33
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,690
But ten days later,

34
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,930
the wedding will be replaced by Chang Qing's death.

35
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,760
No matter which ceremony it is,

36
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,760
I'm willing to witness it.

37
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,750
A life,

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,590
or a wedding.

39
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,440
Make your choice.

40
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,160
After my wedding,

41
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,540
ten days later,

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,350
would you break your promise?

43
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,260
Are you really willing to marry me?

44
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,050
Yes.

45
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,410
Aren't you Supreme Deity Xing Yue,

46
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,670
who treats all beings as ants?

47
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,620
Does his life deserve you making such a mockery of yourself?

48
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,710
Chang Qing fell to the Demon Race

49
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,370
due to the karma I planted three years ago.

50
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,740
The peace in the Divine Region is precious.

51
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,450
But the lives of all beings in the world

52
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,640
are also precious.

53
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,130
Since you're still bothered by what happened back then,

54
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,680
I'll give you what you want.

55
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,399
It's just a wedding.

56
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,340
The lives of all beings are also precious, you said.

57
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,290
What a benevolent and loving goddess you are.

58
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,330
Ten days later,

59
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,010
our wedding will commence.

60
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,620
The Divine Region must celebrate with us.

61
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,180
Even if you have only hatred left for me,

62
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,210
I'll be able to stay

63
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,500
by your side like this before I disappear.

64
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,870
Even if it's only for ten days,

65
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,890
it's fine.

66
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,920
I didn't expect you to sleep so well

67
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,310
in the Demon Race's territory.

68
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,230
I've been waiting here for a long time.

69
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,630
[Invitation]

70
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,490
These are all the wedding invitation samples prepared by the Elder.

71
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,450
Since you are awake,

72
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,180
you can choose for yourself.

73
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,670
[Invitation]

74
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,040
The demonic realm is cold.

75
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,170
You should take care of your health.

76
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,520
I don't want to marry a sick bride

77
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,390
at the wedding ten days later.

78
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,760
Why do you look so pale?

79
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,470
Are you really sick?

80
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,770
You don't have to worry about me.

81
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,710
I've never stayed outside.

82
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,950
I'm just not used to it.

83
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,610
Is that so?

84
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,350
If that's the case,

85
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,670
you'll get used to it after a few more days.

86
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,080
Since you don't like others to worry about you,

87
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,280
you can choose on your own.

88
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,320
Jing Yuan.

89
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,330
If we can be together,

90
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,350
if we can share the same future,

91
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,740
I think

92
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,120
I would be very happy.

93
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,620
[Invitation]

94
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,580
Hidden Lord, since you're here,

95
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,600
why don't you show yourself?

96
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,310
It's been a century.

97
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,920
Your senses have become sharper, Demon Lord.

98
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,730
The wedding is in three days.

99
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,500
It's too early for you

100
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,370
to come here now.

101
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,210
Why are you playing dumb?

102
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,340
Back then, we had a deal.

103
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,950
When I fought Xing Yue,

104
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,610
you'd take the chance to destroy the Xing Yue Divine Bow,

105
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,200
and we'd rule over the Divine Region together after that.

106
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,330
But you broke your promise

107
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,510
and wasted my great opportunity.

108
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,210
I did promise to destroy

109
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,790
the Xing Yue Divine Bow with you.

110
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,950
But I also mentioned that

111
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,120
we'd depend on our own abilities

112
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,220
to destroy the bow.

113
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,659
The winner would become the ruler of the Divine Region.

114
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,730
But neither of us succeeded.

115
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,880
Therefore, the deal is off.

116
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:48,600
Besides, it's been a hundred years.

117
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,320
I'm afraid you didn't come here

118
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,860
for that matter.

119
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,090
I'm here today

120
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,960
to take Xing Yue away.

121
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,340
She's going to be my bride.

122
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,940
Stop lying to yourself.

123
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,410
She won't fall in love with you.

124
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,900
Otherwise, three years ago,

125
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,320
you wouldn't have ended up

126
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,110
in that pitiful state in the Lunar Hidden Sea.

127
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,760
How did you know about that?

128
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,560
I have never ever

129
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,330
let her out of my sight.

130
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,490
Then your eyes

131
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,970
are no longer needed.

132
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,490
Stop.

133
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,890
This is the territory of the Demon Race.

134
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,250
It's not appropriate for you

135
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,000
to start a fight here, Hidden Lord.

136
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,540
Before I came here,

137
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,740
I've rescued Chang Qing back to the Lunar Race.

138
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,210
Come with me.

139
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,320
Really?

140
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,640
I always

141
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,270
have a plan for everything.

142
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,330
Looks like the wedding in three days

143
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,040
should be held in the Lunar Race's territory.

144
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,830
And the person I'll be marrying

145
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,110
won't be you, Demon Lord.

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,620
merely because of Chang Qing?

189
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,010
If I hadn't shown up,

190
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,650
were you really going to marry him?

191
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,380
He broke out of the Demon Race's secret realm.

192
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,530
I had to stay by his side

193
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,830
to find out how powerful he was.

194
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,810
Jing Yuan's feelings for you

195
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,600
are unmatched even by me.

196
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,760
Were you not even a little touched?

197
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,020
Haven't you seen

198
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,390
how I treated him just now?

199
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,920
As expected of the deity with a heart of stone.

200
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,550
In the Divine Region,

201
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,930
only I deserve you.

202
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,650
Only you

203
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,710
deserve to stand by my side too.

204
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,520
Three days later,

205
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,790
the Lunar Hidden Sea

206
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,570
will host our wedding ceremony.

207
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:33,910
Lunar Lord!

208
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,830
How is Jing Yuan?

209
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,940
Your current vessel

210
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,510
can barely utilize one-tenth

211
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,440
of the Divine Bow's power.

212
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,260
The Demon Lord is fine.

213
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,910
I have sent him into the Demon Race's

214
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,330
secret realm according to your order.

215
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,970
He was just too shocked

216
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,510
to notice it just now.

217
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,360
When he wakes up,

218
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,990
he'll notice that the arrow I shot him with

219
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,890
has little divine power left.

220
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,100
Mo Li has almost mastered his evil techniques.

221
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,430
He won't easily leave the altar of the Hidden Race until then.

222
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,170
Only by letting him see me shoot Jing Yuan

223
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,120
can he believe

224
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,750
that the wedding at the Lunar Hidden Sea is real.

225
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,390
This way, I can use the Lunar Hidden Sea

226
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,400
to trap him

227
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,580
and slay him.

228
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,820
Xiu Yan.

229
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,900
You did a good job.

230
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,430
Lunar Lord,

231
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,070
if you are trapped with the Demon Race

232
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,300
and cannot return to the Xing Yue altar to seal the contemplations,

233
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,260
your power will disappear even faster.

234
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,740
I know.

235
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,550
I can feel the divine power dissipating in my body.

236
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,630
I don't have much time left.

237
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,990
Lunar Lord...

238
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,940
Don't be sad.

239
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,150
Even deities

240
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,160
will perish one day.

241
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,090
But before I perish,

242
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,790
I have one last thing to do.

243
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,540
The Xing Yue Bow has sensed the evil aura.

244
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,540
Before I perish, I must find

245
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,700
the person practicing the evil techniques

246
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,010
and kill him.

247
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,450
I need your help.

248
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,510
Lunar Lord,

249
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,450
your order, please.

250
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,200
In the Divine Region,

251
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,690
apart from me,

252
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,480
only Jing Yuan and Mo Li's divine power

253
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,470
can accommodate the divine souls of the Three Races.

254
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,050
So I must visit the Demon Race.

255
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,320
If Jing Yuan is not the one practicing the evil techniques,

256
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,630
the only one left is Mo Li, the Hidden Lord.

257
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,400
I will try to stay with the Demon Race.

258
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,730
And you

259
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,990
need to let the Hidden Lord know that

260
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,430
I'm staying by Jing Yuan's side.

261
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,830
Yes.

262
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,410
Don't worry.

263
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,560
After three days,

264
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,970
everything will be over.

265
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,010
Lunar Lord...

266
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,050
The Demon Lord will wake up in three days.

267
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,430
He will figure out everything.

268
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,270
But by then, you'd already...

269
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:40,930
Xiu Yan.

270
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,990
I was born as a god.

271
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,500
I should bear the responsibility of all beings.

272
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,150
But as Xing Yue,

273
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,770
I hope he can live.

274
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,900
I see desire in your eyes.

275
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,290
As long as you work for me,

276
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,680
I can help you manifest a divine body.

277
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,370
Are you willing?

278
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,260
Very well.

279
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,110
From now on,

280
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,850
you are my eyes in Xing Yue Pavilion.

281
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,080
Tell me everything that happens in Xing Yue Pavilion.

282
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,680
One day,

283
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,930
you will get what you want.

284
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,970
Three days later,

285
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,620
I'll make the Hidden Race

286
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,600
the only

287
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,810
immortal race in the Divine Region.

288
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,880
Jing Yuan.

289
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,420
Why are you here?

290
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,370
We're getting married soon.

291
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,730
Where else should I be?

292
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,010
This is the invitation I picked.

293
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,050
Isn't it pretty?

294
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,330
[Invitation]

295
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:52,890
Yes.

296
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,180
Let's use this pattern

297
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,430
to invite the gods

298
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,780
to our wedding.

299
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,340
What are you looking at?

300
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,690
The Purple Moon.

301
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,730
When we were with the Lunar Race,

302
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,680
you often told me that the Demon Race's Purple Moon

303
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,330
was vast and beautiful.

304
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,860
But I was constantly occupied by other things

305
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,980
and never paid attention.

306
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,580
Looking at it tonight,

307
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,420
it truly is beautiful.

308
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,900
Do you like this place?

309
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,460
Yes.

310
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,340
Let's stay here forever, okay?

311
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,880
If you don't like this place,

312
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,540
we can leave together and...

313
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,320
Okay.

314
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,200
Let's stay here forever.

315
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,290
Xing Yue.

316
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,600
Are we really getting married?

317
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,160
Do you know

318
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
when I fell in love with you?

319
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,750
When I sent you the fireflies?

320
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,810
When I sought the divine wine for you?

321
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,180
How about when we went to the Lunar Hidden Sea together?

322
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,420
Remember when I said that

323
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,420
I recognized you the moment

324
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,960
you joined the Lunar Race?

325
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,200
Was it love at first sight?

326
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,550
Not really.

327
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,540
That day, when I saw you,

328
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,190
I thought,

329
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,000
"Why is the Demon Lord

330
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,410
doing such a ridiculous thing?"

331
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,010
To destroy the bow,

332
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,650
you were willing to become a mere attendant.

333
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,790
I became a little interested after that.

334
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,690
I get it now.

335
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,820
Supreme Deity Xing Yue

336
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,730
took one glance at me

337
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,060
and caught feelings for me ever since.

338
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,230
Jing Yuan.

339
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm very happy.

340
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,510
What are you happy about?

341
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,330
Everything.

342
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,470
Happy that we met and fell in love,

343
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,120
happy that you prepared the invitation for me,

344
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,870
happy that we're admiring the Purple Moon together

345
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,360
Happy that we're getting married soon.

346
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,590
Happy...

347
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,290
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

348
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,250
♫You are the blueprint of my life♫

349
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,270
♫The morning breeze and morning dew♫

350
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,340
♫Let the tears celebrate♫

351
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,620
Xing Yue.

352
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,460
If this is a dream,

353
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,270
♫We embrace each other in the sky♫

354
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,160
I hope I will never wake up.

355
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,730
♫Let's never let go♫

356
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,820
Jing Yuan.

357
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,990
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,800
You woke me up.

359
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,830
Yes.

360
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,040
She made a dream for me

361
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,110
and trapped me inside.

362
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,210
But you forcefully woke me up.

363
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,900
Xiu Yan.

364
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,020
What are you and your Lunar Lord

365
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,530
planning to do?

366
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,220
She isn't planning anything.

367
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,180
Maybe she created the dream

368
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,520
to fulfill her wish.

369
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,720
Her wish?

370
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,850
I think

371
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,730
it's just a trick

372
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,720
to manipulate me.

373
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,070
Do you think I would be

374
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,440
deceived by your words again?

375
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,480
Demon Lord.

376
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,000
Didn't you notice that the Xing Yue Divine Bow

377
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,510
didn't really hurt you?

378
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,480
Her divine power has weakened.

379
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,960
Why?

380
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,630
Because of you.

381
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,040
Because of me?

382
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,020
Because she fell in love with you.

383
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,910
Xiu Yan.

384
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,550
This is the funniest joke

385
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,460
I've heard in my long life.

386
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,990
It's thanks to her that

387
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,830
I'm in this state today.

388
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,580
She betrayed me,

389
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,210
hurt me,

390
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,670
and used me.

391
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,210
If this is love,

392
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,370
I think I'll

393
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,330
have to pass.

394
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,820
She did all this

395
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,470
to save your life.

396
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,050
Tell me.

397
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,870
What do you mean by saving my life?

398
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,460
Do you think the Lunar Lord was born heartless?

399
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,330
That's because she has no choice.

400
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,490
The Bow contains the stellar power of heaven.

401
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,850
Only by giving up all her emotions

402
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,440
can she absorb the stellar power into her body

403
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,680
and use the Xing Yue Divine Bow.

404
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,590
Everyone thinks the Contemplation Stone

405
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,270
is a divine object that seals the Divine Bow.

406
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,560
Actually,

407
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,770
it seals the Lunar Lord's humanity.

408
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,750
But now,

409
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,590
the Contemplation Stone can no longer seal her feelings for you.

410
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,510
The stellar power in her body is disappearing day by day.

411
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,650
In the end, she'll even lose her life.

412
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,370
But even in the face of death,

413
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,600
she didn't give up loving you.

414
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,240
What made her give up

415
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,030
is the laws of the Xing Yue Divine Bow

416
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,480
and your survival.

417
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,710
Lunar Lord asked me to hide it from you.

418
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,250
♫No matter if I'm drunk or not, I just want to be reckless once♫

419
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,940
But how can I watch her

420
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,680
bear the misunderstanding

421
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,000
and die in misery?

422
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:18,750
♫Because love is thrilling♫

423
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,950
Die?

424
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,030
♫If you tear open my heart♫

425
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,090
This is the Contemplation Stone.

426
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,230
♫I can hold you a little tighter♫

427
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,730
It can break the seal on you

428
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,100
♫This pain will gradually fade♫

429
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,600
and remind you of everything.

430
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,290
Xing Yue.

431
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,450
♫Time withers the moonlight♫

432
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,490
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

433
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,460
and roam the Divine Region with her.

434
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,490
♫All that's left is pitch darkness♫

435
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,180
I'll show her sceneries

436
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,480
outside of the Xing Yue Pavilion.

437
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,550
♫I want to tear apart♫

438
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,650
I want to be with you forever.

♫This sky for you♫

440
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,780
Will you be my partner?

441
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,130
♫A lifetime of guarding everything with you♫

442
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,280
Why?

443
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,990
Why did you kill him?

444
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,820
♫Crossing the abyss to fulfill our vow♫

445
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,660
This...

446
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,780
is the Heavenly Path.

447
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,470
♫I'll leap without a thought for tomorrow♫

448
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,350

00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,680
♫This moment feels like forever♫

450
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,840

♫I've missed too much time in my life♫

452
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,230
is the law of the Divine Region.

The Heavenly Path wants him dead.

454
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,930
♫I'll throw myself into this flame for you♫

455
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,620

Hidden Lord is practicing evil techniques.

460
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,840
Lunar Lord agreed to marry him

461
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:25,000
♫In exchange for a lifetime of passion♫

462
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,680
to trap him with the star chain formation

463
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,840
at the Lunar Hidden Sea

464
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,120
and die with him.

465
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,340
She doesn't have much time.

466
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,540
Maybe only you can save her now.

467
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,780
Xing Yue.

468
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,690
Xing Yue.

469
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,960
When the Heavenly Bell stops toiling,

470
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,730
our divine pact will be made,

471
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,090
and you'll become my wife.

472
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,650
From now on,

473
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,590
I'll take charge of the Divine Region with you.

474
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,070
I won't let you down.

475
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,710
You want to kill me?

476
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,840
Mo Li.

477
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,480
You cultivated evil techniques and killed the Divine Race.

478
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,720
Heaven and earth cannot tolerate you.

479
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,520
Heaven and earth cannot tolerate me?

480
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,100
I'm the heaven and earth.

481
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,890
I'm the ruler of this world.

482
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,910
Who is qualified to sentence me?

483
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,230
The stellar power

484
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,890
and the law of heaven and earth

485
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,580
both uphold peace in the Divine Region.

486
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,290
I, Xing Yue, am qualified.

487
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,700
Your Hidden Power...

488
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,450
As you can see,

489
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,730
I have mastered my techniques.

490
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,490
If you hadn't fallen in love,

491
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,840
you might have been able to kill me.

492
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,270
But you are too weak now.

493
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,970
You can't shoot a full arrow with the Xing Yue Divine Bow.

494
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,110
You are no match for me.

495
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,500
But don't worry.

496
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,130
I won't kill you.

497
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,070
Even if I kill you,

498
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,580
a new Xing Yue will take your place.

499
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,500
The Xing Yue Divine Bow is my only nemesis.

500
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,530
You must be wondering why I entered

501
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,710
the Lunar Hidden Sea despite knowing your plan.

502
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,240
Because once I make the divine pact with you,

503
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,530
I'll be able to control the Xing Yue Divine Bow.

504
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,020
You invited me into your trap,

505
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,630
so I planned around it.

506
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,630
What else did you do?

507
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,660
The Divine Region

508
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,340
doesn't need any other deities

509
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,190
other than the Hidden Race.

510
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,740
Today,

511
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,850
I'll become the ruler of the world.

512
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,850
It's such a big day.

513
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,330
We need to spill the blood of the Lunar and Demon Race to celebrate.

514
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,560
Mo Li.

515
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,170
You deserve to die!

516
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,670
Xing Yue.

517
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,160
As long as you make a divine pact with me,

518
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,350
my Hidden power can protect

519
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,870
your divine soul from dispersing.

520
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,630
You can live forever

521
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,980
and take charge of the Divine Region with me.

522
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,360
Isn't that good?

523
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,620
Dream on.

524
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,330
It doesn't matter.

525
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,740
After we make the divine pact,

526
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,880
you'll be able to live for a long time.

527
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,220
One day, you will change your mind.

528
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,970
The mark of the Demon Lord?

529
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,060
When did you make a divine pact with Jing Yuan?

530
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,290
Mo Li.

531
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,230
The divine pact is set.

532
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,760
You can never control the Xing Yue Bow.

533
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,010
Even if you kill everyone in the Divine Region today,

534
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,390
one day,

535
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,500
the new Lunar Lord will be born in the world.

536
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,760
By then,

537
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,070
you will die.

538
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,680
How am I inferior to Jing Yuan?

539
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,180
You chose him and treated me as the inferior one.

540
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,300
You don't deserve to be compared with him.

541
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,430
I respected you and loved you,

542
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,140
So I put up with you and cherished you.

543
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,040
Since you abandoned me and chose someone else,

544
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,550
don't blame me for being ruthless.

545
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,060
Jing Yuan.

546
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,560
No matter what happens today,

547
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,730
don't face it alone anymore.

548
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,570
I'm here for you.

549
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,710
I'm willing to die with you.

550
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,610
But I refuse to survive alone.

551
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:13,980
Fine.

552
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,680
Since you want to die,

553
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,030
I'll grant your wish.

554
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,760
After today,

555
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,130
the whole world will regard me as the master.

556
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,800
Jing Yuan!

557
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,590
Xing Yue!

558
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,780
Draw the bow!

559
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,410
Jing Yuan!

560
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,680
Do you want to die?

561
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,940
Xing Yue!

562
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,680
You're the Supreme Deity of the Lunar Race.

563
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,220
Draw the bow!

564
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,780
Hurry, Xing Yue!

565
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,340
Draw the bow!

566
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:06,200
Do you think you can kill me like this?

567
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:07,780
No!

568
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,610
My Hidden Heart is still there.

569
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,060
I will destroy the Divine Region,

570
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,340
the world,

571
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,870
and everything!

572
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,420
None of you

573
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,909
will get what you want!

574
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,080
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

575
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,429
The Divine Region is destroyed

576
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,130
and the deities are falling.

577
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,730
Sealing this Hidden Heart

578
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,870
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

579
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,610
is the last thing I can do.

580
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,610
Jing Yuan!

581
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:13,960
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

582
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,660
Jing Yuan!

583
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,930
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫

584
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,220
♫Across thousands of miles♫

585
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:35,670
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

586
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:45,610
♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

587
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,810
Lunar Lord.

588
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,830
Lunar Lord!

589
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,510
♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

590
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,210
Lunar Lord.

591
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,060
Hidden Lord's Hidden Heart is too strong.

592
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,790
With my current power,

593
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,110
I can't destroy him completely.

594
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,540
I can only rebuild the Stellar Formation

595
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,030
to suppress the Hidden Heart

596
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,420
under the Lunar Hidden Sea.

597
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,460
You've exhausted your power with your last arrow.

598
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,250
To rebuild the Stellar Formation,

599
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,990
you have to sacrifice yourself for the formation.

600
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,500
But if you die too,

601
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,550
the Divine Region will be gone.

602
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,260
the world is still here,

603
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,720
no?

604
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,780
As long as the Hidden Heart remains,

605
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,620
its threat cannot be removed.

606
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,450
My duty

607
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,300
is to suppress the Hidden Heart.

608
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,370
Xiu Yan,

609
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,150
your mission

610
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,360
is to guard the Hidden Heart

611
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,730
until the birth of the new Lunar Lord.

612
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,630
No.

613
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,400
No...

614
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,500
Lunar Lord...

615
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,590
Lunar Lord!

616
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,510
No!

617
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,580
No!

618
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,780
♫The flowers flew away♫

619
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:14,220
♫My tears are streaming down like rain♫

620
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:25,440
♫Light my heart's lamp, cast away attachments, and ask the world♫

621
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:32,120
♫On the vast sea, you and I♫

622
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:45,780
Remember.

623
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,510
Only the full power of the Xing Yue Divine Bow

624
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,690
can completely destroy the Hidden Heart.

625
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,350
Remember.

626
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,220
Bring everything

627
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,890
back on track.

628
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,710
Lunar Lord!

629
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,550
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

630
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,850
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

631
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,700
♫My love brought tears♫

632
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,670
♫Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completeness♫

633
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,650
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

634
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,550
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

635
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,520
♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

636
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,490
♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

637
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,510
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

638
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,570
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

639
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,950
♫The daylight burns through, and the stars shine bright♫

640
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,840
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

641
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,300
Lunar Lord...

642
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,950
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

643
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,370
I will guard the Lunar Hidden Sea and the Hidden Heart

644
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,230
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

645
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,020
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

646
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,730
with my life.

647
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,680
♫To protect the world for eternity♫

648
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,750
Till my final moments.

649
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:52,420
The Hidden Heart would not destroy where it resided.

650
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,200
So the Lunar Hidden Sea

651
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,400
became the only surviving location of the Divine Region.

652
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,750
Bai Shuo,

653
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,270
you're the one I'm waiting for.

654
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,470
No.

655
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,400
Xing Yue, Jing Yuan, and Mo Li.

656
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,300
They were already dead.

657
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,290
Why can they still appear in the world?

658
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,720
The heaven and earth gave birth to the Supreme Deity of Three Races.

659
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,940
The bodies of the Supreme Deities may live and die,

660
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,320
but the Divine Mantles will never disappear.

661
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,030
As long as the Divine Mantles remain,

662
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,820
they will be able to live again.

663
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,920
However, no one knows

664
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,440
how long that will take.

665
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,360
I'm already lucky that it only took

666
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,170
60,000 years for me to meet you.

667
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,360
But I met Jing Yuan ten years ago.

668
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,980
He was still alive back then.

669
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,580
I cannot understand that either.

670
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,420
Maybe only Jing Yuan

671
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,280
knows the reason.

672
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,700
What about Chong Zhao?

673
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,970
You haven't answered me.

674
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,040
Why was the Hidden Lord born an Eternal Race?

675
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,590
Because fate has been disrupted.

676
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,750
The Fate of Heaven

677
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,600
has been in chaos since

678
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,240
the Divine Region was destroyed,

679
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,310
and couldn't control the whereabouts of your Divine Mantles.

680
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,810
That's why Zhen Yu spent 60,000 years looking for

681
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,580
all of you after escaping the Divine Region.

682
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,670
Zhen Yu?

683
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,440
That black snake

684
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,940
was Zhen Yu.

685
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,740
Back then, his spiritual consciousness was not yet established,

686
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,730
so he couldn't remember your faces.

687
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,660
He only remembered

688
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,190
his faith in the Hidden Lord

689
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,620
and his mission to welcome him back.

690
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,910
It's the same with Luan Zhu.

691
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,610
Thanks to the boundless life energy of the Soul Lotus,

692
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,550
she survived

693
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,680
and ended up on the Eastern Continent.

694
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,080
She hated you for killing Jing Yuan.

695
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,110
So she wanted to kill you too.

696
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,110
I once asked

697
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,220
why she didn’t do it herself

698
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,480
and made Chong Zhao do it instead.

699
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,990
Only a Supreme Deity can truly kill a Supreme Deity.

700
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,880
60,000 years ago,

701
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,720
Xing Yue failed to truly kill Mo Li and Jing Yuan

702
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,080
because her power was too weak.

703
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,500
If Chong Zhao really killed you that day,

704
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,580
your Divine Mantle would have been destroyed

705
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,840
and you'd never live again.

706
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,850
I see.

707
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
That's not right.

708
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,220
60,000 years ago,

709
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,880
the Contemplation Stone was in your hands.

710
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,710
You're the only deity who survived.

711
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,780
But why did you say you were dead?

712
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,550
Why did the Contemplation Stone end up in Lanling?

713
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,520
Hidden Lord's attack

714
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,680
hurt me badly.

715
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,340
At that time, I knew

716
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,800
I had little time left.

717
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,360
But I still had my promise to my Lunar Lord.

718
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,860
I didn't want the Divine Region to end its inheritance either.

719
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,010
So,

720
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,090
I also went to the Eastern Continent.

721
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,310
I built a cave there

722
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,720
and carved the secret techniques and history

723
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,630
of the

724
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,570
Divine Region's inheritance

725
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,080
on the stone walls.

726
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,400
At that time, I thought that

727
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,900
maybe one day,

728
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,000
a fated one would stumble upon this cave

729
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,180
and witness the history and former glory

730
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,350
of the Divine Region.

731
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,960
In the Divine War,

732
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,140
the Contemplation Stone went completely silent.

733
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,570
And I sensed that the new Lunar Lord

734
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,500
would be born in the Eastern Continent.

735
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,210
So I gave the Contemplation Stone

736
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,110
to the famous Lanling Clan.

737
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,440
I left a divine edict

738
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,890
to let every sect leader of Lanling

739
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,110
wait for and aid the girl

740
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,440
who could activate the Contemplation Stone.

741
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,400
Unfortunately,

742
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,000
when the secret was passed down to the current generation,

743
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,320
it was used by Jin Yao instead.

744
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,110
After doing all that,

745
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,920
I returned to the Lunar Hidden Sea

746
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,180
and guarded the Hidden Heart without rest.

747
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,530
Soon,

748
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,180
I died from my serious injury.

749
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,920
It was the protection power Lunar Lord

750
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,920
left me in this Flaming Moon pendant

751
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,850
that helped me maintain a strand of my divine soul

752
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,080
to this day.

753
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,360
But why are you only telling me all this now?

754
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,850
Why did you pretend

755
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,360
to be my benefactor on purpose?

756
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,030
Because at that time,

757
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,150
you were just a human who had never experienced the world.

758
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,690
You didn't even know what Eternals and demons were,

759
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,500
let alone understand what it means to protect the world.

760
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,820
Becoming an Eternal to return the favor

761
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,330
became your original intention,

762
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:59,310
helping you overcome all obstacles along the way.

763
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,740
Now,

764
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,170
you've experienced a lot of life and death

765
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,530
and developed your mind.

766
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,880
You also possess the divine power

767
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,680
to take on the responsibility now.

768
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,360
If I were really a deity,

769
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,220
why couldn't I revive the dead

770
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,520
and save Fan Yue?

771
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,790
I also didn't expect that

772
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,170
Fan Yue would find the cave.

773
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,860
The curse of the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal

774
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,330
wasn’t part of my plan,

775
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,910
and certainly not what I wanted.

776
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,780
Now I can only help you

777
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,630
protect his body.

778
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,020
As for the rest,

779
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,310
I can do nothing.

780
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,000
But, Bai Shuo,

781
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,990
this is not the time to be sad.

782
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,450
I'm telling you everything today

783
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,820
because the Lunar Hidden Sea can no longer suppress the Hidden Heart.

784
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,180
Why?

785
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,510
After 60,000 years,

786
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,450
even the strongest divine power will disappear.

787
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,000
Without Xing Yue and Jing Yuan's powers suppressing it,

788
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,030
the Hidden Heart will escape,

789
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,610
and the Lunar Hidden Sea will no longer exist.

790
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:59,270
I can only use the Contemplation Stone in your body

791
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,010
to keep the Hidden Heart for now.

792
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,600
But this is not a long-term solution.

793
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,170
Bai Shuo,

794
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,750
you have to find the Xing Yue Divine Bow

795
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,000
and completely destroy Hidden Heart

796
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,510
to avoid the world-destroying catastrophe.
