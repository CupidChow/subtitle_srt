00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Episode 23]

19
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
Is Yue okay?

20
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,450
Actually, I shouldn't have

21
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,950
told him about those things from the past.

22
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,820
Yue's reserved and quiet.

23
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,570
He didn't have many friends

24
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,920
when he was in the Baize Clan.

25
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,240
Now,

26
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,010
I'm so glad to see him be friends

27
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,200
with you, Ms. Bai.

28
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,330
Hope you can help cheer him up.

29
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,890
Actually,

30
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,190
it's not all his fault.

31
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,060
What happened to the Baize Clan

32
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,090
is the greatest pain and regret in his heart.

33
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,280
He has been missing you all these years.

34
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,390
I'm also happy to see you two

35
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,950
reunited now.

36
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,150
Yue is now

37
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,170
the esteemed Demon King of the Polar Region.

38
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,040
He's shared the past

39
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,970
and his weaknesses

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,220
with you.

41
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,200
I bet you matter a lot to him.

42
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,440
He also means a lot to me.

43
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,100
Have a good rest.

44
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,960
I'll take my leave.

45
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,180
You're awake.

46
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:01,980
I

47
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,240
was just passing by.

48
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,490
Come in.

49
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,600
If you have anything to say,

50
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,630
just go ahead.

51
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,570
You had a sudden headache yesterday.

52
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,930
How is it now?

53
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,100
Are you worried about me?

54
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,640
As you said,

55
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,950
we are in the same boat here at the Cold Spring Palace.

56
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,740
Of course I should care about you.

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,920
I fought my way out of those extraordinarily treacherous places.

58
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,310
Injuries are nothing new to me.

59
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,560
A little headache

60
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,780
is nothing.

61
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,440
But it's quite weird.

62
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,950
I've had headaches for no reason.

63
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,130
Pretty sure

64
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,900
yesterday was the third time.

65
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,070
Do you have any other symptoms

66
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,150
besides the headache?

67
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,830
Some images

68
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,320
flashed through my mind,

69
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,640
but I couldn't see clearly.

70
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,740
There seemed to be some sounds as well,

71
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,960
but I couldn't remember now.

72
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,880
Did I

73
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,790
say something

74
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,310
that made you so concerned?

75
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,730
You were

76
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,670
actually mumbling something.

77
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,130
but I didn't catch it.

78
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,130
You're hiding something from me.

79
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,740
What can I hide from you?

80
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,630
Looks like your headaches

81
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,610
are just from your overthinking.

82
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,310
If I didn't think too much,

83
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,860
I wouldn't have made it this far alive.

84
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,100
Are you leaving already?

85
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,420
I have something to attend to.

86
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,150
The tranquilizer.

87
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,960
You've been up all night?

88
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,160
Tastes good.

89
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,810
I hope you're really letting it go

90
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,660
instead of pretending.

91
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,950
Knowing the truth

92
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,750
is to face it better,

93
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,300
but not to be stuck in past guilt.

94
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,420
Don't forget that

95
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,460
we came to the Stone Clan's place not only to investigate the case

96
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,620
but also to gather the Contemplations.

97
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,920
Only by gathering the Five Contemplations

98
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,840
and undoing the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal on you as soon as possible

99
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,860
can you protect the people around you better.

100
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
I'm so lucky to have you

101
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,140
by my side.

102
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,200
The Stone Clan's place

103
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,870
is full of danger now.

104
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,020
After dark,

105
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,270
let's go to the stone forest

106
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,120
for investigation.

107
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,560
I also want to know why these victims

108
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,660
were all killed in the stone forest at night.

109
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,160
Seems that you got here

110
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
one step ahead of me, Ms. Bai.

111
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,600
I'll head out and leave you

112
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,820
to your meal.

113
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,720
Why not join us?

114
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,070
I remember

115
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,660
you used to love these bamboo-stuffed buns.

116
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,600
I asked Mrs. Cang.

117
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,430
She told me

118
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,159
the bamboo shoots here only grow in the back mountain.

119
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,140
So I went there early this morning to dig these fresh bamboo shoots.

120
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:37,990
Give it a try.

121
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,890
You don't have to over-exert yourself for me.

122
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,690
Qi Feng,

123
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,580
you just came here, so you may not know

124
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,090
it's not safe

125
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,280
in the Stone Clan right now.

126
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,690
You'd better not go out alone.

127
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,940
Now that you and Fan Yue are finally reunited,

128
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,460
your safety is very important to him.

129
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,050
My bad for being reckless.

130
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,390
I just wanted to let Yue

131
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,750
try my cooking.

132
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,170
I'm not blaming you.

133
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,610
You're right, Ms. Bai.

134
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,920
Now I'm disabled

135
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,940
with weak spiritual power.

136
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,300
I'd be pretty helpless

137
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,910
if I really ran into danger.

138
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,260
Qi Feng,

139
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,940
Shuo is caring about you.

140
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,010
Don't worry.

141
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,920
I'm here,

142
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,670
and I will protect you.

143
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,120
Since it used to be Fan Yue's favorite,

144
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,230
let me try it too.

145
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,500
Thank you, Qi Feng.

146
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,559
Ms. Bai, with your amazing cooking,

147
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,370
Yue can enjoy

148
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,429
a lot of delicacies from now on.

149
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,170
Mrs. Cang,

150
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,150
let me help you.

151
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,210
Don't bother, Ms. Bai. I can do it myself.

152
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,030
It's okay, Mrs. Cang.

153
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,080
We're lodging in your house.

154
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,680
Helping out is the least we can do.

155
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,110
Thank you.

156
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,200
I heard from Shi Lei that

157
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,630
the Stone Clan has no grudges outside

158
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,650
with peace inside.

159
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,160
You guys have no enemies.

160
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,540
But with no enemies,

161
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,470
your clan members were actually tortured to death.

162
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,910
You went all the way to the Unbridled Pavilion

163
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,810
and anxiously asked Master Fan for help.

164
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,560
But we've been here for two days.

165
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,700
Yet you didn't urge us to find your husband.

166
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,170
Aren't you worried?

167
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,310
Or

168
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,900
are you waiting for something?

169
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,850
What's the use of worrying?

170
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
Master Fan

171
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,630
has his own way of investigation.

172
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,980
I'm just

173
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,280
an ignorant woman.

174
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,350
So I can only wait for him to solve the case.

175
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,930
But you don't look like you know nothing.

176
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,070
Mrs. Cang,

177
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,910
the murder case of the Stone Clan is still unsolved.

178
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,820
I hope you don't hide any information.

179
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,290
I...

180
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,660
Mrs. Cang,

181
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,090
I heard that the wind chimes under the eaves are broken.

182
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,660
I made you a new one.

183
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,140
Hope you like it.

184
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,050
What?

185
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,480
You don't like it, Mrs. Cang?

186
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,190
I've got soup simmering in the kitchen.

187
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,950
I'll go take a look.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll leave the space for you.

189
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,340
Mrs. Cang,

190
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,990
the kitchen is that way.

191
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,660
Well, I'm getting old.

192
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,810
I can't even tell the direction.

193
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,950
Why are you looking at me like that, Ms. Bai?

194
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,860
Nothing.

195
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,950
I just think your craftsmanship

196
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,490
is way better than I thought.

197
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,730
Although God took away my legs,

198
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,050
I've still got a pair of hands to make a living.

199
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,620
That's kind of him.

200
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,970
If you need anything,

201
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,120
just tell me.

202
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,280
At least,

203
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,860
I can help with something this way.

204
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,080
The Heavenly Sky Fan?

205
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,960
You are the Master of Cold Spring Palace?

206
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,660
He's even set a barrier.

207
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,950
Looks like this mirror

208
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,780
means a lot to Zhen Yu.

209
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,270
You shouldn't be here.

210
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,140
Master,

211
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,960
I came to report the recent movements

212
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,010
of the Eternals and demons

213
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,120
and didn't find you in the room.

214
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,900
I planned to...

215
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,090
Is this what you meant when you said

216
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,780
you'd be the strongest among the Ladies and Lords

217
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,340
by my side?

218
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,000
So strong that

219
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,640
you could even enter my room

220
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,650
and pry into my secret at will.

221
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,550
Do you know that,

222
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,300
with a little squeeze,

223
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,040
I could just

224
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,110
crush your head?

225
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,290
I didn't intend

226
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,080
to pry into your secret, Master.

227
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,980
I just accidentally hit it.

228
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,390
Master!

229
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,970
Master...

230
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,300
Chong Zhao broke into your room

231
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,170
for...

232
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,930
It was for me.

233
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,630
For you?

234
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,830
Chong Zhao knew I was punished and was worried,

235
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,970
so he broke into your room to look for the elixir.

236
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,740
He definitely didn't mean to offend you, Master.

237
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,400
Please forgive him

238
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,400
and spare his life.

239
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,690
Really?

240
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,870
Yes.

241
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,450
Don't think that

242
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,470
you're indispensable to the Cold Spring Palace.

243
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,780
In this world,

244
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,690
no one

245
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,020
is irreplaceable.

246
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,150
I understand.

247
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,120
I understand.

248
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,560
Get lost!

249
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,590
I told you

250
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,100
everything in the Cold Spring Palace

251
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,600
is under the Grand Master's control.

252
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,320
How dare you break into his room without permission?

253
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,380
And as I said,

254
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,920
we're even now.

255
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,190
You don't have to speak up for me anymore.

256
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,730
Do you really want to die?

257
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,270
Sometimes, it may seem like a path to death,

258
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,650
yet it might actually give more people a chance to survive.

259
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,550
Back in the Outlanders' City, Zhen Yu

260
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,120
already ignored the order of Eternals and demons.

261
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,020
What is the plot he's working on now?

262
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,770
This concerns world peace.

263
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,080
I have to dig into it

264
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,060
even at the risk of my life.

265
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,810
So,

266
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,490
what did you find?

267
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,220
An ancient mirror with cracks.

268
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,730
Have you heard of it from him before?

269
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,630
An ancient mirror?

270
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,150
I've never heard the Grand Master mention it before.

271
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,030
But why did he

272
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,790
let you go so easily today?

273
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,130
You already went against his order

274
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,190
and saved me from the secret chamber.

275
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,990
Today, you even pried into his secret,

276
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,090
yet he just accepted the excuse I made up and let you go.

277
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,400
I think he found something

278
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,620
on me.

279
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,440
Did the Grand Master also spot

280
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,150
the black forehead mark on Chong Zhao?

281
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,940
I think I also sensed

282
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,950
another sort of power from him,

283
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,250
something other than demonic power.

284
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,280
Something other than demonic power?

285
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,810
You've never noticed it before?

286
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,080
Am I the only one who can sense it?

287
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,850
Why on earth did Zhen Yu let me go?

288
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,900
Chong Zhao,

289
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,450
You were lucky to be spared

290
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,610
by the Grand Master.

291
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,660
I'm afraid

292
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,670
you can't dig up any secrets

293
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,060
in the Cold Spring anymore.

294
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,200
I suggest you

295
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,570
go back to Lanling.

296
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,040
Your soup smells so good, Mrs. Cang.

297
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,720
Why are you so nervous?

298
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,050
You've been acting well

299
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,480
these past few days, haven't you?

300
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,210
As you requested,

301
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,000
I've lured the Master of Bright Moon here.

302
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,340
When will you release my husband?

303
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,540
It depends on whether you listen to me or not.

304
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,680
After so many years,

305
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,660
you're still so into bones, Mrs. Cang.

306
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,510
Judging from the scratches

307
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,349
and the holes all over these stones,

308
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,240
it's clear that the murderer wielded some sharp

309
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,680
steel weapons

310
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,530
that could kill people with one blow,

311
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,640
yet the murderer chose

312
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,329
to break their bones and veins.

313
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,240
Aside from torturing them,

314
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,369
what else was the murderer up to?

315
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,070
Maybe the victims

316
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,270
share something in common.

317
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,190
Something in common?

318
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,060
No.

319
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,260
They are all from different families.

320
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,530
I got it.

321
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,580
Before I left the Stone Clan,

322
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,960
a host of clan members fell ill.

323
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,630
I remember they were the ones who went out to find the elixir

324
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,730
and cured everyone.

325
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,030
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

326
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,680
What disease did they get?

327
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,980
And what elixir did they find?

328
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,010
I don't know.

329
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,710
I have to ask my mother.

330
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,320
Who's there?

331
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,480
Get him!

332
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,180
Where are we?

333
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,180
Why's the resentment aura so strong here?

334
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,680
Master,

335
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,420
Bai Shuo,

336
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,490
let's go.

337
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,820
This is the Forbidden Stone Formation of the Stone Clan.

338
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,070
Are you okay?

339
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,710
Master,

340
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,450
I'm fine.

341
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,450
I cut the man in black on the shoulder.

342
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,330
That's so weird.

343
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,590
That man in black seemed to have

344
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,720
deliberately lured us here,

345
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,160
held the two of us back,

346
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,760
and only attacked Cang Shan.

347
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,370
What on earth is his purpose?

348
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,070
Let's go back first.

349
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,480
What on earth is that stone formation for?

350
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,290
Actually, we Stone Clan

351
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,340
didn't live here before.

352
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Ten years ago,

353
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,160
the Demon Race was awash with slaughter.

354
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,150
Many clans were destroyed by the Tiger Clan.

355
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,590
We Stone Clan were no exception.

356
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,880
To avoid the hunting of the Tiger Clan,

357
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,950
my father led the clan members to migrate everywhere.

358
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,080
First, we reached a valley in the south.

359
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,400
It abounded with spiritual energy,

360
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,880
hidden in the mountains

361
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,550
as a perfect place to live in seclusion.

362
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,190
Our people wanted to settle there,

363
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,730
but we found

364
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,790
it was the home of another ancient clan.

365
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,680
What ancient clan?

366
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,730
I don't know.

367
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,380
When we arrived,

368
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,600
they were already wiped out.

369
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,110
Only one young man was left,

370
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,480
guarding the tombs of his family there.

371
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,970
Our people had been wandering for too long.

372
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,820
They didn't want to leave there.

373
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,390
They wanted to occupy that valley by force.

374
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,140
But that was the young man's home too.

375
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,280
How would he let that happen?

376
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,330
At the resting place of his family,

377
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,300
if he had any guts left in him,

378
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,390
he wouldn't give in.

379
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,810
What did you do?

380
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,430
That young man would rather die than leave his homeland.

381
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,490
My father

382
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,260
killed him.

383
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,190
What?

384
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,010
After he died,

385
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,350
the resentment aura started to permeate

386
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,620
and make trouble for the people of the Stone Clan.

387
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,370
Our clan couldn't continue living there,

388
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,170
so we had to migrate again

389
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,410
to this place.

390
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,570
But that young man's resentment aura

391
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,470
followed us all the way,

392
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,370
sticking around.

393
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,700
My father

394
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,510
and the other clansmen

395
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,290
erected the stone pillars in the stone forest

396
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,490
to suppress the resentment aura.

397
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,650
That's the Stone Formation we've just been to.

398
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,320
Seized someone's residence,

399
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,120
killed the innocent,

400
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,810
and suppressed his soul.

401
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,080
No wonder that Stone Formation is a forbidden area.

402
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,680
Did you refuse to return home

403
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,670
because of this past incident?

404
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,630
I had a big fight with my father.

405
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,950
After that,

406
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,420
I left the Stone Clan

407
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,840
and never came back.

408
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,650
The resentment aura in that Stone Formation

409
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,270
is definitely not from the young man alone.

410
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,570
Are you hiding anything else from me?

411
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,400
I swear I've come clean.

412
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,490
Master,

413
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,720
please trust me.

414
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,600
But if the last one

415
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,810
of that ancient clan's bloodline was killed,

416
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,820
who else would come to take revenge?

417
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,410
Did you see

418
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,910
that young man get killed?

419
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,500
My father

420
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,410
broke his legs.

421
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,380
He bled all over the place with a hemorrhage.

422
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,880
He couldn't survive.

423
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,190
Your father broke his legs?

424
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,830
Qi Feng's legs have suffered from an old injury as well.

425
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,660
The timing of his appearance was too coincidental.

426
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,550
What if...

427
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,040
The world is full of coincidences.

428
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,960
There are plenty of people with leg problems.

429
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,400
This alone

430
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,610
can't prove anything.

431
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,220
I've checked it in person.

432
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,800
Qi Feng's legs are indeed totally broken.

433
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,760
The man in black

434
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,490
we just saw in the Stone Formation

435
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,970
has fully functional legs.

436
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,290
He can't be Qi Feng.

437
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,880
Fan Yue, don't think too much.

438
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,690
Coincidences may not necessarily be the truth.

439
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,940
Don't stress yourself out.

440
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:00,610
Cang Shan,

441
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,020
how old was that young man

442
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,160
when his legs got broken?

443
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,150
About 14 or 15 years old.

444
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,530
In other words,

445
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,380
he is about the same age as Fan Yue.

446
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,790
Bai Shuo,

447
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,800
didn't you just talk like you didn't suspect Qi Feng?

448
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,840
It's not that I don't.

449
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,820
I just don't want to suspect him in front of Fan Yue.

450
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,400
He lost his entire family

451
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,750
overnight that year.

452
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,640
Now that he's finally got Qi Feng back,

453
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,060
it's torture for him

454
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,910
to suspect Qi Feng of the murder.

455
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,400
Currently, it's pure speculation with no evidence.

456
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,270
Before we find out the truth,

457
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,980
there's no need to make Fan Yue sad.

458
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,270
I see.

459
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,060
Like this?

460
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,660
The divination of three special children

461
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,070
is about the ultimate secret of the world.

462
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,830
We'd better not do it.

463
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,520
You shall either divine

464
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,720
or die.

465
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,170
I'll do it...

466
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,160
Let me do it...

467
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,950
What does this mean?

468
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,260
Baize Clan,

469
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,000
purple-eyed boy.

470
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,540
What's wrong with you?

471
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,420
Oh, no...

472
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,620
This divination is against God's will.

473
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,820
I will get backlash!

474
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,660
Then die!

475
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,360
No, I'll do it...

476
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,510
Let me continue.

477
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,320
And what does this mean?

478
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,310
You...

479
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,630
What exactly are you making me divine?

480
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,020
Don't ask about what you shouldn't know.

481
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:25,850
Say it.

482
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:28,570
Human Race,

483
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,080
Ning'an City,

484
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,310
Bai family.

485
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,910
Bai family?

486
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,790
Go on.

487
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,210
I really can't divine the third one!

488
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,170
Then die.

489
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,830
It takes abundant spiritual energy for a Mystery Turtle

490
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,010
to divine the top secret of the world.

491
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,270
The first two children's information

492
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,910
has used up my spiritual energy.

493
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,400
Even if you kill me today,

494
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,440
it's still beyond my capacity.

495
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,590
Then I'll just kill you.

496
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,440
Five years...

497
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,310
Give me five years!

498
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,200
Once I fuel myself with spiritual energy in five years,

499
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,510
I'll surely help you divine

500
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,930
where the third child is.

501
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,220
Fine.

502
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,250
Today I'll

503
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,540
trust you this time.

504
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,290
You have five years.

505
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,530
Five years later,

506
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,360
I'll come to you again.

507
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,600
Don't try to play tricks.

508
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,620
Otherwise,

509
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,660
I'll make sure to eliminate all the Mystery Turtles

510
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,520
in the Eastern Continent.

511
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,220
According to the Mystery Turtle's divination,

512
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,040
I've brought back the first two children

513
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,680
from the Demon Race and Human Race.

514
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,810
Do I really have to wait

515
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,410
for two decades for the third child?

516
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,570
The third child will be born...

517
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,870
Where?

518
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,390
The Eternal Race.

519
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,970
When?

520
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,720
Twenty years later.

521
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,330
Twenty years later?

522
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,410
Okay.

523
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,500
In these 20 years,

524
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,760
you should stay at the Cold Spring Palace with me.

525
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,030
By then,

526
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,490
you shall wait

527
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,510
for the birth of that child with me.

528
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,600
The third child shouldn't be born yet.

529
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,500
But just now,

530
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,820
I clearly saw that black forehead mark

531
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,750
on Chong Zhao.

532
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,170
Did that Mystery Turtle lie to me?

533
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,650
My lord,

534
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,050
I've been waiting for you for 60,000 years.

535
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,190
It's been 60,000 years.

536
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,210
Everyone thinks that all gods have perished,

537
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,610
and the Hidden Race has fallen.

538
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,580
No one knows that

539
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,960
I've been holding onto the last bit of your hidden power

540
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,710
all the time, my lord.

541
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,290
I didn't have awareness 60,000 years ago.

542
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,350
Although I can't remember your appearance,

543
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,670
I've never forgotten your help.

544
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,030
I won't mistake that black forehead mark.

545
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,660
My lord,

546
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,480
is it really you?

547
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,990
My lord,

548
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,250
I will find the Contemplation Stone

549
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,810
and the three children

550
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,000
with the Divine Race destiny

551
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,350
as soon as possible

552
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,890
to bring you

553
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,110
back to the world.

554
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,600
Soon,

555
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:39,880
I won't need this Heavenly Mirror

556
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,480
to reminisce you anymore.

557
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,110
My lord,

558
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,020
wait for me.

559
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,360
Yue!

560
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,200
Have you finished the investigation with Ms. Bai?

561
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,850
With a murder in the Stone Clan,

562
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,240
no one will feel at ease.

563
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,190
After what happened to the Baize Clan back then,

564
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,400
I felt like I died inside as well.

565
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,420
You and I know the pain

566
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,530
of losing family.

567
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,670
If there's anything I can help,

568
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,950
just feel free to reach out to me.

569
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,050
Qi Feng,

570
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,280
where were you when we entered the stone forest

571
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,960
last night?

572
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,200
I was in my room.

573
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,650
Yue,

574
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,500
are you suspecting me?

575
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,810
There's something I want to ask you.

576
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,560
Last time you didn't give me a straight answer

577
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,910
about how your legs got broken.

578
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,460
Can you tell me now?

579
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,080
Who hurt you?

580
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,690
Do you want to know who hurt me,

581
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,980
or who I hurt?

582
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,610
Yue,

583
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,670
you don't trust me.

584
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,870
We are brothers.

585
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,910
Brothers never lie to each other.

586
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,870
That's why I chose to ask you directly.

587
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,800
Do you know what keeps you from passing away

588
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,950
when the pain almost knocks you out?

589
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,690
It's hope.

590
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,300
I hoped I could survive.

591
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,580
I hoped I could see you again.

592
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,080
The Baize Clan was gone.

593
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,850
You were the last one I've got.

594
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,250
If I couldn't make it and died out there,

595
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,100
how would you manage to live alone?

596
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,940
This hope

597
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,800
helped me pull through.

598
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,370
But I didn't expect

599
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,260
you to suspect me now.

600
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,280
Qi Feng,

601
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:13,890
I...

602
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,530
What happened?

603
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,030
What's wrong?

604
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,720
I don't know!

605
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,910
Come and take a look.

606
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,990
He fell from the sky.

607
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,440
This man

608
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,280
just fell from the sky.

609
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,800
If I hadn't dodged in time,

610
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,510
he almost hit me.

611
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,460
It's the one who attacked us last night.

612
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,290
The attacker?

613
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,240
What's going on?

614
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,000
Who is it?

615
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
What happened?

616
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,790
Chief?

617
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,070
Didn't the Chief go missing?

618
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,000
What's going on?

619
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,720
It's the Chief!

620
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,750
Why is the Chief here?

621
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:57,830
Chief?

622
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,190
Is that true?

623
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,030
How could it be the Chief?

624
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,860
[Uncle Shi, Stone Clan, Demon Race]

625
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,400
Chief?

626
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,760
How could it be?

627
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,140
Why did this happen all of a sudden?

628
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,710
The Mountain-splitting Blade...

629
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,330
The Mountain-splitting Blade?

630
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,180
It was you...

631
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,500
It was you!

632
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,330
The wounds on the Chief

633
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,080
were caused by the Mountain-splitting Blade!

634
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,910
The Mountain-splitting Blade?

635
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,140
Cang Shan,

636
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,910
you killed the Chief!

637
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,150
Father!

638
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,280
Don't talk nonsense!

639
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,700
Although the Mountain-splitting Blade is Cang Shan's weapon,

640
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,360
how could he hurt the Chief?

641
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,330
Cang Shan,

642
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,650
explain it to us.

643
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,080
C'mon! Defend yourself!

644
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,650
What's there to explain?

645
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,250
You bastard!

646
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,500
Before we get to the bottom of it,

647
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,890
no one can make a move.

648
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,050
Father...

649
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,380
It was me...

650
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,700
I killed my father.

651
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,530
I killed my father...

652
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,650
I killed my father...

653
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,550
I killed my father...

654
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,620
I killed my father.

655
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,680
I killed my father!

656
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,950
Cang Shan!

657
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,760
You have no conscience!

658
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,610
Leave it to me.

659
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,580
That bastard killed his father!

660
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,860
Bastard!

661
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,120
You bastard!

662
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,390
Bastard!

663
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,870
You are such a jerk!

664
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,410
Bastard! Kill him!

665
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,290
You watched Cang Shan grow up.

666
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,410
You should know him well.

667
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,020
Even though he was mad at his father,

668
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,530
he would never kill his father!

669
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,850
He wouldn't do it

670
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,040
if he were sober.

671
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,890
But when he relapses,

672
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,910
he can't control himself at all.

673
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,940
Everyone here knows that.

674
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,650
Yes, we all know that.

675
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,510
What do you mean

676
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,530
by "relapse"?

677
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,790
We Stone Clan members are born

678
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,090
with stronger power than other demons.

679
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,890
We don't know why

680
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,230
Cang Shan was born with way more overwhelming power.

681
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,020
I killed my father...

682
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,880
He couldn't control this power before,

683
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,290
often losing control

684
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,220
and hurting our people.

685
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,380
I killed my father...

686
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,170
Since I met Cang Shan,

687
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,400
I've never seen him lose control of his demonic power

688
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,780
or hurt any random people.

689
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:34,980
You haven't seen it,

690
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,550
but it doesn't mean he won't.

691
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,620
The Stone Clan has seen frequent murder cases.

692
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,010
The Chief's mysterious death is fishy.

693
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,370
Before we find out the truth,

694
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,100
I won't let anyone do anything to Cang Shan.

695
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,120
Master Fan, you are obviously biased.

696
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,380
So what if I am?

697
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,500
At least my bias is aboveboard.

698
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:54,730
Unlike you,

699
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,340
who have done plenty of selfish things

700
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,740
yet still faking

701
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,070
peace and love on the surface.

702
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,080
What do you mean, Master Fan?

703
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,610
You know

704
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,370
exactly what I mean.

705
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,980
I must

706
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,830
bring Cang Shan back.

707
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,909
You can try to stop me

708
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,989
if you want.

709
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,300
How arrogant!

710
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,020
You...

711
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,110
Father.

are you going to mess around just for an outsider?

718
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,410
You killed that young man,

719
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,030
and now you're even trying to suppress his soul!

720
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,820

is a great and righteous hero.

I don't deserve to be your father, huh?

739
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,470

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,010
♫On the vast sea, you and I♫

755
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,240
He has locked himself in his room for quite a while.

756
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,230
I'm worried that if this continues,

757
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,410
he'll get stuck in overthinking

758
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,290
and hurt himself.

759
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,410
Mr. Cang Sr. has been missing for days, and he suddenly showed up last night.

760
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,400
It was already suspicious.

761
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,040
What's even weirder is that

762
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,080
there's no way he couldn't recognize Cang Shan.

763
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,970
So why would he attack Cang Shan?

764
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,060
This is definitely not as simple as it seems.

765
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,920
It was too chaotic

766
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,300
to check it out just now.

767
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,030
I plan to go to the stone house

768
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,380
to check Mr. Cang Sr.'s body.

769
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,060
Let's go together.

770
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,710
Didn't you promise me

771
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,300
you would let him go

772
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,050
if I did what you said?

773
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,690
Why did you kill him?

774
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,530
Why?

775
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,550
You were going to tell Bai Shuo the truth yesterday,

776
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,370
weren't you?

777
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,100
One

778
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,920
must pay for betrayal.

779
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,320
But I didn't say it.

780
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,370
Yet you went back on our deal.

781
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,230
Then let me fulfill my promise now

782
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,500
and send you to reunite with your husband.

783
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,860
Your bones and veins are complete.

784
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,810
Apart from the wounds on his body,

785
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,840
there seem to be no other fatal injuries.

786
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,370
But when he got injured last night,

787
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,750
he could still fight off Cang Shan and escape.

788
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,350
Why did he suddenly die?

789
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,840
What is this?

790
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,630
There's something inside.

791
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,380
Guess it was this evil insect

792
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,690
that controlled Mr. Cang Sr.'s mind

793
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,240
and got him killed without him even realizing it.

794
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,800
Controlled his mind?

795
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,000
This sounds like...

796
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,450
The Cold Spring Palace's trick.

797
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,220
Mr. Cang Sr. was the Chief of the Stone Clan

798
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,830
with quite superior spiritual power among the demons.

799
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,460
Yet this evil insect could actually control his mind.

800
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,290
I'm curious

801
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,480
how this evil insect was raised.

802
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,490
Do you know how these evil insects

803
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,690
control humans?

804
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,580
There are many kinds of poisonous insects in the world.

805
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,420
I've never seen this sort of evil insect before.

806
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,670
But since it's a poisonous insect,

807
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,070
there must be another one paired with it.

808
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,240
With the parent insect, the mastermind can just

809
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,260
control countless sub insects at the same time.

810
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,500
If we find the parent insect and destroy it,

811
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,560
will that disable all the sub insects?

812
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,550
That makes sense.

813
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,080
But the mastermind

814
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,780
won't hand over the parent insect so easily.

815
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,020
Besides, the parent insect has absorbed all the poisonous energy.

816
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,870
It can't be busted so easily.

817
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,810
Our collection of the Contemplation in the Stone Clan is really risky this time.

818
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,540
As I said before,

819
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,350
so long as I'm here...

820
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,090
Who said only you can protect me?

821
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,740
I can protect you as well.

822
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,920
Cang Shan's still locking himself in his room.

823
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,130
He might need you,

824
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,490
his master,

825
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,230
to help him work through the trauma caused by his father's death.

826
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,210
Besides Cang Shan,

827
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:03,700
there's another person

828
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,840
who should spill the secrets

829
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,190
hidden by the Stone Clan all these years.

830
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,920
You mean

831
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,880
Mrs. Cang?

832
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,600
Exactly.

833
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,020
The mastermind controlled Mr. Cang Sr. with evil insects.

834
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,170
Who's there?

835
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,040
He lured us to the forbidden area of the Stone Clan first,

836
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,590
deliberately letting Cang Shan hurt his father.

837
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,280
Then Cang Shan was framed for killing his father.

838
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,600
Every step was carefully orchestrated.

839
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,560
There's no way the Stone Clan doesn't have enemies.

840
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,380
I even think

841
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,640
the murderer's been targeting Cang Shan.

842
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,250
We're totally on the same page.

843
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,920
So we must

844
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,140
get to know the past grudges

845
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,290
of the Stone Clan before the next accident.

846
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,870
You lock yourself in the room

847
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,190
without sleeping, resting, drinking, or eating.

848
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,920
Your mother will be worried.

849
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,160
"You don't deserve to be my father."

850
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,930
This is the last thing I said to him.

851
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:07,270
He asked me to get out of the Stone Clan and never come back.

852
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,780
I've really been away for so many years

853
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,120
without coming back even once.

854
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,480
I thought I would never forgive him

855
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,600
for the rest of my life.

856
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,410
But when he died in front of me,

857
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,950
I realized that I didn't want to lose him at all.

858
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,220
I know you feel so guilty and down,

859
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,520
blaming yourself for not returning to the Stone Clan earlier,

860
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,220
not recognizing your father,

861
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,970
and striking that blow.

862
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,230
But I want to tell you that, Cang Shan,

863
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,730
it's not your fault.

864
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,630
Before your father attacked you,

865
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,020
an evil insect already controlled his mind.

866
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,820
He already couldn't recognize you.

867
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,580
Bai Shuo and I

868
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,270
found an evil insect

869
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,010
in your father's body.

870
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,900
It was the insect that controlled him.

871
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,940
And your father didn't die from a stab wound.

872
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,660
He was killed by the evil insect that devoured his demonic essence.

873
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:07,730
Master,

874
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,920
who on earth murdered

875
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,340
my father and my clansmen?

876
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:12,090
Just because we don't know who did that,

877
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,720
you must pull yourself together, and let's find out the truth

878
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,610
to let the dead rest in peace.

879
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,850
But that can't bring them back to life.

880
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,520
I understand.

881
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,340
With the family gone,

882
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,450
all that's left is regret.

883
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,060
Even the strongest Eternals and demons in the world will have their regrets.

884
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,680
Regret is just a part of life.

885
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,740
Since it's inevitable,

886
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:35,850
we can't let us get stuck in it.

887
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:37,990
We should learn to move on.

888
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,740
Let's try together.

889
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,800
Ms. Bai, where are you going

890
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,710
in such a hurry?

891
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,980
I need to talk to Mrs. Cang.

892
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:51,890
Mrs. Cang?

893
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,910
I think she went to the back mountain to pick vegetables.

894
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:56,050
I saw her walking out with a basket.

895
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,350
Mr. Cang Sr. just died,

896
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,410
yet Mrs. Cang's already doing chores

897
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,840
like nothing happened?

898
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,950
I know

899
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,170
I'm an outsider.

900
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,470
There were multiple murders within the Stone Clan

901
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,400
while I showed up at this time.

902
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,720
It's reasonable for you to suspect me more or less.

903
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:23,430
Ms. Bai,

904
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:24,830
I can take my leave now.

905
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,400
May fate bring Yue and me

906
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,360
back together again in the future.

907
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,520
The world is big.

908
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,230
I believe there will be a place for me to settle.

909
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:34,790
Please tell Yue about this.

910
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,110
I won't say goodbye to him face-to-face.

911
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,370
You and Fan Yue just reunited in your real identities.

912
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,430
Do you really want to leave?

913
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,000
Do you want me to stop you?

914
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,150
Or do you want Fan Yue to blame me for not keeping you?

915
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,440
Ms. Bai, you got me wrong.

916
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:52,500
I'm just afraid

917
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,370
I can't bear to bid farewell to Yue.

918
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,960
And I'm also worried

919
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,260
I might delay your investigation.

920
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,780
Watch out!

921
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,650
Qi Feng? Qi Feng!
