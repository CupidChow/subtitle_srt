May I be like the stars

00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,280
What are you doing?

20
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,590
You have the antidote.

21
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,940
Why didn't you save us?

22
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,770
Why?

23
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,079
Step back!

[Bai Residence]

26
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,910
Master,

27
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:39,770
Cold Spring Palace has spread the news

28
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,170
that the Governor's Mansion has the antidote.

29
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,150
All the uninfected people in the city are besieging the Governor's Mansion.

30
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,240
Bai Shuo was sent out of the city by her father.

31
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,590
Bai Xun doesn't know that Bai Shuo is afflicted with Nether Poison.

32
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,450
Without Ghost Grass to suppress it,

33
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,710
won't she go mad?

34
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,220
Uncle Wang,

35
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,710
stop! Send me back!

36
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,330
I said stop!

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,240
Stop the carriage!

38
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,650
Lady Shuo!

39
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,410
Lady Shuo!

40
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,150
You can't go!

41
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,370
You can't go back!

42
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,280
I know my father well.

43
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,000
If I leave,

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,950
he will die.

45
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,600
-Let go!
-Lady Shuo!

46
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,260
The governor's order was a military command.

47
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,390
No matter what happens,

48
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,390
I must take you away.

49
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,690
Military orders must be obeyed.

50
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,670
I must take you away!

51
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,310
Okay.

52
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,390
Okay.

53
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,420
I'll go get the horse.

54
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,790
Sorry.

55
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,250
With this horse,

56
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,920
you won't be able to reach Ning'an City before it's destroyed.

57
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,040
Fan Yue?

58
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,780
She didn't go mad?

59
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,060
It seems the Nether Poison doesn't work on her.

60
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,480
Is it because the Desireless Stone is in her body?

61
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
If you want to return to Ning'an City,

62
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,550
I'll take you back.

63
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,270
You three,

64
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,460
quickly go and restrain the people who have gone mad in the city.

65
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,310
Yes.

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,190
let her go!

69
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,750
Are they the Eternals you've been wanting to become?

70
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,400
The Lanling Eternals?

71
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,660
So this is Bai Shuo?

72
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,300
Yes.

73
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,880
Leave now.

74
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,340
Fan Yue,

75
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,230
there has long been an agreement between the Eternal and Demon Races

76
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,690
to not harm the Human Race.

77
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,310
Yet you not only stole the Desireless Stone,

78
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,860
but also caused chaos among the Human Race.

79
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,210
So what?

80
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,310
Jin Yao,

81
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,020
the Desireless Stone and Bai Shuo are both mine.

82
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,830
If you don't want your Lanling Sect

83
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,270
to be wiped out in Ning'an today,

84
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,630

85
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,340

The city is full of demons.

88
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,000
They all want to take the Desireless Stone.

89
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,270
It's too dangerous for you to stay here.

90
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,120
With Master and Uncle Master here,

91
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,150
they will surely keep Uncle Bai safe.

92
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,320
Come back to Lanling Sect with me.

93
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,230

as you expected,

Bai Shuo was brought back by Fan Yue.

106
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,110
The Five Eternals of Lanling have also arrived

107
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,550
and are currently fighting with Fan Yue.

108
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,710
Although the Five Eternals of Lanling can't kill Fan Yue,

109
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,210
they can at least hold him off.

110
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,050
See?

111
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,560
Remember,

112
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,140
the Nether Poison is just the prelude

113
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,100
to the chaos in Ning'an City.

114
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,800
Go.

and indifferent to the people in the city!

What kind of governor are you?

166
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,030
You're even worse than a beast!

167
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,440
You don't deserve to be the governor!

168
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,240
You're useless!

169
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,670
Give us the antidote!

170
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,870
Are you even human?

171
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,360
You find it unbelievable, right?

172
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
From respect to hatred,

173
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,100
it only took one day.

174
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,510
How could you not care about us?

175
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,680
Now that things have come to this,

176
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,410
how about we make it even more exciting?

177
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,150

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,910

Let's run!

The outside is full of madmen!

186
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,040
Only the Governor's Mansion is safe!

187
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,830
Where else can we escape to?

188
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,250
Bai Xun is highly skilled in martial arts.

189
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,590
While he hasn't completely lost control,

190
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,570
let's kill him now!

191
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,170
Otherwise, when he completely loses his sanity,

192
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,960
-we'll be the ones who die!
-Kill him!

193
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,530
They are the people Bai Xun wants to protect—

194
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,760
ungrateful,

195
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,150
murderous.

196
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,450
Even I, a demon, can't compare to them.

197
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,520
Bai Shuo,

198
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,840
why don't you stop being a human

199
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,340
and join our Demon Race?

200
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,960
The Desireless Stone is inside you.

201
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,580
If you work for the Grand Master,

202
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,630
he

203
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,090
will surely be pleased.

204
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,360
Shut up!

205
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,110
Detoxify my father!

206
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,420
As you know,

207
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,760
there's no cure for this poison.

208
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,930
It's either death or madness.

209
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,710
Today,

210
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,410
someone has to die.

211
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,110
Kill him!

212
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,530
Kill him!

213
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,270
Die!

214
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,510
Kill him!

215
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,610
Stop!

216
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,420
Stop beating him!

217
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,720
Beat him!

218
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,760
Beat him!

219
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,840
Father, wake up!

220
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,880
Beat him!

221
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,720
Beat him!

222
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,080
What are you doing?

223
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,120
Governor!

224
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,000
Stop it!

225
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,260
Father!

226
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,150
No!

227
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,650
Don't bite my father!

228
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,720
Father, wake up! Father!

229
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,960
Let go of my father!

230
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
Let go of my father!

231
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,050
Don't bite my father!

232
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,590
Let go of my father!

233
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,140
Let go of my father!

234
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,020
Go.

235
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,570
Go!

236
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,450
Father, wake up! Father!

237
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,750
Father!

238
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,550
Governor!

239
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,400
I'll kill you!

240
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,680
I swear I'll kill you!

241
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,900
I'm incompetent!

242
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,260
I can't save you.

243
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,390
This maniac condition...

244
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,690
really has no cure!

245
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,280
Bai Yu!

246
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,970
Hurry!

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,600
Take the people out of Ning'an City!

248
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,670
Hurry!

249
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,720
Father!

250
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,320
I don't know...

251
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,290
why Ning'an is suffering this calamity,

252
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,210
but I know...

253
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,560
♫Across thousands of miles♫

254
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,630
that there are gods in this world!

255
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,560
Gods!

256
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,320
I, Bai Xun,

257
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,250
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

258
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,510
am willing to offer my life

259
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,290
to seek your mercy!

260
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:04,020
♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

261
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,290
Please descend upon Ning'an

262
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,550
and save

263
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,960
the people of Ning'an!

264
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,180
♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

265
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,270
I am willing

266
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,130
to exchange my life

267
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,750
for the peace...

268
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,030
Governor! Governor!

269
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,330
No!

270
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Governor!

271
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,600
Of a city!

272
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,510
Father!

273
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,030
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

274
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,840
Governor!

275
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,330
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

276
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,180
♫My love brought tears♫

277
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,150
♫Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completeness♫

278
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,400
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

279
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,030
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

280
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,860
♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

281

♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

282
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,150
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

283
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,050
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

284
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,430
♫The daylight burns through, and the stars shine bright♫

285
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,320
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

286
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,430
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

287
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,710
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

288
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,500
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

Don't sleep.

♫Light my heart's lamp, cast away attachments, and ask the world♫

294
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,480
You can't sleep!

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,610
I don't allow you to die!

296
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,670
Didn't you say you would wait with me

297
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:29,460
♫On the vast sea, you and I♫

298
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,080
for Xi to come back?

299

Xi hasn't come back yet.

300
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,150
You can't die!

301
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,240
It's all your fault!

302
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,270
It's because of you!

303
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,210
I'll kill you!

00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,900
I can save you.

306
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,540
I'll find someone to save you.

307
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,630
Hang in there.

308
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,510
I will find someone to save you.

309
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,010
[Bai Residence]

310
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,800

One of the Five Contemplations

327

was awakened?

328
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,520
It's golden.

329
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,990
Kindness?

330
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,580
The first Contemplation is not killing,

331
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,870
but kindness!

332
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,570
Bai Shuo.

333
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:35,650
Bai Shuo.

334
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,960
Let's go.

335
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,450
Did you see that?

336
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,920
Are they immortals?

337
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,100
My baby is cured!

338
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,830
My baby is cured!

339
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,480
Sect Leader.

340
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,400
He's really cured!

341
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,370
They are really immortals!

342
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,040
They are really immortals!

343
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,140
-Are you okay? Let me see.
-I'm fine.

344
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,220
Great!

345
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,190
Great!

346
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,680
We're fine now.

347
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,560
I didn't expect to see you again.

348
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,420
Thank you, immortals! Thank you, immortals!

349
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,050
Thank you, immortals! Thank you, immortals!

350
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,310
Put her down!

351
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,000
The Human Race has suffered heavy losses.

352
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,940
How about we call a truce between the Eternals and demons today?

353
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,760
Bai Xun just died.

354
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,200
Aren't you going to let them

355
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,440
say their final goodbyes?

356
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,880
The Lanling Sect always stands by its word.

357
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
Are you afraid

358
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,310
that we'll take her in front of you?

359
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,400
Master,

360
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,350
don't believe him.

361
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,300
You're injured.

362
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,090
We should take Bai Shuo back to the Polar Realm as soon as possible.

363
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,740
The road ahead is not yours to take.

364
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,070
Sir?

365
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,160
Is this the Lunar Hidden Sea?

366
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,110
Yes.

367
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,240
And no.

368
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,490
This is your sea of consciousness.

369
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,550
What you see

370
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,930
is just my consciousness.

371
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,580
Bai Shuo,

372
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,700
your father's death

373
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,330
caused you great pain.

374
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,240
Sir,

375
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,020
I'm begging you, please save my father.

376
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,130
You saved me ten years ago,

377
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,200
which was already a great kindness.

378
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,730
I know I have no right to ask for more,

379
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,190
but my father loved the city and protected the people

380
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,650
with loyalty throughout his life.

381
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,790
Until the moment of his death,

382
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,540
he never gave up on being kind.

383
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,980
He is the one who truly deserves to live.

384
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,280
Please, I beg you to save him.

385
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,000
Or...

386
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,510
or give my life to him

387
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,440
and let him live.

388
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,200
You want to die?

389
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,200
I don't want to die.

390
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,670
But I have no other choices now.

391
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,940
Only gods can bring someone

392
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,590
back to life.

393
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,960
No.

394
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,680
You're wrong.

395
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,450
The one who can interfere with life and death isn't me—

396
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,940
it's you.

397
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,400
Me?

398
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,700
Eternals can't save him,

399
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,910
and demons can't save him.

400
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,960
I'm just a mortal.

401
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,160
How can I save him?

402
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,880
As long as you have enough power,

403
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,520
you can.

404
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,720
Enough power?

405
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,900
How can I have enough power?

406
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,770
Gather the contemplations

407
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,410
and reignite the Desireless Stone.

408
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,590
Reignite the Desireless Stone?

409
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,530
Bai Shuo,

410
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,580
remember,

411
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,200
the meaning of your existence

412
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,210
isn't to repay someone's kindness,

413
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,360
nor to live for anyone else.

414
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,650
The Desireless Stone entering your body

415
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,930
is both a serendipity

416
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,200
and a part of the cycle of cause and effect.

417
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,050
When the heavens bestow great responsibilities,

418
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,290
they come with trials.

419
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,110
There's no way ahead.

420
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,830
No destruction, no construction.

421
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,230
You

422
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,200
must carve your own path.

423
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,280
What is my own path?

424
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,700
Sir,

425
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,250
who are you?

426
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,530
One day,

427
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,980
you will know.

428
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,960
Father.

429
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,190
Where is my father?

430
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,480
Where is my father?

431
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,630
[Noble Virtue]

432
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:17,710
[Memorial Tablet of My Late Father, Bai Xun]

433
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,640
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

434
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,020
♫The flowers that bloomed once in a lifetime♫

435
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,600
♫I remember that word of concern♫

436

♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

437
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,620

00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,930
♫It dried in the wind♫

439
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,260
♫The one in the autumn wind♫

440
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:07,400
♫How many times have I seen you in my dreams?♫

441
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,640
♫That year, that year♫

442
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,430
♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

443

♫Another year passed♫

459
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,960
Mom.

460
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,920
Ning'an City is in this state

461
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,170
because of the Eternal Race's negligence.

462
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,760
But isn't the Bright Moon Palace also responsible for this?

463
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,490
You're injured now.

464
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,650
And we're not afraid of war.

465
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,050
If the 72 sects of the Eternals unite,

466
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,420
the Bright Moon Palace would have no chance to win.

467
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,950
Do you think

468
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,290
you can use this threat on me?

469
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,140
It's not a threat.

470
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,500
If it really comes to a war,

471
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,760
it's still the common people who will suffer.

472
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,080
This is not what we want.

473
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,960
You must have taken Bai Shuo in

474
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,590
out of compassion, right?

475
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,570
Compassion?

476
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,340
Ridiculous.

477
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,440
Whether it's out of compassion or not,

478
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,080
only you know.

479
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,390
Whether she joins the Eternals

480
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,680
or the demons,

481
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,120
let Bai Shuo decide for herself.

482
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,630
Does it hurt?

483
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,050
Wipe it off.

484
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,270
Thank you, Grand Master.

485
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,290
Do you know

486
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,480
why I punished you?

487
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,330
Because I saved Chong Zhao,

488
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,040
which led to the failure of framing the blame.

489
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,440
Lanling Sect is now targeting

490
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,640
the Cold Spring Palace.

491
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,180
Wrong.

492
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,050
When you first intervened to save him,

493
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,420
I told you

494
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,410
I wouldn't punish you, so I didn't.

495
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,570
What angered me is that

496
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,600
you made the same mistake for the second time.

497
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,580
Do you think I couldn't see through it?

498
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,570
In front of

499
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,870
the Governor's Mansion,

500
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,290
you took the initiative to step in

501
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,710
and lend a hand,

502
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,890
and it was still to save Chong Zhao.

503
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,390
It seems our Lady Fu Ling

504
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,140
has someone special on her mind now.

505
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,230
Unfortunately,

506
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,680
he is an Eternal.

507
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,950
I can accept any punishment

508
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,250
from Grand Master.

509
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,040
But it's not your place to sow discord between us.

510
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,920
That's right.

511
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,360
But I'm also curious,

512
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,410
what exactly

513
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,760
are your feelings

514
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,980
for that Chong Zhao now?

515
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,110
I have no particular feelings for him.

516
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,090
As I said before,

517
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,680
besides repaying his kindness,

518
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,460
I also want him to join our Cold Spring Palace

519
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,820
and work for you.

520
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,880
Great.

521
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,590
Well then,

522
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,820
let's do as you said

523
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,090
and turn him into a demon.

524
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,870
How about this?

525
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,280
I...

526
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,170
will give you some more time.

527
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
One month.

528
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,350
How about one month?

529
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,870
Within one month,

530
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,750
make him work for our Cold Spring Palace.

531
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,760
If you fail,

532
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,350
then

533
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,930
I'll have to step in

534
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,810
and end him.

535
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,520
Understood?

536
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,070
Yes.

537
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,970
Go.

538
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,160
I allowed you to kowtow to him

539
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,300
because he deserved it.

540
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,270
But Chong Zhao,

541
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,380
from now on,

542
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,420
you're no longer a member of the Bai family.

543
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,410
Ever since my father was chosen as the governor,

544
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,310
he prepared this coffin.

545
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,400
I know he was not afraid of death,

546
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,640
but I never imagined

547
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,700
he would leave me like this.

548
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,830
The one who always wants to cultivate immortality is me.

549
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,240
The one who was self-righteous

550
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,960
and brought the Eternals and demons upon us was me.

551
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,280
The one who should have borne the consequences was supposed to be me,

552
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,960
but why was it my father?

553
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,440
What did my father do wrong?

554
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,480
Why was he the one who died in the end?

555
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,790
Why was he the only one who died?

556
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,400
It was all my fault.

557
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,160
I failed to protect Uncle Bai.

558
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,240
Shuo,

559
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,880
go back to the Eternals with me.

560
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,010
Now that the Demon Race is eyeing the Desireless Stone,

561
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,150
only the Eternals can protect you.

562
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,930
That day, in the ruined house outside the city,

563
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,630
you said you'd protect my father.

00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,060
drawing your sword would only be self-humiliation.

745
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,260
Fan Yue,

746
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,840
if you forcefully take her away,

747
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,630
you'll be the enemy of the entire Lanling Sect.

748
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,360
Fine by me.

749
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:48,200
♫A lifetime of guarding everything with you♫

750
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,790
Go back and tell Jin Yao

751
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,120
I've taken her away.

752
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,070
If he wants to start a war,

753
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,420
♫Crossing the abyss to fulfill our vow♫

754
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,410
I'll be waiting in the Polar Realm.

755
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,410
♫I'll leap without a thought for tomorrow♫

756
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,080
♫This moment feels like forever♫

757
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,670
♫I've missed too much time in my life♫

758
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:05,410
♫I'll throw myself into this flame for you♫

759
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,830
♫Even if I'll perish♫

760
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,550
♫At least I can still kiss your face♫

761
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,670
Young Lord!

762
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,110
Young Lord!

763
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,030
How are you?

764
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,180
I won't die.

765
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,130
Master hasn't punished you so harshly in a long time.

766
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,910
Young Lord,

767
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,220
I don't understand.

768
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,370
That Chong Zhao only saved you once.

769
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,090
Why are you helping him so much?

770
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,280
Haven't you already

771
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,870
repaid his kindness?

772
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,840
That's not kindness.

773
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,820
Then what is it?

774
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,620
It's a feeling,

775
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,870
a feeling

776
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,830
that I can't even explain.

777
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,790
You don't need to worry about this.

778
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:12,000
Investigate something for me.

779
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,760
What is it?

780
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,610
Everything about Chong Zhao from his birth until now,

781
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,800
no matter how big or small.

782
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,250
Why do you want to investigate this?

783
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,410
I want him to come into my world,

784
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,040
the world of hell.

785
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,620
[Bright Moon Palace, Demon Race]

786
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:42,620
Where am I?

787
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:43,880
The Bright Moon Palace.

788
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:46,870
I didn't say I'd come here.

789
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,620
Don't you want revenge?

790
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,280
Do you really think Lanling Sect can help you?

791
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,970
That doesn't mean

792
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,330
I have to rely on you.

793
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,040
Even if I don't join the Eternals,

794
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,990
I will never submit to the Demon Race.

795
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:01,490
I'll choose

796
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:02,980
my path myself.

797
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,600
No one has the right to decide for me.

798
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,050
So, are you going back

799
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,290
to Ning'an City to step right into the trap,

800
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,450
or are you going to live a wandering, fugitive life?

801
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:13,480
It has nothing to do with you.

802
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,250
I don't want to get involved in your life or death.

803
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,080
In my eyes,

804
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:20,560
you're just a vessel for the Desireless Stone.

805
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,910
But the Wunian Stone is mine,

806
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,840
so you are mine too.
