00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580

As long as the world remains,

00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370

Eternals and demons walk different paths.

You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,980
[Episode 28]

19
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,550
Master?

20
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,720
What exactly happened at Cold Spring Palace?

21
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,290
Why did Fan Yue suddenly attack it?

22
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,410
I don't know, Master.

23
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,160
At the time, the situation was dire,

24
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,850
so I had no choice but to leave first.

25
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,550
Leaving was for the best.

26
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,820
Zhen Yu was defeated by Fan Yue

27
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,780
and fled with severe injuries.

28
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,840
This is already widely known.

29
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,030
After this battle,

30
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,870
Cold Spring Palace will surely remain in hiding for a while.

31
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,490
You've had a hard time these days.

32
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,090
Come back to Lanling with me.

33
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,680
Your uncles have been missing you.

34
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
What are you doing?

35
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,660
Master, please save Fu Ling.

36
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,210
Fu Ling?

37
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,820
Zhen Yu's disciple?

38
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,410
She's here now?

39
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,490
Yes.

40
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,890
You're out of your mind!

41
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,470
How could you involve yourself with a demon?

42
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,220
Fu Ling has saved me many times,

43
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,870
even at the risk of punishment from Zhen Yu.

44
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,430
Now, she has left Cold Spring

45
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,560
and has no further ties with Zhen Yu.

46
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,990
Please, Master, save her.

47
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,810
Even if she has left Cold Spring,

48
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,230
she is still a demon!

49
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,840
How can you forget all the wrongs she's done

50
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,670
just because you're feeling merciful now?

51
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,070
She's not a demon!

52
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,450
What are you saying?

53
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,960
She's Bai Xi,

54
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,290
Bai Xun's daughter,

55
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,019
and Shuo's older sister.

56
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,920
What's going on?

57
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,140
10 years ago,

58
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,900
Zhen Yu took Bai Xi from the Bai family,

59
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,820
erased her memories,

60
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,190
and infused her with demonic power,

61
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,700
turning her into a demon.

62
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,540
I've only recently found out that she's Bai Xi.

63
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,920
Why did Zhen Yu do this?

64
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,280
I don't know.

65
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,770
But Xi is innocent.

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,880
She was deceived by Zhen Yu,

67
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,530
which led her to commit many wrongdoings.

68
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,900
She suffers from guilt now.

69
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,080
Master,

70
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,600
Xi was originally human.

71
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,950
Please save her.

72
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,100
Chong Zhao,

73
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,200
Fu Ling has done too much evil.

74
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,220
Even if she was once a human,

75
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,090
after becoming a demon,

76
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,770
everything she has done is her own doing.

77
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,230
Moreover, she now carries demonic power.

78
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,450
She has already become a demon.

79
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,190
I cannot save her.

80
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,930
Master...

81
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,680
Because of her pitiful past,

82
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,070
I won't kill her.

83
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,210
But you can't

84
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,250
ask for more.

85
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,140
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

86
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,310
You and she are ultimately different.

87
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,960
Go back to Lanling with me.

88
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,780
I can't return to Lanling anymore.

89
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,830
Zhen Yu's demonic power

90
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,030
has merged with my body.

91
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,180
Master,

92
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,040
I can't go back.

93
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,040
Go back with me.

94
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,390
I'll find a way to remove the demonic power within you.

95
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,990
As you said,

96
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,570
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,480
Now, I'm neither an Eternal nor a demon.

98
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,960
Returning to Lanling will only bring it trouble.

99
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,190
Xi is all alone now.

100
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,740
I want to stay here

101
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,100
to be with her

102
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,710
and protect her.

103
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,810
Everything you've suffered

104
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,940
has been for Lanling.

105
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,740
In my heart,

106
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,270
you'll always be my good disciple

107
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,100
and a disciple of Lanling.

108
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,180
Since you don't want to return,

109
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,180
then stay here in Ning'an City.

110
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,190
This place is your home after all.

111
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,780
Go back

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,040
when you come around.

113
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,990
But...

114
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,370
Fu Ling is no longer the Bai Xi she once was.

115
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,750
Don't get too entangled with her.

116
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,659
Otherwise...

117
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,960
I've said all I need to say.

118
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,270
Take care of yourself.

119
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,500
My lord.

120
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
This time it was my carelessness

121
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:36,130
that caused the ancient mirror to shatter even further.

122
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,900
But rest assured.

123
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,040
I'll definitely capture Fan Yue

124
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:43,920
and Bai Shuo

125
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,990
at any cost

126
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,310
to bring you back.

127
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,170
As for Chong Zhao,

128
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,940
he thinks he can escape everything

129
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,490
with Fu Ling.

130
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,770
He's too naive.

131
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,160
He carries your hidden power.

132
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,390
No matter where he is,

133
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,850
I'll be able to find him.

[Unbridled Pavilion]

135
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,450
I want to go back to Ning'an City.

136
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,890
With the fall of Cold Spring Palace,

137
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,570
if Xi managed to escape,

138
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,400
she'd definitely return to Ning'an City.

139
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,840
Although I know the chances are slim,

140
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,110
I still want to go back and wait there.

141
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,130
What if she comes back?

142
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Tian Huo,

143
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,330
you stay and guard Bright Moon Palace.

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,720
we'll return to Unbridled Pavilion

191
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,370
and reopen it.

192
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,140
If only Xi could come back.

193
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,260
We can definitely find her.

194
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,450
Take a look.

195
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,360
Fresh and good.

196
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,280
Yeah, come on.

197
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,060
Not bad.

198
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,430
Take one.

199
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,840
You're awake.

200
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,930
I just made some steamed buns.

201
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,940
Try one.

202
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,950
As you said,

203
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,610
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

204
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,540
Now, I'm neither an Eternal nor a demon.

205
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,690
Returning to Lanling will only bring it trouble.

206
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,330
Xi is all alone now.

207
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,990
I want to stay here

208
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,760
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

209
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,320
to be with her

210
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,030
and protect her.

211
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,400
Since you don't want to return,

212
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,840
♫The flowers that bloomed once in a lifetime♫

213
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,660
then stay here in Ning'an City.

214
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,520
♫I remember that word of concern♫

215
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,630
This place is your home after all.

216
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,170
Go back

217
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,470
when you come around.

218
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,190
♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

219
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,070
But...

220
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,230
Fu Ling is no longer the Bai Xi she once was.

221
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,740
♫I remember that drop of tear♫

222
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,880
Don't get too entangled with her.

223
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,790
♫It dried in the wind♫

224
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,060
Otherwise...

225
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,140
♫The one in the autumn wind♫

226
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,910
I've said all I need to say.

227
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,030
♫How many times have I seen you in my dreams?♫

228
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,240
Take care of yourself.

229
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,410
♫That year, that year♫

230
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,250
♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

231
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,380
Is it good?

232
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,320
♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

233
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,140
It's okay.

234
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,610
Looks like I'm out of practice.

235
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,580
♫They unfold, one page after another♫

236
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,450
I'll get the timing right tomorrow.

237
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,900
♫That year, that year♫

238
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,480
I'm going out.

239
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,400
Where are you going?

240
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,400
♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

241
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,090
The poison in you hasn't been cured yet.

242
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,900
I'm going to get some medicine for you.

243
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,220
♫Falling to the mud, burying the memories♫

244
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,440
You stay at home.

245
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,620
♫Layer after layer♫

246
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,190

♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

249
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,370
Xixi,

250
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,420
if you were still alive,

251
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,100
you'd definitely enjoy life here too.

252
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,260
♫They unfold, one page after another♫

253
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,610
♫That year, that year♫

254
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,820
You always asked me

255
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
why I was so good to Chong Zhao.

256
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,330
♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

257
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,300
Now I finally understand.

♫Falling to the mud, burying the memories♫

259
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,660
It turns out I've fallen in love with him

260
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,620
a long time ago.

261
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,930
♫Layer after layer♫

262
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,770
Unfortunately, I'm dying.

♫Another year passed♫

264
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,950
I wish I had remembered him sooner.

265
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,650
Unbridled Pavilion is open.

266
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,780
Is Shuo back?

267
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,060
Greetings, Divine Lord.

268
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,600
After all the twists and turns,

269
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,100
we're back in Unbridled Pavilion.

270
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,950
I wonder what Fan Yue

271
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,060
is doing now.

272
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,120
Please.

273
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,510
Please save Xi.

274
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,270
If there truly are immortals in this world,

275
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,270
please, save Xi.

276
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,980
Souls destroyed.

277
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,120
Eternal damnation.

278
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,800
Those words

279
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,680
were actually uttered

280
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,800
by someone other than me.

281
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,970
She's already dead.

282
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,360
I never interfere with the life and death of any living being.

283
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,400
Saving you

284
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,960
was already an exception.

285
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,450
The next time I descend to the mortal world,

286
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,080
it may be thousands of years from now.

287
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,050
You, a mortal,

288
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,510
won't live beyond 100 years.

289
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,840
How could you possibly repay me?

290
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,610
Fan Yue.

291
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,690
Shuo.

292
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,450
I want you

293
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,340

294

Eternal damnation.

296
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,600
Shuo,

297
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,360
what's wrong with you?

298
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,630
Repeat after me.

a few memories of Jing Yuan flashed through my mind.

351
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,060

375
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,160
is you,

376
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,030
Fan Yue.

377
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,470
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

378
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,760
I'm just so happy.

379
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,420
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

380
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,630
So happy that I finally found him.

381
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,340
♫My love brought tears♫

382
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,380
♫Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completeness♫

383
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,990
Do you understand?

384
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,520
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

385
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,180
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

386
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,400
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

387
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,130
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

388
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,890
♫To protect the world for eternity♫
Please bless the world♫To protect the world for eternity♫

389
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,980
Fu Ling.

390
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,930
What's going on?

391
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,290
Didn't you take the medicine?

392
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,830
Why is your condition getting worse?

393
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,510
I'll get you another bowl of decoction.

394
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,770
No need.

395
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,690
I just need to tough it out.

396
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,720
Why has your condition worsened despite all the medicine you took?

397
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,330
The medicine you took couldn't cure the poison,

398
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,460
right?

399
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,420
What kind of poison is in you?

400
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,890
Stop asking.

401
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,650
What the poison is

402
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,730
is none of your concern.

403
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,790
Fine.

404
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,350
If you don't tell me,

405
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,470
I'll go ask Zhen Yu.

406
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,480
No!

407
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,200
He'll kill you.

408
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,100
Then tell me

409
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,350
what the poison is

410
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,480
and how we can cure it!

411
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,260
Heart Devouring Poison.

412
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,060
It was created by Zhen Yu.

413
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,330
Except him,

414
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,800
no one else can cure it.

415
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,790
Normal medicine is useless.

416
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,030
Shuo has already returned to Ning'an City.

417
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,390
She can make pills.

418
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,380
I'll take you to Unbridled Pavilion to find her.

419
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,140
Maybe she can save you.

420
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,880
No!

421
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,020
I don't want to see her!

422
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,300
Xi!

423
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,060
Xi.

424
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,150
It's okay. It's okay.

425
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,200
I can't...

426
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,920
I can't see Shuo.

427
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,630
I've sinned.

428
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,530
I can't see her.

429
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,480
I can't see Shuo.

430
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,270
I've sinned.

431
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,110
I can't see her.

432
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,760
I can't.

433
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,530
When we first found the Lunar Hidden Sea,

434
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,210
I saw a pendant on that person.

435
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,920
It was identical to the one the Demon Lord

436
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,960
was wearing when he saved me 10 years ago.

437
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,000
So I thought he was the one who saved me.

438
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,970
It turns out I was wrong all this time.

439
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,770
But when I went to the Lunar Hidden Sea for the second time,

440
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,630
why didn't he deny it?

441
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,150
By the way,

442
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,810
the pendant had a design

443
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,280
of the moon and fire.

444
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,320
In the memories you recalled,

445
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,780
did you ever see him?

446
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,640
No.

447
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,880
Do you think

448
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,920
he might be connected to the Demon Lord?

449
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,010
Who exactly is he?

450
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,680
Why was he by the Lunar Hidden Sea?

451
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,850
What did those words

452
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,530
he said to me mean?

453
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,690
There are still many things I don't understand.

454
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,230
Since he told you to activate the Contemplation Stone,

455
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,470
after we collect the Five Contemplations,

456
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,780
we may meet him again.

457
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,580
Everything will make sense then.

458
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,990
The tides of the Lunar Hidden Sea have ebbed and flowed for tens of thousands of years,

459
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,540
creating some crystals.

460
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,770
I found them interesting and collected them.

461
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,240
You don't like jewelry,

462
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,870
but this is made of stone.

463
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,710
Divine Lord, you won't refuse it, will you?

464
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,140
Who is she?

465
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,640
What is my relationship

466
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,420
with her?

467
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,020
Shuo.

468
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,400
Shuo!

469
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,290
Shuo!

470
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,430
Shuo.

471
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,420
She's been poisoned,

472
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
suffering unbearable pain every day.

473
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,790
Do you have any pills to ease her pain?

474
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,270
Fu Ling?

475
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,900
You can't kill her!

476
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,900
She's defected from Cold Spring Palace

477
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,380
and no longer serves Zhen Yu.

478
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,670
What does her defection have to do with me?

479
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,950
All I know is I must avenge my father

480
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,850
and the people of Ning'an City!

481
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,480
But she knows where Xi is.

482
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,490
Where is Bai Xi?

483
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,790
Put me down.

484
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,720
I told you I wouldn't come to Unbridled Pavilion.

485
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,510
I told you I wouldn't beg her.

486
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,250
Why did you still bring me here?

487
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,430
Make it clear.

488
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,150
Where is Bai Xi?

489
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,560
Since you know where Bai Xi is,

490
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,990
just tell her.

491
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,280
Yes,

492
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,880
I do know where Bai Xi is.

493
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,760
Bai Xi is already dead.

494
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,610
That weak, useless girl

495
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,530
didn't even have the courage to hold a knife.

496
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,890
She died the very first day

497
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,860
she came to Cold Spring Palace.

498
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,190
Impossible.

499
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,240
Xi was gentle,

500
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,880
but she was never weak.

501
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,100
She wouldn't have died just like that.

502
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,720
You're lying to me.

503
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,210
You're definitely lying to me!

504
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,050
Tell me where Xi is!

505
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,360
Fu Ling.

506
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,560
Fu Ling!

507
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,130
Shuo.

508
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,930
Save her.

509
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,520
Now that Zhen Yu has fled with injuries,

510
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,560
you don't have to stay in Cold Spring Palace anymore.

511
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,350
I don't know why

512
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,060
you're still entangled with Fu Ling,

513
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:31,960
nor do I care about

514
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,720
whatever ties you two have.

515
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,630
But giving her the pill is my biggest compromise.

516
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,420
Take her away.

517
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,290
Shuo.

518
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,900
Lately,

519
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,280
I often think about the days when we were little—

520
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,020
you, me,

521
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,050
and Xi.

522
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,870
I know Xi had been to Cold Spring Palace,

523
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,090
but Tian Huo went there to search

524
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,980
and didn't find her.

525
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,050
No one knows where she is.

526
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,530
She says Xi is dead,

527
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,770
but can I really believe her?

528
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,160
She's killed so many people

529
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,080
and done so many evil things.

530
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,790
-Actually, Fu Ling is...
-She even caused my father's death!

531
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,450
So, Chong Zhao, tell me.

532
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,020
She said Xi is dead.

533
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,580
Can I believe her?

534
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,810
Shuo.

535
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,620
I'm just like you.

536
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,000
I really want to find Xi too.

537
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,480
But there are many things

538
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,880
I can't give you answers for.

539
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,740
I've always felt that you're smarter than me,

540
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,490
that you see things more clearly.

541
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,240
Back then,

542
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,780
my parents and I came to Ning'an City and opened a steamed bun stall.

543
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,890
At first, I really didn't understand it.

544
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,520
We were Eternals

545
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,240
with the power to summon wind and rain,

546
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,430
change shapes, and move things at will.

547
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,140
Yet, we had to hide our identities,

548
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,430
suppress our power,

549
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,410
and spend every day just making and selling steamed buns.

550
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,680
Why couldn't we fight back when we were bullied

551
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,600
and mistreated?

552
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,320
Instead, we had to swallow our pride and endure.

553
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,000
During that time,

554
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,770
I argued with my parents every day.

555
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,630
And they scolded me every day.

556
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,610
At that time,

557
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,520
I wasn't happy.

558
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,740
If you're feeling really down,

559
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,200
why not have a good sleep

560
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,450
and dream a good dream?

561
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,520
When you wake up, it'll be a brand new day.

562
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,000
The sun is shining brightly today,

563
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,390
with a gentle, warm breeze.

564
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,310
When you're in a bad mood,

565
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,040
just soak up the sun.

566
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,870
The pear blossoms are in full bloom outside the city.

567
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,900
They're beautiful.

568
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,120
Take a trip when you have time.

569
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,840
It'll help you forget a lot of worries.

570
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,390
[In the early morning mist, the riverbank is shrouded in light rain, with willow trees looking like a painting.]

571
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,540
At that time,

572
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,130
I often delivered steamed buns to your house,

573
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,060
so I recognized

574
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,810
that the sachet belonged to you.

575
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,430
Here, Xi.

576
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,140
If it weren't for you,

577
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,840
I would've wallowed in it for a long time.

578
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,400
I'm really thankful

579
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,520
for the comfort you brought me back then.

580
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,640
Now, I want to

581
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,160
return this sachet to you.

582
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,690
I never wrote you any notes.

583
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,770
It wasn't me

584
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,160
who comforted you.

585
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,720
But this sachet...

586
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,110
It was indeed mine,

587
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,530
but not long after, I gave it to Xi.

588
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,410
Could the one who sent you notes to comfort you

589
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,730
have been Xi?

590
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,910
I remember there was a time

591
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,080
when she would sneak out by herself.

592
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,220
When I asked her where she was going,

593
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,770
she wouldn't tell me.

594
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,300
It seems she was going to find you.

595
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,550
But I recognize your handwriting.

596
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,390
Xi taught me how to write.

597
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,890
I learned to write by copying her characters.

598
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,180
Naturally, our handwritings look similar.

599
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,700
If you want to know what really happened back then,

600
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,350
you'll have to find Xi

601
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,500
and ask her.

602
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,620
I don't believe Xi could have died like that.

603
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,090
Even if Fu Ling refuses to tell me,

604
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,030
I'll find Xi my own way.

605
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,250
As for Fu Ling,

606
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,940
just because she has betrayed Cold Spring Palace

607
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,400
doesn't mean the evil she's done can be erased.

608
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,160
For your sake,

609
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,510
I'll show her mercy and won't kill her,

610
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,670
but I won't save her.

611
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,330
Take her away.

612
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,580
Shuo.

613
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,040
The Contemplation Stone lives up to its reputation as the divine object of Goddess Xing Yue.

614
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,210
Its power has wounded me so badly.

615
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,350
To repair the ancient mirror,

616
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,710
I need more power.

617
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,310
If back then,

618
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,400
that idiot turtle from Lanling hadn't deceived me,

619
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,910
I wouldn't have wasted so many years

620
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,400
and lost the opportunity.

621
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,810
Old Turtle,

622
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,620
you brought this upon yourself.

623
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,780
I will never let you off the hook.

624
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,220
Fan Yue.

625
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,290
What's wrong with you?

626
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,680
I'm fine.

627
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,730
You're lying.

628
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,110
You've been acting weird today,

629
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,730
like you're purposely avoiding me.

630
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,510
We're so close now.

631
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,540
You can tell me anything.

632
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,340
This is my master's turtle shell.

633
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,850
Master once said

634
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,190
he has many turtle shells,

635
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,750
but this one is always with him.

636
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,370
Now that he's sent it over,

637
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,530
something must have happened.

638
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,810
Old Turtle has always been in Lanling.

639
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,300
There have been no reports of an attack on Lanling.

640
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,400
The turtle shell is giving us a direction.

641
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,810
The east.

642
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:50,920
Shuo said those things

643
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,340
because she didn't know who you were.

644
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,890
She's been searching for you for many years.

645
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,600
Don't you want to be reunited with your sister?

646
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,460
The one she's been looking for

647
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,150
is her sister, Bai Xi.

648
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,120
But look at me now.

649
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,540
My hands are covered in blood,

650
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,720
and I've done too many bad things.

651
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,180
What right do I have to be Bai Xi again?

652
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,720
I'd rather she think

653
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,070
Bai Xi is dead.

654
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,030
But…

655
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,790
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

656
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,010
Then what about us?

657
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,770
The one who sent me notes back then was you,

658
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,050
right?

659
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,020
I don't want to talk about that either.

660
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,990
If you're feeling really down,

661
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,270
why not have a good sleep

662
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,790
and dream a good dream?

663
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,930
When you wake up, it'll be a brand new day.

664
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,340
The sun is shining brightly today,

665
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,920
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

666
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,740
with a gentle, warm breeze.

667
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,510
When you're in a bad mood,

668
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,300
♫The flowers that bloomed once in a lifetime♫

669
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,720
just soak up the sun.

670
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,900
The pear blossoms are in full bloom outside the city.

671
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,290
♫I remember that word of concern♫

672
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,560
They're beautiful.

673
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,780
Take a trip when you have time.

674
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,130
♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

675
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,420
It'll help you forget a lot of worries.

676
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,480
♫I remember that drop of tear♫

677
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,380
Enough! Stop reciting them.

678
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,340
They were just some casual things I wrote.

679
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,440
♫It dried in the wind♫

680
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,400
I've long forgotten them.

681
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,780
♫The one in the autumn wind♫

682
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,350
♫How many times have I seen you in my dreams?♫

683
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,429
♫That year, that year♫

684
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,020
Then, will these remind you?

685
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:16,260
I've kept every single one of those notes.

686
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,179
[The afterglow paints the rooftops and drifting smoke golden.]

687
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,179
[When you're bored, you can go to the riverbank to look at the sunset.]

688
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,219
♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

689
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,639
Over the years,

690
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,670
I've read them again and again.

691
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,239
♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

692
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:22,370
I always thought the person from back then was Shuo,

693
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,520
and I've kept her in my heart ever since,

694
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:25,570
♫They unfold, one page after another♫

695
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,560
treasuring and loving her.

696
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,670
♫That year, that year♫

697
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,010
But it turns out

698
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,820
I was wrong from the start.

699
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:33,429
♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

700
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,020
I liked Shuo

701
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,239
♫Falling to the mud, burying the memories♫

702
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,500
because I was touched by these notes,

703
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,719
[The afterglow paints the rooftops and drifting smoke golden.]

704
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,719
[When you're bored, you can go to the riverband to look at the sunset.]

705
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,860
these comforting words.

706
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,060
♫Layer after layer♫

707
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,690
But the encouragement and company back then

♫Another year passed♫

710
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,630
I've been such a fool.

711
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,840
For all these years,

712
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,030
I didn't even know I liked the wrong person.

713
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:56,699
I told you,

714
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,330
I've already forgotten.

715
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:01,020
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

716
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,800

♫The flowers that bloomed once in a lifetime♫

718
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,890
Zhen Yu erased all your memories.

720
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:08,270
♫I remember that word of concern♫

721
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,380
you still showed me mercy and protected me.

722
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,330
It was because your heart never changed.

723
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,030
♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

724
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,330

♫I remember that drop of tear♫

00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,210
There's no future between us.

741
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,050
♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

742
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,910
I also have demonic power now,

743
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,540
and my hands are stained

744
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,530
♫They unfold, one page after another♫

745
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,590
with the blood of Eternals too.

746
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,570
That was forced upon you!

747
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,590
♫That year, that year♫

748
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,850
Wasn't it the same for you?

749
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,000
You were a 12-year-old girl

750
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,400
♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

751
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,020
who was always gentle and kind

752
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,240
and wouldn't even hurt a fly.

753
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,230
♫Falling to the mud, burying the memories♫

754
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,740
But suddenly, your memories were erased,

755
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,770
and you were thrown into fights

756
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,020
in Cold Spring Palace.

♫Another year passed♫

760
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,880

761
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,220
Xi.

762
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,900
Can you let me

763
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,680
♫That year, that year♫

764
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,560

♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

Lady Xi,

782
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,100
there are hibiscus flowers in the city too.

783
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,100
Why did you come all the way out here so early

784
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,310
to pick them?

785
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,280
Shuo and Zhao

786
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,000
love the hibiscus cakes I make.

787
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,760
The flowers here are the most vibrant,

788
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,180
so naturally, I came here to pick them.

789
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:10,950
Lingdang.

790
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,350
Go gather some dew.

791
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,910
Making the cakes with the morning dew

792
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,160
makes them the sweetest.

793
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,390
Yes, Lady Xi.

794
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,200
Aunt Meng!

795
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,950
Let me help you up.

796
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:34,490
What happened to you?

797
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,810
Why are you bleeding so much?

798
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,920
Xi.

799
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,270
Hurry home.

800
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,000
Give this to Chong Zhao.

801
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,430
Tell him…

802
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,320
[Follow the way of heaven as the way. Practice kindness, caution, and harmony.]

803
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,380
Don't...

804
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,210
Don't ever return to Lanling.

805
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,180
Go now.

806
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,250
What's Lanling?

807
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
I don't understand.

808
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,090
Aunt Meng.

809
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,000
Let me help you back home. Let's go.

810
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,110
There's no time.

811
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,380
Go!

812
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,090
Father.

813
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,000
I'll go ask Father to save Aunt Meng.

814
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,350
Xi.

815
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,100
Xi, what's wrong?

816
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
Chong Zhao.

817
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,990
Your parents

818
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,620
weren't killed by a scorpion demon.

819
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,630
Before your mother died,

820
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,350
I met her.

821
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,230
What are you saying?

822
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,690
I couldn't see the person's face clearly,

823
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,240
but I vaguely saw that he severely injured your mother.

824
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,680
He also tried to kill me,

825
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,780
but I lost consciousness soon.

826
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,110
I don't know

827
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,340
what happened after that.

828
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,700
Don't return to Lanling?

829
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,520
Was she hunted down by someone from Lanling?

830
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,580
No.

831
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,040
I must go back to tell Master

832
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,340
and have him look into it.

833
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,450
No.

834
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,990
You can't trust anyone in Lanling.

835
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,270
Your master could also be the one who killed your mother.

836
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,250
Impossible.

837
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,020
My master and my parents had a deep bond.

838
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,000
If it were my master,

839
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,610
he wouldn't have raised me himself.

840
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,120
Anyone in this world might hurt me,

841
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,490
but my master would never.

842
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,440
Moreover,

843
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,270
my master has been protecting people his whole life.

844
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,090
He would never do such a thing.

845
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:37,420
[Bodhi Village]

846
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,690
The compass led us here.

847
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,950
Is my master

848
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,510
in this village?

849
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,380
Do you know this village?

850
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,290
I've never heard of such a place on the Eastern Continent.

851
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,200
But the compass is clearly pointing towards the village.

852
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,570
Why don't we go in and have a look?

853
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,230
A single village,

854
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,770
hidden in the mountains.

855
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,500
It's rather strange.

856
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,380
Stay close to me after going in.

857
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,290
Let's go.

858
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,510
Here, take it if you like.

859
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,600
-Old wine.
-Pumpkins.

860
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,720
Fresh pumpkins.

861
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,050
Take one with you.

862
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,950
-Take a look.
-Take one. Take one.

863
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,290
So fresh.

864
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,910
Thank you, sir.

865
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,150
It smells so good.

866
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,140
Why are there humans

867
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,480
on the land of the Eternals?

868
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,750
They all have mana.

869
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:28,970
They're not humans.

870
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,200
This village is not simple.

871
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,320
Be cautious.

872
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,110
Come look.

873
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,340
Miss, take a look.

874
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,110
Have a look. Fresh fruit.

875
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,820
Miss, come back again.

876
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:47,520
Thank you, madam.

877
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,060
Sir, the wontons are really good.

878
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,510
I'll pack some for you.

879
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,520
Take care.

880
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,790
Sir.

881
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,630
We were out for a walk

882
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,700
and stumbled upon this place.

883
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,110
May I ask where this is?

884
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,230
This is Bodhi Village.

885
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,650
You're here because you're meant to be.

886
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,020
Welcome.

887
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,990
Meant to be?

888
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:02,660
Yes.

889
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,440
This village is protected by the Divine Maiden.

890
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,510
Whether you're on the run,

891
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,550
homeless,

892
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,810
or seeking to avoid the mundane world,

893
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,760
if fate brings you here,

894
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,960
the Divine Maiden will take you in,

895
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:10,800
never asking about your past

896
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,640
and treating everyone equally.

897
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,500
The Divine Maiden?

898
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,850
That's right. This village

899
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,320
owes everything to the Divine Maiden.

900
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,020
[Food]

901
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,920
We were all saved by her.

902
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,710
Yes.

903
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,670
The Divine Maiden is not only powerful

904
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,510
but also very compassionate.

905
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,770
She's the kindest person

906
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,620
in the world.

907
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,010
If you meet her,

908
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,510
you'll definitely like her too.

909
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,280
Definitely, you'll like her.

910
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,840
Yes.

911
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,970
Yes, you will.

912
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,530
Let's go over there.

913
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Do you think the Divine Maiden

914
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,830
they spoke of is real?

915
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,040
Whether real or not,

916
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,980
someone who can hide so much spiritual energy

917
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,080
and keep it a secret

918
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,910
is definitely not an ordinary person.

919
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,410
Look.

920
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,400
The Divine Maiden is here!

921
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,980
I told you,

922
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,300
once you come to this village,

923
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,880
we're all family.

924
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,110
No need for formalities.

925
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,170
Just do your own thing.

926
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,460
Divine Maiden,

927
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:28,220
you...

928
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,590
I've finally found you.

929
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:47,850
What...

930
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,140
What's going on?

931
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,750
I don't know.

932
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:52,400
What's wrong with the Divine Maiden?

933
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,500
Is he the one

934
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,080
the Divine Maiden has been waiting for?

935
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,400
No way.

936
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,140
The Divine Maiden has been waiting for him all this time,

937
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,320
but now he has

938
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,170
another woman by his side.

939
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,840
The Divine Maiden must be heartbroken.

940
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,550
What does she mean?

941
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,080
Do you two know each other?

942
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,760
I've never met her.

943
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:21,920
You don't remember me?

944
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,530
Yeah, 60,000 years is so long

945
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:30,750
that

946
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,010
you've forgotten everything.

947
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,770
It's okay.

948
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,350
[Food]

949
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,640
If you've forgotten me,

950
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,090
we'll just get to know each other again.

951
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,390
In scattered flowers and flying petals,

952
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,250
my once youthful face has changed.

953
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,110
Now, I go by the name

954
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,330
[Luan Zhu, Divine Race]

955
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,140
Luan Zhu.

956
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,100
Ms. Luan Zhu,

957
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,760
why not let me get to know you as well?

958
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,440
You're a human?

959
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:00,690
Yes.

960
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,860
Bai Shuo, a human.

961
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,760
It's getting late.

962
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,370
I'll skip the pleasantries.

963
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,590
We came to this village

964
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,000
to look for someone.

965
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,520
Have there been any other visitors besides us

966
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,150
in the past several days?

967
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:14,500
Well...

968
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,870
Shuo!
