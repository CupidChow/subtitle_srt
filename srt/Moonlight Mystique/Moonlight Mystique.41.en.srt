I need to control it in this aspect.

00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,300
I'm looking forward to it.

and experienced a lot of love and hatred

14
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,600

[Full of faith]

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,200

Do it!

34
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,900

[Ao Ruipeng as Fan Yue & Jing Yuan]

36

both corners,

53
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,800

after years of practice.

99
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,350

in advance.

101
