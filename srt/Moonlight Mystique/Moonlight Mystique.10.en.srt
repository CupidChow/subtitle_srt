1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,000
[Episode 10]

19
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,560
Oh, right.

20
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,150
You're a Kunlun disciple.

21
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,660
Tell us.

22
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,690
What happened

23
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,960
1000 years ago?

24
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,020
A thousand years ago...

25
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,450
It was a tragedy.

26
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,530
Get to the point.

27
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,120
Back then,

28
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,980
Ling Long, the Saintess of the Fox Clan, entered Kunlun

29
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,950
and fell in love with Rong Xian, the Saint.

30
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,640
But their love was not accepted by either clan.

31
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,170
Eventually, they lived in seclusion, away from the world.

32
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,290
Yet, for some unknown reason,

33
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,160
one day,

34
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,070
Ling Long suddenly attacked Kunlun

35
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,530
and slaughtered the entire clan.

36
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,280
Mr. Rong Xian, upon hearing the news, rushed back.

37
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,870
Not only did he kill Ling Long,

38
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,980
but he also went on a killing spree in Jingyou Mountain

39
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,220
and avenged

40
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,090
Kunlun.

41
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,280
But Ling Long

42
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,560
doesn't seem to be such a cruel person.

43
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,240
Why did she slaughter Kunlun?

44
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:44,630
I don't know either.

45
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,680
But there's one thing I've heard about.

46
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,120
When Ling Long entered Kunlun back then,

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,100
she brought three people with her.

48
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
One was her younger sister,

49
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,079
and the other two were her attendants.

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,600
Isn't that us three?

51
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,160
Stop stating the obvious.

52
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,760
Since this place

53
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,210
is formed from Rong Xian's resentment,

54
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,970
if we kill him in this illusion,

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,370
will the resentment disappear?

56
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,390
No.

57
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,250
Kunlun Illusion is tied to the caster's life.

58
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,110
If you kill him,

59
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,700
you'll only kill the version of him in the illusion.

60
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,000
The illusion won't be destroyed,

61
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,430
and instead, we'll be trapped here forever.

62
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,019
There might be a way out.

63
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,530
If the illusion is formed from Rong Xian's resentment,

64
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,910
then if we can stop Ling Long from slaughtering Kunlun,

65
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,580
we might be able to quell his resentment

66
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,500
and break the illusion.

67
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,630
That makes sense.

68
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,620
So, what...

69
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,640
should we do now?

70
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,050
All we need to do is one thing:

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,110
stop Ling Long and Rong Xian from falling in love with each other.

72
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,610
Wu.

73
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,180
Why are you two acting so strange today?

74
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,770
Aren't you usually inseparable?

75
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,620
What happened?

76
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,800
Have you two suddenly become distant?

77
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,970
How is that possible?

78
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,380
They are very close.

79
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,530
-Right?
-Yes.

80
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,650
You three

81
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,210
must protect each other

82
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,240
and prioritize the overall picture.

83
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,570
Now Rong Xian wants to see us.

84
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,360
Remember,

85
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,960
he is the guardian of the Snow Lotus.

86
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,830
We must follow the plan and gain his trust.

87
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,920
What exactly is the Fox Clan's plan?

88
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,910
The beauty trap.

89
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,180
Who will be the beauty?

90
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,160
You?

91
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,800
Me?

92
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,060
Saintess,

93
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,850
please.

94
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,250
Please.

95
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
This young lady

96
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,990
is quite different.

97
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,970
Saint, please excuse us.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,360
This is my younger sister, Wu.

99
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,140
It's our fault for spoiling her so much

100
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,680
that she lacks proper manners.

101
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,850
Let me toast to you on her behalf.

102
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,080
Saintess, you are unconventional and poised.

103
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,360
You're quite different from what I imagined

104
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,450
a Fox Clan girl to be like.

105
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,720
How?

106
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,940
The world believes the Fox Clan to be petty,

107
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,110
always haggling over every penny.

108
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,310
But seeing you today,

109
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,970
I feel the world has misunderstood the Fox Clan.

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,750
Both of you

111
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,930
are truly generous people.

112
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,800
Kunlun is a righteous sect,

113
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,050
open-minded and inclusive.

114
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,910
You have a sharp eye,

115
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,660
unlike those shallow and ignorant people.

116
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
I toast to you

117
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,590
in admiration of your noble character

118
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,960
and trust in my clan.

119
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,780
Oh no.

120
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,570
As the toasts keep coming,

121
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,240
it feels like they really hit it off.

122
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,740
Saint!

123
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,180
Saint,

124
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,320
my apologies for earlier.

125
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,070
I like divination.

126
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,110
How about I offer you a reading

127
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,500
as a greeting today?

128
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,370
That sounds wonderful.

129
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,280
Please, Miss Wu.

130
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,770
This divination technique is quite accurate.

131
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,910
It's called Grain Divination.

132
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,620
If there's anything you want to know,

133
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,520
feel free to ask.

134
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,630
I'll make sure to give you a clear

135
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,390
and correct answer.

136
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,170
Really?

137
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,090
Of course.

138
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,930
In that case,

139
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,070
I'd like to ask you to see

140
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,520
if we are destined to be together.

141
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,150
What?

142
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,270
Are you saying we're in that Rong Xian's

143
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,270
resentment illusion?

144
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,680
Keep your voice down.

145
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,490
Let go of me!

146
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,680
I didn't expect you to be sucked into this realm of resentment too.

147
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,470
Why did you, the Young Master of the Fox Clan,

148
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,710
act so sneaky in participating in the Wutong Martial Arts Contest?

149
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,950
I didn't!

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,140
If it weren't for my aunt forbidding me from coming to Outlanders' City,

151
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,850
I wouldn't have had to be so sneaky.

152
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,110
Look what happened now.

153
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,460
I ended up in this stupid illusion

154
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,550
and became a stupid Eternal.

155
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,500
What did you say?

156
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,120
Our Kunlun Sect

157
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,040
is the leader of the...

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,390
sword sects,

159
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,300
shining in glory. We're not some stupid Eternals.

160
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,650
Shut up.

161
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,110
Aren't they...

162
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,250
hosting the foxes?

163
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,050
Why didn't you go in?

164
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,900
Master and I are just attendants right now.

165
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,400
We can't sit at the same table as the Saint.

166
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,110
I didn't expect

167
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,700
Master of Bright Moon

168
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,610
to ever be in a position where he couldn't sit at the table.

169
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,670
My aunt is Chang Mei, the Master of Jingyou.

170
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,000
She is one of the three kings.

171
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,659
You can't hit me.

172
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,890
You think

173
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,320
I'm afraid of her?

174
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,030
It's the realm of resentment.

175
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,850
You...

176
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,750
You are Saintess Ling Long?

177
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,650
I've heard a lot about you.

178
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,580
You really are

179
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,960
gorgeous in person.

180
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,530
You are quite interesting.

181
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,290
The Divinity of Kunlun

182
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,090
has heard a lot about the Fox Clan Saintess?

183
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,250
Aren't you afraid of being punished by your sect?

184
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,210
Anyway, I've heard a lot about you.

185
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,630
Where is she?

186
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,130
How are you speaking to the Saintess?

187
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,250
Watch your attitude.

188
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,280
Don't disturb them.

189
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,940
The atmosphere inside is quite harmonious.

190
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,220
It seems Rong Xian has fallen for Wu at first sight.

191
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:32,900
How about this?

192
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,960
Tonight, let Wu hold off Rong Xian,

193
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,730
and I'll steal the Snow Lotus.

194
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,750
What are you doing?

195
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,440
According to your divination,

196
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,640
I find that we share similar interests.

197
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,810
It's fate.

198
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,480
I'd like

199
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,130
to ask you to read my fortune again.

200
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,980
Would you

201
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,890
like it?

202
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,270
What else do you want to know?

203
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,510
My fate with a girl.

204
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,490
A girl?

205
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,980
Who is it?

206
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,250
Someone...

207
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,240
Someone I've known for a long time.

208
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,820
Known for a long time?

209
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,210
Then it shouldn't be Ling Long.

210
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,210
This Rong Xian.

211
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,880
First, he wanted to know his fate with me,

212
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,020
then his fate with another woman,

213
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,160
and later, he'll fall in love with Ling Long.

214
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,000
He seems to be a weak-willed,

215
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,810
easily enamored playboy.

216
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,430
But that's good.

217
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,530
The more he behaves like this,

218
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,280
the easier it will be for us to break him and Ling Long up

219
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,400
and prevent the future tragedy.

220
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,490
Then tell me,

221
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,460
when is her birthday?

222
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,810
Her birthday is...

223
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,470
Wu!

224
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,510
Where did this rude servant

225
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,030
come from?

226
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,490
I, the Master...

227
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,730
Is this how people from Kunlun behave,

228
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,150
showing such a lack of courtesy to someone they've just met?

229
00:10:59,170 --> 00:10:59,840
Qi,

230
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,340
don't be rude.

231
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,550
Saint, please forgive us.

232
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,110
This servant of Wu

233
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:05,610
is...

234
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,090
a bit slow-witted.

235
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,540
He only knows to protect his master,

236
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,750
which is why he offended you.

237
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,350
I'll take him back now and teach him proper manners.

238
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,020
It doesn't matter.

239
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,870
Let's go.

240
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,440
After all these years,

241
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,520
she's still the same.

242
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,960
The Master of Bright Moon fell into the illusion

243
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,630
to save Ms. Bai.

244
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,600
Although the Saint is a true gentleman,

245
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,440
their being alone together

246
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,750
would inevitably make Master suspicious

247
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,770
that Ms. Bai is in danger.

248
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,000
With his temper,

249
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,300
he might cause trouble.

250
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,610
Get it straight.

251
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,110
You are a servant from the Fox Clan now.

252
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,850
If you go in there and stop Fan Yue,

253
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,370
aren't you helping the outsiders?

254
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,910
All you do is make trouble.

255
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,880
Me?

256
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,070
f it weren't for you causing trouble at the Yi Clan Tomb,

257
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,650
we wouldn't have entered this realm of resentment.

258
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,230
Are Kunlun disciples really this vengeful?

259
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,370
Does the Fox Clan

260
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,750
never admit their mistakes?

261
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,350
Rong Xian almost wiped out the Fox Clan.

262
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,890
How is it wrong for me to kill him for revenge?

263
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,000
It was your Saintess who almost wiped out Kunlun.

264
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,850
-Don't make a move.
-I'm going to punch you.

265
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,080
It's the realm of resentment.

266
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,040
-What are you doing? Let me go!
-Let's go.

267
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,810
-Let go of me!
-What are you doing?

268
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,710
The Elder wants to interrogate him.

269
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,670
Follow up.

270
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,530
Interrogate him?

271
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,210
I've already figured it out.

272
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,630
Stop pretending.

273
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,890
Could it be that…

274
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,000
she has figured out we're impostors?

275
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,430
Qi,

276
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,540
you little brat.

277
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,010
You and Wu have been keeping this well from me.

278
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,510
Tell me.

279
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,820
When did you two

280
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,040
start liking each other?

281
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,200
Sister,

282
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,100
it's not what you think.

283
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:47,850
Wu,

284
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,870
stop explaining.

285
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,910
I've lived for more than 100 years. How could I not see this?

286
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,210
Just now, when Qi heard that Rong Xian was interested in you,

287
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,000
he rushed right in without a second thought.

288
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,530
Even a fool can tell

289
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,010
he cares about you a lot.

290
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,290
He even dared to challenge the Kunlun Saint for you.

291
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,790
Such a fiery spirit.

292
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,520
I've underestimated you all this time.

293
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,430
Young Chief,

294
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,070
you misunderstood.

295
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,520
Why are you so shy?

296
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,610
I think Wu quite likes you too.

297
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,570
You almost ruined our plan just now.

298
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,550
But during this whole time,

299
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,260
she didn't criticize you for your reckless actions.

300
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,200
What does it mean?

301
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,920
It means favoritism.

302
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,530
Only someone who likes you

303
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,080
would protect you like that.

304
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,180
Am I right?

305
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,720
Come on.

306
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,530
Sister,

307
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,800
you really misunderstood.

308
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,650
We're not what you think.

309
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,550
Misunderstood?

310
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,710
Then let me ask you,

311
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,540
when you're in danger,

312
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,350
who do you most want to protect?

313
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,740
When you're bored,

314
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,490
who is the first person you think of?

315
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,730
When you're happy,

316
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,810
who do you want to share it with the most?

317
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,870
When you're sad,

318
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,450
who do you want to talk to?

319
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,570
When you truly like someone,

320
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,230
you think of this person all the time.

321
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,520
Aren't you like that for each other?

322
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,350
Of course,

323
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,850
sometimes the person involved might be too confused

324
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,120
to realize it,

325
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,900
but others can see it clearly.

326
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,550
Qi,

327
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,140
although you're just a servant,

328
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,820
our Fox Clan has always been open-minded

329
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,370
when it comes to love.

330
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,480
Since you two are already in love,

331
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,940
I'm happy to support you.

332
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,850
How about this?

333
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,570
I'll carry out the beauty trap myself.

334
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,070
You two go to the back mountain and steal the Snow Lotus.

335
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,610
If she goes,

336
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,750
it'll be terrible.

337
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,590
No!

338
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:18,960
Sister,

339
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,200
I like Rong Xian.

340
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,100
I'll go.

341
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,750
Alright.

342
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,350
Stop saying things against your will.

343
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,660
I can't sacrifice your happiness

344
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,880
just to complete the mission

345
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,410
and send you to another man.

346
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,030
It's decided.

347
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,630
Tonight, I'll hold off Rong Xian

348
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,620
while you two go to the back mountain and steal the Snow Lotus.

349
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,760
If you manage to get the Snow Lotus

350
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,870
and make a great contribution,

351
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,340
when we return to the Fox Clan, I'll make sure to speak to the Chief

352
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,790
and appoint you as an Elder.

353
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,430
That way,

354
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,060
you'll be worthy of Wu.

355
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,950
Although Rong Xian already has someone he likes,

356
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,930
the Fox Clan's seduction techniques are unmatched.

357
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,800
How can Rong Xian resist?

358
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,210
So, we need to hurry.

359
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,740
The sooner we get the Snow Lotus and complete the mission,

360
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,760
the sooner we can take Ling Long back to the Fox Clan.

361
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,220
The shorter the time Ling Long spends with Rong Xian,

362
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,830
the less likely they are to fall in love.

363
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,880
I'm still here.

364
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,950
Stop being so lovey-dovey.

365
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,340
Let me remind you,

366
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,910
don't let love

367
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,200
ruin our big plan.

368
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,520
Qi and I will go to the back mountain now.

369
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,940
We'll definitely bring the Snow Lotus back.

370
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,460
The conflict between

371
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,920
the Eternals and demons has been ongoing for all this time,

372
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,910
and Kunlun and the Fox Clans have also been at war endlessly.

373
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,000
Your proposal of peace talks this time

374
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,030
is quite strange and suspicious.

375
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,980
Do you really think Kunlun will believe you?

376
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:26,950
Tell me.

377
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,250
What is your purpose

378
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,720
in entering Kunlun?

379
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,510
El...

380
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,830
We are truly here for peace talks.

381
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,930
You're full of lies!

382
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,080
You,

383
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,490
beat him up!

384
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,070
Yes!

385
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,000
How dare you!

386
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,060
How dare you, fox demon,

387
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,610
play tricks in front of our Elder?

388
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,640
Speak up!

389
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,630
Let me tell you,

390
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,860
don't do anything reckless.

391
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,610
If we can't break the illusion,

392
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,700
none of us will be able to leave.

393
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,380
Just wait.

394
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,560
When I get out...

395
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,320
Then you should wait until we get out first.

396
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,320
I haven't tasted the sweet dew,

397
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,820
but I've already smelled the sacred fragrance.

398
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,490
Saint, you arrived on time.

399
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,060
This is your invitation,

400
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,490
so I naturally couldn't be late.

401
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,500
If I'm not mistaken,

402
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,970
this tea smells like

403
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,600
the Fox Clan's Nine-Color Flower Tea.

404
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,730
You sure know a lot about the Fox Clan.

405
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,380
That's right.

406
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,650
Nine-Color Flower Tea

407
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,070
has a delicate and refreshing fragrance,

408
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,020
best brewed with water derived from thousand-year-old ice.

409
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,500
I specially brought some

410
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,000
to share with you.

411
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,339
The thousand-year-old ice

412
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,810
can be sourced endlessly from Kunlun.

413
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,890
The purest part

414
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,569
lies beneath the Snow Lotus.

415
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,200
Saintess,

416
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,690
would you like to see it?

417
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,210
If you hadn't mentioned it,

418
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,140
I wouldn't have known.

419
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,270
Kunlun and the Fox Clan have never been on good terms.

420
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,579
Are you really so at ease drinking tea

421
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:29,010
that I brewed?

422
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,350
You came from afar for peace talks

423
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:31,970
to bring

424
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,370
tranquility to the countless lives

425
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,020
of both the Fox Clan and Kunlun.

426
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,420
You're such a noble person,

427
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,480
so you would never

428
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,600
engage in despicable deeds.

429
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,870
I've misjudged you with a narrow mind.

430
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,690
Your doubt

431
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,910
is quite understandable.

432
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,190
Just as I too want to ask you—

433
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,950
did you really come here

434
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,770
with no other intention?

435
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,410
Isn't my intention to seek peace

436
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,860
for countless Fox Clan members enough?

437
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,550
I've heard of Saintess Ling Long's heroic qualities for many years,

438
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,030
and seeing you today

439
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,170
I can confirm those words are true.

440
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,910
I have long admired you

441
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,810
and have always wanted to come to Kunlun to see

442
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,700
what Saint Rong Xian of Kunlun

443
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,210
truly looks like.

444
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,230
Now that you've seen me,

445
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,320
what do you think?

446
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,690
Even the stars in the sky

447
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,440
cannot hide your brilliance.

448
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,290
By the way,

449
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:27,900
I heard that

450
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,500
the old Chief of the Fox Clan is seriously ill.

451
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,260
How is he doing recently?

452
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,370
The old Chief is blessed

453
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,590
and has strong spiritual power.

454
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,140
With the treatment of the Fox Clan's holy healer,

455
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,500
he has fully recovered.

456
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,220
Thank you for your concern.

457
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,410
That's good.

458
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,560
Kunlun is full of suspicions.

459
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,740
The Fox Clan entered the mountain,

460
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,400
but the elders are all avoiding us.

461
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,380
Bei Chen and Mu Jiu also seemed to have disappeared.

462
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,980
But the longer we wait, the more complicated it will become.

463
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,410
We can only give them this one night

464
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,920
to spend together.

465
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,980
Once we get the Snow Lotus,

466
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,840
let's take Ling Long and leave Kunlun as quickly as possible.

467
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,220
The Snow Lotus!

468
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,640
Wait.

469
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,840
Is there a trap?

470
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,100
Let's go!

471
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,560
The Fox Clan is indeed crafty.

472
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,690
They used the peace talks as a cover to steal our treasure.

473
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,160
Fortunately, the Elders have already made preparations.

474
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:49,740
Today,

475
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,170
you won't be able to go back.

476
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,190
Capture them!

477
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:52,900
Yes!

478
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,180
Oh no.

479
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,790
Wu and Qi were discovered.

480
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,540
The Elders had already made arrangements around the Snow Lotus.

481
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,670
You won't be able

482
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,720
to save them now.

483
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,420
You knew our plan all along?

484
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,850
Did you come tonight

485
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,280
just to watch me fail?

486
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,090
Ling Long,

487
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,390
you really don't remember me?

488
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,410
Hurry!

489
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,320
Hurry!

490
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,600
Someone is coming.

491
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,380
Come with me.

492
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,720
The old Chief of the Fox Clan is seriously ill.

493
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,690
I know you're here for the Snow Lotus.

494
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,370
Take it.

495
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,250
Leave Kunlun now.

496
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,030
No.

497
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,330
Wu and the others are still inside.

498
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,510
I can't leave.

499
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,190
Leave Wu and those two attendants to me.

500
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,210
I will send them back to the Fox Clan safely.

501
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,340
But since you knew I was lying to you,

502
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,830
why are you still helping me?

503
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,020
Ling Long,

504
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,010
Kunlun is not where we first met.

505
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,310
I've known you

506
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,580
for a long time.

507
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,570
Do you remember

508
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,510
ten years ago,

509
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,570
in Qingling Mountain,

510
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,720
when you saved a severely wounded Eternal?

511
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,430
Ten years ago?

512
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,220
It was you?

513
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,950
At that time, I was ambushed by demons,

514
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,450
severely injured, and fell off a cliff.

515
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,900
My face was covered in wounds.

516
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,290
It's normal that you didn't recognize me.

517
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,680
If you hadn't taken care of me for three days,

518
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,870
I might have died at the bottom of the cliff.

519
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,100
The reason I didn't tell you

520
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,570
when we met again today

521
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,000
wasn't that I wanted to deceive you intentionally.

522
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,090
I just...

523
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,230
just wanted to spend more time with you.

524
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,290
Although Kunlun and the Fox Clan have been enemies for years,

525
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,750
I have always hoped the two clans could reconcile.

526
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,420
The two clans have a deep grudge;

527
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,150
someone has to take the first step.

528
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,160
So,

529
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,320
take the Snow Lotus

530
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,980
to save the old Chief.

531
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,860
But if Kunlun finds out

532
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,050
you helped me,

533
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,520
how will they deal with you?

534
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,520
Don't worry.

535
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,860
I am the Saint after all.

536
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,650
At most,

537
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,840
I'll just get scolded by my master.

538
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,500
I won't die.

539
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,570
I won't forget

540
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,730
your kindness today.

541
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,330
If there's an opportunity in the future,

542
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,630
I'll repay it.

543
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,050
What happened?

544
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,520
Why are we suddenly here?

545
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,700
They...

546
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,710
We were still a step too late.

547
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,570
Emotions in this world are truly unpredictable.

548
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,350
Some feelings may take a thousand or ten thousand years to develop,

549
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,680
while others

550
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,610
might arise in the blink of an eye.

551
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,660
Why is it changing again?

552
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,670
It's Rong Xian's obsession leading us.

553
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,580
Everything in this illusion

554
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,500
changes according to his key memories.

555
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,820
Where will we go?

556
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,090
I don't know.

557
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,740
Qi.

558
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,010
What's wrong with you today?

559
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,670
You've lost five rounds already.

560
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,040
It's...

561
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,490
Sister, don't misunderstand.

562
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,070
He was just too tired last night and didn't rest well,

563
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,860
so he spaced out.

564
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,450
I see.

565
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,530
It's not what you think.

566
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,480
It is.

567
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,790
Last night...

568
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,490
I was too tired, so today I feel a bit weary.

569
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,710
I understand.

570
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,620
You're young,

571
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
full of energy.

572
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,080
I can understand.

573
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,380
Here.

574
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,540
You took back your card again.

575
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,390
What do you mean "again"?

576
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,850
Haven't you done it before?

577
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,750
I haven't.

578
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,930
Not taking back cards

579
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,360
is a noble act.

580
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,180
Yes.

581
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,960
You are noble.

582
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,330
Then why don't you cook?

583
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,430
For the past month,

584
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,250
I've been the one cooking at home.

585
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
That's because you refused to wash the dishes first.

586
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,890
So now you want to bring up old grievances?

587
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,390
I've been the one doing the laundry.

588
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,990
That was me.

589
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,420
You always forget to collect them.

590
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,090
How can you lie?

591
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,150
Even if I did collect them,

592
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,700
you'd still throw them all over the place,

593
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,040
and I wouldn't be able to find anything!

594
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,620
You, the Saint of Kunlun,

595
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,610
are lazy and don't know life at all.

596
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,190
That's because I have order in my chaos.

597
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,350
When have I ever failed to find something

598
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,140
when you asked me to?

599
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,550
You always forget our anniversaries.

600
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,160
Who has hundreds of anniversaries in a year?

601
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,430
You have secret money.

602
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,350
With a fierce wife,

603
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,350
this is my last line of defense and dignity.

604
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
Actually, these are not important.

605
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,170
Shut up!

606
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,220
You don't love me anymore.

607
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,090
What I saw just now

608
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,800
was the Saintess of Fox Clan and the Saint of Kunlun?

609
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,060
You saw an ordinary couple.

610
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,080
They say that marriage is like a tomb.

611
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,820
That makes sense. They didn't deceive me.

612
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,240
This should be the place where Rong Xian and Ling Long

613
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,000
lived in seclusion, which Bei Chen mentioned before—

614
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,100
Carefree Valley.

615
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
They've grown so tired of each other already.

616
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,020
It shouldn't be hard to break them up.

617
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,850
Sister,

618
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,590
I really feel for you.

619
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,820
You gave up your position as Saintess for him,

620
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,810
enduring public criticism.

621
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,270
But what about him?

622
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,790
It hasn't been long,

623
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,030
and he's already speaking to you harshly,

624
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,110
with no patience at all.

625
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,270
The Saint of Kunlun,

626
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,030
pure and untainted, the best of his time?

627
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,030
I think men are all bad.

628
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,750
He's not that bad.

629
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:55,920
Wu,

630
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,850
you're still young.

631
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,310
What you see now is just romance.

632
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,900
But when two people live together for a long time,

633
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,880
it's never just about romance and passion.

634
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,350
In the end, it all comes to a simple life.

635
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,530
Although he's not good at cooking,

636
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,340
he knows I always sleep in,

637
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,470
so he always gets up early to prepare breakfast.

638
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,100
He always puts things everywhere,

639
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,020
but whenever I can't find something,

640
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,070
he always manages to find it for me.

641
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,700
Although he can't remember

642
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,850
all our little anniversaries,

643
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
he always prepares

644
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,230
a thoughtful gift for me,

645
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,480
never repeating.

646
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,490
Even if he forgets,

647
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,880
he always makes it up to me.

648
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,270
When you think about it,

649
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,930
all these little things

650
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,520
are the happiness in our ordinary life.

651
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,590
Marriage

652
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,020
should be like this.

653
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,670
Besides,

654
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,460
I've already...

655
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,810
Qi,

656
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,790
did you see that?

657
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,900
Married women

658
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,970
are really scary.

659
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,030
Who has

660
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,160
100 anniversaries in a year?

661
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:57,740
And after using

662
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,080
any ornament in the house,

663
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,310
it must be put back in its exact place.

664
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,740
If I get it wrong, she scolds me.

665
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,390
She doesn't even let me save any secret money.

666
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,310
Isn't that terrifying?

667
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,280
Terrifying, right?

668
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,630
Yes.

669
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,280
So my advice is,

670
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,580
you should return to Kunlun

671
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,370
and continue to be the Saint.

672
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,860
How can I do that?

673
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,770
For me,

674
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,440
Ling Long left her clan,

675
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,410
abandoned her position as Saintess,

676
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,950
and came with me to live in this secluded place.

677
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,110
How can I abandon her?

678
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,600
Besides,

679
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,790
she often breaks bowls

680
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,550
because she thinks I'm too tired from cooking,

681
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,610
and she breaks them

682
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,070
while fighting with me to do the dishes.

683
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,130
Remembering every single one of our anniversaries

684
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,530
shows how much she cares about me.

685
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,170
Not letting me save secret money

686
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,630
is because she's afraid I'll sneak out to buy alcohol

687
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,720
and get spotted by Kunlun and the Fox Clan.

688
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,340
With such a wife,

689
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,240
I have nothing more to ask for.

690
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,160
No.

691
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,850
I have to coax her now.

692
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,160
I didn't manage to persuade Ling Long.

693
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,150
How about you?

694
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,270
No.

695
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,120
Bei Chen said that

696
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,660
not long after Rong Xian and Ling Long lived in seclusion,

697
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,330
the Fox Clan and Kunlun encountered problems.

698
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,650
Fan Yue,

699
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,330
we don't have much time left.

700
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,040
What do you think of Rong Xian?

701
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,070
He became too talkative after getting married,

702
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,880
but he is also kind,

703
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,620
righteous,

704
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,950
and noble.

705
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,810
And he is deeply devoted to Ling Long.

706
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,560
As you can see,

707
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,630
Ling Long gave up her position

708
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,670
as the Chief of the Fox Clan for Rong Xian.

709
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,950
But why did she suddenly go to wipe out Kunlun?

710
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,210
What happened a thousand years ago

711
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,460
that led them to this point, where one of them must die?

712
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,700
I was wrong.

713
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,850
It's always like this.

714
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,440
You have to argue with me,

715
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,560
and then I have to apologize to you.

716
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,550
Yes, yes.

717
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,770
It's all my fault.

718
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,310
There's something

719
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,410
I want to tell you.

720
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,870
What is it?

721
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,720
It's a letter from Kunlun.

722
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,220
Open it.

723
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,470
Actually,

724
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,680
if Kunlun really wanted to stop us from being together,

725
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,560
they would have found us

726
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,060
long ago during these three years.

727
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,430
[Master is seriously ill and on the verge of death. Return quickly]

728
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,260
What happened?

729
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,270
The letter says

730
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,240
that my master is seriously ill

731
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,390
and nearing the end of his life.

732
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,490
I have to go back to Kunlun.

733
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,240
Don't worry.

734
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,130
I'm just going back to see my master.

735
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:06,260
The Kunlun Sect Leader has treated you like a master and a father.

736
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,590
You should go back.

737
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,010
By the way,

738
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,650
what did you

739
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,640
want to tell me just now?

740
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,350
I'll tell you when you come back.

741
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,500
Just go.

742
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,470
I'll take care of things at home.

743
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,970
Three years?

744
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,310
Why is it already three years later?

745
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,250
I still haven't finished beating that Bei Chen.

746
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,520
In this realm of resentment,

747
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,450
time changes without any logic at all.

748
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,250
I wonder where those three were sent.

749
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,230
Am I

750
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,310
going to stay in this stupid illusion

751
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,580
for the rest of my life?

752
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,170
Why is he back?

753
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,200
Master.

754
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,900
You've been gone for three years,

755
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,820
and you're finally back.

756
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,400
I'm sorry.

757
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,690
During these three years,

758
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,310
the Eternals and Demons have been fighting incessantly.

759
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:49,840
[In Harmony with Heaven and Earth]

760
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,400
Kunlun has been guarding the boundary between the two races,

761
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,640
and the responsibility is immense.

762
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:49,700
Rong Xian,

763
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,490
I don't have much time left,

764
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,250
but Kunlun now has no one capable of bearing such a heavy responsibility.

765
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,120
You are my only disciple

766
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,120
and the Saint of Kunlun.

767
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,680
Only you

768
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,810
can inherit the position of Kunlun Sect Leader.

769
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,790
Master,

770
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,900
the dangers and evil of the world

771
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,170
do not have just one source.

772
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,840
Not all demons are evil and should be eradicated.

773
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,730
Nonsense!

774
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,240
Demons are wreaking havoc in the world.

775
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,570
They should be eradicated.

776
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,080
The Eternals and the demons have been fighting for over a thousand years.

777
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,620
The casualties include not only demons

778
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,340
but also Eternals and Kunlun disciples.

779
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,400
Why don't we stop the war

780
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,020
to prevent the world from being flooded with blood?

781
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,350
Eradicating the demons

782
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,740
and protecting the people is Kunlun's duty.

783
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,690
Rong Xian,

784
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,950
don't forget,

785
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,710
you are the Saint of Kunlun.

786
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,260
I've left Kunlun for a long time,

787
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,310
and I no longer want to get involved in the conflicts between the two races.

788
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,670
As for inheriting the position of the Sect Leader,

789
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,120
I can only let you down.

790
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,000
-Rong Xian!
-Rong Xian!

791
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,450
You don't want to take on the position of the Sect Leader

792
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,170
because you can't let go of that Fox Clan Saintess, right?

793
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,770
It's true that I don't want the slaughter between the Eternals and the demons to continue,

794
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,480
but it's also true that I can't let go of Ling Long.

795
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,200
Ling Long and I

796
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,860
swore to be together for life.

797
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,370
I will never break that promise

798
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,850
and betray her.

799
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,490
Since you can't let go,

800
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,850
I'll make the decision for you.

801
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,550
[In Harmony with Heaven and Earth]

802
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,110
Master,

803
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,540
what are you doing?

804
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:25,240
Eternals and demons are destined to fight each other to the death.

805
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:25,990
Rong Xian,

806
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,080
you are the hope of all Kunlun.

807
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,190
I cannot allow you

808
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,000
to abandon your sect

809
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,310
and the Eternal Race

810
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,830
for a Fox Clan demoness.

811
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,610
In order to preserve Kunlun's reputation

812
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,790
[In Harmony with Heaven and Earth]

813
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,990
and thousand-year legacy,

814
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,990
I will transfer all my spiritual power to you

815
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,170
and change all of your memories with that demoness.

816
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,300
Rong Xian,

817
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,440
remember,

818
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,940
your parents and closest kin

819
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,140
were all killed by the Fox Clan.

820
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,740
Three years ago, it was you

821
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,100
who deceived Ling Long into going into seclusion,

822
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,630
all to make

823
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:01,060
the Fox Clan lose their strongest heir.

824
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,180
[In Harmony with Heaven and Earth]

825
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,920
You have never loved Ling Long.

826
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,690
[In Harmony with Heaven and Earth]

827
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,110
You only have hatred

828
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,430
and murderous intent toward her.

829
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,150
My parents and closest kin

830
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,580
were all killed by the Fox Clan.

831
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,580
I have never loved Ling Long.

832
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,909
The Demon Race deserves to die.

833
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,440
The Fox Clan deserves to die!

834
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,500
Is this

835
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,639
the true reason Rong Xian slaughtered the Fox Clan?

836
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,480
I must hurry back to the Fox Clan

837
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,710
and tell them everything.

838
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,870
Stop!

839
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,310
You were spying outside the Sect Leader's room.

840
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:36,920
Take him away!

841
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,239
What are you doing?

842
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,239
Let go of me!

843
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,300
Move!

844
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,800
Sister.

845
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:53,340
I haven't seen Rong Xian all afternoon.

846
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,500
Where did he go?

847
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,170
He went back to Kunlun.

848
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,590
Why did Rong Xian suddenly go back to Kunlun?

849
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,250
Did you two have a fight,

850
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,110
and he

851
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,450
went back to Kunlun out of anger?

852
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,540
Of course not.

853
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,770
The Sect Leader of Kunlun is seriously ill

854
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,950
and summoned him back.

855
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,310
What's wrong?

856
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,890
Wu,

857
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,150
over the past three years,

858
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,240
you've been living in seclusion with me in Carefree Valley.

859
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,460
I know

860
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,430
that you and Qi are in love with each other.

861
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,670
Why did you suddenly bring this up?

862
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,370
I just feel that Qi is gentle,

863
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,820
kind, and upright.

864
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:37,900
If you choose him,

865
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,040
I will be at ease.

866
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,150
You've always been a free spirit,

867
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,400
not interested in practicing magic.

868
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,750
Now that

869
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,390
you've left the Fox Clan,

870
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,260
just don't go back.

871
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:47,850
From now on,

872
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,910
stay in Carefree Valley with Qi

873
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,300
and live as a simple, carefree couple.

874
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,280
Sister,

875
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,740
what happened exactly?

876
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,920
I just suddenly feel

877
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,920
that my little Wu has grown up.

878
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:08,840
Let's take a look!

879
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,830
What happened?

880
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,050
-Get up.
-What happened?

881
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,430
What happened?

882
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:25,730
Rong Xian?

883
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
Aren't you living in seclusion with the Saintess in Carefree Valley?

884
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,290
Why did you suddenly barge into the Fox Clan?

885
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,310
Did something happen to the Saintess?

886
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,840
Saint,

887
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,660
stop!

888
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,910
Why?

889
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,660
Why?

890
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,550
After all this,

891
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,640
haven't you understood?

892
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,790
From the start,

893
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,510
he got close to you intentionally.

894
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,970
You are the Fox Clan's most powerful Saintess.

895
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,700
You were supposed to inherit the position of Chief

896
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,210
and strengthen our Fox Clan,

897
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,050
but he

898
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,130
deceived you into living in seclusion,

899
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,740
keeping you away from the clan.

900
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,160
And while you were gone, he came to Jingyou Mountain

901
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,270
and slaughtered us.

902
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,820
All of this

903
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,420
is a conspiracy of Kunlun!

904
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,660
That's not true.

905
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,240
It's not true, right?

906
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,940
Who would use three years to set up a trap,

907
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,130
spending thousands of days and nights together?

908
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,000
No one would do that.

909
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,020
If I had known you were this stupid,

910
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,040
I wouldn't have gone to all the trouble to scheme for three years.

911
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,590
For the past three years,

912
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,160
every moment I pretended to love you,

913
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,710
I felt

914
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,160
utterly disgusted!

915
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,680
But it's also thanks to you.

916
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,290
If you hadn't trusted me completely,

917
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,780
how would I have known everything about the Fox Clan?

918
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,510
When I was charging up the mountain,

919
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,620
it felt like walking into an unprotected territory.

920
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,250
Miss Ling Long!

921
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,400
Saintess!

922
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,810
Even if these three years were all a lie.

923
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,110
Even if you never loved me.

924
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,630
Rong Xian,

925
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,470
they are all living beings.

926
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,200
How could you bring yourself to do that?

927
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,810
They are just a group of vile demons.

928
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,970
And you.

929
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,690
You're the same.

930
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,020
Vile,

931
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,590
and disgusting.

932
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,620
I am the Saint of an Eternal Sect.

933
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,690
How could I ever fall in love with a demon?

934
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,020
Ridiculous.

935
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,410
There should be an end

936
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,160
between us!

937
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,270
Miss Ling Long!

938
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,190
Saintess!

939
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,320
♫No matter if I'm drunk or not, I just want to be reckless once♫

940
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,900
♫Because love is thrilling♫

941
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,920
Miss Ling Long!

942
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,690
Saintess!

943
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,040
♫If you tear open my heart♫

944
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,750
I have long admired you

945
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,550
and have always wanted to come to Kunlun to see

946
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,150
♫I can hold you a little tighter♫

947
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,750
what Saint Rong Xian of Kunlun

948
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,410
truly looks like.

949
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,910
♫This pain will gradually fade♫

950
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:13,060
♫Time withers the moonlight♫

951
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,540
But since you knew I was lying to you,

952
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,490
why are you still helping me?

953
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,070
♫All that's left is pitch darkness♫

954
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:14,930
I won't forget

955
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,130
your kindness today.

956
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,300
If there's an opportunity in the future,

957
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,470
♫I want to tear apart♫

958
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,720
I'll repay it.

959
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,070
♫This sky for you♫

960
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,850
You always forget our anniversaries.

961
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,100
Who has hundreds of anniversaries in a year?

962
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,970
♫A lifetime of guarding everything with you♫

963
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,490
You have secret money.

964
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:29,740
♫Crossing the abyss to fulfill our vow♫

965
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,770
I'll tell you when you come back.

966
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,010
Just go.

967
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,390
♫I'll leap without a thought for tomorrow♫

968
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,960
I'll take care of things at home.

969
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,260
♫This moment feels like forever♫

970
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,520
♫I've missed too much time in my life♫

971
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,640
♫I'll throw myself into this flame for you♫

972
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,830
♫Even if I'll perish♫

973
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,650
♫At least I can still kiss your face♫

974
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,100
♫Burn out my waning moon♫

975
00:41:52,360 --> 00:42:00,600
♫In exchange for a lifetime of passion♫

976
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,880
Eternals and demons are destined to fight each other to the death.

977
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,920
Why?

978
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,150
All of this is a conspiracy of Kunlun!

979
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,830
You fox demoness!

980
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,270
Long!

981
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,220
Long!

982
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,420
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

983
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,990
Long!

984
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,700
Ling Long!

985
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,120
Ling Long!

986
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:54,210
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

987
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,510
I'm sorry.

988
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,140
I didn't mean it.

989
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:04,300
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

990
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,540
Our...

991
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,080
child...

992
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:10,270
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫

993
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,800
♫Across thousands of miles♫

994
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:29,260
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

995
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,830
Child?

996
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:31,950
Child?

997
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:39,160
♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

998
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,850
What child?

999
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,400
What child?

1000
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,900
♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

1001
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,680
Can't you see

1002
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:47,310
that she's already pregnant with your child?

1003
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,000
Children conceived

1004
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:53,280
♫What kind of tree never takes root?♫

1005
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,110
by an Eternal and a demon

1006
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,620
are naturally flawed and hard to carry to term.

1007
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:01,470
♫What kind of roots never turn into trees♫

1008
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:00,110
She has expended a great deal of her own spiritual power to sustain the baby.

1009
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,370
Otherwise,

1010
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,900
she wouldn't have so easily died under your sword!

1011
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:11,630
♫ To break the roots of love, to look at the past and seal one's heart ♫

1012
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:08,940
Rong Xian,

1013
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,780
what you've done

1014
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,510
is unforgivable!

1015
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:16,890
♫I'm your wanderer♫

1016
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,410
It was me.

1017
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:21,060
It was me.

1018
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,310
♫The flowers flew away♫

1019
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,010
It was me

1020
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,240
who killed our child.

1021
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,050
It was me who killed Ling Long.

1022
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,840
♫My tears are streaming down like rain♫

1023
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,160
Why?

1024
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,070
Why did you do this to me?

1025
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:43,060
♫Light my heart's lamp, cast away attachments, and ask the world♫

1026
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,360
Why?

1027
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:50,350
♫On the vast sea, you and I♫
