Since you're in so much pain,

It seems

and dispatched all spies in Bright Moon Palace.

150
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,660

Zhen Yu was not born into the Dragon Clan

Ten years ago,

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,930
Qi Feng didn't go back to serve Zhen Yu

but to avenge the Bai Ze Clan.

163
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,210
He didn’t kill Nuo

164
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,790
because he has the Contemplation of kindness.

165
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,730
What's wrong?

166
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,330
What else did you find out?

167
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,160
I just received news from the Cold Spring Palace.

168
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,310
Chen Ye rebelled and tried to assassinate Zhen Yu.

179
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,770

Do you think I’m afraid of Zhen Yu?

181
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,630
That's not what I meant.

182
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,500
But Zhen Yu is sinister and cunning.

183
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,200
I’d better go with you.

184
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,190
Bai Shuo is at the critical moment.

185
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,600
She can't be disturbed.

00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,420
is your most important task now.

188
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,500
But protecting you, Master, is my mission.

189
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,640
This is an order.

190
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,640
If you still regard me as your master

191
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,470
and you still see yourself as the guardian of Bright Moon Palace,

192
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,860
obey my order.

193
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,420
Let me ask you.

194
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,330
Chen Ye

195
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,540
acted unfavorably

196
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,860
and failed his mission.

197
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,850
What should we do?

198
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,070
Kill him!

199
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,640
Let me continue to ask.

200
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,780
Chen Ye

201
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,220
colluded with enemies

202
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,730
and plotted a rebellion.

203
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
What should we do?

204
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,250
Kill him!

205
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,720
Let me ask you one last time.

206
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,720
Not only did Chen Ye disobey me,

207
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,230
but also assassinated me.

208
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,740
What should we do?

209
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,950
Kill! Kill! Kill!

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,880
My today

211
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,550
will be your tomorrow.

212
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,430
Zhen Yu,

213
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,030
those who do evil will be punished by death.

214
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,320
All the eternals and demons

215
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,090
who want to kill you will flood over

216
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,500
and flatten Cold Spring Palace.

217
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,050
Flatten Cold Spring Palace?

218
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,900
Do you know

219
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,810
what I'm plotting?

220
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,540
Once my plan

221
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,720
succeeds,

222
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,440
only the Cold Spring Palace

223
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,240
will remain in this world.

224
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,440
Zhen Yu!

225
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,390
How arrogant!

226
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,420
Today,

227
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,120
I will make this Cold Spring Palace

228
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,420
no longer exist.

229
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,180
Qi Feng.

230
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,280
Who told you to come?

231
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,230
Go!

232
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,980
I set up a trap with Chen Ye.

233
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,090
You came as expected.

234
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,930
If I guessed correctly,

235
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,420
you’re also from the Bai Ze Clan, right?

236
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,660
The boy

237
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,580
with purple eyes I wanted to find before

238
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,800
was you, right?

239
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,330
Back then, Chen Ye

240
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,310
exchanged identities to protect you.

241
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,950
If I were you,

242
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,300
I would come to save him too.

243
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,700
Fan Yue,

244
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,710
I don't need your pity

245
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,380
nor need you to save me.

246
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,370
Go!

247
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,240
Chen Ye,

248
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,980
you treat him sincerely.

249
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,690
It’s not your place

250
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,420
to teach my men a lesson.

251
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,880
Zhen Yu has a mysterious power

252
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,320
that's neither eternal nor demonic.

253
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,310
It's hard to fight him.

254
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,400
I'll take you away.

255
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,830
I'm dying.

256
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,500
Zhen Yu never thought of letting me leave alive.

257
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,840
I’ll leave Bai Ze’s revenge to you.

258
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,580
Go!

259
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,430
Go!

260
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,150
Neither of you can leave.

261
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,960
All these years,

262
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,180
I've been killing demons everywhere.

263
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,330
Do you really think

264
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,610
I did it to repair the dragon tail?

265
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,770
That's just a cover-up.

266
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,160
I fed

267
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,780
all the demon cores

268
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,170
to this ancient mirror.

269
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,330
As long as enough demonic power is absorbed,

270
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,670
the ancient mirror can be completely restored.

271
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,410
The person I want to meet

272
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,350
will be back soon.

273
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,010
Come with me.

274
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,290
Fan Yue is attacking the Cold Spring Palace.

275
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,720
Zhen Yu is busy with Fan Yue.

276
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,530
Now is our best chance to leave Cold Spring Palace.

277
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,130
I said I'm not going anywhere.

278
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,270
You can leave by yourself.

279
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,700
I must

280
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,100
bring you out of this hell.

281
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,700
This is

282
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,980
an ancient Divine Mirror from 60,000 years ago.

283
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,900
Ordinary power can't counter it.

284
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,840
Fan Yue, your demonic power

285
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,580
is much more useful

286
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,980
than ordinary demon cores.

287
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,180
It can heal the cracks of the Divine Mirror.

288
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,950
As expected of a Demon Lord's Divine Mantle.

289
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,830
If I'm not mistaken,

290
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,130
you are a snake of the Divine Region from 60,000 years ago.

291
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,110
That's why you could cultivate into a dragon.

292
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,530
You could cure Chen Ye's legs

293
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,510
because you have a bit

294
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,980
of the Hidden Race's power.

295
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,410
Good guess.

296
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,610
Unfortunately,

297
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,820
you have no chance

298
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,510
to compete with me anymore.

299
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,760
Qi Feng!

300
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,220
All my life, I've always

301
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,710
forced my way out of dead ends.

302
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,330
If I have no chance,

303
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,790
then I'll create a chance.

304
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,470
Zhen Yu,

305
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,450
I won’t let you

306
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,720
do any of the things that you want to do.

307
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,490
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

308
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,790
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

316
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,510
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

Qi Feng.

324

Fan Yue.

325
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,780
I forgive you this time.

326
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,960
Don't do it again.

327
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,890

Zhen Yu!

360
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,690
A Demon Lord's Divine Mantle

361
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,110
is nothing.

362
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,820
Shuo.

363
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,140
Shuo.

364
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
I told you before in Ning'an City

365
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,790
that I'll definitely kill you

366
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,400
and avenge my father!

367
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Shuo.

368
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:46,770
You overestimate yourself.

369
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,630
In my eyes,

370
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,880
you're just an ant.

371
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,040
Even if I, Bai Shuo, am just an ant,

372
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,860
dying by your hand

373
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,700
is not my destiny.

374
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,570
♫I've climbed 3,000 steps with a sincere heart♫

375
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,670
♫I've prayed to the Buddha, burning incense, keeping to oneself♫

376
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,050
♫Don't ask, don't separate, don't describe the universe anymore♫

377
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,300
♫I only deserve to read poetry intoxicatingly♫

378
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,940
♫I am an average person who fell into the mundane world♫

379
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,560
♫Holding a lonely lamp to light up nirvana♫

380
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:31,400
♫Don't approach, don't recognize, don't forget I'm not drifting♫

381
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,610
Hurry and go, Shuo!

382
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,550
If you fight with a strong opponent

383
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,820
and your power is weaker than him,

384
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,910
you can use the fastest speed

385
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,770
and give a fatal surprise attack

386
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,670
by seizing his only opening.

387
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,570
Then, you can survive a desperate situation

388
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,110
and turn defeat into victory.

389
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,160
May we live and die together,

390
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,590
and share life and death as one.

391
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,160
But what if my opponent is Zhen Yu?

392
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,380
He is the same.

393
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,060
But this is just a move.

394
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,430
He has great demonic power.

395
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,110
Even if I find his opening,

396
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,900
I can't take his life.

397
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,140
But don't forget

398
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,090
you still have the power of the Contemplation Stone.

399
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,350
When you gather all your power

400
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,700
to this move,

401
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,080
not to mention Zhen Yu,

402
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,140
you'll

403
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,880
have a 70% chance

404
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,380
to behead even me.

405
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,450
It's not that easy

406
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,060
for a human to defeat a demon.

407
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,120
But remember your feelings and moves just now

408
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,080
and get the knack of it.

409
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,150
As long as you practice hard,

410
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,170
and with the power of the Contemplation Stone,

411
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,090
one day,

412
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,700
even if you are to fight against the Demon King,

413
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,970
you'll still have a chance to win.

414

I'll take you home.

431
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,210
Okay.

432
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,950
Shuo.

433
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,510
Shuo.

434
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,240
It's beautiful!

435
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,530
Look!

♫Across thousands of miles♫

437

Master?

Master?

440
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,450
Master!

441
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,630
Where is this?

442
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,860
Why does it look familiar?

443
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,960
Xi?

444
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,980
Xi.

445
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,510
Why didn't you go home yet?

446
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,650
Let me send you home.

447
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,310
Otherwise, Uncle Bai will be worried.

448
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,840
Stop kneading.

449
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,380
Your hands are red from the cold.

450
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,730
Today is mother's death anniversary.

451
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,330
Father has locked himself in his room.

452
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,460
I want to make steamed buns with Mother's recipe

453
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,420
for Father and Shuo,

454
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,220
so they can be happier.

455
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,400
Xi.

456
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,580
What about you?

457
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,070
You must be sad

458
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,280
about your mother passing away too.

459
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,160
Let me help you.

460
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,750
In the future,

461
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,970
don't keep things to yourself.

462
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,590
Don't hurt yourself.

463
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,230
I believe Uncle Bai and Shuo

464
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,680
want to see you be truly happy.

465
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,910
True happiness.

466
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,120
Am I still qualified

467
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,390
to have that in my life?

468
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,370
You're awake.

469
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,000
Drink the medicine while it's hot.

470
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,570
Do you remember where this is?

471
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,670
No.

472
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,880
Why did you forcefully

473
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,390
take me away from the Cold Spring Palace?

474
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,100
No one willingly stays in hell.

475
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,910
You had no choice before.

476
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,030
Now,

477
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,860
as long as you have enough courage

478
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,050
to believe in yourself and me,

479
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,170
you have a choice.

480
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,610
I'm sorry.

481
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,880
I told you I wouldn't let you get hurt.

482
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,920
I failed to protect you.

483
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,350
You can punish me as you want when you wake up.

484
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,070
Wake up, Bai Shuo.

485
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,280
Master.

486
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,200
I failed to protect Bai Shuo.

487
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,580
She managed to

488
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,810
refine the contemplation power and spiritual power so quickly.

489
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,270
Tian Huo?

490
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,700
Why are you here?

491
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,210
Where is Fan Yue?

492
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,870
Master had something to deal with.

493
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,020
He ordered me to be your guardian.

494
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
He wouldn't leave me easily.

495
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,300
Did something happen?

496
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,100
The only one who can make Fan Yue worried

497
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,610
is Chen Ye.

498
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,480
Did he go to Cold Spring Palace?

499
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,300
Tian Huo,

500
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,440
tell me!

501
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,660
Zhen Yu was the mastermind

502
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,440
behind the Tiger Clan killing the Bai Ze Clan.

503
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,220
Chen Ye went to take revenge on Zhen Yu

504
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,630
and was caught by him.

505
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,170
Bai Shuo!

506
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,470
Move!

507
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,090
I have no time to argue with you.

508
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,800
Master must have his own plan.

509
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,190
Bai Shuo.

510
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,510
Tian Huo.

511
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,900
You have your promise to uphold.

512
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,090
I have a loved one to save.

513
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,440
I must go.

514
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,110
Bai Shuo! Bai Shuo!

515
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,360
Open the barrier!

516
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,540
I didn't fulfill your request.

517
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,980
Please punish me.

518
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,800
Her spiritual power is stronger than yours.

519
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,450
You couldn't stop her.

520
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,540
She trapped you in the cave

521
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,380
because she didn't want me to punish you.

522
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,460
Besides, I should be blamed,

523
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,590
instead of you.

524
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,960
If Bai Shuo hadn't given me the medicine in advance,

525
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,950
you probably wouldn't have

526
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,860
recovered so quickly from losing a star this time.

527
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:48,940
Medicine?

528
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,020
When did she give it to you?

529
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,680
When you went to find the Old Turtle

530
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,900
and asked why Bai Shuo had a nosebleed,

531
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,440
you quarreled with her

532
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,340
and broke her tortoise shell.

533
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,830
Your life is yours.

534
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,790
My life is mine.

535
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,490
Why should they be bound?

536
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,780
After that, she came to my room to look for me.

537
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,460
This is the medicine I made these days

538
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,090
after changing the formula.

539
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,480
I don’t know if it’s useful on the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal.

540
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,970
If he doesn’t appreciate it,

541
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,350
give it to other wounded demons in Bright Moon Palace.

542
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,520
Master...

543
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,620
Master must have his reasons for saying that.

544
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,230
He has his own reasons for everything.

545
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,690
If he doesn't make it clear,

546
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,760
how would I know what he meant?

547
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,270
But you still cultivated the pill.

548
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,910
You say you're unhappy,

549
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,790
but you still care about him

550
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,580
and the demons of Bright Moon Palace.

551
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,960
She always says

552
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,110
I risk my life to save her.

553
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,920
But she also

554
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
risks her life to save me.

555
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,720
Her spiritual power is not as strong as yours,

556
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,430
but she has four Contemplations of the Contemplation Stone

557
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,280
and Bai Ze's spiritual power.

558
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,180
Master, don’t worry too much.

559
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,810
Master.

560
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,980
You just recovered too.

561
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,110
Go and rest.

562
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,890
I'll call you when she wakes up.

563
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,850
Tian Huo.

564
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,550
[Qi Feng]

565
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,940
Qi Feng never forgot who he was.

566
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,200
Otherwise, he wouldn't have risked his life

567
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,350
to take revenge on Zhen Yu.

568
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,860
It’s hard to explain the love and hate,

569
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,990
and right and wrong from these years.

570
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,370
Let Cang Shan's hatred

571
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,620
and Qi Feng's death

572
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,240
scatter like the smoke.

573
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,550
Master, you lost your good friends

574
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,420
Cang Shan and Qi Feng one after another.

575
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,410
You're the one in the most pain.

576
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,920
I won't make things more difficult for you.

577
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,240
Take care of Shuo here.

578
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,390
[Qi Feng]

579
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,050
I'll send Qi Feng

580
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,600
back to the clan.

581
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,780
This time,

582
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,350
I invited you all here

583
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,540
to ask all Sect Leaders to lead your disciples

584
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,780
and join Lanling

585
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,850
to unite the power of the 72 Eternal Sects

586
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,070
and destroy Cold Spring Palace.

587
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,490
Sect Leader Jin Yao,

588
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,020
keeping peace is the obligation of the Eternals,

589
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,280
but Zhen Yu's demonic power is unfathomable.

590
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,150
[Xi Yun, Eternal Race, Yunxiao Sect Leader]

591
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,250
Many disciples of ours

592
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,180
have been killed by Cold Spring Palace these years.

593
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,680
Lanling suddenly summoned all Eternal Sects

594
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,180
to attack Cold Spring Palace.

595
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,820
Isn't this too impulsive?

596
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,260
I understand your worries.

597
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,240
Correct.

598
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,680
[Wu Ya, Eternal Race, Kunlun Sect Leader]

599
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,070
If the 72 Sects attack Cold Spring Palace together,

600
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,860
it'll be a declaration of war between the Eternal and Demon Races.

601
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,320
This is a serious matter.

602
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,680
I'm afraid the innocent Human Race will be implicated.

603
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,910
Sect Leader,

604
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:10,090
you have to give me a reason.

605
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,120
-Yes.
-He's right.

606
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,820
I found that

607
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,030
Zhen Yu may be related to the Hidden Race.

608
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,930
Hidden Race?

609
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,160
Impossible.

610
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,760
The Hidden Race was destroyed 60,000 years ago.

611
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,880
Sect Leader Jin Yao,

612
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,300
where did you get the information that Zhen Yu

613
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,810
has something to do with the Hidden Race?

614
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,360
Sect Leader Xi Yun, what do you mean?

615
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,180
Are you

616
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,040
suspecting

617
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,990
that Lanling is lying?

618
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,160
No,

619
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,420
but this is a serious matter.

620
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,480
If Zhen Yu really is related to the Hidden Race,

621
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,990
we should be more careful

622
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,140
about attacking him.

623
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,280
If the Eternals

624
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,620
always think too much,

625
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,110
how can we cultivate

626
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,410
or protect the world?

627
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,840
You!

628
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,150
I'm talking about him.

629
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,110
This is not the time to argue.

630
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,910
Before, we couldn't figure out

631
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,000
the true strength of Cold Spring Palace,

632
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,460
so we didn't dare to go to attack brashly.

633
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,020
If we don’t take advantage of how

634
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,010
Bright Moon Palace severely damaged Cold Spring Palace

635
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,590
to take it down,

636
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,620
I'm afraid there will be no chance in the future.

637
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:18,220
Fan Yue is stronger than Zhen Yu,

638
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,090
but

639
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:22,310
the mechanisms and demonic abilities of Cold Spring Palace

640
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,340
are not to be underestimated.

641
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,680
Bright Moon Palace seriously hurting Cold Spring Palace

642
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,490
is just hearsay.

643
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,850
Did anyone here

644
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,570
see it with their own eyes?

645
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,990
Yeah.

646
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,170
What if this is a conspiracy

647
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,790
of Bright Moon Palace and Cold Spring Palace

648
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,800
to lure us Eternals in

649
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,940
and then

650
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,060
catch us all in one go?

651
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,970
That's right.

652
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,820
Sect Leader Wu Ya is right.

653
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,090
How can we act brashly

654
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,530
just because of

655
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,640
some rumors?

656
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,730
Yes. What if it's a trap?

657
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,430
This is indeed strange.

658
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,970
We should not act rashly.

659
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,810
That's right.

660
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,860
We need a long-term plan.

661
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
Sect Leader Jin Yao said

662
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,350
the Cold Spring Palace was severely hurt by Bright Moon Palace.

663
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,420
I have a question.

664
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,570
Where is

665
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,850
Zhen Yu now?

666
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,390
Zhen Yu has escaped from the Cold Spring Palace

667
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,820
and disappeared.

668
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,570
That means

669
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,530
he may return at any time.

670
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,350
So everything is unknown.

671
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,970
In my opinion,

672
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,140
we should stay put

673
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,420
before we find Zhen Yu.

674
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,760
Yes, let's plan for the long-term.

675
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,160
Yes.

676
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,070
Stay put.

677
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,610
Stay put.

678
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,000
You're awake.

679
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,540
Where is Fan Yue?

680
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,540
You're just like Master.

681
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,520
You look for each other as soon as you open your eyes.

682
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,970
He must be badly injured too.

683
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,360
He's still in a coma.

684
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,610
Did he lose a star?

685
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,240
I'll go check on him.

686
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,090
He's fine after taking your medicine.

687
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,080
But...

688
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,960
Qi Feng is dead.

689
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,320
He's sad.

690
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,900
He's in the secret room now,

691
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,290
reuniting Qi Feng with the other clansmen.

692
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,469
Don't worry.

693
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,940
By the way,

694
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,020
I need to go to the Cold Spring Palace again.

695
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,420
Xi might still be there.

696
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,040
Bai Xi is not in the Cold Spring Palace.

697
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,199
When you were still unconscious,

698
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,429
I already went to search for her.

699
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,840
But I saw her in Qi Feng's

700
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,000
sea of consciousness.

701
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,000
What you saw was from many years ago.

702
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,500
After so many years,

703
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,659
many unexpected things will happen.

704
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,000
Besides,

705
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,980
the Cold Spring Palace was severely damaged.

706
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,639
The members escaped and scattered.

707
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,340
If your sister was in Cold Spring Palace,

708
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,960
she probably escaped.

709
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,210
Don’t worry.

710
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,030
I’ve sent spies from Bright Moon Palace

711
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,739
to keep searching for her.

712
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,510
Thank you, Tian Huo.

713
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,280
We don't say thanks in Bright Moon Palace.

714
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,670
Sect Leader,

715
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,110
why didn’t you tell them

716
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,630
we asked Chong Zhao to go undercover to Cold Spring?

717
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,360
Chong Zhao risked his life

718
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,680
to get this information.

719
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,330
As you can see,

720
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,840
they don’t even believe me anymore.

721
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,090
How could they believe

722
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,470
the message Chong Zhao sent back?

723
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,240
The Eternals are in chaos now.

724
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,610
Once they find out

725
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,870
Chong Zhao used to work for Zhen Yu,

726
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,010
he won't be accepted by the Eternals

727
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,390
when he returns to the Eternal Race.

728
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,750
Besides...

729
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,620
Sect Leader,

730
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,900
please go ahead.

731
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,210
In Chong Zhao’s letter,

732
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,320
he said he was forced to practice

733
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,610
the magic of combining the power of eternals and demons.

734
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,210
This kind of sorcery can only be integrated

735
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,760
with hidden power.

736
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,060
Sect Leader, you mean Chong Zhao

737
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,380
not only has demon power, but also hidden power?

738
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,000
The Hidden Race and hidden power are not tolerated by eternals and demons.

739
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,240
If other sects know that Chong Zhao has hidden power,

740
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,010
he might lose his life.

741
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,850
This child risked his life

742
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,990
and experienced humiliation for Lanling.

743
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,830
As his teachers and seniors,

744
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,560
how can we push him into a desperate situation again?

745
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,820
This reptile is just one word:

746
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,140
vicious!

747
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:19,590
I will seek justice for Chong Zhao.

748
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,490
But now,

749
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,430
I have to go find Chong Zhao

750
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,390
and see how he is now.

751
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,300
Sect Leader,

752
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,040
we watched Chong Zhao grow up.

753
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,300
We're going too!

754
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,360
No, the situation is still unclear.

755
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,200
You all guard Lanling.

756
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
I will protect Chong Zhao.

757
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,210
Remember,

758
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,350
you must guard Lanling.

759
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,610
We won't let you down.

760
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,020
[Qi Feng]

761
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,260
[Qi Feng]

762
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:19,580
[Yue, I'm sorry.]

763
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,650
♫Don't linger, don't regret♫

764
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,040
♫The last moonlight♫

765
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,760
♫The water from my hometown flows gently♫

766
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,690
♫Sending me to the distant place♫

767
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,430
Yue.

768
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,460
♫In this life, at this time♫

769
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,240
I'm sorry.

770
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,000
♫I dare not look back♫

771
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,240
If none of this had happened,

772
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,150
♫Is there the same moonlight♫

773
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,480
would we still be best friends?

774
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,230
♫On your path?♫

775
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,180
♫I'm walking on a never-ending long road♫

776
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:59,060
♫In the vast world, how can I get there?♫

777
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,610
♫In the chaotic night wind, the melody stopped♫

778
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,090
♫The moonlight is gentle♫

779
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:07,620
♫All the feelings turned into nothing but a dream♫

780
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,460
♫Reminiscing about the good old days♫

781
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,230
♫Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lost♫

782
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,900
♫Forget all about the past and leave it behind♫

783
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,960
♫Time after time♫

784
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,580
♫Oh, melancholy♫

785
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,690
Tian Huo told me

786
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,410
you come here when you're unhappy.

787
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,950
Cang Shan is gone.

788
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,370
Qi Feng is gone too.

789
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,590
You suddenly have the new identity

790
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,220
of a Demon Lord's Divine Mantle now.

791
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,910
So many things have happened.

792
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,210
If I were you,

793
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,850
I'd feel troubled too.

794
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,410
I know you're used to being stubborn.

795
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,560
But in front of me,

796
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,260
you don't have to hide yourself.

797
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,230
You said

798
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,600
we are family.

799
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,930
When I built the palace and called myself the king of the Polar Region,

800
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,020
I swore

801
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,740
to protect everyone around me

802
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,830
and prevent the pain of Bai Ze from happening again.

803
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,270
But in the end, I let Cang Shan and Qi Feng

804
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,450
leave me.

805
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,660
And you were hurt too.

806
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,620
Fan Yue,

807
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,420
you are also of flesh and blood.

808
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,690
You also bleed, get hurt,

809
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,440
and get sad.

810
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,440
You are no different from

811
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,070
the people you want to protect.

812
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,630
Your strength is not

813
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,550
the reason to blame yourself.

814
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,820
You're the best at consoling me.

815
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,690
Thank you, Shuo.

816
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,830
It's not just consolation,

817
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,340
but also a reminder.

818
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,330
You only have one star left.

819
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,390
Don't act tough when you're in trouble.

820
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,490
Understand?

821
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,720
For you,

822
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,210
I'll continue to live well.

823
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,850
I promise you.

824
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,900
♫The person standing far away♫

825
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,840
♫Don't be afraid♫

826
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:49,690
♫The stars will guide you to me♫

827
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,500
Turns out the Demon Race has fireflies too.

828
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:57,170
♫Walk towards me♫

829
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,130
Autumn breeze blows grass

830
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,550
and fireflies fly at night.

831
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,290
This should be the last batch of fireflies this year.

832
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,970
♫My heart feels so...♫

833
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,000
♫It's pounding as I wait for you♫

834
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,490
Shuo.

835
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:11,350
Actually, I think you resemble this firefly.

836
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:14,250
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

837
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,790
The dim glow in the night

838
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,580
is the hope that dispels the darkness and clouds.

839
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,000
♫You are my distant call♫

840
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,660
You mean

841
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,410
I'm your hope

842
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,620
and your light?

843
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:26,120
♫You are my first and last♫

844
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:32,740
♫My heart is trembling for you♫

845
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,150
You've always been.

846
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,640
I heard that the Divine Race is immortal.

847
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,020
♫In this moment where we embrace each other♫

848
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,870
Maybe you will be young forever.

849
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,950
Since I'm so important,

850
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,480
♫Let's never let go♫

851
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,800
when I get old,

852
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,900
you have to stay with me

853
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,550
and take care of me.

854
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,890
Don't die first.

855
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,240
Okay.

856
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,900
In this life

857
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,740
and every life,

858
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,190
I will never leave you.

859
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,340
Your words

860
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,600
sound like an oath.

861
00:41:58,770 --> 00:41:59,920
It is an oath.

862
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:04,810
♫We're destined to be together forever from the first sight♫

863
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,400
♫Goodbye, loneliness♫

864
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,460
♫The one who was slightly late♫

865
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:19,830
♫You came towards me, closer and closer♫

866
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,600
Then let me give you one too, okay?

867
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,650
May I be like the stars

868
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,010
and you like the moon.

869
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,100
As long as the world remains,

870
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:28,070
♫You enriched my life♫

871
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,890
the stars and moon remain,

872
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,020
so shall we.

873
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,810
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

874
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,150
♫You are the light I yearn for♫

875
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:48,330
♫You are my determined way home♫

876
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:54,320
♫Let this moment stay forever♫

877
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:58,560
♫I'm hugging you in the crowd♫

878
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,580
♫Let's never let go♫

879
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:06,980
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

880
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:13,210
♫You are the blueprint of my life♫

881
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,130
♫The morning breeze and morning dew♫

882
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:22,890
♫Let the tears celebrate♫

883
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,300
♫We embrace each other in the sky♫

884

♫Let's never let go♫
