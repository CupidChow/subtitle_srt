00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,990
[Episode 18]

19
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Qi?

20
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,130
Qi!

21
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,650
Qi!

22
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,020
Since you miss him so much,

23
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,930
why don't you let him out from under the tree?

24
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,870
Since when did you, the Master of Bright Moon,

25
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,450
start to play tricks like this?

26
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,780
I'm here only to verify one thing.

27
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,400
Last night, I sensed some spiritual presence

28
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,880
within this Emotion Tree.

29
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,800
After we broke loose from the Emotion Tree,

30
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,190
that spiritual presence took shape and attacked me and Bai Shuo.

31
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,570
Its demon aura

32
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,660
is pretty similar to that of Qi, the person

33
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,600
I transformed into

34
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,630
in Rong Xian's realm of resentment,

35
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,120
I was not sure, actually.

36
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,829
But judging from your expression, Master Chang,

37
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,030
I guess

38
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,070
the person buried under the tree

39
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,100
is your lover,

40
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,910
Qi. Am I right?

41
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,070
Can't believe he showed up...

42
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,640
That's right.

43
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,940
We've been worlds apart for 800 years—

44
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,970
one living, one gone.

45
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,600
Now, few people

46
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,280
in this world know that

47
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,590
we were once in love.

48
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,990
Didn't expect

49
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,010
you to know it too, Master Fan.

50
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,200
It was just a coincidence.

51
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,730
Master Fan, you once played Qi.

52
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,560
But Qi was not as lucky as you

53
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,100
to have his beloved one

54
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,090
by his side

55
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,230
and protect her forever.

56
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,630
You came to ask for the Weak Water Stone

57
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,450
for Ms. Bai, right?

58
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,390
You're smart, Master Chang.

59
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,980
Nope,

60
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,190
I've just seen what people in love look like.

61
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,060
I'm familiar with the way

62
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,820
you look at Ms. Bai.

63
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,450
But what a pity...

64
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,350
What?

65
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,860
What on earth happened back then

66
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,390
that left Qi buried deep under the tree?

67
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,630
The Emotion Tree withered?

68
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,630
Why?

69
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,060
Ms. Bai, you know what?

70
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,960
Under the root of the Emotion Tree

71
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,610
once buried the Weak Water Stone.

72
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,740
The Weak Water Stone

73
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,140
is a treasure

74
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,440
forged by the Fox Clan ancestors with the power of true love.

75
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,590
Wherever it is,

76
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,500
the spiritual power abounds like an endless flow.

77
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,380
After that battle 1,000 years ago,

78
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,770
the Fox Clan started to fall into decline.

79
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,080
My brother and I,

80
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,800
along with our Master, had been struggling

81
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,190
for years

82
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,960
until we finally got a chance to bring the Fox Clan back to prosperity.

83
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,230
But 800 years ago,

84
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,780
the Weak Water Stone suddenly went missing.

85
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,640
When did that happen?

86
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,890
Guess it was last night.

87
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,770
Early this morning,

88
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,940
I brought the young foxes here

89
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,170
and saw all the leaves of the Emotion Tree scattered on the ground.

90
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,540
I checked out with my spiritual power

91
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,810
[Qi, Demon Race, Fox Attendant]

92
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,909
and found nothing

93
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,880
down there.

94
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,250
Then what are we waiting for?

95
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,210
Let's shut down the mountain entrance

96
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,409
and block all access!

97
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,670
No matter who stole it,

98
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,700
we must try to find the Weak Water Stone by all means!

99
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,530
No.

100
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,820
All the races and clans around

101
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,530
are keeping an eye on the Jingyou Mountain, ready to move.

102
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,140
A high-profile search

103
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,880
will alert others to the Emotion Tree's anomaly,

104
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,330
and they'll surely take the chance to cause trouble.

105
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,460
Our Fox Clan went through a lot and just got back to our feet.

106
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,750
We can't stand another blow.

107
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,780
But if we just

108
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,450
see the Emotion Tree wither without doing anything,

109
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,350
the descendants of our clan will not be able to grow emotional veins

110
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,810
and cultivate curses.

111
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,990
At this rate,

112
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,690
the Jingyou Mountain will still be in trouble.

113
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,080
So none of them is feasible?

114
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,410
What on earth should we do?

115
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,610
Fill it with my life.

116
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,400
What do you mean?

117
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,990
The Weak Water Stone just provided nutrients of spiritual power.

118
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,020
As long as we keep offering the Emotion Tree spiritual power,

119
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,310
it will stop withering.

120
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,290
Now in the Fox Clan, I'm the one with the greatest spiritual power.

121
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,490
With the Weak Water Stone gone,

122
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,930
I'll support it with my life.

123
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,730
Wu,

124
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,900
stop talking nonsense.

125
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,900
You're the Master of Jingyou Mountain.

126
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,510
Just because I'm the Master,

127
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,659
I must solve this case.

128
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,400
As you can see,

129
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,190
those clan members

130
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,790
just won't let go of what my sister did back then

131
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,980
as if the one who wiped out their families was not Rong Xian,

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,610
but my sister.

133
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,640
But you still can't risk your life out of rage.

134
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,020
It's not out of rage.

135
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,280
I'm just tired.

136
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,780
Qi,

137
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,200
to them,

138
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,420
all the toil and hard work we've done for the Fox Clan over the years

139
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,160
is no more than

140
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,230
the atonement we're supposed to make.

141
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,930
I've had enough of them badmouthing me behind my back

142
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,750
and me having to endure their attitudes.

143
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,860
Let me pay with my life,

144
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,450
and then they'll know that

145
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,270
my sister never owed them anything.

146
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,920
What Rong Xian did back then

147
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,690
was a tragedy.

148
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,100
It's totally reasonable for the Fox Clan

149
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,850
to hate Rong Xian.

150
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,700
But why did they blame Ling Long

151
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,690
and even take it out on you?

152
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,330
Don't you know that

153
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,010
the malice in our hearts is the most poisonous thing in the world?

154
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,890
When Ling Long was still the Saintess,

155
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,850
those people were all fawning

156
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,260
and groveling.

157
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,270
But once everything fell,

158
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,120
my sister became the sinner condemned by everyone.

159
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,450
Ling Long fell in love with Rong Xian.

160
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,090
It was nothing wrong for her to die for true love.

161
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,909
Were it not for the feud between the Fox Clan and Kunlun,

162
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,040
maybe things wouldn't have ended up like that.

163
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,490
Her love became the evidence of stigma in everyone's eyes,

164
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,020
and she suffered endless accusations.

165
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,870
The hatred of the Fox Clan

166
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,520
gave them a reason to direct all their hatred at me.

167
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,910
I should have died

168
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,650
for relief.

169
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,820
But unfortunately,

170
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,400
Qi loved me.

171
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,750
Because of this love,

172
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,420
he was willing to sacrifice his life

173
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,890
to save me.

174
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,350

My biggest regret

178
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,870
is not being able

179

00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,680
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

190
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,510
♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

191
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,860
♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

192
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,780
No!

193
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,680
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

194
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,700
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

195
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,990
Qi...

196
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,990
♫The daylight burns through, and the stars shine bright♫

197
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,850
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

198
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,040
Qi...

199
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,080
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

200
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,350
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

201
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,150
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

202
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,810
♫To protect the world for eternity♫

203
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,330
After Qi died,

204
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,820
the Master was depressed for a really long time.

205
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,570
With my brother gone,

206
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,060
I had to work harder to take care of the Fox Clan

207
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,240
so that his life wouldn't be sacrificed for nothing.

208
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,440
With the nutrients,

209
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,310
the Emotion Tree was back to being lush and thriving.

210
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,450
Just like that,

211
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,130
hundreds of years flew by.

212
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,190
We thought everything would be fine.

213
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,820
But my brother's spiritual power

214
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,690
will be exhausted one day.

215
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,760
That's why

216
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,920
the Emotion Tree began to swallow people

217
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,720
to continue to obtain spiritual power?

218
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,020
At first,

219
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,440
we didn't notice anything unusual.

220
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,150
Not until a few outsiders came

221
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,620
and got swallowed when they

222
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,920
passed by the Emotion Tree

223
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,750
did it occur to the Master.

224
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,380
Qi's body is buried under the Emotion Tree.

225
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,040
Qi was loyal to the Fox Clan and the Master

226
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,340
all his life.

227
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,030
So our clan members are safe.

228
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,790
But outsiders are different.

229
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,800
If someone gets close to the Emotion Tree,

230
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,310
they will be enchanted by the desire for love

231
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,240
and see the people and things they love

232
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,550
in their illusions,

233
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,820
willing to get killed.

234
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,780
You mean

235
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,190
Qi's the one who's hurting people?

236
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,360
The Emotion Tree ending up as such an evil thing

237
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,680
was definitely not my brother's intention.

238
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,470
There must be something fishy behind this.

239
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,420
Ms. Bai,

240
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,110
you once saw my brother in the illusion.

241
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,720
so you should know

242
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,740
how righteous and kind he was.

243
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,960
We grew up together.

244
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,220
I can't summarize everything I know about him in just a few words.

245
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,420
Others may not understand,

246
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,210
but, Ms. Bai,

247
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,890
I believe you can feel it.

248
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,030
I trust Qi.

249
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,530
But now,

250
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,170
it's also true that

251
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,480
the Emotion Tree swallows people.

252
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,380
So,

253
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,060
Ms. Bai, I hope you can get to the bottom of this case.

254
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,140
Since you could make Rong Xian's obsession from 1,000 years ago disappear,

255
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,980
then you can definitely dispel

256
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,160
my brother's lingering soul.

257
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,670
I'll do whatever it takes to repay you, Ms. Bai.

258
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,960
Anything you ask for.

259
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,850
No way.

260
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,850
After Qi sacrificed his life to the Emotion Tree,

261
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,820
his soul has never appeared.

262
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,640
His sudden appearance last night

263
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,530
must have something to do with Ms. Bai's blood.

264
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,960
It must be the power of the Contemplation Stone!

265
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,030
It was a miracle!

266
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,000
Fan Yue,

267
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,830
I'm not fighting for that stone.

268
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,230
Neither do I want to be your enemy.

269
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,700
I really just want to see Qi once again.

270
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,570
I promise

271
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,670
I won't hurt Ms. Bai.

272
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,530
I just need a little bit of her blood.

273
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,640
As I said before,

274
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,750
no way.

275
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,810
You promised to give me the Weak Water Stone in three days,

276
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,790
yet you failed me.

277
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,880
Since you and Qi were innocent,

278
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,970
I didn't hold you accountable.

279
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,430
But don't go too far.

280
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,700
But as sensible as you are, Master Fan,

281
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,880
can't you have any mercy on the two of us?

282
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,270
The illusion Rong Xian left

283
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,690
means the fate between you and us.

284
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,510
I beg you.

285
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,010
I'll help you.

286
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,110
Ms. Bai.

287
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,210
Bai Shuo, do you have to go against me?

288
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,930
You can't even take care of yourself right now.

289
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,110
How can you help others?

290
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,530
I know what I'm saying.

291
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,670
And I'm fully aware of what I'm doing.

292
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,000
Master Chang was right.

293
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,330
You and I should know Qi best.

294
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,590
He won't hurt anyone.

295
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,560
Do you remember Ling Long's last words?

296
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,100
She wanted Wu to stay away from the fight between Eternals and demons,

297
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,300
take care of herself,

298
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,330
and live a free and peaceful life.

299
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,450
But what does it have to do with you?

300
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,210
This is Ling Long's wish.

301
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,590
But

302
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,360
for the Fox Clan,

303
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,830
Wu gave up freedom

304
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,630
and chose responsibility.

305
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,420
If I can't help Wu this time,

306
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,890
I'll feel guilty.

307
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,600
You didn't kill those foxes.

308
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,360
And Qi's death was also not your fault.

309
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,300
Why would you feel guilty?

310
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,410
But I can do her a favor now.

311
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,030
Do you want me to turn a blind eye?

312
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,440
But you're no more than a human!

313
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,510
Yeah, a human who got the Contemplation Stone by luck.

314
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,030
Master Chang,

315
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,810
I learned about you from Ling Long.

316
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,930
I also felt the warmth Ling Long gave me by holding my hand

317
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,650
and taking care of me as her little sister.

318
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,870
You may not know that

319
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,020
I used to have an elder sister too.

320
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,490
She's not with me now.

321
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,150
I believe

322
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,560
if Ling Long were still alive,

323
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,520
if my sister were still with me,

324
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,910
they would never see their sisters

325
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,880
suffer the agony of being separated

326
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,820
from their beloved ones

327
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,670
without doing anything.

328
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,390
The tragedy from a thousand years ago should have ended long ago.

329
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,900
I'm willing to help you.

330
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,570
Ms. Bai...

331
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,480
Excuse me, Master Chang.

332
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,860
We need to talk alone.

333
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,430
Come out.

334
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,290
How much longer are you going to hide from me?

335
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,340
N-No, I'm not hiding.

336
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,340
Fine.

337
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,660
Bai Shuo entrusted you with a gift from Chang Mei

338
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,630
to me.

339
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,630
Where is it?

340
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,710
I didn't see it.

341
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,880
What a man...

342
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,120
You're really bad at lying.

343
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,060
Are you really going to avoid me

344
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,590
and never talk to me again?

345
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,960
If you don't like Mu Jiu,

346
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,910
why are you going to marry him?

347
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,550
Even if it's fake,

348
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,200
it's going way too far.

349
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,870
I like him...

350
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,090
I like him...

351
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,020
But it's just a tiny bit of love

352
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,880
that's just beginning to sprout.

353
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,190
It's too subtle to be caught even by myself.

354
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,600
But when you fought him,

355
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,590
I felt nervous

356
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,340
and worried.

357
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,510
Only then did I realize

358
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,410
that I actually liked him.

359
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,000
You like him.

360
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,910
Then what about me?

361
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,020
What about the Master?

362
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,020
We are still the same as we were.

363
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,470
We're still friends.

364
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,910
♫In the chaotic night wind, the melody stopped♫

365
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,090
The world is not just about the romantic love between men and women.

366
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,390
♫The moonlight is gentle♫

367
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,390
The bond between you, the Master, and me

368
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,790
♫All the feelings turned into nothing but a dream♫

369
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,770
is friendship.

370
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,760
♫Reminiscing about the good old days♫

371
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,200
Cang Shan,

372
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,880
it's no more than friendship.

373
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,190
♫Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lost♫

374
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,200
♫Forget all about the past and leave it behind♫

375
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,020
Now,

376
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,260
♫Time after time♫

377
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,120
can you give me that wedding dress?

378
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,820
♫Oh, melancholy♫

379
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,580
No need to say anything.

380
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,470
I will never

381
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,760
say yes to this matter.

382
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,740
Do you remember why I wanted to become a god

383
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,400
when we were back in Ning'an City?

384
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,420
When I was still a kid,

385
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,520
a great immortal saved me and my sister.

386
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,150
We survived all thanks to him.

387
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,230
He said a deity's lifespan is really long,

388
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,910
and he wouldn't stick around to wait for me to repay him.

389
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,910
So I wanted to become a god

390
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,910
and fulfill my promise.

391
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,950
Now, you're going to sacrifice your life

392
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,650
before you fulfill it.

393
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,040
Looks like you've already forgotten

394
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,220
about your benefactor's words, huh?

395
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,940
I know you're worried about me.

396
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,320
The Weak Water Stone is missing.

397
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,960
I don't know how long

398
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,160
the Contemplation Stone can last in my body.

399
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,480
You ignored your own safety

400
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,890
and tried to save me first.

401
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,600
Fan Yue,

402
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,310
I'm really grateful.

403
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,329
Thank you.

404
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,690
But I also have something I want to do.

405
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,849
Chang Mei

406
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,079
is an old sly fox who has lived for 1000 years.

407
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,880
You don't know

408
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,859
if she told the truth today.

409
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,430
Qi's death

410
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,630
is just a story pieced from her words.

411
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,000
Don't you think

412
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,520
things are fishy and suspicious about it?

413
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,220
Fine.

414
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,160
What she is hiding has nothing to do with me.

415
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,720
I don't want to meddle in the Fox Clan's crisis.

416
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,030
Taking a few drops of your blood

417
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,570
doesn't sound like a big deal.

418
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,360
But what if she's up to something else?

419
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,690
I know.

420
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,580
But I also want to find out the secret behind the Emotion Tree.

421
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,290
If I shrink from taking any risk

422
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,550
after knowing

423
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,910
my days are numbered

424
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,310
just to survive,

425
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,440
it'll not only let down

426
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,630
my benefactor but also myself.

427
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,160
You should know

428
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,240
how it feels.

429
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,480
The Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal

430
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,330
has been on you for quite a while.

431
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,130
♫When you engrave your love into my heart♫

432
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,990
Did those life-and-death crises

433
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,630
♫When my star falls only for you♫

434
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,530
ever freak you out?

435
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,270
That's because...

436
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,440
Because you're strong.

437
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,140
♫When the heavens fall♫

438
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,240
You have full confidence in yourself.

439
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,630
♫I can still connect with you through the waning moon♫

440
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,640
But no one is born strong.

441
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,460
Not to mention that I'm a human.

442
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,460
If I don't train myself

443
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,850
♫When my pain blurs my eyes♫

444
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,500
and overcome every difficulty,

445
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:16,310
♫Out of the countless stars, I see only you♫

446
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,910
I will never become stronger.

447
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,580
So,

448
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:25,800
♫As you turn into a falling star and crash into my heart♫

449
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,200
you know Chang Mei's probably lying,

450
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,040
yet you still want to get yourself involved?

451
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:22,960
Yes.

452
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,050
Besides,

453
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,910
I have you with me.

454
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,860
Am I right?

455
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,760
Master,

456
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,040
we deceived Ms. Bai.

457
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,270
If the Master of Bright Moon finds out,

458
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,160
he won't let it go, I'm afraid.

459
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,830
I didn't lie to her.

460
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,300
Qi did sacrifice his life to the Emotion Tree.

461
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,530
The feelings between Qi and me

462
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,150
were also real.

463
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,790
But the Weak Water Stone wasn't lost.

464
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,350
It's right in...

465
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,070
Shut up!

466
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,350
When my brother died,

467
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,340
he asked me to protect you, Master.

468
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,310
All these years,

469
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,790
in my heart,

470
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,910
you are like my sister,

471
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,740
my sister-in-law.

472
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,490
I know

473
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,690
everything you've done

474
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,120
is for the Fox Clan.

475
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,570
But Qi is dead!

476
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,090
The one inside the Emotion Tree now is an evil monster!

477
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,010
So what?

478
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,960
Ms. Bai's blood has got the aura of the Contemplation Stone.

479
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,270
If we use her blood to nourish it,

480
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
that evil monster might grow stronger!

481
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,950
If he is no longer Qi,

482
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,750
letting him out

483
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,110
will put the entire Fox Clan in danger!

484
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,810
What if my original purpose

485
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,680
was never to let Qi out?

486
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,040
Last time when the Emotion Tree was dying,

487
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,830
Qi sacrificed all his cultivation

488
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,400
to the Emotion Tree.

489
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,010
This time,

490
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,560
I once wanted to do the same thing by myself,

491
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,250
But Fan Yue came.

492
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,790
I was wondering that, with his powerful spiritual energy,

493
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,560
there could be a silver lining.

494
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,470
Now we've got a chance, right?

495
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,260
Master,

496
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,410
are you going to kill Ms. Bai?

497
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,380
Today, Fan Yue's words made me realize that

498
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,840
the Weak Water Stone

499
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,550
is no more than the Fox Clan's treasure,

500
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,470
yet the Contemplation Stone is the real divine stone.

501
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,260
If we bury Bai Shuo

502
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,580
under the Emotion Tree,

503
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,320
then the Tree

504
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,710
will thrive forever and ever.

505
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,680
Master, you...

506
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,270
This is wild and unrealistic!

507
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,820
Before we talk about whether it works,

508
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,000
even if we do it,

509
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,060
the Master of Bright Moon will never agree.

510
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,990
At this point,

511
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,820
I have no other choice.

512
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,270
Ba,

513
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,040
I have to carry this out.

514
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,990
Let go of me! Let go!

515
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,300
Am I a prisoner or a groom?

516
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,200
Let go of me!

517
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,310
What did I do

518
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,580
to deserve to be watched over like this?

519
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,500
Do you think I want to watch you?

520
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,270
It's all your Auntie's order.

521
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,180
Auntie...

522
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,370
It's Auntie again!

523
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,560
I lost my parents when I was young.

524
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,840
I thought I could lead a carefree life.

525
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,880
But, oh my God,

526
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,200
I've still got such an annoying Auntie!

527
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,840
I'm not even 20,

528
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,590
yet half of my life

529
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,000
has been spent being treated like a prisoner.

530
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,070
I think

531
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,130
I was just born into captivity,

532
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,230
unable to escape.

533
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,880
What a worthless life.

534
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,710
Gosh.

535
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,530
You should be grateful.

536
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,500
In the Fox Clan,

537
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,310
we're either family or related in some way.

538
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,160
Let's not talk about the others.

539
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,600
There are a dozen orphans

540
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,060
in your generation.

541
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,950
But only you

542
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:51,840
were picked by the Master

543
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,950
and taken in as her nephew.

544
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,540
Now,

545
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,160
you've hit the jackpot

546
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,770
and are going to succeed as the Master of Jingyou Mountain.

547
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,390
Don't you think

548
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,490
you're so lucky that everyone would envy you?

549
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,810
Succeed as the Master of Jingyou Mountain?

550
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,780
Hasn't the succession ceremony been changed into the wedding?

551
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,050
Why are you still talking about that?

552
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,510
Elder...

553
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,950
Are you

554
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,420
colluding with my Auntie to cheat me?

555
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,820
No!

556
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,320
No more wild guesses.

557
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,970
By the way,

558
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,120
I need to go to the forest

559
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,820
to find those two people from the Cold Spring Palace.

560
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,920
That's it.

561
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,750
I gotta go now.

562
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,730
See you.

563
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,670
Don't go!

564
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,490
Young Master...

565
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,670
Move it to tomorrow?

566
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,800
Why?

567
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,440
Didn't we reach an agreement?

568
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,630
Tian Huo is my good friend.

569
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,540
I shouldn't

570
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,820
miss her wedding no matter what.

571
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,300
I've promised you that I would release Qi

572
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,940
for your reunion,

573
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,300
and I will never go back on my word.

574
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
One day earlier or later, there's no big difference.

575
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,480
Ms. Bai, you should also know that

576
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,770
everyone in the clan

577
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,970
will attend their wedding tonight.

578
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,220
The Emotion Tree is really important to the Jingyou Mountain.

579
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,600
If something goes wrong and alerts the others,

580
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,110
it will inevitably cause chaos.

581
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,350
As the Master of Jingyou Mountain,

582
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,310
I've got to maintain peace within our clan.

583
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,490
Hope you can understand.

584
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,600
Does it have to be tonight?

585
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,470
Yes.

586
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,410
Alright.

587
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,310
Since you've asked for it,

588
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,890
I should respect your request.

589
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,220
By the way,

590
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,070
Master Chang,

591
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,930
when is Mu Jiu's birthday?

592
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,090
And how old is he?

593
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,930
He was born in September, and he's not over 20.

594
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,650
Why are you asking this?

595
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,940
I am of the Human Race.

596
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,810
Marriage should always take horoscopes into account.

597
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,570
I'm just curious.

598
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,550
I'm leaving.

599
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,560
Chang Mei deliberately chose today.

600
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,200
There must be a special reason.

601
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,840
What's so special about today?

602
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,990
The first day of the ninth lunar month.

603
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,160
Anything significant?

604
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,850
Chang Mei mentioned that Mu Jiu's birthday is also in the ninth lunar month.

605
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Could it be that she insists on holding the wedding today

606
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,560
because it's Mu Jiu's birthday?

607
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,600
That doesn't quite add up, though.

608
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,580
No need to overthink it.

609
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,360
I'll go with you tonight.

610
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,760
With me there,

611
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,550
nothing will go wrong.

612
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:19,840
I'll go too.

613
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,550
You stay here for the wedding.

614
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,860
Even if Tian Huo's marriage

615
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,970
is fake,

616
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,540
our Bright Moon Palace

617
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,860
should still have someone to accompany her.

618
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,490
In terms of Human Race,

619
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,090
we'd count as family from the bride's side.

620
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:32,790
How about this:

621
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,330
I'll go with Bai Shuo to the Emotion Tree,

622
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,680
and you stay with Tian Huo.

623
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,400
Why?

624
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,280
Cang Shan,

625
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,070
come with me.

626
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,250
When did you fall in love with Tian Huo?

627
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,550
You...

628
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,410
How did you...

629
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,750
How did I find it out?

630
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,700
It was on that day

631
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,390
when we talked about your age.

632
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,990
So you don't want to attend the wedding

633
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,750
because you don't want to see Tian Huo marry someone else?

634
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,170
Tian Huo has made it clear to me.

635
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,500
We are

636
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,630
just friends.

637
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,300
Bai Shuo,

638
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,110
why does Mu Jiu

639
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,770
get to be the one she likes,

640
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,590
while I'm

641
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,330
just a friend?

642
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,750
Isn't being a friend good enough?

643
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,580
I don't know.

644
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,060
I just feel uneasy

645
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,750
at the thought of

646
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,460
seeing her marry Mu Jiu.

647
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,280
You've known Tian Huo longer than I have.

648
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,800
What kind of person do you think she is?

649
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,140
She's carefree,

650
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,030
brave,

651
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,360
and also very smart.

652
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,770
She's also sensitive, pessimistic,

653
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,080
and a bit weak at times.

654
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,060
How could you say that?

655
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,680
Those aren't necessarily flaws.

656
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,170
Maybe your master

657
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,670
is just like her.

658
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,910
Tian Huo has been through so much in the past.

659
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,520
It's hard for her to trust anyone again.

660
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,640
You and Fan Yue became friends

661
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,760
only after

662
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,400
going through so many things with her.

663
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,890
Now that Tian Huo has finally managed to tear apart the knots in her heart

664
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,840
and is willing to give things a try with Mu Jiu,

665
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,740
this wedding

666
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,000
is far from simple for her.

667
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,060
But she said

668
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,500
it's just a temporary solution.

669
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,480
You

670
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,000
don't understand her.

671
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,270
Even if it's not about that,

672
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,300
I still find

673
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,160
Chang Mei's treatment of Mu Jiu

674
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,740
quite strange.

675
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,000
If Chang Mei doesn't have any ill intentions tonight,

676
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,920
then fine.

677
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,860
But if she truly has other plans,

678
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,340
we won't allow Tian Huo to marry Mu Jiu.

679
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,000
I have Fan Yue protecting me,

680
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,630
but Tian Huo will have to face the entire Fox Clan alone.

681
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,170
If you stay and help her,

682
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,670
we can rest assured.

683
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,870
So, are we going to

684
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,030
fight again tonight?

685
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,850
I hope not.

686
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,360
No matter what Chang Mei's goal is,

687
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,840
she's just a pitiful person trapped by love.

688
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,920
Maybe she has no choice for many things.

689
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,490
If it really comes to a battle,

690
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,440
no one will come out as the winner.

691
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,460
Isn't the situation with the Fox Clan from back then

692
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,110
the perfect example of this?

693
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,890
It hurts so much!

694
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,890
It hurts so much!

695
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:27,870
It hurts!

696
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,250
It hurts!

697
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:29,990
Young Master.

698
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,630
What's wrong with you?

699
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,870
Hurry up. Get me some medicine!

700
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,580
Go.

701
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,990
Hurry up, report to Master Chang.

702
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,450
Young Master.

703
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,770
Are you okay?

704
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,730
Idiot.

705
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,590
Luckily, I have a lot of stocks.

706
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,040
Huo!

707
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
You're here.

708
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,150
You scared me.

709
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,130
I thought Auntie and the others...

710
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,070
You're so beautiful.

711
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,030
It suits you so well.

712
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,330
Your hairpin looks great too.

713
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,570
Your makeup is also stunning.

714
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,390
I mean

715
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,900
you're already so beautiful.

716
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,870
Even if you wore a torn sack,

717
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,580
you'd still look like a celestial being descending to the mortal world.

718
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,390
Huo.

719
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,460
Why are you ignoring me?

720
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,080
Huo.

721
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,670
Cursed technique?

722
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,390
Have you forgotten the rules I told you?

723
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,440
Go back.

724
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,460
Auntie, I'm not leaving.

725
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,350
Let me just take a look at her.

726
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,940
Your wedding is tonight.

727
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,770
She still has a lot to prepare.

728
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,610
You can take your time to look at her once the marriage is settled.

729
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,960
She is acting strange.

730
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,510
She's been cursed.

731
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,460
Is that so?

732
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,430
You did this?

733
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,590
There's a curse on the wedding dress.

734
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,350
Do you want to lose your life?

735
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,610
She is my life.

736
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,390
If you insist on harming her today,

737
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,840
then you might as well kill me first.

738
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,710
What did you say?

739
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
I said

740
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,970
please kill me first.

741
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,270
Master Chang, we...

742
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,530
Get out!

743
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,540
Yes.

744
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,740
I raised you myself.

745
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,570
In the cold, I feared you might freeze;

746
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,530
when you were sick, I feared you might be in pain.

747
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,940
For all these years, I couldn't bear to let you suffer even the slightest bit of hardship

748
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,360
or injustice.

749
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,100
Yet in the end,

750
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,190
the life I've worked so hard to protect

751
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,590
is being used so carelessly

752
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,480
to protect an outsider.

753
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,120
Do I even matter to you as your auntie?

754
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,230
Auntie, I haven't forgotten the kindness

755
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,500
you've shown me,

756
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,320
but Huo has nothing to do with all of this.

757
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,400
She shouldn't have to bear any of this.

758
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,070
She and Fan Yue came to Jingyou Mountain

759
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,310
just to harm you!

760
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,760
All they want is the Weak Water Stone.

761
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,280
How does that translate into wanting to harm me?

762
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,980
They've never had any hostility toward the Fox Clan.

763
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:23,750
In the Outlanders' City,

764
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,680
they've protected me time and time again.

765
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,890
Auntie,

766
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,810
I'm begging you,

767
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,970
just give them the Weak Water Stone, alright?

768
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,850
Shut up!

769
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,110
I'll tell you one last time:

770
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,130
not a single word more

771
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,010
about the Weak Water Stone.

772
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,490
Ms. Bai!

773
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,020
Ms. Bai!

774
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,150
Is Master here?

775
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,900
Master.

776
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,100
I've finally found you!

777
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,760
Bad news!

778
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,450
What is it?

779
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,060
Lady Tian Huo is in trouble.

780
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,380
Lady Tian Huo

781
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,200
has been cursed with a very complicated spell.

782
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,780
We tried to break it for her,

783
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,870
but we were met with backlash.

784
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,720
Only a powerful demon with high-level mana

785
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,170
can help her.

786
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,590
Master asked you to go take a look.

787
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,880
Tian Huo got cursed?

788
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,260
Why would she be cursed?

789
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,460
Perhaps

790
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,590
it was those two people from the Cold Spring Palace in the forest who did it.

791
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,420
In any case, with the wedding approaching,

792
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,350
if we don't break the curse soon,

793
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,530
things will become troublesome.

794
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,210
Lead the way.

795
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,100
Ms. Bai.

796
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,910
It's getting late.

797
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,410
May I take you to the Emotion Tree now?

798
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,360
I'll go call Fan Yue to come along.

799
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,320
No need.

800
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,960
To release Qi,

801
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,290
only your blood is needed.

802
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,110
It doesn't matter

803
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,180
whether Master of Bright Moon

804
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,370
goes or not.

805
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:38,810
Could it be that

806
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,810
the feelings Ms. Bai expressed toward Ling Long

807
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,870
were all fake?

808
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,560
Or is it

809
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,720
because you don't trust me?

810
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,610
You must be joking.

811
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,610
Please.

812
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,680
Here he Comes.

813
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Young Master is here.

814
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,380
Young Master is here.

815
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,420
Young Master is here.

816
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,990
You can save Tian Huo,

817
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,320
but you must do as I say.

818
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,970
Tonight, I will have Elder Chang Sheng

819
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,000
announce that the position of Master will be passed on to you.

820
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,460
If you dare refuse,

821
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,410
I will never spare the life of Tian Huo.

822
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,080
Understand?

823
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,450
I don't understand.

824
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,440
Auntie, why are you

825
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,090
so determined to pass the position to me?

826
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,690
There are some things I'm not telling you now,

827
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,010
but it's for your own good.

828
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,570
After tonight,

829
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,810
I will make sure all those who could harm you

830
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,900
are gone.

831
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:57,880
At that time,

832
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,280
whether you understand or not,

833
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,530
the promise I made to my sister

834
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,930
will be fulfilled.

835
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,240
Your sister?

836
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,740
Auntie's sister

837
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,950
isn't the Ling Long Saintess?

838
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,490
What did you promise her?

839
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:10,940
What does it have to do with me?

840
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,240
What do you want?

841
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,850
Auntie,

842
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,350
what's going on?

843
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,930
Master, please act quickly to break the curse.

844
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,420
This curse is extremely powerful,

845
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,120
and if we wait too long, it may be too late.

846
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,200
Tian Huo is a member of Bright Moon Palace.

847
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,030
Why do you seem even more anxious

848
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,360
than me?

849
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,470
You're being too modest.

850
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,540
Lady Tian Huo is about to marry into the Fox Clan,

851
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,070
so she will also be a member of mine.

852
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,710
The wedding in the palace is about to begin,

853
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,080
and if the time comes

854
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,590
and the bride and groom haven't shown up,

855
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,930
it would be quite embarrassing.

856
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,530
I see.

857
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,310
I misunderstood.

858
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:43,820
What's going on?

859
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,929
Didn't they say it was a wedding?

860
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,980
-Yeah.
-So what is this?

861
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,449
Yeah, it's strange.

862
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:49,170
What's going on?

863
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:51,409
Master has issued a decree:

864
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,159
everyone, listen attentively.

865
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,460
A thousand years have passed, and I have grown old

866
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,210
and frail, unable to shoulder the rise and fall of the Fox Clan.

867
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,840
The heavy responsibility entrusted to me weighs on my heart.

868
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,900
After much consideration, I only see the talent of Mu Jiu.

869
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,740
He's talented?

870
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,420
With the governance and nurturing, success has been achieved,

871
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,910
and he is capable of bringing about reform.

872
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,570
I hereby offer this to Heaven and Earth,

873
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,960
and thus the position of Master is granted.

874
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,990
What's wrong with the position?

875
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,930
Yes. It doesn't make any sense.

876
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,150
Yes.

877
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,700
-Can he really become Master?
-Yeah.

878
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,050
I, Elder Chang Sheng,

879
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,110
lead the tribe

880
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,890
to greet the new Master.

881
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,460
Greetings, new Master.

882
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,790
Chang Sheng,

883
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,690
is Chang Mei being reckless

884
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,240
and you're going along with her?

885
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,380
What kind of talent is Mu Jiu?

886
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,300
How could he inherit the position?

887
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,610
Yes, how could he?

888
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,400
How could he?

889
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,610
How could he?

890
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,800
Yeah.

891
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,010
Make it clear!

892
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,300
Elder!

893
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,620
Master has issued another decree:

894
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,390
anyone who disagrees with Mu Jiu inheriting the position

895
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,360
will be killed on the spot.

896
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,110
Actually, time can really change someone.

897
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,220
Right?

898
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,310
Ms. Bai, why do you say that?

899
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,180
Ling Long once said that

900
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,160
Wu has always been carefree

901
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,720
and didn't like practicing spells since she was young,

902
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,820
which is why she hoped she would leave the Fox Clan with Qi.

903
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,680
A vow of eternal love,
a lifetime for one person.

904
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,790
But now, a millennium has passed.

905
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,790
Master, you've become
a figure of immense power,

906
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,110
revered and feared by all.

907
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,520
No one in the Fox Clan dares to defy you.

908
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,350
If Ling Long were still alive

909
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,570
to see this,

910
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,050
she probably wouldn't believe her own eyes.

911
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,330
But if Ling Long were still here,

912
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,210
I wouldn't have become who I am today.

913
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,580
The carefree days of my youth were possible

914
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,280
only because

915
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,420
I had an elder sister
who took care of everything.

916
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,860
Who wouldn't want to remain

917
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,930
a carefree child forever,

918
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,370
sheltered from the storms of life?

919
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,390
Since you understand this,

920
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,170
then why pressure Mu Jiu
to take the role of Master?

921
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,320
Why bring up Mu Jiu

922
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,920
all of a sudden?

923
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,830
All right,

924
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,960
let's talk about Ling Long then.

925
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,750
You love your sister so much

926
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,530
that you gave up freedom and chose to remain

927
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,780
guarding Jingyou Mountain

928
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,910
for her.

929
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,730
When I asked Elder Chang Wu

930
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,060
about the Master's role,

931
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,100
he explained it's a position passed down
in your family for generations.

932
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,150
Even if you have no descendants,

933
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,190
shouldn't the responsibility
to the Fox Clan guide you

934
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,830
to choose a qualified successor

935
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,120
rather than a twenty-year-old orphan

936
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,710
with no family?

937
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:39,230
Am I wrong?

938
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,290
Ms. Bai, you seem unusually interested
in the private matters

939
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,590
of my Fox Clan.

940
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,610
But we came here today for Qi.

941
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,660
Those old stories

942
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,600
can wait until we've freed him.

943
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,420
Let's go.

944
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,510
Why the rush?

945
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,570
With Fan Yue sent away,

946
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,860
my life is right here

947
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,780
for you to claim.

948
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,200
Let me finish what I have to say first,

949
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,420
and then you can make your move.

950
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,690
Ms. Bai, what exactly are you
trying to get at?

951
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,610
I just want to know

952
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,850
who exactly Mu Jiu is.

953
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,170
Old fox,

954
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,260
I'll ask one more time.

955
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,110
Do you agree to the Young Master taking over

956
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,470
as Master?

957
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,170
Yes, I do.

958
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,200
Does anyone else disagree?

959
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,150
No.

960
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,270
I don't agree.

961
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,530
Cang Shan?

962
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,850
Tonight is a big day for Tian Huo.

963
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,400
Whatever tricks your Fox Clan is playing,

964
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,280
I don't care.

965
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,100
But the wedding of the guardian
of Bright Moon Palace

966
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,650
will not be disrupted.

967
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,710
Mu Jiu is just a child

968
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,190
in his twenties,

969
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,780
an orphan with no family.

970
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,960
My bond with him is purely personal.

971
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,140
Surely that's none of your concern?

972
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,630
There are countless ways
to hide a person's true age.

973
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,170
For instance, sealing their growth

974
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,390
so that even a child
born a thousand years ago

975
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,970
could only start aging

976
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,170
twenty years ago.

977
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,100
For someone of your power,

978
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,800
it would be effortless.

979
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,490
But sometimes, the question
isn't about what you can do.

980
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,140
It's about

981
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,590
why you do it.

982
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,670
Since I discovered

983
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,730
that Mu Jiu is not truly
your biological nephew,

984
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,100
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

985
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,800
The connection between you two

986
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,380
goes far beyond what can be explained

987
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,560
by the absence of a blood bond.

988
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,880
Your care for Mu Jiu

989
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,490
surpasses even what a mother
would show her own child.

990
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,140
What puzzles me most

991
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,810
is why you chose today,

992
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,530
of all days,

993
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,450
to pass down your title to him.

994
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,920
Then I finally remembered.

995
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,780
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

996
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,070
Today, the first day
of the ninth lunar month,

997
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,700
marks a thousand years

998
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,990
since Rong Xian

999
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,190
was ambushed by the Sect Leader of Kunlun,

1000
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,600
lost his mind,

1001
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,590
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

1002
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,030
and annihilated
the entire Fox Clan in one day.

1003
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,100
It was also the day

1004
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,670
Ling Long died a tragic death.

1005
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,320
Is that correct?

1006
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:13,620
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

1007
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:19,730
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫

1008
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:17,530
The Contemplation Stone must have
taken us into Rong Xian's realm of resentment.

1009
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,040
If my guess is correct,

1010
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,650
it was Fan Yue
who defied destiny in that realm,

1011
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,760
giving Mu Jiu a chance to live.

1012
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,570
The Contemplation Stone's power

1013
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,130
then allowed Mu Jiu
to survive in this world.

1014
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,300
He is, in fact, Ling Long's child.

1015
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,510
Cang Shan,

1016
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,140
look carefully.

1017
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,650
Lady Tian Huo is not here.

1018
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:42,080
This is a matter concerning
only Jingyou Mountain.

1019
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,810
It has nothing to do
with your Bright Moon Palace.

1020
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,200
That's not for you to decide.

1021
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,870
Mu Jiu,

1022
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,890
Tian Huo told me herself

1023
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,530
that she likes you.

1024
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,060
It might not be much,

1025
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,310
and it might just be the beginning,

1026
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,360
but

1027
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,180
her feelings are real.

1028
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,140
Since she likes you,

1029
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,580
that makes you the one
who can bring her joy.

1030
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,200
But if you become the Master,

1031
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,380
who will

1032
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,390
bring her happiness in the future?

1033
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,500
That's why

1034
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,790
I'm against it.

1035
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,560
Fox Clan, heed my command!

1036
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,120
Arrest him!

1037
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,360
Young Master.

1038
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,680
Everyone, back off!

1039
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,630
Cang Shan,

1040
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,020
drop the knife.

1041
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,370
- You...
- What?

1042
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,560
If anything happens to you,

1043
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,240
Huo will have my head for this.

1044
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,280
Get out of the way!

1045
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,540
All of you, stand back!

1046
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,870
You're afraid that the resentment
and curses that once fell upon Ling Long

1047
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,070
will now land on Mu Jiu.

1048
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,620
That's why you've gone to
such lengths to hide this secret,

1049
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,900
even using unknown means

1050
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,040
to alter his age

1051
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:50,840
and his background.

1052
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,760
Today, of all days, was chosen

1053
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,800
because it's Ling Long's death anniversary.

1054
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,840
You want her to see

1055
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,320
that Mu Jiu has grown into a man

1056
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,830
and to give her back everything

1057
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,710
that should have been hers.

1058
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,480
Enough!

1059
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,910
Ms. Bai, you're indeed incredibly smart.

1060
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,810
You're right.

1061
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:13,060
Both you and the Master of Bright Moon
have shown kindness to Mu Jiu.

1062
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,050
By all rights,

1063
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,670
I shouldn't treat you this way.

1064
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,400
But I've gone to great lengths

1065
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,320
to protect Jiu's secret for so long.

1066
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,110
I can't let anyone uncover it now.

1067
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,510
Your kindness…

1068
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,890
I'll repay it in my next life.

1069
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,570
They won't dare lay a finger on me.

1070
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:48,930
Go find Huo right now!

1071
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,170
My aunt intends to harm her.

1072
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,200
You must save her.

1073
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,270
Do you hear me?

1074
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:54,710
Master said

1075
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,220
the strong should stay behind
to hold the line.

1076
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,360
You go find Tian Huo.

1077
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,570
If anything happens to her,

1078
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,810
you'll pay for it.

1079
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:00,770
Now, go!

1080
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,620
Stop Young Master!

1081
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,590
Don't let him get away!

1082
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

1083
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,330
Who would've thought?

1084
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,680
Before we could act,

1085
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,620
the Fox Clan is already falling apart.

1086
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,220
By now, Bai Shuo should have been taken
to the Emotion Tree by Chang Mei.

1087
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,140
Let's move.

1088
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:28,970
Chong Zhao,

1089
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,210
what are you doing?

1090
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:31,930
Master wants Bai Shuo

1091
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,120
for the power of the Contemplation Stone

1092
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,490
to become the strongest among demons.

1093
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,870
But if

1094
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,840
Chang Mei and Fan Yue die tonight,

1095
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:39,330
she'll already be unmatched

1096
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,880
and won't need Bai Shuo anymore.

1097
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,060
Are you out of your mind?

1098
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,370
How could the two of us
possibly kill Fan Yue and Chang Mei?

1099
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:45,880
It won't be "us."

1100
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,130
Just me.

1101
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,100
Chong Zhao,

1102
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,420
you are injured.

1103
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:04,530
Going alone is suicide!

1104
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,810
I brought some of Chen Ye's evil insects
when I came here.

1105
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:07,980
They're not fully refined yet,

1106
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,810
but they've absorbed enough
celestial and demonic energy to be effective.

1107
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,850
Don't worry.

1108
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,440
You will be safe.

1109
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,370
Chong Zhao!

1110
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,160
I can help you.

1111
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,460
No need.

1113
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:23,900
