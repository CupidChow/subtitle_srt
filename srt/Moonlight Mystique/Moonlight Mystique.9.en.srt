00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,970
[Episode 9]

19
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,490
Why is there an evil aura in Yi City?

20
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,600
What is the evil aura?

21
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,290
Heaven and earth produce spiritual energy.

22
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,370
Eternals and demons all cultivate with this spiritual energy.

23
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,079
Yet evil aura

24
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,850
specifically comes from evil cultivators.

25
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,980
Evil cultivators?

26
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,850
They cultivate by devouring essence.

27
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,250
Since there's an evil aura,

28
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,300
there must be

29
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,660
evil cultivators in Yi City.

30
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,090
Devouring essence...

31
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,540
The Desireless Stone led us to this Yi City.

32
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,090
So is the appearance of the evil cultivator

33
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,820
related to the next Contemplation?

34
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,210
Bai Shuo?

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,810
Bai Shuo!

36
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,820
Fan Yue? Fan Yue!

37
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,200
Mana is banned in Yi City.

38
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,580
But it's not working on her?

39
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,360
Fan Yue!

40
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,980
I once saw this monster in the Desireless Stone.

41
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:06,850
Let's go.

42
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,730
Shuo.

43
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,180
Stay out of the Bright Moon Palace's business.

44
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,410
Who are you?

45
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,640
How dare you break into Yi Palace?

46
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,880
Yi Palace?

47
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,780
Don't be rude.

48
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,390
Back off.

49
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,210
Yes, sir.

50
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,060
I didn't expect you, the Master of Bright Moon Palace,

51
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,710
would join the competition in person.

52
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,510
Earlier today, with the Eternals and demons around,

53
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,230
I couldn't expose our collaboration with you.

54
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,980
Please forgive me

55
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,450
for my disrespect.

56
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,190
Let's cut to the chase.

57
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,200
Just now,

58
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,260
I saw some evil aura entering Yi Palace.

59
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,310
Did you see it wrong, Master Fan?

60
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,590
There has never been any evil cultivator in Yi City.

61
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,030
How could there be an evil aura?

62
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,310
It can't be wrong.

63
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,670
We've been chasing him all the way here.

64
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,400
We saw him entering Yi Palace.

65
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,860
Go with me to find him if you don't believe us.

66
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,300
Since you saw it with your own eyes, Master Fan,

67
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,260
I will report this to His Majesty right away

68
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,340
and search the palace.

69
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,080
However, this is Yi Palace after all.

70
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,930
It's in the dead of night.

71
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,630
I'm afraid it's improper for you to enter the palace now.

72
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,270
I've told you about the evil aura and the evil cultivator.

73
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,420
Whether you investigate it or not

74
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,720
is up to you.

75
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,700
Evil cultivators are banished by the Three Races

76
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,690
If there's really an evil cultivator in the city,

77
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,230
our Yi Clan will not let him go for sure.

78
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,930
Let's go.

79
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,270
You could clearly tell that

80
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,630
the lieutenant of the King of Yi tried to stop us on purpose

81
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,000
from entering the palace to investigate the monster.

82
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,340
Why did you give in so easily?

83
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,690
If that monster is really related to the King of Yi,

84
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,960
what do you think

85
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,430
you can find out in that way?

86
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,020
You'd even die in there.

87
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,800
You don't need to make up these excuses.

88
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,990
As the prestigious Master of Bright Moon Palace,

89
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,960
how could you let them shut you out of the palace gate

90
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,120
just for your worry

91
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,390
about my life?

92
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,120
Master.

93
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:00,920
Master,

94
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,170
did you hunt that monster down?

95
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,490
That monster

96
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,230
entered Yi Palace.

97
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,420
You came just in time.

98
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,800
Tell me,

99
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,360
who on earth are you?

100
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,270
I found you kinda weird

101
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,120
before we entered Yi City.

102
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,370
You seem to be very sensitive to things in here.

103
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,780
Spiritual power is banned in Yi City.

104
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,990
Even Fan Yue is restricted by the rules.

105
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,960
But you can use your spiritual power.

106
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,840
Are you a Yi citizen?

107
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,520
Yi citizens are born with limited spiritual power.

108
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,830
But your power is so strong that you can kill a thousand with a single strike.

109
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,330
It's enough to make you the guardian of Bright Moon Palace.

110
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,840
Are you a human or a demon?

111
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,040
It's none of your business.

112
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,350
None of my business?

113
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,590
I made a deal with your Bright Moon Palace.

114
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,659
Since it's a deal, we should trust each other.

115
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,490
There's a lot going on in Yi City right now.

116
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,880
Your identity is fishy.

117
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:46,430
I can stop the deal.

118
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,270
It's not up to you.

119
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,510
You should have known

120
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,060
the real identity of Tian Huo, right?

121
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,440
Tian Huo's identity

122
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,700
has nothing to do with claiming the Heart Flames

123
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:57,659
and gathering the Five Contemplations.

124
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,230
Fan Yue,

125
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,700
I know you are quite mighty,

126
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,930
and I can't beat you.

127
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,040
But it doesn't mean

128
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,550
I have to accept your schemes and deception.

129
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,470
I can ignore her identity,

130
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,100
but I need trust and respect for our cooperation.

131
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,660
Tian Huo,

132
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,660
you may leave now.

133
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,290
Yes, Master.

134
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,870
Tian Huo

135
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,480
is indeed a Yi citizen.

136
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,110
As for why she has the extraordinary spiritual power out of limits,

137
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,669
this is her own business.

138
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,830
It has nothing to do with us.

139
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,429
Fine.

140
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,289
Everyone has secrets.

141
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,480
I can stop asking about it.

142
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,679
But since she is a Yi citizen,

143
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,670
she must know this city well.

144
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,220
When looking for the entrance to Yi City,

145
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,840
I almost died in the sand formation.

146
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,240
Did Tian Huo provide any clues?

147
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,900
Tian Huo's been by my side for seven years.

148
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,450
She's never had any contact with Yi City over the past seven years.

149
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,040
The entrance to Yi City changes every year.

150
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,180
None of us—

151
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,540
neither you, me,

152
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,260
nor Tian Huo—

153
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,500
know the specific location.

154
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,440
But now that we're in Yi City,

155
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,190
is she still clueless

156
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,140
about the three Heart Flames?

157
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,180
Yes.

158
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,180
So,

159
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,680
you've never doubted her?

160
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,630
Never.

161
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,740
You can totally trust her,

162
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,930
but why should I?

163
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,310
Because you have to trust me completely.

164
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,310
I can't trust anyone

165
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,780
except myself.

166
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,640
Here's my promise to protect you.

167
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,910
I can assure you that,

168
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,570
as long as I'm alive,

169
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,960
I will let no one hurt you.

170
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,380
Sounds quite touching.

171
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,690
Fan Yue,

172
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,020
you're giving it your all

173
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,610
to protect the Desireless Stone,

174
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,630
not me.

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,790

Zero in on looking for the Heart Flame and Five Contemplations.

♫Even if I'll perish♫

189
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,390
That's all

190
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,790
♫At least I can still kiss your face♫

191
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,660
I need you to do.

192
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,040
♫Burn out my waning moon♫

193
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,100
OK! That's all!

194
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,480
Once we're done with it,

195
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:28,770
♫In exchange for a lifetime of passion♫

196
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,520
there's gonna be

197
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,520
no more ties between us!

198
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,090
It's been seven years since I was last in Yi City.

199
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,430
Feels like it's changed a lot.

200
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,310
Even a person

201
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,150
can change a lot

202
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,940
in seven years, not to mention a city.

203
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,250
I know Hua Lin well.

204
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,980
Everything happening in Yi City

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,670
is under his surveillance.

206
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,860
There's no way he doesn't know about the monster.

207
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,900
The Three Races forbid evil cultivation.

208
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,540
If that evil being is really related to the King of Yi,

209
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,990
then both the Eternal and Demon Races

210
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,890
will surely go after the entire Yi Clan.

211
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,200
Don't worry, Master.

212
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,270
I've cut ties with the Yi Clan

213
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,320
ever since my departure seven years ago.

214
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,520
Now I'm back here just to get the Contemplation for you.

215
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,590
I will get to the bottom of the monster as soon as possible.

216
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,480
General, what's wrong?

217
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,840
You go first.

218
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,070
I'll be right there.

219
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,870
Yes, General.

220
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,280
General, you're really vigilant.

221
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,760
I watched you grow up.

222
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,490
How could I not know it was you?

223
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,470
Princess.

224
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,310
I've already cut ties with Yi City.

225
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,760
I'm not your Princess.

226
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:23,650
Hua Hong...

227
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,070
Don't call me that.

228
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,090
I am the guardian of Bright Moon Palace, Tian Huo.

229
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,500
Lady Tian Huo,

230
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,180
how have you been these years?

231
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,210
I'm not here to catch up with you.

232
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,040
Why is there a monster in the palace?

233
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,370
I don't know what you're talking about.

234
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,700
Stop playing dumb here.

235
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,370
I'm patrolling with the guards.

236
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,240
Nothing suspicious was found.

237
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,210
Don't worry.

238
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,990
If there is really an evil being in the palace,

239
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,570
His Majesty and I will show no mercy.

240
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,270
You're still as hypocritical

241
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,910
as before.

242
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,870
You clearly know

243
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,250
whether there's a demon in the palace.

244
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,940
If Eternals and demons find out about it,

245
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,450
I'm afraid the Yi City you've been swearing to protect

246
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,280
will fall apart.

247
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,420
The palace is a sacred place.

248
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,380
No evil beings are allowed here.

249
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,800
So you don't need to worry about that, Lady Tian Huo.

250
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,230
The fate of Yi City doesn't concern me.

251
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,260
Where is the second Heart Flame?

252
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,930
Since you're joining the Wutong Martial Arts Contest as Lady Tian Huo,

253
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,520
you should abide by the rules and keep it fair.

254
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,340
Who are you to talk about fairness with me?

255
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,230
No matter what,

256
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,380
I'm your uncle.

257
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,370
Uncle?

258
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,240
Yes.

259
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,970
You are my mother's sworn brother.

260
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,920
My grandfather raised you up.

261
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,240
The Mei Family helped you and the King of Yi get to where you are today

262
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,000
with all the glory.

263
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,390
But how did you treat her?

264
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,560
Now you wanna talk about fairness with me?

265
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,390
Where were you when my mother was forced to death?

266
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,910
The Mei Family has been loyal to Yi King for generations.

267
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,120
Your mother died for the whole Yi City.

268
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,540
If you insist on blaming her death

269
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,610
on me,

270
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,050
then do it.

271
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,680
I'll repay the Mei Family

272
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,470
with my life.

273
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:27,470
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

274
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,750
Stop!

275
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:36,240
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

276
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,650
Your Majesty.

277
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:46,350
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

278
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:52,460
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫

279
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,920
You left years ago.

280
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,220
Why are you back now?

281
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,580
To get the Heart Flame,

282
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,990
you gotta rely on your real capacities.

283
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,420
What's your position

284
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,930
to be snooping around here?

285
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,720
Any position will do,

286
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,900
but it can never be a Yi citizen.

287
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,200
Since you're an outsider...

288
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,000
Wu Zhao,

289
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,400
arrest this intruder who dared

290
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,260
to trespass the palace.

291
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,710
♫Across thousands of miles♫

292
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,310
Your Majesty,

293
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,320
Lady Tian Huo is the guardian of Bright Moon Palace.

294
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,500
It's not the right time to mess with the Master of Bright Moon Palace.

295
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,770
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

296
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,040
Get lost!

297
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,250
Get out of the palace right now!

298
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:24,380
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

299
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,770
Get out of Yi City!

300
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,200
And never come back!

301
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,490
Once I get the Heart Flame,

302
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:34,440
♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

303
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,300
I'll never see you again.

304
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:40,360
♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

305
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,370
Your Majesty, you've been missing the Princess every day.

306
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,790
Now you finally met her today.

307
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,550
Why did you say those angry words?

308
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,440
She shouldn't be back now.

309
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,120
They have noticed him.

310
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,470
They won't let it go for sure.

311
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,770
At this point,

312
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,140
we have no choice but to play along with the plan

313
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,390
and advance it.

314
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,440
What about the Princess?

315
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,180
if she gets in the way,

316
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,260
show no mercy.

317
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

318
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,980
Senior Chong Zhao!

319
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,300
Where have you been so late at night?

320
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,370
Is Bai Shuo back?

321
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,920
I saw her going back to her room.

322
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,100
What happened?

323
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,870
Of course, you can think that way.

324
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,580
So,

325
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,300
don't make any reckless moves, and don't be delusional.

326
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,410
Zero in on looking for the Heart Flame and Five Contemplations.

327
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,780
That's all

328
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,210
I need you

329
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,980
to do.

330
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,440
That's right.

331
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,390
That's all.

332
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,280
Shuo.

333
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,540
Shuo.

334
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,300
I'm glad you're alright.

335
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,240
That monster...

336
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,579
Something is wrong with Yi City.

337
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,200
If there is no reason to stay,

338
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,339
you should leave immediately.

339
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,310
I know.

340
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,050
I saw

341
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,569
Fu Ling earlier today.

342
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,570
Sounds quite touching.

343
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,500
Fan Yue,

344
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,420
you're giving it your all

345
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,380
to protect the Desireless Stone,

346
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,890
not me.

347
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,900
Come in.

348
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,530
Did you see Hua Lin?

349
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,490
What did he say?

350
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,610
He denied his connection with the monster

351
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,440
and just asked me to get out of Yi City.

352
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,640
Looks like we need to grab

353
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,720
the Heart Flame real quick this time.

354
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,880
Although I don't know the King of Yi well,

355
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,980
he used to be a great figure with his reputation spreading everywhere.

356
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,020
As a father,

357
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,920
he hasn't seen you for seven years.

358
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,670
Yet he asked you to get out of Yi City as soon as he met you.

359
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,550
They might sound like angry words,

360
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,290
but he might be speaking the truth.

361
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,760
I'm afraid you've overthought it, Master.

362
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,250
He doesn't live up to his reputation.

363
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,590
He doesn't deserve to be a king,

364
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,260
much less my father.

365
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,360
No matter what,

366
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,560
the current priority

367
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,690
is to find the Heart Flame.

368
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,680
Why didn't you tell me that Fu Ling was there?

369
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,510
You'd definitely try to kill her if you saw her.

370
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,160
But that

371
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
wouldn't do you any good.

372
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,090
So,

373
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,160
you made a decision for me once again.

374
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,720
I just wanted to keep you safe.

375
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,160
That's your personal thought!

376
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,050
Chong Zhao,

377
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,270
I don't wanna quarrel with you because of this case.

378
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,590
I know I can't kill her now.

379
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,380
I will try to survive

380
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,790
and give a fatal blow to her and Zhen Yu in the future.

381
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,330
But Fu Ling came to Yi City.

382
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,950
This thing can't be as simple as it seems to be.

383
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,720
If you get any other information,

384
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,560
I hope you won't hide it from me.

385
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,460
Okay.

386
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,390
I promise you.

387
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,230
Good night.

388
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,480
If you need anything,

389
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,780
feel free to call me anytime.

390
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,460
Seems like

391
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,800
she can't completely break off with Chong Zhao.

392
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,270
Chong Zhao

393
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,590
can't get in the way of my plan.

394
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,560
What if he's in the way of something else?

395
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,580
What are you trying to say?

396
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,370
Nothing.

397
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,610
Please take a good rest, Master

398
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,850
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

399
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,600
♫You are my distant call♫

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,870
♫You are my first and last♫

00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:41,340
♫My heart is trembling for you♫

402
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,760
♫In this moment where we embrace each other♫

[Sihai Inn]

405
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,920
Lady Tian Huo, you've made a name with your prowess.

406
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,430
Yet your dining etiquette is so good.

407
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,330
Is it your Yi citizens' habit?

408
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,070
Don't talk when eating. Don't ask too much.

409
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,820
Sirs and madams,

410
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,550
a gentleman

411
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,030
just asked me to send you this box of cakes.

412
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,220
Please enjoy.

413
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,160
Where is he?

414
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,080
He just left.

415
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,460
Don't be too nosy.

416
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,150
Hua Yong.

417
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,800
[Hua Yong, Yi Clan, Prince of Yi]

418
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:36,840
Sister.

419
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,550
Don't call me that!

420
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,210
It's disgusting.

421
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,600
I told you

422
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,840
never to show up in front of me ever again.

423
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,070
I thought you came back

424
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,280
because you had forgiven me.

425
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,850
Forgive you?

426
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,240
Just a box of cakes,

427
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,720
and you want me to forget about everything from the past?

428
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
No, it's not like that...

429
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,050
Shut up!

430
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,540
I'm warning you one last time.

431
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,200
I've cut ties

432
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,400
with you.

433
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,260
If you show up again,

434
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,240
I will beat you up.

435
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,160
Stay out

436
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,040
of Tian Huo's business.

437
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,150
Who says I wanna get involved in her business?

438
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,450
Now that we've obtained the first Heart Flame,

439
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,850
I'm in a hurry to find the second one.

440
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,250
By yourself?

441
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,840
Can't I?

442
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,830
Where are you going to find it?

443
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,220
Since you haven't been honest with me, Master Fan,

444
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,210
why should I tell you everything?

445
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,010
Master,

446
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,650
what's wrong with her today?

447
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,130
Are you really letting her go alone?

448
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,220
She can walk by herself

449
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,680
and go anywhere she wants.

450
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,190
What if she runs into danger?

451
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,640
Danger?

452
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,530
It's her own decision.

453
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,140
There's no one else to blame if she dies.

454
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,770
Mommy,

455
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,240
what is this character?

456
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,030
"Citizen."

457
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,340
The "citizen" in "Yi citizen."

458
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,460
What's the difference between humans and Yi citizens?

459
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:13,890
There's not much difference.

460
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,440
They're all made of flesh and bones,

461
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,940
standing tall and upright.

462
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,130
It's you.

463
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,020
Why are you here?

464
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,400
I'm here to deliver the medicine for Hu.

465
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,650
Also,

466
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,530
I'm here to ask you something.

467
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,780
Hu, go play nearby.

468
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,440
I'll teach you to read later,

469
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,000
okay?

470
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,640
Okay.

471
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,680
Good girl.

472
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,720
What do you want to ask?

473
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,050
Do you know where the second Heart Flame is?

474
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,900
Heart Flames choose their owners themselves.

475
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,160
How would I know?

476
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,890
Then do you know there's a monster

477
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,080
in the city?

478
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,320
Did it attack you?

479
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,630
So, you knew it.

480
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,890
What is it?

481
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,800
No one knows what it is.

482
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,050
We only know that it first appeared

483
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,970
on a night seven years ago.

484
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,350
Seven years ago again?

485
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,200
That year, it bit many people in the city to death

486
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,370
and then disappeared for a long time.

487
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,030
After that, we heard about it from time to time.

488
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,870
Some said it was formed from the souls of deceased Yi citizens.

489
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,730
Some said it was a beast cultivated by an evil cultivator.

490
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,670
But there was no conclusion.

491
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,950
Later, His Majesty worried that there would be chaos among the people,

492
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,210
so he ordered us to stop discussing this matter.

493
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,190
Does it only come out at night?

494
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,340
Maybe.

495
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,130
No one has ever seen it during the day anyway.

496
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,730
Do you know anything else?

497
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,470
Don't ask too much

498
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,210
about Yi citizens.

499
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,430
I told you this

500
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,330
to repay your kindness to Hu.

501
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,920
Just now, you said

502
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,760
Yi citizens were no different from humans.

503
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,870
You were wrong.

504
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,790
Yi citizens' suffering

505
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,960
is not something Eternals, demons,

506
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,210
and you humans

507
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,600
can understand.

508
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,570
Go.

509
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,150
That's all I can say.

510
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,030
Your friend's been waiting for you over there for a long time.

511
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,230
Go back early.

512
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,440
It's not safe in the city at night.

513
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,090
Why did you follow me here?

514
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,260
Don't play dumb.

515
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,860
Don't act innocent after getting the benefit.

516
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,530
I knew you wouldn't let me die,

517
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,980
so I dared to come and go recklessly.

518
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,510
I advise you not to play your tricks

519
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,510
on me.

520
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,030
But you still came.

521
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,800
It won't happen again.

522
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,710
Got it.

523
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,330
It's getting late. Let's go back.

524
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,390
I don't want to meet the monster again.

525
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,950
Stop ordering me around.

526
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,360
Got it. Don't be so verbose.

527
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,140
I'm verbose?

528
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,340
You keep emphasizing your identity.

529
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,470
Aren't you verbose?

530
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,670
Say that again!

531
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,080
I dare not.

532
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,190
Your Majesty,

533
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,680
the first Heart Flame

534
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,420
has been sent to Bai Shuo as planned.

535
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,250
Bai Shuo is being protected by Fan Yue.

536
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,200
Even if Eternals and demons are not convinced,

537
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,670
they dare not speak out their anger.

538
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,830
Cold Spring Palace

539
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,240
has seen Yi City's good faith.

540
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,180
You're Lady Fu Ling from Cold Spring Palace.

541
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Please forgive me for being disrespectful.

542
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,750
Greetings, Your Majesty.

543
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,890
You offered your blood as a sacrifice to King Yi's Sword

544
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,950
and made the two Heart Flames come into the world in advance.

545
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,360
The Grand Master was very touched.

546
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,640
Since we're cooperating,

547
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,320
we'll both benefit from it.

548
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,370
Surely I won't take it lightly.

549
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,250
Your Majesty, please hurry up

550
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,470
in case

551
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,980
something unfavorable happens.

552
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,590
It's over there, too!

553
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,640
Did you see the dark shape just now?

554
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,260
Hurry!

555
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,580
It's over there! Look!

556
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,620
It's over there!

557
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,540
-Over there.
-Over there.

558
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,480
What's over there?

559
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,290
A dark shape?

560
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,090
What is it?

561
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,350
It actually has an evil aura.

562
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,750
I think it must be an evil cultivator.

563
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,570
It's there, too. Look!

564
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,380
It's the monster from yesterday.

565
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,650
It went that way!

566
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,180
Over there!

567
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:22,950
Go after it!

568
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,410
Let's go! Hurry!

569
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,350
-Let's go!
-Let's go after it!

570
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,270
Don't you think it's suspicious?

571
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,160
The monster knew Eternals and demons wouldn't let evil cultivators go,

572
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,260
but it still came.

573
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,790
I know.

574
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,980
Yet you still want to chase it?

575
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,130
Only after chasing it

576
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,820
will we know what conspiracy is lying ahead.

577
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,730
Let's go.

578
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,920
Senior, shall we chase it?

579
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,830
You stay in the inn.

580
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,490
If anything happens, you can back us up anytime.

581
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,400
You two, come with me.

582
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:44,980
Yes.

583
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:49,900
Go!

584
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,650
-Hurry! It's over there!
-Go after it!

585
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,510
Hurry!

586
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,020
Over there!

587
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,670
Hurry!

588
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,240
Over there!

589
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,260
Catch up with it!

590
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,060
Damn it!

591
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,000
The monster got away.

592
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,120
There's someone over there.

593
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,880
Where are we?

594
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,400
The Yi Clan Tomb.

595
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,570
The Yi Clan Tomb?

596
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,050
How come I don't see any tombstone?

597
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,380
Whose tomb is that?

598
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,010
Yi citizens have a custom

599
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
of burying the dead in the open without a tombstone.

600
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,210
However, it's not a Yi citizen buried in the tomb

601
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,960
but...

602
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,110
That's the Wutong Heart Flame.

603
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,110
-It's really the Wutong Heart Flame.
-Really?

604
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,240
Heart Flame?

605
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,510
Over there.

606
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,400
The quietness was so good.

607
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,020
Now, there are so many people

608
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,580
disturbing my peace.

609
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,680
Killing people

610
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,590
is not tiring.

611
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,480
Burying them

612
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,680
is.

613
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,620
What's going on?

614
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,140
Sir,

615
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,030
we are not here

616
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,410
to steal the Heart Flame.

617
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,090
Instead, we chased a monster here.

618
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,750
Since the monster is gone,

619
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,440
we shall take our leave.

620
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,670
Please forgive us

621
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,100
if we offended you.

622
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,170
Why are we leaving?

623
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,520
The Heart Flame is right over there.

624
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,960
It's dangerous here.

625
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,230
We'd better go back

626
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,410
and take some time to think of a solid plan.

627
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,510
This Heart Flame

628
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,570
is mine!

629
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,210
Calm down.

630
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,870
That's impossible.

631
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,630
Isn't there a Magic Restriction in Yi City?

632
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,120
Why can you use magic?

633
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,980
Are you a Yi citizen?

634
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,110
Master,

635
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:30,820
let's go now.

636
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:31,930
We can't leave.

637
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,360
Since you're here,

638
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,730
stay here

639
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,790
with me.

640
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,900
I don't care who you are.

641
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,060
I'm taking

642
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,600
this Heart Flame.

643
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,480
Tian Huo.

644
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,950
How did he turn into this?

645
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,740
This is what he originally looks like.

646
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,060
The Snow Lotus Holy Sword.

647
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,380
Could he

648
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,060
be...

649
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,650
Kneel down and bow.

650
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,420
Mr. Rong Xian.

651
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,350
How's that possible?

652
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,040
[Rong Xian, Eternal, Saint of Kunlun]

653
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,450
Didn't Mr. Rong Xian die 1,000 years ago?

654
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,850
How could someone who died 1,000 years ago still be here?

655
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,850
Rong Xian.

656
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,300
He's long dead.

657
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,560
I'll kill all of you, too!

658
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,010
Bastard Rong Xian,

659
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,100
I'll kill you!

660
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,880
Young Master Mu Jiu, why are you here?

661
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,770
[Mu Jiu, demon, Young Master of the Fox Clan]

662
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,170
How could this happen?

663
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,120
He is not Rong Xian.

664
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,870
He's just the resentment formed from Rong Xian's obsession.

665
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,730
Is he himself

666
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,150
buried in the tomb?

667
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,540
He was formed from resentment,

668
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,190
so he's not bound by the rules of Yi City.

669
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,100
We can't kill him,

670
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,490
but he can hurt us.

671
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,150
Doesn't that mean he's invincible?

672
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,830
We'll all die if we stay here any longer.

673
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,060
Let's come back for the Heart Flame

674
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,190
after finding a way

675
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,630
to eliminate the resentment.

676
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,640
The Fox Clan?

677
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,030
Get lost.

678
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,430
Get lost!

679
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,290
I must destroy this bastard's tomb today

680
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,990
to avenge the Fox Clan

681
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,170
and Saintess Ling Long!

682
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,720
Idiot.

683
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,620
Watch out!

684
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,330
Master, go.

685
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,300
Rong Xian's resentment is too strong.

686
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,440
My spirit shield won't last long.

687
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,710
Chong Zhao!

688
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,750
Don't come over here!

689
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,630
Bai Shuo!

690
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,110
Where are we?

691
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,490
Why are you in the Fox Clan's costume?

692
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:25,900
Yes.

693
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,370
Why are you in the Fox Clan's costume, too?

694
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,870
Well, you, too.

695
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,220
Who changed my clothes?

696
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,170
Why are you looking at me?

697
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,940
Could it be...

698
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,470
me?

699
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,870
Weren't we at the Yi Clan Tomb?

700
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,230
How did we suddenly get here?

701
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,450
Where are we?

702
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,470
[Kunlun]

703
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,000
This is my home, Kunlun.

704
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,010
[Kunlun]

705
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,630
Kunlun?

706
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,230
Kunlun?

707
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,400
No.

708
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,870
Something's wrong here.

709
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,320
What's wrong?

710
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,290
Wuji Palace

711
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,660
was destroyed 1,000 years ago.

712
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,580
[Kunlun]

713
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,030
Wu.

714
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,250
Wu.

715
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,360
I told you not to come, but you didn't listen.

716
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,370
If I hadn't sent the Fox Clan's letter of peace

717
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,900
up the mountain in advance,

718
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,960
you'd have been riddled

719
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,950
before entering the mountain gate

720
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,300
for breaking into Kunlun so rashly.

721
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,640
Who is she?

722
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,840
And who's Wu?

723
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,400
And you.

724
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,280
Qi.

725
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,530
Aren't you the most down-to-earth and stablest servant?

726
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,710
Why did you let the lady sneak out this time?

727
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,960
If anything goes wrong,

728
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,720
no punishment will be enough.

729
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,500
Qi?

730
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,840
Servant?

731
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,760
Me?

732
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,700
Lady?

733
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,670
What lady?

734
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,960
What family am I from?

735
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:38,990
What about me?

736
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,300
Who am I?

737
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,650
Look how dumb you are.

738
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,350
The Elder must have been out of his mind

739
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,130
to ask the three of you to help me steal the Snow Lotus.

740
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,280
Steal the Snow Lotus?

741
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,760
Especially you,

742
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,660
Ba.

743
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,210
You're usually the most impatient.

744
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:52,840
If Qi

745
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,490
hadn't been putting in a good word for you with the Elder,

746
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,160
he wouldn't have given you

747
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,180
the chance to make a contribution.

748
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,280
-When we enter Kunlun later,
-The Elder?

749
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,490
control your temper

750
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,320
and don't get into a fight on their turf.

751
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,380
Got it?

752
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,370
I'm Ba.

753
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,540
Ba is me.

754
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,980
Shall I say "got it"?

755
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,560
Aren't you usually good at quarreling?

756
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,910
Why aren't you talking today?

757
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,900
Say something.

758
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,790
Got it.

759
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,010
I won't quarrel with others.

760
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,610
What's going on?

761
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,070
The situation is unclear.

762
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,150
Let's listen more and talk less.

763
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,780
Young Chief Ling Long.

764
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,860
Our Sect Leader has received the Fox Clan's letter.

765
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,030
Please follow us into the mountain.

766
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,730
Ling Long?

767
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,580
[Ling Long, demon, Saintess of the Fox Clan]

768
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,840
Saintess of the Fox Clan!

769
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:35,930
Thank you.

770
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,900
Snow Lotus.

771
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,080
Saintess Ling Long.

772
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,270
Now I remember!

773
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:44,960
Let's go.

774
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:56,470
[Kunlun Sect, Eternal Race]

775
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,760
Everyone!

776
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,530
Hold your breath.

777
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,530
Concentrate.

778
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,420
As disciples of Kunlun,

779
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,080
always remember that the Fox Clan is vicious and cunning.

780
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,790
We, Kunlun,

781
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,970
see them as our mortal enemies.

782
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,710
Who can tell me what happened?

783
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,430
Wasn't I at Yi City just now?

784
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,300
How did I suddenly arrive at Kunlun?

785
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,740
Kunlun is the sworn enemy of the Fox Clan.

786
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,290
If I enter Kunlun,

787
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,880
it'll be like a sheep entering the tiger's den.

788
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,490
Stop!

789
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,420
What are you doing?

790
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,650
W-What are you doing?

791
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,520
Why is he walking over?

792
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,180
Is he going to kill me?

793
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,940
Should I make the first move?

794
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,070
But with so many of them,

795
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,420
I don't stand a chance!

796
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,480
Calm down.

797
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,360
No action unless

798
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,300
the enemy acts first.

799
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,690
Slacking off again? Start practicing now!

800
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,900
Practice?

801
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,620
Practice what?

802
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,580
As disciples of Kunlun,

803
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,770
we are practicing our swordsmanship, of course.

804
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,420
How did I become a disciple of Kunlun?

805
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,080
Kunlun Sword?

806
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,880
How could something so treacherous

807
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,860
end up in my hands?

808
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,480
Take it.

809
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,450
Make your move.

810
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,730
I'm full of demonic aura.

811
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,830
If I make a move,

812
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,610
wouldn't I be exposed immediately?

813
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,460
Could it be that

814
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,480
I'm going to perish here today?

815
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,540
If you are this lazy,

816
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,090
how will you kill fox demons in the future?

817
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,010
Make your move!

818
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,000
Let me test you.

819
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,750
Whatever.

820
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,820
If I die, so be it.

821
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,320
When did I learn the Kunlun Sword Technique?

822
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,470
Wait.

823
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,600
How did I become an Eternal?

824
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,420
Stop!

825
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,330
Rong Xian.

826
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,850
Wasn't Rong Xian at the Yi Clan Tomb just now?

827
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,580
If so, who is this?

828
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,440
What time is it now?

829
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:53,920
And who am I?

830
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,510
Sir.

831
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,480
Why are you fighting each other?

832
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,160
Sir.

833
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,970
The Elder has ordered

834
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,370
for us disciples to practice our swordsmanship

835
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,260
so that we are ready to fight the Fox Clan any time.

836
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,850
But he slacked off

837
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,500
and refused to practice.

838
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,050
I...

839
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,910
I was just punishing him for a bit.

840
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,850
Why aren't you willing to practice your swordsmanship?

841
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,290
Why should I?

842
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,230
Is the sole purpose of spiritual cultivation and becoming a Kunlun disciple

843
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,850
to kill the Fox Clan?

844
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,080
Do we have nothing better to do?

845
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,780
I mean...

846
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,220
the Fox Clan haven't done

847
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,460
anything evil.

848
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,610
Aren't they just...

849
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,650
vain,

850
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,590
gluttonous,

851
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,820
and like to sunbathe every day?

852
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,240
There's no need to fight

853
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,640
the moment we meet.

854
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,460
Judging from what you said,

855
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,090
you seem to know a lot about the Fox Clan...

856
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,910
and seem to have some different views.

857
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,050
Great.

858
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,490
The Fox Clan sent its people to negotiate peace.

859
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,170
I am going to meet the Saintess of Fox Clan.

860
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,970
Come with me.

861
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,040
Saintess of the Fox Clan?

862
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,280
Could it be that...

863
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,670
Saintess Ling Long is alive in this damned place too?

864
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,140
Aren't you going to keep up?

865
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,090
You...

866
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,540
Cang Shan! Cang Shan!

867
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,700
It's useless.

868
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:40,960
They have entered

869
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,810
the illusion created out of Rong Xian's resentment.

870
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,810
Even if you break open Rong Xian's tomb,

871
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,660
you can only exist in the present time and space.

872
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,350
You won't be able to enter the illusion.

873
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,020
That monster

874
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,130
deliberately led the Eternals and demons towards the Yi Clan Tomb.

875
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,090
You wanted to make use of Rong Xian's resentment to kill the Eternals and demons.

876
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,120
Rong Xian's illusion

877
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,880
is the second stage of Wutong Martial Arts Contest.

878
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,890
If you desire the Heart Flame,

879
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,850
you must break through the illusion.

880
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:00,560
This is the rule.

881
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,470
Rong Xian's resentment has been building for a thousand years.

882
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,770
How can it be broken in a moment?

883
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,990
Well then, let's see if

884
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,170
Demon King from the Polar Region

885
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,810
lives up to his name.

886
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,710
I will say just one thing today.

887
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,660
If anything happens to our master,

888
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,670
I will certainly lead

889
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,060
our demons from Bright Moon Palace to crush Yi City.

890
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,340
At the very least,

891
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,160
Yi City has raised you.

892
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:23,130
You and your king have no grounds to speak of grace.

893
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,530
If my master does not return safely,

894
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,600
your entire city will pay the price.

895
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:33,470
I think I understand what's going on.

896
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:34,300
While Ling Ling is not here,

897
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,770
let's figure it out among ourselves.

898
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,000
This time, the Fox Clan came to Kunlun

899
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,100
seemingly for a peace negotiation,

900
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,080
but it's actually to steal the Snow Lotus of Kunlun

901
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,710
to extend the Chief's life.

902
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,790
But didn't Ling Long and Rong Xian

903
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:48,280
die a long time ago?

904
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,690
Could it be that the Desireless Stone

905
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,360
brought us back to a few thousand years ago?

906
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,970
This is not the true version of a thousand years ago.

907
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,840
This is the realm of illusion from Rong Xian's resentment.

908
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,280
Yi City's Magic Restriction?

909
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,340
This really is the realm of resentment.

910
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,460
What brought us in here was the Desireless Stone.

911
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,780
But what's trapping us now

912
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,160
is Rong Xian's resentment.

913
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,330
Why so?

914
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,770
If it weren't for his will,

915
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,880
we wouldn't have become

916
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,620
people who were already part of his memory.

917
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,360
Then, how will we get out?

918
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,070
If we follow his life until death,

919
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,840
this illusion will naturally be broken.

920
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,370
How could this be?

921
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,210
What if he lives for decades?

922
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,060
Are we going to remain here

923
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,600
and be foxes for decades?

924
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,760
The Saint wouldn't live for that long.

925
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,960
Oh right.

926
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,590
You're a Kunlun disciple.

927
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,170
Tell us then.

928
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,590
What happened a thousand years ago?
