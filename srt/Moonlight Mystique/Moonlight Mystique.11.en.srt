1
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

17
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,710
[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,910
[Episode 11]

19
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,770
Why?

20
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,960
Why did Master do this to me?

21
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,090
Why?

22
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,020
Why?

23
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,650
No.

24
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,270
No.

25
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,210
Ling Long is dead.

26
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,720
The legend is fake.

27
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,750
Ling Long didn't slaughter the Kunlun Sect.

28
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,290
The Fox Clan didn't do it either.

29
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,750
It was Rong Xian!

30
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,390
Rong Xian is not in the valley today.

31
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,810
Did you see him?

32
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,130
The Sect Leader of Kunlun is seriously ill.

33
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,480
He rushed back to Kunlun.

34
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,710
He went back to Kunlun?

35
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,200
Ling Long said something strange to me just now.

36
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,250
She was acting a little strange today.

37
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,320
I asked her what happened.

38
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,220
She said she was tired

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,310
and wanted to rest.

40
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,340
Ling Long.

41
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,430
Where did she go?

42
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,910
[To Wu]

43
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,380
Wu.

44
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,000
Forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye.

45
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,020
Every saintess of the Fox Clan

46
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,540
has the jade of the tribe.

47
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,620
When the jade cracks,

48
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,220
it means the clan is in trouble.

49
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,050
As the Saintess of the Fox Clan,

50
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,910
it's my duty to protect the Fox Clan.

51
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,760
But you're different.

52
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,050
You left the Fox Clan with me for three years

53
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,150
and are finally living a free and stable life.

54
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,960
I don't want you to be in danger.

55
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,840
I just hope you can be a carefree little girl

56
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,030
and live a happy life

57
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,270
with the person you love.

58
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,830
Rong Xian and Ling Long left one after the other.

59
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,159
I'm afraid that something will happen to the two tries today.

60
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,060
She really mistook me for Wu.

61
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,400
Fan Yue.

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,640
Is there really nothing we can change?

63
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,640
Is Ling Long pregnant?

64
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,440
Let's go to the Fox Clan.

65
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:09,040
[Kunlun]

66
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,360
Rong Xian.

67
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,880
The Sect Leader exhausted his spiritual power and died

68
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,290
to pass on his skills to you.

69
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,120
How dare you

70
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,420
betray your master

71
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,590
and the Kunlun Sect?

72
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,890
Betray my master and the sect?

73
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,180
The Kunlun Sect is so cruel and cold-blooded.

74
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,830
So what if I destroy it?

75
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,700
Rong Xian!

76
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,440
Stop!

77
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,490
Kunlun is wrong.

78
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,740
But only the Kunlun Sect Leader and those

79
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,070
four bastards deserve to die.

80
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,630
These disciples didn't hurt you.

81
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,370
Not everyone deserves to die!

82
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,980
Let me ask you then.

83
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,470
What did Ling Long and the child do wrong?

84
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,620
Mr. Rong Xian.

85
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,460
If you continue to kill,

86
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,340
there's no turning back.

87
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,250
Turn back?

88
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,660
I'm long past the point of return.

89
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,410
The Fox Clan was destroyed by me.

90
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,330
I've already made a big mistake.

91
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,880
I want this Kunlun Sect which deceived the world

92
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,030
to be buried with Ling Long and the child!

93
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,190
When I've killed those who deserve it,

94
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,590
I will accompany them to hell.

95
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,100
This child...

96
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,890
Could it be...

97
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,030
Ling Long!

98
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,530
Ling Long!

99
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,659
Ling Long!

100
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,920
Ling Long!

101
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,510
We're still too late.

102
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,990
Who slaughtered the Fox Clan?

103
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,830
Wu.

104
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,530
Thank goodness

105
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,710
you're alive.

106
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,840
It's Rong Xian.

107
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,360
Rong Xian slaughtered the Fox Clan.

108
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,110
All of this

109
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,960
is the Kunlun Sect's

110
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,040
fault.

111
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,690
Why?

112
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,810
Isn't Rong Xian an Eternal?

113
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,240
Wasn't Kunlun supposed to protect the people?

114
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,190
He killed the Fox Clan.

115
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,890
Why did he still have so much resentment

116
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,880
to create such a realm of resentment?

117
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,400
A realm of resentment?

118
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,600
Yes.

119
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,320
This is a realm of resentment.

120
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,740
Since everything is fake,

121
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,120
can life and death be reversed?

122
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,270
If we save Ling Long and the baby,

123
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,810
will there be a chance for change?

124
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,860
Ling Long is dead.

125
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,320
I can’t save her.

126
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,030
You only said you couldn’t save Ling Long.

127
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,630
So the baby can be saved?

128
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,840
This child has gathered almost

129
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,150
all of Ling Long's spiritual power.

130
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,090
He can be saved.

131
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,720
But this is just a realm of 
illusion.

132
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,710
They were already killed by Rong Xian.

133
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,180
Even if we go against fate

134
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,580
and save him,

135
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,960
what good will that do?

136
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,840
No.

137
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,330
If everything happened

138
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,990
as Rong Xian wished,

139
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,130
why did he still develop

140
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,490
such a strong resentment

141
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,270
and such a vivid realm of resentment?

142
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,180
You once asked me

143
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,060
what kind of person Rong Xian was.

144
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,490
I can see that

145
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,680
his love for Ling Long

146
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,660
was real.

147
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,360
A thousand years later,

148
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,950
what we heard was not the truth.

149
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,380
So what we see now

150
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,830
is not necessarily true.

151
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,990
If the Fox Clan was destroyed before Kunlun,

152
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,150
then who was the one

153
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,820
who destroyed Kunlun?

154
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,340
Fan Yue.

155
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,370
Save this child,

156
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,330
and everything may turn around.

157
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,080
Do you really want to save this child?

158
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,110
Rong Xian.

159
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,140
Ling Long loved you so much.

160
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,560
So why did you

161
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,550
slaughter the Fox Clan first

162
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,870
and then destroy the Kunlun Sect?

163
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,910
Shut up.

164
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,960
Shut up!

165
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,000
The Sect Leader of Kunlun altered his memories.

166
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,740
As a result, he hated the Fox Clan and the Saintess.

167
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,290
That’s why he slaughtered the Fox Clan.

168
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,710
When Saintess Ling Long died,

169
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,580
she used her blood

170
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,050
to recover his memories.

171
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,190
I see.

172
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,060
Rong Xian.

173
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,000
Look.

174
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,430
This is the child of you and Ling Long.

333

and the past couldn't be changed,

334
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,210

The Heart Flame has appeared.

351

This is the Heart Flame.

352
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,520
Is it really the Heart Flame?

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,880

Otherwise,

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,760
we wouldn't have switched identities

A man who has been dead for a thousand years

373

375
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,920
That's right!

376
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,730
Enough.

377
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,240
I didn't want it at first.

378
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,920
But now that you are

379
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,950
all fighting for it,

380
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,800
I won't part with it anymore.

381
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,960
Let me tell you.

382
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,520
Whoever dares to fight me for it

383
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,380
will be the enemy of Jingyou Mountain.

384
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,790
His aunt is Chang Mei.

385
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,930
Chang Mei is one of the Three Kings of the Demon Race.

386
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,630
She's quite formidable

387
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,810
and not easy to deal with.

388
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,430
You guys might be scared of Chang Mei,

389
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,600
but the Yunxiao Sect is not.

390
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,600
Kid.

391
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,120
Give me the second Heart Flame.

392
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,040
As you can see,

393
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,260
you can’t keep the Heart Flame for even half a day.

394
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,600
Why don’t you give it to me?

395
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,820
Why should I give it to you?

396
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,980
But this lady

397
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,560
saved me from chaos just now.

398
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,810
If you want it,

399
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,300
I can think about it.

400
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,480
Her?

401
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,860
No.

402
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,700
When you fought Rong Xian just now,

403
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,010
you obviously used spiritual power.

404
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,340
You are not a demon.

405
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,960
-Yes.
-You're an Outlander.

406
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,390
-An Outlander?
-What do you mean?

407
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,230
Yes.

408
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,380
My identity

409
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,650
has nothing to do with you.

410
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,490
Bright Moon Palace cheated.

411
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,210
How could it have nothing to do with us?

412
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,890
That's right.

413
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,180
That's right.

414
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,480
How can you cheat?

415
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,280
Master Fan.

416
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,480
You brought a human to the tournament.

417
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,650
We've put up with it.

418
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,640
Right?

419
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,870
Now you colluded with an Outlander to cheat.

420
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,730
How can we accept that?

421
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,400
Right?

422
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,720
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

423
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,240
Tian Huo left Outlanders' City seven years ago.

424
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,830
She's no longer informed about matters of Outlanders' City.

425
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,170
She's now taking the demonic path

426
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,250
and practicing demonic magic.

427
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,620
She joined the tournament as a demon.

428
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,570
What's wrong with that?

429
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,880
She can change her skillset,

430
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,270
but can she change her bloodline?

431
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,970
She is an Outlander

432
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,030
in her bones.

433
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,800
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

434
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,820
Ugly.

435
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,010
And you...

436
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,380
Purple Potato Spirit.

437
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,930
You failed to obtain the Heart Flame,

438
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,090
and now you're picking on her origins.

439
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,810
To think you were referring to yourselves

440
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,500
as elites among demons and Eternals.

441
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,810
I think you're all just

442
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,350
shameless!

443
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,040
-You want to die?
-You want to die?

444
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,880
What did you say?

445
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,740
Stop! Come here!

446
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,990
-Come here.
-Stop!

447
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,460
-Stop!
-Go after him!

448
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,960
-Stop!
-Stop!

449
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,310
He has the Heart Flame.

450
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,200
Aren't you going to chase him?

451
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,400
Don't let him escape.

452
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:13,920
Stop!

453
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,830
-Stop!
-Stop!

454
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,400
Stop!

455
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,270
Stop!

456
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,090
Stop!

457
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,590
Stop!

458
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,820
Stop!

459
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,390
Catch him!

460
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,560
Stop!

461
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,450
Bunch of idiots.

462
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,260
You'll never catch me.

463
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,810
The famous Lady Tian Huo of the Demon Race

464
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,540
is actually an Outlander.

465
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,560
Interesting.

466
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,170
Master.

467
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,830
Why don’t we take the Heart Flame

468
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,720
from Mu Jiu?

469
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,750
Master!

470
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,960
-Master!
-Master!

471
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,060
I’m fine.

472
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,320
I’m just a little injured.

473
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,080
That wasn't the best time to take the Heart Flame.

474
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,640
The third Heart Flame hasn't been found.

475
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,940
If we have both Heart Flames in our hands,

476
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,210
we will only become the next target.

477
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,270
Master.

478
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,430
What happened in the realm of resentment?

479
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,290
How did you get hurt so badly?

480
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,310
I'm fine.

481
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,240
I just expended some mana

482
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,050
changing fate in the realm of resentment.

483
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,430
Just some mana?

484
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,240
Even in the realm of resentment,

485
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,600
the price of changing fate

486
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,750
is a severe injury at best and death at worst.

487
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,200
You're speaking too lightly of it.

488
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,940
Master.

489
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,410
You have the Seven Stars Soul Burning Seal on you.

490
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,840
Why don’t you cherish yourself more?

491
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,830
Did you do all that

492
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,070
to save Bai Shuo?

493
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,760
I just wanted to escape the realm of resentment.

494
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,620
How could it have been to save Bai Shuo?

495
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,830
Then, does Bai Shuo know that

496
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,600
to destroy Rong Xian's realm of resentment,

497
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,870
you greatly damaged your spiritual power?

498
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,030
She doesn't know yet.

499
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,670
Don't mention it to her either.

500
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,920
-Yes.
-Yes.

501
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,350
[Please send help, Grand Master. From: Chong Zhao]

502
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,110
Senior.

503
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,930
You called?

504
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,300
We can't use magic to send letters within Outlanders' City.

505
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,580
Go outside the city

506
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,740
and send this letter

507
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,840
[To Sect Leader]

508
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,250
to our sect with your spiritual power.

509
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,780
Send a letter?

510
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,150
Why so sudden?

511
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,170
Within Outlanders' City,

512
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,310
be it that unknown monster,

513
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,510
Rong Xian's realm of resentment,

514
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,690
or that Tian Huo,

515
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,230
they are all too suspicious.

516
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,100
I'm afraid the Wutong Martial Arts Contest isn't just a simple contest.

517
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,550
Hurry back.

518
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,530
Don't let anyone find out.

519
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,080
[To Sect Leader]

520
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,730
[To Sect Leader]

521
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,450
[Please send help, Grand Master. From: Chong Zhao]

522
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:20,650
Your Majesty,

523
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,270
Chong Zhao did report to Lanling Sect.

524
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,650
Fortunately, I was prepared

525
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,560
and intercepted the letter.

526
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,530
Zhen Yu was right.

527
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,620
The Contemplation Stone

528
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,610
can indeed bring them into Rong Xian's realm of resentment.

529
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,430
A thousand years ago,

530
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,680
Rong Xian hated the Eternals and demons.

531
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,550
He brought Ling Long’s body

532
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,750
to Outlanders' City.

533
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,680
After burying his wife and child,

534
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,190
he committed suicide in front of the tomb

535
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,260
and left 1000 years of resentment.

536
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,920
No one managed to resolve it.

537
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,700
Fan Yue and Bai Shuo

538
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,290
thought they had resolved

539
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,660
Rong Xian's resentment.

540
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,390
But they don't know

541
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,530
that they're just paving the way for us.

542
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,310
Has Fu Ling's operation

543
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,100
started?

544
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,980
According to the plan,

545
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:01,860
it should start soon.

546
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,320
The Fenlan Banquet is in two days.

547
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,330
The moment the Eternals and demons enter the palace,

548
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,500
they will

549
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,880
never get to leave again.

550
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,480
The last banquet,

551
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,420
an arena of life and death.

552
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,500
I will give them the grandest funeral.

553
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,680
Master!

554
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,400
-Master!
-Master!

555
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,280
How could this happen?

556
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,170
Changing fate

557
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,410
is not a trivial matter.

558
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,360
I'm afraid it has hurt your core.

559
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,030
Bai Shuo learned some medical skills from Old Turtle.

560
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,000
Go get her.

561
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,000
Okay.

562
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,290
Master.

563
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,820
I brought the medicine.

564
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,250
Quick, treat our master.

565
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,460
What happened to him?

566
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
When did he get hurt?

567
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,420
You don't even know when he got hurt?

568
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,500
He used up so much demonic power

569
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,760
to reverse that child's fate

570
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,030
in the realm of resentment for you.

571
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:49,480
But you don't even...

572
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,030
Cang Shan.

573
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:58,550
[Rejuvenation Pill]

574
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,060
What is this pill?

575
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,480
Rejuvenation Pill.

576
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,130
Second grade.

577
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,150
It can replenish the spiritual core.

578
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,330
If you don't believe me,

579
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,560
then just watch him die.

580
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,370
It really works.

581
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,710
This pill is not enough.

582
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,140
We still need some medicine.

583
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,570
Go find the medicine in the city.

584
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,110
Prescriptions?

585
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,220
Fan Yue.

586
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,220
Save this child,

587
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,420
and everything may turn around.

588
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,600
Saving that child would damage your demonic power.

589
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,950
Why didn't you tell me that

590
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,130
in the realm of resentment?

591
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,430
Fan Yue,

592
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,550
what kind of person are you?

593
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,370
Tian Huo!

594
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,360
Cang Shan!

595
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,220
What's wrong?

596
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,890
Is your master awake?

597
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,290
We didn't hear him summon us.

598
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,550
He's not in the room.

599
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,920
Master?

600
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,620
Where is he?

601
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,900
He's injured and weak.

602
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,560
He could have at least brought me along.

603
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,210
There is no sign of an outsider entering.

604
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,000
He left the room by himself.

605
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,180
Let's split up and search.

606
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:48,660
Let's go.

607
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,350
This way.

608
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,750
Excuse me.

609
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,070
Take a look.

610
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,980
Be careful!

611
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,060
I'm sorry, Miss.

612
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,510
I didn't spend the whole night saving you

613
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,000
to let you get hit by a log.

614
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,160
Why didn't you dodge?

615
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,940
Why is he staring at me?

616
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,450
Is he angry because

617
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,460
I scolded him too harshly?

618
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,450
Since you're fine,

619
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,150
I'll go back first.

620
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,910
Does it hurt?

621
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,610
You're not Fan Yue.

622
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,960
Who are you?

623
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,350
You really don't remember your name?

624
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,030
What about

625
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,960
Bright Moon Palace?

626
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,640
The Demon King of the Polar Region?

627
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,770
Tian Huo and Cang Shan?

628
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,660
You must remember the Contemplation Stone, right?

629
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,750
What do you remember?

630
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,630
You.

631
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,780
You...

632
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,840
You remember who I am?

633
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,620
You are...

634
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,750
Someone kind

635
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,450
who saved me.

636
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,720
What's wrong with him?

637
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,470
I only fed him the Rejuvenation Pill last night.

638
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,520
Nothing wrong with that.

639
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,700
Is it because he was injured in the realm of resentment

640
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,670
and the nature was different,

641
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,220
so it changed the effect of the pill?

642
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,630
No.

643
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,380
Tian Huo and Cang Shan can never know that

644
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,810
I turned Fan Yue into a fool.

645
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,430
Otherwise, they will kill me.

646
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,270
Listen.

647
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,850
Your name is Fan Yue,

648
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,570
Demon King of Polar Region and Master of Bright Moon Palace.

649
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,650
Tian Huo and Cang Shan are your

650
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
two generals.

651
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,400
Your reputation

652
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,720
is known to the world,

653
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,810
and feared by everyone.

654
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,550
Your home is in Bright Moon Palace.

655
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,140
You spent a lot of money to build it.

656
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,480
It's very grand and luxurious,

657
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,070
just like your clothes.

658
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,970
And we are in Outlanders' City right now,

659
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,200
We're here to activate the Contemplation Stone.

660
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,960
We've searched the whole Outlanders' City,

661
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,220
but Master is nowhere to be found.

662
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,570
Is he back already?

663
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,710
Guests,

664
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:27,580
your master

665
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,560
came back long ago.

666
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,270
I saw

667
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,360
the human girl

668
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,430
drag him upstairs.

669
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,860
My name is Bai Shuo.

670
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm your...

671
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,350
Lover.

672
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,120
Did I say it too fast just now?

673
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,590
Let me repeat myself.

674
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,200
Bai Shuo.

675
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,240
I got it.

676
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,510
You promised to protect me.

677
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,820
Does it still count?

678
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,510
Yes.

679
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,200
A demon king's promise

680
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,070
cannot be broken.

681
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,540
I won't break it.

682
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,610
♫I'll fulfill this promise with my life♫

683
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,720
♫Once in a lifetime, forever♫

684
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,590
Why do you trust me so much?

685
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,230
♫Every starlight♫

686
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,290
When you saved me,

687
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,110
your eyes were full of concern.

688
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,290
♫Is a kiss from me to you♫

689
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,500
Although I can't remember who you are,

690
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,800
you must be the closest person to me.

691
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,430
That's why I trust you.

692
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,160
Shuo.

693
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,600
Master!

694
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,700
-Master!
-Master!

695
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,690
You...

696
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,370
What...

697
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,440
Oh no.

698
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,670
I haven't finished telling him everything.

699
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,590
Fan Yue lost his memory.

700
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,790
He doesn't remember them at all.

701
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,310
They'll find out as soon as he talks.

702
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:47,920
Bai Shuo.

703
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,460
How dare you seduce our master

704
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,500
while we're away?

705
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,910
I was...

706
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,020
I took the initiative.

707
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,260
Is there a problem?

708
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,400
If not,

709
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,330
you can leave now.

710
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,180
Since you are back safe and sound,

711
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,410
we'll leave now.

712
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:18,930
Close the door.

713
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,800
They must be

714
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,410
Tian Huo and Cang Shan, right?

715
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,610
You don't want to see them?

716
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,440
Why do you think so?

717
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,040
Because when they came in,

718
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,000
you looked anxious.

719
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,490
It seems that

720
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,940
even though he lost his memory,

721
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,140
he didn't become a fool.

722
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,710
He's still smart.

723
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,160
Remember.

724
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,220
Outlanders' City is dangerous.

725
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,820
Don't let anyone find out you lost your memory,

726
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,030
including them.

727
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,290
How about this?

728
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,010
I'll teach you.

729
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,800
Just remember these words:

730
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,280
♫We're destined to be together forever from the first sight♫

731
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,440
Stand straight,

732
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:06,490
talk less,

733
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,420
and look sharp.

734
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,070
♫Goodbye, loneliness♫

735
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,090
♫The one who was slightly late♫

736
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,449
Use a commanding tone when you talk to others,

737
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
like this.

738
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,380
Like this.

739
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:22,409
♫You came towards me, closer and closer♫

740
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,510
One more time.

741
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,650
Like this.

742
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:20,630
Stand straight.

743
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:23,380
Put this hand here.

744
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,679
♫You enriched my life♫

745
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,889
Don't you think something is wrong with Master?

746
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,760
Yes.

747
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,719
Bai Shuo slept in the Master's room

748
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,750
for one night.

749
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,000
Do you think

750
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,489
she drugged our Master?

751
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,469
What did you say?

752
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,340
Who slept in Fan Yue's room all night?

753
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,639
I...

754
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:46,969
Yes.

755
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,239
Like this.

756
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,199
You have to look colder

757
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:51,449
and more arrogant.

758
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,440
Your gaze must be sharper.

759
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,720
Master of Bright Moon,

760
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,740
please behave yourself.

761
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,110
-How dare you be rude to our master!
-Zhao.

762
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:05,800
It's not what you think.

763
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,330
Shuo is my woman.

764
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,070
I can do whatever I want.

765
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,060
It’s none of your business.

766
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,240
Let her go!

767
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,770
Zhao, you...

768
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,470
I only listen to Shuo.

769
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,070
If and when I'd let go

770
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,210
all depends on her words.

771
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,670
Fan Yue.

772
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,790
Let go.

773
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,770
That's too much.

774
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,080
Let go.

775
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,200
Come with me.

776
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:45,930
Master...

777
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,690
Get out.

778
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,380
Yes.

779
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:56,670
Close the door.

780
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,910
It's not what you think.

781
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,410
Fan Yue was injured saving someone in the illusion realm.

782
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,250
I took care of him all night.

783
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,190
Saving someone?

784
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,750
He is a Demon King.

785
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,410
He'd save someone?

786
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,130
He's not like what you think.

787
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,340
But he just...

788
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,520
Shuo.

789
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,370
When did you two become so close?

790
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,640
Fan Yue doesn't remember anything now.

791
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,940
Anyone can kill him.

792
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
I can't let anyone know that he lost his memory.

793
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,670
Close?

794
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,870
I just don't want to owe him anything.

795
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,550
In Outlanders' City, Eternals and demons are in conflict

796
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,590
while danger lurks everywhere.

797
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,620
Have you ever thought about withdrawing from the contest?

798
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,590
The contest is not the only chance.

799
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,590
If something happens to you in Outlanders' City,

800
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,960
you'll lose your life.

801
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,710
Be it returning favors or taking revenge,

802
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,410
I don't want to wait any longer.

803
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,450
Even if it's a cliff ahead,

804
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,690
I'll take the leap.

805
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,910
What if you'll be smashed to pieces?

806
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,090
Will you still jump?

807
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,260
Judging from the previous stories,

808
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,760
jumping off a cliff

809
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,210
will always be met with a miracle.

810
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,080
I might get a legendary weapon

811
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,380
or acquire a unique skill,

812
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,730
and then come back to slay my enemies

813
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,700
and get what I want.

814
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,270
Chong Zhao.

815
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,600
Wish me the same.

816
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,580
Wish me success

817
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,990
in getting what I want.

818
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,360
Must you stay?

819
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
I must stay.

820
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,280
I see.

821
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,200
So what can I do for you?

822
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,840
What did you do to Master?

823
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,780
I knew it.

824
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,500
It's easy to fool Cang Shan,

825
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,050
but not you.

826
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,110
Amnesia?

827
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,220
Lovers?

828
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,550
When Master regains his memory

829
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,790
and sees through your teasing,

830
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,130
he won't let you off easy.

831
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,680
Don't threaten me.

832
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,890
Your master only trusts me now.

833
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,540
If I'm unhappy,

834
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,820
I'll feed him one Rejuvenation Pill every day.

835
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,690
Let's see if he trusts me, his lover,

836
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,100
or you, his guardian.

837
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,840
Don't you dare.

838
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,970
Why not?

839
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,370
The Demon King as my lover?

840
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,710
What an honor.

841
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,700
If you still want to gather the Five Contemplations,

842
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,800
cure him as soon as possible.

843
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,280
You think I don't want to?

844
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,340
His current situation

845
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,500
is unexpected.

846
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,140
It takes time to cure him.

847
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,410
How long?

848
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,810
At least one or two days.

849
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,680
And at most?

850
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,700
I don't know yet.

851
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,630
You'd better not have

852
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,790
done this to him on purpose.

853
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,770
I have the same goal as Fan Yue.

854
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,950
Even now,

855
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,500
we are still allies.

856
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,250
I won't hurt him on purpose.

857
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,020
You only treat him as an ally?

858
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,130
What else?

859
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,400
I hope so.

860
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,450
Got hurt?

861
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,280
Tian Huo and Cang Shan

862
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,310
were secretly searching for herbs in the city.

863
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,790
They are all healing herbs.

864
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,860
I'm afraid only Fan Yue can make them

865
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,050
them so anxious.

866
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,380
Did he get hurt in Rong Xian's realm of resentment?

867
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,300
So,

868
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,420
Tian Huo is not with Fan Yue now.

869
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,220
Yes.

870
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,160
[Sihai Inn]

871
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,330
I just made it.

872
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,930
Are you really angry?

873
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,430
I was afraid Zhao would

874
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,620
find out you lost your memory.

875
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,730
-That's why... 
-You called him Zhao,

876
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,650
but you call me Fan Yue.

877
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,150
Because of this?

878
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,550
Mu.

879
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,480
I usually call you Mu,

880
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,070
because you have "Mu" in your written name.

881
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,870
But you are the Demon King of the Polar Region.

882
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,000
So I can't call you

883
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,540
by that name in front of others.

884
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,410
Mu.

885
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,910
♫The person standing far away♫

886
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,260
Take the medicine.

887
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:30,880
Mu.

888
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,570
♫Don't be afraid♫

889
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:38,850
♫The stars will guide you to me♫

890
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:46,020
♫Walk towards me♫

891
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,700
Good boy.

892
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:43,890
Have a good rest.

893
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,900
Sleep early.

894
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,390
Where are you going?

895
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:48,930
To my room.

896
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:51,130
♫My heart feels so...♫

897
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,520
There's a bed here.

898
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,590
Let's sleep together.

899
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:57,160
♫It's pounding as I wait for you♫

900
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,960
We can't sleep together.

901
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,230
Why not?

902
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,180
Look.

903
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,320
In this inn,

904
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,850
everyone gets a room.

905
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,890
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

906
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,800
Why is that so?

907
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,140
It's to give each other some space to be alone.

908
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,220
We're lovers.

909
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,260
Why should we be alone?

910
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,040
Love...

911
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,070
♫You are my distant call♫

912
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,320
Don't lovers

913
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,250
also need time to themselves?

914
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:15,040
♫You are my first and last♫

915
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,760
But distance makes the heart colder.

916
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,950
No.

917
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:14,710
Distance

918
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,770
makes the heart warmer.

919
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:21,900
♫My heart is trembling for you♫

920
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,460
But I want to...

921
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,040
No.

922
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,180
♫In this moment where we embrace each other♫

923
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,280
You don't want to.

924
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:29,980
♫Let's never let go♫

925
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,690
The more you trust me now,

926
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,760
the more you'll want to

927
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,850
tear me up when you recover.

928
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,570
The Demon King is the Demon King after all.

929
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,250
It's better to keep a distance.

930
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:42,920
Be good.

931
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,030
Sleep alone.

932
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:46,770
Watch out!

933
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,360
Did the Hua Lin send you here?

934
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,120
Princess.

935
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:19,820
The Master of Bright Moon

936
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,250
must die here in Outlanders' City.

937
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,620
If you don't want to die,

938
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:27,520
get lost!

939
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,200
Retreat!

940
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,150
Are we leaving

941
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,300
without completing our order?

942
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,250
General ordered us

943
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,460
not to hurt the Princess.

944
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,510
You took the knife for me.

945
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:49,330
You could have died, you know?

946
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,410
I'm fine.

947
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,650
I need to protect you.

948
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,020
I remember that.

949
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,710
I just said it casually.

950
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,440
You can't remember anything else,

951
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,900
but you remembered this?

952
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,010
I don't need to remember it.

953
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,000
Because I want to protect you.

954
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,360
Because I want to protect you.

955
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,690
You can't risk your life to protect me.

956
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,940
If something like this happens again,

957
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,230
protect yourself first.

958
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,260
Don't worry about me.

959
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,300
Do you hear me?

960
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,030
I'm asking you.

961
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,010
Do you hear me?

962
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,030
Your hand.

963
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,190
You're feeding him more pills?

964
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:40,760
What if...

965
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,440
You'll feel sleepy after taking the medicine.

966
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,060
Sleep when you're sleepy.

967
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:48,990
Don't wait for me.

968
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:52,840
Tian Huo and I

969
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,100
have something to talk about.

970
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,010
Tian Huo.

971
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,260
I didn't want to ask about your background,

972
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,040
But now monsters are rampant in the city,

973
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,710
Fenlan Banquet is around the corner,

974
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,370
and people just tried to assassinate Fan Yue.

975
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,360
The danger in the city is unpredictable.

976
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,380
We have to find a way to solve this.

977
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,330
I hope you can tell me

978
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,240
everything you know,

979
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,140
including your past.
