00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,890
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,910
[Episode 8]

19
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,360
Master.

20
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,680
I found the tomb of Qian Yin.

21
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,540
I found that he died

22
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,310
two days before my parents died.

23
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,560
If my parents hadn't been killed by Qian Yin,

24
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,200
they could still be alive, right?

25
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,030
Back then, I went deep into the Demon Race to kill Qian Yin,

26
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,180
only to learn he'd died in an internal power struggle.

27
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,370
I didn't even find where he was buried.

28
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,110
How did you find it?

29
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,520
Fu Ling told me.

30
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,210
Fu Ling from Cold Spring Palace?

31
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,400
Why did you get involved with a demon?

32
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,320
In Ning'an City, I thought she was a human.

33
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,570
I saved her life, so…

34
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,160
You fool!

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,210
How can you believe what a demon said?

36
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,280
Moreover, it's just a tombstone.

37
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,350
She must be on

38
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,730
something else.

39
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,480
Chong Zhao,

40
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,030
I know

41
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,130
you've never gotten over

42
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,640
your parents' deaths.

43
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,650
But as a disciple of Lanling,

44
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,730
you should know

45
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,740
once the soul lamp goes out,

46
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,980
there's no chance of living.

47
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,460
It's irreversible.

48
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,990
Besides,

49
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,900
if they were still alive,

50
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,200
why would they have left you

51
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,230
and never come back?

52
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,970
You should let it go.

53
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,520
West sun mountain.

54
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,170
East moon river.

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,450
A snake slithers across the grass.

56
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,760
A fish leaps above the sandy sea.

57
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,000
The earth knows, but the sky does not.

58
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,020
Only by stepping in can you find the way.

59
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,420
This is a nursery rhyme from the Desireless Stone?

60
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,260
I don't understand a single line of it.

61
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,360
"West sun mountain"

62
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,220
means the sun

63
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,130
is about to set from the west of the mountain.

64
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,350
"East moon river"

65
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,140
means the moon

66
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,180
is about to rise from the east of the sea.

67
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,810
The sun and the moon

68
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,060
are both visible at twilight.

69
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,990
What unusual sights might appear

70
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,250
in the desert at twilight?

71
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,020
A mirage?

72
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,420
That's what I thought too.

73
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,940
If it's a mirage,

74
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,590
then the snake and fish

75
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,790
should be just illusions.

76
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,200
What does it mean by a snake slithering across the grass?

77
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,850
You don't live among humans,

78
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,170
so you don't know about it.

79
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,950
It's a riddle of the Human Race.

80
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,820
A riddle?

81
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,850
In the human culture,

82
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,190
we have the zodiac.

83
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,550
The snake in the zodiac

84
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,570
corresponds to the "Si" in the Earthly Branches.

85
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,400
A snake slithering across the grass means "Si" slithering across the grass.

86
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,860
The character "Si," combined with the grass radical,

87
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,960
becomes the character "Yi," as in Yi City.

88
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,020
The Desireless Stone is telling me

89
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,280
this nursery rhyme is the key to finding Yi City.

90
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,890
Master,

91
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,130
if only we knew better about the human culture.

92
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,350
It's not surprising to find a snake in the desert,

93
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,900
but how do we explain a fish leaping above the sandy sea?

94
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,390
How could there be fish in the desert?

95
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,340
I still haven't figured that out.

96
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,670
Looks like

97
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,630
we need to see this mirage

98
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,070
for ourselves.

99
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,320
Turns out it's the city walls blocking the view.

100
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
People mistook the snake's tail for a fish's tail.

101
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,380
Just looking at the tail,

102
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,920
it looks like a giant fish leaping into the sandy sea.

103
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,310
Then what do the last two lines mean?

104
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,570
The earth knows, but the sky does not.

105
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,240
Only by stepping in can you find the way.

106
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,790
Maybe we can only find a clue

107
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,040
by going to the mirage site.

108
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,860
This is just the illusion of Yi City.

109
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,440
Where is the real Yi City?

110
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,160
What's wrong?

111
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,770
I can't explain it, but it feels strange.

112
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,390
Everything just seems too easy.

113
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,290
Oh no!

114
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,610
It's a sand formation!

115
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,610
Don't let go.

116
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,940
Hold on tight!

117
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,950
Hold on tight.

118
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,650
The suction is too strong.

119
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,020
I can't hold on much longer!

120
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,960
Don't worry.

121
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,790

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,140
I still have to correct you.

188
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,270
♫This sky for you♫

189
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,670
My life

190
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,220
has always been my own.

191
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,390
Thank you for following me,

192
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,180
risking your life without hesitation.

193
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,720
But without you,

194
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,800
I'd still save myself.

195
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,560
This must be the core of the sand formation.

196
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,550
I feel

197
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,030
the entrance to the city is right here.

198
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,360
Hold on to me.

199
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,290
Hold on to my sleeve.

200
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,900
Stick close to me.

201
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,620
Don't go anywhere or act rashly.

202
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,630
There may be other formations.

203
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,350
[Hua Lin, King of Yi]

204
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,630
I didn't expect the Master of Bright Moon Palace to visit.

205
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,290
I apologize for not welcoming you properly.

206
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,780
Yi City has been locked down for seven years,

207
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,790
yet you recognize me.

208
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,100
Seven years of locking the city

209
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,670
doesn't mean we're out of touch with the world.

210
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,940
You're famous far and wide.

211
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,080
I've long

212
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,350
heard of your name.

213
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,670
In that case,

214
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,400
that sand formation earlier

215
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,240
was your way of welcoming me?

216
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,020
Yi City has been oppressed

217
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,310
by Eternals and demons for a thousand years.

218
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,540
The sand formation

219
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,990
is just for defensive purposes.

220
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,260
This young lady

221
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,090
is very smart.

222
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,600
Your courage is commendable.

223
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,110
In the face of life and death,

224
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,680
you remained calm

225
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,590
and saw through the pattern of the formation.

226
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,300
I must say, I'm impressed.

227
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,670
I'm not particularly smart or wise,

228
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,060
and I'm not fearless either.

229
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,700
I just know

230
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,730
there's another way to live in this world.

231
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,590
It's called "live after death."

232
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,720
No wonder Master Fan Yue

233
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,840
risked his own life to save you.

234
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,010
I've come here to tell you

235
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,700
that within three days,

236
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,030
you should send invitations

237
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,950
to all Eternals and demons

238
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,940
for the Wutong Martial Arts Contest.

239
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,270
Why?

240
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,770
You should know

241
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,520
Bright Moon Palace

242
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,560
is a place no one dares to trespass in the Polar Region.

243
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,240
King of Yi, if you agree,

244
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,570
I'll allow Yi City to move into the Polar Region

245
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,500
under my protection.

246
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,060
But if not,

247
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,000
I doubt you have time

248
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,990
to move the city within three days.

249
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,970
The easy way

250
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,420
and the hard one

251
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,810
are both in front of you.

252
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,930
You choose.

253
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,820
Your Majesty,

254
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:08,650
back then,

255
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,560
the first King of Yi

256
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,580
agreed to host the Wutong Martial Arts Contest

257
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,450
to earn the respect of Eternals and demons

258
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,910
for peaceful coexistence.

259
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,450
We've held the Contest for a thousand years

260
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,570
and put in a lot of effort,

261
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,690
but they still look down on us.

262
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,140
If we hold the Contest again,

263
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,290
the people in the city

264
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,540
[Wu Zhao, Deputy General of Yi City]

265
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,620
will complain more.

266
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,850
Although the protection

267
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,070
the Master of Bright Moon Palace

268
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,180
offers seems tempting,

269
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,140
we don't truly know

270
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,900
his real intentions.

271
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,760
We must not trust him so easily.

272
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,220
I know that.

273
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,270
But now, Yi City is exposed.

274
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,620
Moving the city in three days

275
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,720
is simply impossible.

276
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,800
If the Eternals and demons

277
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,390
discover Yi City's location,

278
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,010
the secrets of the city

279
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,550
can no longer be hidden.

280
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,830
Whether I agree or not,

281
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,650
it will be troublesome.

282
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,560
King of Yi.

283
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,850
Zhen Yu?

284
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,490
Long time no see.

285
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,880
Is this how you welcome your guests?

286
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,460
Zhen Yu.

287
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,700
How did you find this place?

288
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,070
Was it difficult?

289
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,810
If Fan Yue could find it,

290
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,050
it would be

291
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,380
a piece of cake for me.

292
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,840
What do you want?

293
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,940
Why are you so vigilant?

294
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,020
I came here today

295
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,050
to help Yi City.

296
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,760
I can help you keep the secrets

297
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,310
you wish to keep

298
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,250
and solve

299
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,190
the problems

300
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,580
you want to solve.

301
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,170
Every deal

302
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,470
has its price.

303
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,770
What do you want?

304
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,610
Straight to the point.

305
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,330
You must have heard of

306
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,220
the Desireless Stone.

307
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,600
Sect Leader,

308
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,670
are we about to attack Bright Moon Palace?

309
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,540
I've decided on the moves. Look.

310
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,760
Calm down.

311
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,710
Sit down first.

312
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,710
Alright.

313
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,600
Today,

314
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,030
I've gathered everyone here to discuss another matter.

315
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,230
King of Yi has sent an invitation.

316
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,930
He's invited all Eternals and demons

317
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,640
to go to Yi City

318
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,730
[and strengthen the bonds between the three races. We invite the esteemed guests of Lanling to join us in Yi City.]

319
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,730
[On the 15th of this month, the Wutong Martial Arts Contest will be held to test the abilities of Eternals and demons]

320
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,700
for the Wutong Martial Arts Contest.

321
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,980
He wants to ease

322
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,230
[and strengthen the bonds between the three races. We invite the esteemed guests of Lanling to join us in Yi City.]

323
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,230
[On the 15th of this month, the Wutong Martial Arts Contest will be held to test the abilities of Eternals and demons]

324
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,510
the relationship between the Yi citizens and the two races.

325
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,050
The Contest hasn't been held for seven years.

326
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,920
They just hold it and cancel it

327
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,920
as they please.

328
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,750
Are we fools in their eyes?

329
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,780
I won't go!

330
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,760
That's right.

331
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,340
Seven years ago, King of Yi suddenly canceled the Contest,

332
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,190
which led to more fighting between the Eternals and demons.

333
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,960
If Eternals enter Yi City,

334
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,640
they'll surely get into fights with demons.

335
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,130
Lanling

336
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,640
doesn't need to get into that mess.

337
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,590
Don't rush to object.

338
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,720
Let me finish.

339
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,020
The winner of the Contest

340
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,140
will get the Wutong Spirit Pill.

341
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,230
How could I forget that?

342
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,840
If that's the case,

343
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,570
maybe we should reconsider.

344
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,100
The Wutong Spirit Pill is a rare spiritual treasure.

345
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,160
It can greatly enhance cultivation.

346
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,300
Even if we don't need it,

347
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,770
we can sell it to other Eternal sects.

348
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,400
It'd be enough to support us for three years.

349
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,250
Three years?

350
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,050
It would last us ten years!

351
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,020
Since no one has any objections,

352
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,210
then

353
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,180
Chong Zhao will lead the team.

354
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,480
Yes, Master.

355
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,470
But...

356
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,690
Don't worry,

357
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,230
I haven't forgotten about the Desireless Stone.

358
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,090
The Contest this time

359
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,200
is not only for the Eternals.

360
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,570
Bright Moon Palace, Jingyou Mountain, and other demon clans

361
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,690
are also invited.

362
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,730
Bai Shuo, eager to grow stronger,

363
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,550
will likely attend it as well.

364
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,810
We can wait for her in Yi City

365
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,740
instead of searching for her in the Polar Region.

366
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,160
Isn't that much easier?

367
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,230
Then I'll go!

368
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,250
Calm down.

369
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,680
Yi City has a restriction formation.

370
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,030
Even the strongest Eternals and demons

371
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,490
can't use their magic there.

372
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,510
They can only rely on physical strength.

373
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,260
So whether you go or Chong Zhao goes,

374
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,690
it makes no difference.

375
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,839
Chong Zhao,

376
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,130
the Wutong Contest

377
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,440
is not just a simple martial arts competition.

378
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,050
It's a comprehensive test

379
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,000
of strength, intelligence,

380
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,510
temperament, and character.

381
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,030
So, going to Yi City

382
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,380
will certainly be dangerous.

383
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,310
Remember,

384
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,610
bringing Bai Shuo back is secondary.

385
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,480
The most important thing is to protect your fellow disciples.

386
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,990
Understood, Master.

387
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,990
This is my Cangxuan Sword.

388
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,080
It has a century-old sword spirit

389
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,180
and will be useful at a crucial moment.

390
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,760
Thank you, Master.

391
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,000
I never said I was giving it to you.

392
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,290
But if it's useful,

393
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,140
then take it.

394
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,760
Thank you, Master.

400

401

and has always despised Eternals and demons.

Master has figured out Yi City's location,

403
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,140
but he's agreed to our terms too easily.

404
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,180
Once the city gates are open,

405
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,950
whether it's a conspiracy or something else,

406
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,620
I'll be right there to see it through.

407
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,300
Grand Master,

408
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,510
King of Yi has already sent out invitations

409
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,370
to all Eternals and demons for the Wutong Contest.

410
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,910

411
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,310

412

414
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,470

415
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,360
Even if they fight to the death,

416
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,160
what difference will it make?

417
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,510
In the end,

418
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,180
they'll all fall into my hands.

419
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,170
But...

420
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,620

I'll teach you a lesson after we get back!

427
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,480
This is Yi City, huh?

428
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,090
It really looks different.

429
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,400
These Yi citizens

430
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,940
are surprisingly

431
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:07,930
strong.

432
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,930
They don't seem to welcome us.

433
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,710
Yi citizens have been at loggerheads with Eternals and demons for over 1,000 years.

434
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,570
Eternals and demons look down on them,

435
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,880
and they despise

436
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,310
Eternals and demons.

437
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,880
When we're in Yi City,

438
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,550
don't leave my sight.

439
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,180
If you die, the Desireless Stone will be useless.

440
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,600
Just take care of yourself.

441
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,470
The city gates have opened.

442
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,970
The Eternals will arrive soon.

443
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,640
You took their Desireless Stone.

444
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,000
They can't wait to kill you.

445
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,610
The Eternals will come, so what?

446
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,130
Their power will be restricted too.

447
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,310
Even if it wasn't,

448
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,030
Bright Moon Palace

449
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,470
wouldn't be afraid of those Eternals.

450

451
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,030
In Yi City,

452
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,820
Eternals and demons can't use their magic.

453
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,470
Then why the Contest?

454
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,090
With punches, kicks, swords,

455
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,040
and clubs,

456
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,530
we can still fight.

457
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,650
So in Yi City,

458
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,940
one can only rely on weapons and physical strength.

459
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,720
Neither Eternals nor demons can use magic.

460
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,890
That gives me a better chance of winning.

461
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,180
Stop dreaming.

462
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,710
Even without magic,

463
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,970
I can still easily

464
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,150
hold you in my palm.

465
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,940

472
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,460
You shouldn't stay with demons,

473
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,040
and you shouldn't have come here.

474
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,950
Who I stay with

475
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,010
and where I go

476
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,690
are my decisions to make.

477
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,190
Demons can't be trusted.

478
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,300
We're not here to fight.

479

480
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,130
Since there's a "we,"

481
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,290
don't pick the wrong side.

482
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,080

The Eternals can't give me what I want.

00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,920
I insist.

561
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,410
We Eternals believe that

562
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,520
from one breath, three purities are born.

563
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,680
As…

564
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,440
As Eternals, we should restrain our evil desires,

565
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,180
clear out the bad energy,

566
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,260
and make it pure again.

567
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,350
My Eternal friends,

568
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,960
stop arguing.

569
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,470
Come on.

570
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,900
Let's recite

571
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,030
the Scripture of Forgetting Emotions.

572
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,340
-Forgetting emotions…
-Shut up!

573
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,490
I can't stand you Eternals and your scriptures!

574
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,270
All you do

575
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,110
is waste time!

576
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,200
-Exactly.
-You…

577
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,920
We're all here for the Wutong Martial Arts Contest,

578
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,920
so why fight over something pointless?

579
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,770
Bah!

580
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,580
The Eternals from Kunlun

581
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,750
are the most hypocritical.

582
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,430
You guys

583
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,160
are cruel and bloodthirsty.

584
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,070
Since Eternals and demons can't get along,

585
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,350
why do they have to stay in the same inn?

586
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,070
It's the tradition of the Contest.

587
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,710
The former King of Yi wanted to help the three races reconcile

588
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,820
and set the rules with the heads of the other two races

589
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,930
for Eternals, demons, and Yi citizens to stay together.

590
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,260
But I think this rule is just for show.

591
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,410
Once sides are taken,

592
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,700
right or wrong doesn't matter,

593
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,170
and the fighting never ends.

594
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,120
Nonsense!

595
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,060
It's your Saintess…

596
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,350
Eternals and demons

597
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,640
are not nobler than one another.

598
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,050
You can't insult the Saint!

599
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,120
Everyone, stop arguing!

600
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,370
What's the point of fighting over the rooms?

601
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,980
Lanling has old ties with many sects.

602
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,620
Please listen to me.

603
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,220
Look who's here.

604
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,170
Isn't that

605
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,510
Chong Zhao, the Eternal who couldn't even

606
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,260
guard Ning'an City?

607
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,180
They call you the head disciple of Lanling.

608
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,440
But you're weak and incompetent,

609
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,330
causing chaos in the whole city.

610
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,550
If I were you,

611
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,850
I'd have already buried myself in a hole.

612
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,150
You don't deserve to come here

613
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,900
and fight with us for the Wutong Spirit Pill.

614
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,520
Nan Wan!

615
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,620
That's nonsense!

616
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,960
If Chong Zhao doesn't deserve to be here,

617
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,430
then do you?

618
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,870
You guys are Eternals,

619
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,850
but instead of protecting the people,

620
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,350
you're here fighting

621
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,370
and arguing.

622
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,880
Is that what Eternals do?

623
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,900
You're just a human.

624
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,350
How dare you lecture me?

625
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,440
You're dead!

626
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,110
Senior!

627
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,260
Senior.

628
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,520
You know where to seek protection, don't you?

629
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,430
With someone like you around,

630
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,540
if I don't make use of it,

631
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,890
it'd be an ungodly waste.

632
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,180
Are you alright?

633
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,480
Senior.

634
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,150
Who are you?

635
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,580
Tell me your name!

636
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,990
Forgot to mention.

637
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,940
The top-tier rooms

638
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,830
are all mine.

639
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,790
Who do you think you are?

640
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,960
Senior, calm down.

641
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,160
He's so powerful.

642
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,960
Forget it.

643
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,230
The second-tier rooms will do too.

644
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,830
Forget it.

645
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,180
Why are you laughing?

646
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,490
Nothing.

647
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,200
It just feels good to boss around

648
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,110
under your wings.

649
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,310
I'll do it more often.

650
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,900
Not anyone can stay by my side.

651
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:23,070
Kill them! Kill them!

652
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,440
Go!

653
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,040
Kill them! Kill them!

654
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,390
Kill them! Kill them!

655
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,390
Kill them! Kill them!

656
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,200
Kill them! Kill them!

657
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,670
Kill those Eternals and demons!

658
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,780
Yes, kill them!

659
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:42,910
Kill them!

660
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,080
Hey, bro,

661
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,090
what are you...

662
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,520
Bah!

663
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,010
Don't call me bro.

664
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,990
Eternals, demons—

665
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,340
none of you guys are any good.

666
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,720
[Hu's mother, a Yi citizen]

667
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,370
You brought this disease

668
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,950
into the city.

669
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,110
You all deserve to die!

670
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,000
Kill them!

671
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!

672
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,830
Disease?

673
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,510
[Hu, a Yi citizen]

674
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,100
Chong Zhao.

675
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,410
What's wrong with this kid?

676
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,540
It doesn't look like an ordinary illness.

677
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,790
Cut the crap!

678
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,880
These Eternals and demons

679
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,050
never cared about the lives of Yi citizens.

680
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,830
If we kill them,

681
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,920
the kid can be saved!

682
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,800
Right, kill them! Kill them!

683
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,240
Please, calm down.

684
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,530
Enough.

685
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,090
Yi citizens

686
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,250
are all lowlifes.

687
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,750
How dare you talk like that?

688
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,700
Their king

689
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,980
invited us to the Contest.

690
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,940
Not only did they fail to host us properly,

691
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,240
but now they're actually

692
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,800
messing with us.

693
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,190
Fine.

694
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,200
Bring it on.

695
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,810
I'd like to see

696
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,320
what you can do

697
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,320
with us today!

698
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,510
Watch your mouth!

699
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,200
Come on. Bring it on!

700
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,790
We'll kill you all!

701
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,040
I'm actually with him on this one.

702
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,820
I was just getting started.

703
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,570
I can't wait to see which one of you has a death wish

704
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,910
and wants to try your luck with me.

705
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,410
Come on!

706
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,960
Hu.

707
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,740
Hu.

708
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,770
Hu, wake up!

709
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,590
Hu!

710
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,230
Listen.

711
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,700
Take her away.

712
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,840
If she dies here,

713
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,930
we can't stay in this inn anymore.

714
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,090
The situation is not clear yet.

715
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,910
It's no good for you to be kind now.

716
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,550
Hu.

717
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,420
Hu!

718
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,500
Kunlun is skilled in medicine.

719
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,790
Do you know how to treat him?

720
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,970
I've never seen a disease like this before.

721
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,140
Why are you still there?

722
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,340
Take her away!

723
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,710
Don't bring bad luck to us.

724
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,020
I knew it.

725
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,930
None of you Eternals and demons are any good.

726
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,000
Get out!

727
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,150
Get out! Get out!

728
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:42,970
Hu.

729
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,910
Hu.

730
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,320
Hu, hang in there!

731
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,030
Hu.

732
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,400
Hu.

733
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,720
Don't sleep.

734
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,750
Don't sleep!

735
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,500
Hu, wake up!

736
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,750
Hu, wake up!

737
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,750
Hang in there!

738
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,660
Hu.

739
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,390
Hu, wake up!

740
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,590
Hu, don't sleep.

741
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,030
Hu!

742
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,110
Wake up, Hu!

743
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,340
What's that?

744
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,530
I'm a human,

745
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,870
not an Eternal or a demon.

746
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,070
This pill can save her.

747
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,620
Even if you're a human,

748
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,420
you came here with Eternals and demons,

749
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,410
so you're definitely with them.

750
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,270
You can believe me or not.

751
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,880
For me,

752
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,040
whether I save her or not,

753
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,300
it's no loss either way.

754
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,570
What's more important,

755
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,500
your child's life or hatred?

756
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,820
You choose.

757
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,050
Mom.

758
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,630
-It worked.
-She's awake.

759
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,140
Hu.

760
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,370
Bai Shuo

761
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,950
did learn something from Old Turtle.

762
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,460
Her pills are great,

763
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,890
but she's still

764
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,010
too soft-hearted.

765
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,050
Thanks

766
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,570
for the pill.

767
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,970
Earlier,

768
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,400
I was wrong about you.

769
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,590
It's fine.

770
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,590
I don't care.

771
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,220
Take her home for some rest.

772
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,980
Look.

773
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,980
Heart flame. That's the heart flame.

774
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,750
The first heart flame has appeared.

775
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,250
I've never seen one before.

776
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,070
Why did it appear?

777
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,239
Why is it landing on her?

778
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,810
Why is it landing on her?

779
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,380
-Yeah.
-Why?

780
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:27,659
Wait.

781
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,650
What are you doing?

782
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,460
What are you doing?

783
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,650
That's the heart flame!

784
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,889
I can see it.

785
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:32,949
Chong Zhao.

786
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,250
Look.

787
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,550
Maybe after Bai Shuo saved the Yi child,

788
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,170
the heart flame sensed it and responded.

789
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,270
That's nonsense!

790
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,080
Maybe this human planned it

791
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,530
with those Yi citizens from the start.

792
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,810
How could she get the heart flame with just a pill?

793
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,350
That's cheating.

794
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,659
Cheating, cheating!

795
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,929
That's the first heart flame.

796
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,210
Whether it's taken by the Eternals

797
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,350
or the demons,

798
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:53,929
it can't

799
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,770
be taken

800
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,830
by a human!

801
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,030
Exactly!

802
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,420
Why can't a human

803
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,450
have the heart flame?

804
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,800
This Contest is for Eternals and demons.

805
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,220
The Human Race doesn't even have the right to attend it!

806
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,490
Is that so?

807
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,140
I'm here in Yi City with her.

808
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,600
That gives her the right!

809
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,500
Not convinced?

810
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,130
Come fight me.

811
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,290
You...

812
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,030
Senior.

813
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,100
Why are you sticking up for her?

814
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,220
Why?

815
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,470
You just got to Yi City.

816
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,360
Why are you already at each other's throats?

817
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,280
I'm Wu Zhao.

818
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,860
I'm the deputy general under King of Yi.

819
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,240
Welcome to Yi City

820
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,580
to attend

821
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,630
the Wutong Martial Arts Contest.

822
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,800
You've come at the right time.

823
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,190
I've got one question.

824
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,900
What gives her, a human,

825
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,010
the right to take the heart flame?

826
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,730
Before the Master of Bright Moon Palace came,

827
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,230
he'd notified the King

828
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,400
that a human would contend in the competition.

829
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,850
The King gave his approval.

830
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,370
Isn't that right,

831
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,520
Master?

832
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,360
-Master?
-Master?

833
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,540
He's the Master of Bright Moon Palace?

834
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,890
He's come to Yi City in person.

835
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,140
We don't stand a chance.

836
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,440
The Wutong Contest

837
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,730
has already begun the moment

838
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,950
you entered the city.

839
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,270
There are three heart flames.

840
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,610
The first gives rise to the second,

841
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,120
the second to the third.

842
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,350
The first two heart flames

843
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,730
are naturally generated

844
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,920
and choose their owners themselves.

845
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,630
But the third heart flame

846
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,750
must be kindled by the King

847
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,100
along with the Eternals and demons

848
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,600
by burning Wutong branches

849
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,240
at the Fenlan Banquet.

850
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,930
The one who collects all three heart flames

851
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,760
will be the victor of the Wutong Contest

852
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,620
and receive the Wutong Spirit Pill.

853
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,120
This has been the rule for the past thousand years.

854
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,410
I hope I've answered

855
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,860
your question.

856
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,850
The heart flame chooses its owner.

857
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,380
No one can interfere.

858
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,470
Magic is forbidden in Yi City.

859
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,860
Eternals and demons are equals here.

860
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,000
I wish

861
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,290
you all

862
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,760
a victorious start

863
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,240
and an enjoyable return.

864
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,470
Come up.

865
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:20,890
Shuo.

866
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,300
Chong Zhao.

867
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,800
Let's settle down too.

868
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,550
Okay.

869
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,330
Brother,

870
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,340
among the Three Kings of the Demon Race,

871
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,430
the Master of Bright Moon Palace is the most powerful.

872
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,860
What do you think we should do?

873
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,140
If we don't show some goodwill,

874
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,990
we may offend him.

875
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,350
But if we do show goodwill,

876
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,800
we may upset the heads of Jingyou Mountain

877
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,320
and Cold Spring Palace.

878
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,860
Let's stay neutral.

879
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,970
The more neutral, the better.

880
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,720
After all,

881
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,110
we're here for the Contest,

882
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,850
right?

883
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,890
Yeah.

884
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,760
We just

885
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,580
won't ask questions

886
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,480
or get involved.

887
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,630
Right.

888
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,820
No questions. No involvement.

889
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,970
But why has the Master of Bright Moon Palace

890
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,150
brought a human with him?

891
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,810
What did I just say?

892
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,060
No questions!

893
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,080
Got it?

894
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,390
Yes.

895
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,460
No questions.

896
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,580
No questions.

897
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,660
Let's go.

898
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,850
Go.

899
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,360
Let's go.

900
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,630
Don't you think everything

901
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,110
is going a bit too smoothly?

902
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,550
Eternals and demons just entered the city.

903
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,220
Before they even got to grab a bite,

904
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,680
a kid fell ill,

905
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,920
and a bunch of Yi citizens rushed over, throwing accusations.

906
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,690
It happened so fast,

907
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,150
almost like someone planned it beforehand.

908
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,330
Go on.

909
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,580
Then I saved that kid

910
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,640
and got the first heart flame.

911
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,980
It's said the heart flame chooses its owner,

912
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,750
but why do I feel like

913
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,710
someone's intentionally

914
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,500
given this heart flame to me?

915
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,060
You've gotten smarter.

916
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,120
What I want to hear isn't praise.

917
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,610
Giving the first heart flame to you

918
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,810
would make you the target of both Eternals and demons.

919
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,840
Everyone will have their eyes on you.

920
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,020
No matter who's pulling the strings behind the scenes,

921
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,760
the game has already begun.

922
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,100
And,

923
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,370
it's more interesting than I expected.

924
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,210
This isn't a conspiracy.

925
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,480
It's a blatant scheme.

926
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,510
Bai Shuo,

927
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,990
they're coming for you.

928
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,940
But to be exact,

929
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,750
they're after the Desireless Stone.

930
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,600
It's the Desireless Stone again.

931
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,510
Looks like

932
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,510
I'll have to turn defense into offense.

933
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,080
If someone's targeting me,

934
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,340
they'll definitely make moves behind my back.

935
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,520
[Sihai Inn]

936
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,660
I saved your life once.

937
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,510
Is this how you treat someone who saved your life?

938
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,210
You're a demon, and I'm an Eternal.

939
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,060
We're on different paths.

940
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,360
The truth about my parents' deaths,

941
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,550
I'll find it out myself.

942
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,990
If I worked with a demon

943
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,340
to uncover the truth,

944
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,980
my parents would turn in their graves!

945
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,570
Chong Zhao,

946
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,680
remember what you said today.

947
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:15,560
From now on,

948
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,430
whatever you want,

949
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,860
I'll take it from you.

950
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,960
You refuse to work with me.

951
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,540
Then let's see how long you can hold out.

952
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:21,380
Get out!

953
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,840
Don't make me fight you.

954
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,810
You're the one who should leave.

955
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,700
What do you mean?

956
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,890
Don't say I didn't warn you.

957
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,320
Yi City is dangerous.

958
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,420
Don't let those old fools from Lanling

959
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,160
end up holding your funeral.

960
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,270
Chong Zhao,

961
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,290
it's me.

962
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,470
Get out.

963
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,560
What?

964
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:43,730
Are you worried

965
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,280
Bai Shuo will see me?

966
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,440
Or

967
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,590
are you afraid you won't be able to explain things to her?

968
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,900
Get lost!

969
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,540
What's that sound?

970
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,600
A cat.

971
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,060
Shuo.

972
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,800
Have you changed your mind?

973
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,920
You're willing to go back with me?

974
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,320
I came to ask

975
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,190
what happened to Old Turtle after I left.

976
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,840
He's fine.

977
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,070
He was just punished to make

978
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,320
an extra hundred pills every month.

979
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,880
Nothing else?

980
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,680
No.

981
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,920
I'm glad he's fine.

982
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,020
Shuo.

983
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,210
There's nothing else you want to say to me?

984
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,130
What more

985
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,770
can I say?

986
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,020
I've said it before,

987
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,500
we're no longer on the same path.

988
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,560
If that's true,

989
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,080
why did you speak up for me just now?

990
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,920
We spent ten years together.

991
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,880
To hide your identity,

992
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,190
you always pretended to be weak.

993
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,050
Helping you

994
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,950
seems to have become a habit of mine.

995
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,140
I forgot again just now.

996
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,810
You're an Eternal from Lanling.

997
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,760
You don't need me to stand up for you.

998
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,000
Shuo.

999
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,220
While I was in Lanling, I heard some things.

1000
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,150
I know you did all that back in Ning'an City to protect me,

1001
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,550
and I know you endured 300 lashes.

1002
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,880
But Chong Zhao,

1003
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,380
I can't thank you.

1004
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,700
Then,

1005
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,280
do you hate me?

1006
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,110
No.

1007
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,810
The demon poison wasn't your doing,

1008
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,020
nor did you cause my father's death.

1009
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,500
You were just wrong

1010
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,090
in taking my life too seriously.

1011
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,490
To protect me, you almost ruined a whole city.

1012
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,670
Have you ever thought

1013
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,040
even if I survived,

1014
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,360
how would I live with all of this

1015
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,500
after knowing the truth?

1016
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,240
It was all my fault.

1017
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:36,840
I was too confident,

1018
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,660
and the demons made use of it.

1019
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,480
I'm sorry.

1020
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,260
But I…

1021
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,320
I really didn't expect things

1022
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,860
to end up like that.

1023
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,830
I know you didn't mean it,

1024
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,010
so I don't want to blame you anymore.

1025
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,710
Can we

1026
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,600
go back to the way we used to be?

1027
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:02,620
♫That year, that year♫

1028
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,430
Everything in Ning'an City is over now.

1029
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,480
♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

1030
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,390
You're no longer that steamed bun boy,

1031
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,440
♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

1032
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,010
and I'm no longer that

1033
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,730
devil-may-care girl.

1034
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,950
♫They unfold, one page after another♫

1035
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:17,870
♫That year, that year♫

1036
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,430
I'll walk my own way.

1037
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,660
♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

1038
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:19,450
You too.

1039
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,610
Shuo.

1040
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:25,530
♫Falling to the mud, burying the memories♫

1041
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,320
What about you and Fan Yue?

1042
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,130
♫Layer after layer♫

1043
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,120
What exactly…

1044
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,890
♫Another year passed♫

1045
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,530
is your relationship now?

1046
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,640
Both of us need the power of the Desireless Stone.

1047
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,070
It's just cooperation.

1048
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:40,740
♫Another year passed♫

1049
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,670
He's been protecting you.

1050
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,030
What he's been protecting

1051
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,400
is the Desireless Stone.

1052
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,530
You chatted for a long time.

1053
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,810
You're a Demon King,

1054
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,140
yet you eavesdrop?

1055
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,100
I wouldn't stoop to something like that.

1056
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:01,860
What you wanted to ask him

1057
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,080
and what you'd say,

1058
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,530
I don't need to listen to know.

1059
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,980
You think you know me very well?

1060
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,880
At least better than he does.

1061
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:13,700
Since you're on different paths,

1062
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,510
don't waste time on all this sentimentality.

1063
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,330
The night has fallen.

1064
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,480
It's time to explore the city.
