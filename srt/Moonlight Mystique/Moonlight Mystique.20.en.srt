00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Moonlight Mystique]

18
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,990
[Episode 20]

19
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,770
Thank you for your help, Grand Master.

20
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,060
If it weren't for you, Grand Master,

21
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,380
I, Chen Ye, would have been killed by Jing Lei.

22
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,080
Being humble

23
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,330
doesn't seem

24
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,580
to match you well.

25
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,670
You knew for a fact

26
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,900
that I won't let you die,

27
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,160
That's why you dared to

28
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,060
head to the Cold Spring Palace.

29
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,990
Originally, if we kill a few more humans,

30
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,860
the evil insect could have been transmuted.

31
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,180
Unfortunately,

32
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,460
the old guy in Lanling interrupted me.

33
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,320
Enough.

34
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,079
The Supreme Eternal

35
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,600
came in person to capture you.

36
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,790
You're considered prestigious now.

37
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,820
But don't you think it's strange, Grand Master?

38
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,030
We've been very careful.

39
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,500
How could he know it in advance?

40
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,940
Besides,

41
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,750
how could he recognise

42
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,250
that I'm from the Cold Spring Palace?

43
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,410
Unless...

44
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,000
Chong Zhao is also from Lanling.

45
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,410
It's about time

46
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,030
the both of them return.

47
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,130
Why are you still here?

48
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,320
I didn't hurt the people from the Fox Clan.

49
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Shuo.

50
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,050
I should have told you some things earlier.

51
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,329
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,779
So are you going to tell me

53
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,890
why you wanted to enter the Cold Spring Palace?

54
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,580
If I say it's for Lanling,

55
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:25,860
would you believe me?

56
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,350
Young Lord,

57
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,310
Chong Zhao went to find Bai Shuo again.

58
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,980
Stop helping him, Young Lord.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,350
Master will punish you severely when we're back.

60
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,230
Perhaps,

61
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,280
he might even kill you.

62
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,280
Don't worry.

63
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,610
Until the last moment,

64
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,120
I may not necessarily lose.

65
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,280
Young Master, you have an idea?

66
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,310
The incident with Emotion Tree

67
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,420
is sufficient to hault Fan Yue.

68
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,960
We just need to find a chance to kill Bai Shuo.

69
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,060
Just that...

70
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,060
Just that Chong Zhao likes Bai Shuo so much.

71
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,500
He must hate you till death.

72
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,000
This is unfair.

73
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,660
Young Lord, stop liking him.

74
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,820
He is not good at all.

75
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,300
-Xixi hates him.
-You’re right.

76
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,580
So this time

77
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,850
will be the last time I help him.

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,560
My feelings ripple,

79
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,170
but I dare to attempt reversing the river's flow.

80
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,820
I can't control my heart

81
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,660
because it doesn't hurt enough.

82
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,560
It should hurt to my bones;

83
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,830
Hurts so much that I fear;

84
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,170
Hurts so much that whenever I think of the torture,

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,850
I no longer dare to waver.

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,030
This way,

87
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,710
my feelings for him

88
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,120
will be suppressed.

89
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,390
Young...

90
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,380
Young Master, what do you plan to do?

91
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,100
To kill Bai Shuo,

92
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,790
which is also to bring an end

93
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,300
to my feelings.

94
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,350
You investigated the Cold Spring for Lanling.

95
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,590
That's not odd.

96
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,040
But the Cold Spring Palace

97
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,700
treats other Eternals very harshly.

98
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,280
How did they come to trust you?

99
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,320
It's probably because of Fu Ling.

100
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,120
She wanted me to become a demon.

101
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,770
So she may have said a lot of good words to Zhen Yu.

102
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,860
Become a demon?

103
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,310
You're an Eternal.

104
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,530
How can you become a demon

105
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,180
Through practicing the techniques of the Demon Race?

106
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,520
It's complicated.

107
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,780
Anyway,

108
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,350
Zhen Yu took a fancy to our relationship.

109
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,310
He wants to use me to capture you to the Cold Spring.

110
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,130
All the more reason you shouldn't return then.

111
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,620
They didn't manage to catch me at the Jingyou Mountain this time.

112
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,240
Zhen Yu won't let you go easily.

113
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,260
You should back to Lanling now.

114
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,740
With Sect Leader Jin Yao,

115
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,950
you'll be safe.

116
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,620
I would be. But what about you?

117
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,580
There are so many demons in the Cold Spring Palace.

118
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,490
Zhen Yu is determined to get the Contemplation Stone.

119
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,490
Even if he didn't send me, he would send someone else.

120
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,700
Only when I'm around,

121
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,310
it is safer for you.

122
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,310
Chong Zhao,

123
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,159
You should walk your own path.

124
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,230
What do you mean?

125
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,640
I know

126
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,520
you feel guilty

127
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,880
for what happened to my father at Ning'an City,

128
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,860
that is why you always put me first.

129
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,840
But you don't have to do that.

130
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,370
Aren't you and I

131
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,280
always like this?

132
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,540
Yes.

133
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,710
You have been like this since young

134
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,140
You took the blame when I caused trouble.

135
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,070
♫I remember that moonlit night♫

136
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,340

♫I remember that word of concern♫

141

♫But unfortunately, I didn't get to answer♫

144
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,100

♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

160
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,640

So in Ning'an City,

183
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,310
I chose to hide it from you

184
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,500
because I didn't want you to get entangled in this mess.

185
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,350
Now I choose to tell you everything

186
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,860
because I've figured it out.

187
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,670
No matter what happens in the future,

188
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,570
I will walk the path with you.

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,040
But your journey

190
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,260
shouldn't have been troubled in the first place.

191
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,190
Chong Zhao.

192
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,990
You were meant to be a sword-wielding,

193
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,210
justice-defending Lanling Eternal.

194
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,300
Don't ruin you life

195
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,440
because of me.

196
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,659
You sneaking into the Cold Spring Palace was an act of righteousness.

197
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,909
But I hope

198
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,590
you can also protect yourself.

199
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,330
If you know the road ahead is a dead end,

200
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,549
you should turn around quickly.

201
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,909
Don't sacrifice for nothing,

202
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,230
especially for me.

203
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,170
But your safety

204
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,440
is my wish.

205
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,920
But I can't bear your wish.

206
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,350
But it's fine when it comes to Fan Yue?

207
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,230
Just because both of you have to collect Contemplation,

208
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,850
you can walk the same path?

209
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,530
It's because I like him.

210
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,940
It's because I like him.

211
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,350
♫That year, that year♫

212
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,710
♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

213
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,260

♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

215

216
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,120
I still like him.

♫They unfold, one page after another♫

218
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,290
After all,

♫That year, that year♫

220
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,840

♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

222
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,370

226

You wanted to tell me these long ago, didn't you?

227
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,810
In the past,

228
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,750
we were childhood friends.

229
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,370
When I was in Ning'an City,

230
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
I didn't even know what love is.

231
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,130
But after the experience with the Fox Clan,

232
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,740
being parted by life

233
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,120
and death,

♫That year, that year♫

235
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,750

236
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,410
my heart died to the passage of time.

♫The leaves fell unnoticed after the flowers bloomed♫

238

♫I'm afraid the autumn wind will stir up memories♫

♫That year, that year♫

245
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,690
I didn't choose you in the Outlanders' City.

♫The flowers flew under the moon, filling the sky♫

248

You should move on to your own life path.

♫Falling to the mud, burying the memories♫

251

What are you here for?

253
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,110
I want to talk to you, Master

254
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,910
about the Weak Water Stone.

255
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,430
Auntie told me everything.

256
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,420
I want to make a deal with you.

257
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,250
I'll give you the Weak Water Stone,

258
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,790
and you'll go and save Ms. Bai.

259
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,810
But I ask Master

260
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,200
to protect Auntie for me.

261
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,600
You will die if the Weak Water Stone leaves your body.

262
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,600
I know.

263
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
So,

264
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,070
I hope you don't tell Tian Huo about this.

265
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,290
I can't.

266
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,780
I don’t agree.

267
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,990
I don't want to take advantage of others.

268
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,190
If Bai Shuo were here, she also wouldn’t.

269
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,560
And there's Tian Huo.

270
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,750
She finally have feelings for someone after all these years.

271
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,450
What would happen to her when you die?

272
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,660
But for you, Master,

273
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,420
there is no other choice.

274
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,320
If Ms. Bai died,

275
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,200
what would happen to you?

276
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,710
I will think of other ways.

277
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,020
If there were so many ways,

278
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,440
you wouldn't have

279
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,030
spent so much time in Jingyou Mountain.

280
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,350
My life, Mu Jiu's,

281
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,600
was saved by Ms. Bai and Master

282
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,120
from the realm of resentment.

283
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,740
Returning it now

284
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,390
is considered a worthwhile death.

285
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,320
Bai Shuo and I only gave you a start.

286
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,940
Your life was given by your aunt.

287
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,920
Precisely.

288
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,760
All the more reason I can't let Auntie die because of me.

289
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,750
Rong Xian killed people from the Fox Clan,

290
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,470
hence the Fox Clan resented Linglong.

291
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,380
Linglong has been cursed for years,

292
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,680
so Auntie resented the Fox Clan

293
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,380
and sent Qi to death,

294
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,400
at the same time sacrificed her own life.

295
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,340
Guilt,

296
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:16,890
hatred,

297
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,660
and resent.

298
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,420
These are things that are endless.

299
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,410
One loop after another,

300
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,360
one step chasing the next,

301
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,600
it goes on forever without an end.

302
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,960
If someone has to end it,

303
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,330
the most suitable person is me.

304
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,710
So,

305
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,560
you do this to fulfill everyone's wish

306
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,140
and end all tragedies?

307
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,870
Master,

308
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,900
you word it too altrusticly.

309
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,160
Me?

310
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,500
I am just a little fox

311
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,510
who was lucky to earn a chance to live.

312
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,210
I was born with a shocking background,

313
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,750
have been receiving the deepest and most profound protection,

314
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,600
and even became

315
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,880
the Master of a mountain,

316
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,180
and had a moment of glory.

317
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,630
The luckiest thing

318
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,640
was to have met a girl whom I love,

319
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,660
and she happens to like me too.

320
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,980
Ordinary people might be fortunate to have one or two,

321
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,370
but I, Mu Jiu, have achieved them all.

322
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,570
It's worthwhile!

323
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:20,930
Fan Yue.

324
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,490
Can I call you that?

325
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,860
In my body,

326
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,720
there is the power you left in me that had changed my fate.

327
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,840
It has been kept for a thousand years.

328
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,470
It was then nourished by the Weak Water Stone,

329
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,540
enough to extend the lifespan of the Emotion Tree by thousands of years.

330
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,560
When the Weak Water Stone is handed over to Ms. Bai,

331
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,500
I request you

332
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,370
to bury the remaining power under the Emotion Tree.

333
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,860
However,

334
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,660
extracting its power

335
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,850
is another life-risking act.

336
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,370
It's very dangerous.

337
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,700
Are you willing to help me?

338
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,520
There's a saying among the Human Race,

339
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,360
"unfamiliar at first, but more familiar after a second encounter."

340
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,800
Master...

341
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,230
I...

342
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,580
Will do my best.

343
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,270
You don’t address yourself as Master anymore?

344
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,620
Are you

345
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,090
acknowledging me?

346
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,010
About Tian Huo...

347
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,420
I'll say goodbye to her properly.

348
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,860
She deserves better.

349
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,360
Don't touch it.

350
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,270
Behave yourself.

351
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,960
This is the evil insect

352
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,320
caused the bloodshed among the Human Race?

353
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,140
Yes.

354
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,020
I personally intercepted this in Ning'an City.

355
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,280
Otherwise, the new governor Bai Yu

356
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,370
would have died.

357
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,090
It seems that the letter of Chong Zhao is right.

358
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,570
The Cold Spring Palace

359
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,760
is indeed cultivating evil insects.

360
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,760
Many cities

361
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,990
have been implicated.

362
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,270
I'm afraid it won't be long till the birth

363
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,040
of these evil insects.

364
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,170
This is not an ordinary evil insect.

365
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,980
Is there any way to restrain it?

366
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,150
It takes time to find a way to restrain it.

367
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,890
I'm afraid that before we discover it,

368
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,060
there would already be a mess.

369
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,670
I will send a message to Chong Zhao.

370
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,130
No matter what,

371
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,760
we must stop everything

372
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,570
before chaos arises.

373
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,630
What is this?

374
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,810
It's woven using the fur on my tail.

375
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,980
Softest when each strand is freshly plucked.

376
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,830
Keep it as a souvenir.

377
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,200
What do you mean?

378
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,190
You're not leaving anymore?

379
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,460
Why?

380
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,570
There are too many things happening in the Fox Clan.

381
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,750
Auntie is getting old now.

382
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,110
Ah Huo.

383
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,100
I think I should take up responsibility.

384
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,980
Excuses.

385
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,200
Responsibility again?

386
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,870
The Outlanders' City is the responsibility of Hua Lin.

387
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,410
The Fox Clan is your responsibility.

388
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,940
Now, it's your responsibility.

389
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,160
What were you doing earlier?

390
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:16,420
♫Don't linger, don't regret♫

391
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,640
I'm sorry.

392
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,950
There's no need.

393
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,810
♫The last moonlight♫

394
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,580
Wait.

395
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,740
I have something to tell you.

396
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,460
♫The water from my hometown flows gently♫

397
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,300
Before I met you,

398
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,000
I thought my life was the worst.

399
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,710
I didn't have parents, friends,

400
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,410
♫Sending me to the distant place♫

401
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,810
nor freedom,

402
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,520
until I met you.

403
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,960
♫In this life, at this time♫

404
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,840
You've been hurt too.

405
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,530
But you never resented nor pitied yourself.

406
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,360
You seem calm and deep like still water,

407
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,770
♫I dare not look back♫

408
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,820
but you are actually the most affectionate and loyal.

409
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,300
To me,

410
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,770
♫Is there the same moonlight♫

411
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,480
I feel happy just being with you.

412
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,130
Is there any meaning to say all these now?

413
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,000
♫On your path?♫

414
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,190
Of course there is.

415
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,630
You are the meaning.

416
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,870
♫I'm walking on a never-ending long road♫

417
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,290
After liking you, I realized

418
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,860
I shouldn't try to escape all the time.

419
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,340
I used to pushed everything on Auntie

420
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,540
♫In the vast world, how can I get there?♫

421
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,170
and selfishly chose to live a free life.

422
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,810
I like being with you,

423
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,380
♫In the chaotic night wind, the melody stopped♫

424
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,090
and I like the happiness you brought me.

425
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,860
♫The moonlight is gentle♫

426
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,020
But what about myself?

427
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,920
♫All the feelings turned into nothing but a dream♫

428
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,340
Who am I?

429
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,230
♫Reminiscing about the good old days♫

430
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,380
What is my purpose?

431
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,660
♫Singing until the voice fades, I'm feeling lost♫

432
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,670
♫Forget all about the past and leave it behind♫

433
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,730
♫Time after time♫

434
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:19,569
♫Oh, melancholy♫

435
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,829
I like you.

436
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,290
This is absolutely true.

437
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,740
But now, I have to stay.

438
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,329
I want to be like you,

439
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,109
making the choice I should make,

440
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,270
and taking on the responsibility I should take.

441
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,400
Ah Huo.

442
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,200
♫Don't linger, don't regret♫

443
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,530
I'm sorry.

Don't be sorry.

452
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,810
The future is yours.

453
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,530
♫I'm walking on a never-ending long road♫

454
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,600
You have the final say.

455
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,720
But I promised you.

456
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,320
♫In the vast world, how can I get there?♫

457
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,960
I've already told you,

458

nothing is eternal in this world.

♫In the chaotic night wind, the melody stopped♫

460

♫The moonlight is gentle♫

♫All the feelings turned into nothing but a dream♫

464
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,520
you were genuine.

465
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,550
I like you.

466
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,480
I trust you.

467
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,890
I do.

♫Reminiscing about the good old days♫

469
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,260

♫Time after time♫

474
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,150
Can you

The journey ahead is long.

480
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,090

♫In the chaotic night wind, the melody stopped♫

♫The moonlight is gentle♫

484
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,480
you must continue

♫All the feelings turned into nothing but a dream♫

486
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,000

♫Oh, melancholy♫

493
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,260
Auntie's resentment is gone.

494
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,730
and the Emotion Tree stopped engulfing people.

495
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,290
Unfortunately,

496
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,570
without spiritual power,

497
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,020
it will die soon.

498
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,720
Let me ask you one last time.

499
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,980
Have you really made up your mind?

500
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,400
Yes.

501
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,590
Please pass this

502
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,890
to Ms. Bai for me.

503
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,230
This is...

504
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,620
A memory bead.

505
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,860
I'm afraid

506
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,220
if I don't say certain things,

507
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,090
you two will waste time again.

508
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,840
Although demons live a long life,

509
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,970
you don't live eternally.

510
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,730
Since you like each other,

511
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,050
don't think about the future,

512
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,410
live the present well.

513
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,290
Thank you.

514
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,600
Fan Yue went to the Emotion Tree.

515
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,800
Tian Huo and Cang Shan are in the cave.

516
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,080
The forest is deep,

517
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,030
no one will come by,

518
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,170
perfect for me to take action.

519
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,160
Are you going to capture me?

520
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,740
Wrong.

521
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,200
I'm going to kill you.

522
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,700
Why?

523
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,180
Do you find it strange?

524
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,360
Chong Zhao said to capture you,

525
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,540
but from me,

526
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,720
it became murder.

527
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,220
You knew Chong Zhao came to me?

528
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,700
Of course.

529
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,860
Why? Are you afraid that I'll betray him?

530
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,720
So do you love him deeply

531
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,490
or are you heartless?

532
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,770
Or,

533
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,840
are you being greedy?

534
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,190
Cut the crap.

535
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,860
Kill me?

536
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,400
Aren't you afraid of the backlash of the Contemplation Stone?

537
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,600
Afraid?

538
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,260
I've long forgotten what it's like to be afraid.

539
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,350
Some things have to be done,

540
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,420
even if you're scared,

541
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,800
even if you'll get hurt,

542
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,410
even if you'll bleed and cry.

543
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,130
Those who are not cruel enough to themselves

544
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,180
cannot survive.

545
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,440
This thing.

546
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,840
Where did you get it from?

547
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,330
♫Across thousands of miles♫

548
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:56,020
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

549
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:05,790
♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

550
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:11,950
♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

551
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,330
In the realm of resentment,

552
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,270
I gave you the first spiritual energy.

553
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,910
So I can lend you some more spiritual power now.

554
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,050
The Weak Water Stone has left your body.

555
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,620
You don't have much time now.

556
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,240
If you have anything unfinished,

557
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,610
do it now.

558
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,880
Thank you.

559
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,750
I should be thanking you.

560
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,360
Tell me.

561
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,340
Who gave you this knife?

562
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,600
Why would I remember?

563
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,520
Nonsense.

564
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,800
Aren't you going to kill me?

565
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,600
Why don't you do it?

566
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,840
Relying on Contemplation Stone,

567
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,980
do you really think I can't do anything to you?

568
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,220
Bai Shuo.

569
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,880
There are many ways to kill a person.

570
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,920
This arrow

571
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,690
may not need to be shot in your heart.

572
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,320
As long as it's not fatal,

573
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,380
the owner protection mechanism of the Contemplation Stone won't be activated.

574
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,640
From then till now,

575
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,430
you've shed quite a bit of blood, right?

576
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,550
♫Don't linger, don't regret♫

577
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,420
You're merely a human,

578

The Human Race

586

587

♫On your path?♫

588
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,930

♫In the vast world, how can I get there?♫

593
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,770
That's because

594

♫In the chaotic night wind, the melody stopped♫

596

I can't die here.

608
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,440
I haven't paid back the favour from back then.

609
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,180
I haven't avenged for Father.

610

I haven't finished my journey.

611
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,200

Aren't you not going to leave?

I don't know what you're thinking.

645
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,650
after making a decision,

646
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,390
you shouldn't turn back.

651
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,330
I still have Master,

652
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,220

654
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,970
I can win it back.

I will heal my heart if it's a heart ailment,

661

662
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,120

00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,280
There are Eternals and demons beyond humans,

740
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,110
deities beyond Eternals and demons.

741
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,520
Even if you become a deity,

742
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,040
can you escape these feelings of helplessness

743
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,630
and return to freedom?

744
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,150
I don't know.

745
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,140
But I know

746
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,920
death does not necessarily lead to an end.

747
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,300
Mu Jiu was calm when he left.

748
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,880
He even asked me to give this to you.

749
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,540
Ms. Bai,

750
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,370
when you see this,

751
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
I probably have died.

752
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,750
So,

753
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,090
you have to take this chance

754
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,420
to remember my handsome face.

755
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,450
Recently, I've been thinking...

756
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,320
Demons

757
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,830
are actually just like humans.

758
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,160
We are foolish too.

759
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:33,750
♫If the wind intends to fill the sky with flowers♫

760
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,840
For the past twenty years,

761
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,150
I never thought

762
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,000
I would sacrifice my life for others

763
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,920
like a hero.

764
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,120
♫The moon's brightness is also the result of stars falling into place♫

765
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,930
The old Mu Jiu

766
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,900
was childish

767
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,860
and willful.

768
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,550
Things like

769
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,390
responsibilities

770
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,000
and morality

771
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,440
are bullshit to me.

772
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,460
But when did it change?

773
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,410
♫As the wind stirs, the clouds gather♫

774
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,740
Probably

775
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,760
♫As the clouds shift, the moon becomes full♫

776
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,720
at the Outlanders' City

777
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,130
when I got to know you two.

778
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:55,530
♫Love is the hardest thing to understand♫

779
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,260
I started to have friends

780
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,430
and family.

781
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,570
Besides Auntie,

782
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:03,240
♫I'm finally back to where it all started♫

783
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,710
Ah Huo was the first person

784
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,160
who saved me when I was in danger.

785
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,850
Ms. Bai, you're the second one.

786
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:10,240
♫All the answers are already explained♫

787
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,510
I really like Ah Huo.

788
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,480
So,

789
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,410
can you take good care of her for me?

790
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,920
♫I'll owe you all of my life♫

791
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,770
♫But we're destined to part♫

792
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:24,740
♫How can I downplay this?♫

793
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:20,900
Right!

794
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,670
There's also Master.

795
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,280
Before I met you,

796
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,980
I thought you were someone

797
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,570
♫When you engrave your love into my heart♫

798
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,130
who could kill people without blinking.

799
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,850
But now I realize

800
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,130
♫When my star falls only for you♫

801
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,460
you are just an ordinary demon

802
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,720
who would get worried for your friends

803
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,270
♫When the heavens fall♫

804
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,450
and fall in love with people.

805
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,850
♫I can still connect with you through the waning moon♫

806
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,990
Now I finally understand,

807
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,050
♫When my pain blurs my eyes♫

808
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,020
whether it's human

809
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,220
or demons,

810
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,670
♫Out of the countless stars, I see only you♫

811
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,460
as long as you have attachments,

812
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,180
you'll have a reason to  willingly stay.

813
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:57,240
♫As you turn into a falling star and crash into my heart♫

814
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,920
Ms. Bai,

815
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,560
I gave you the Weak Water Stone willingly.

816
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,500
I don't blame anyone.

817
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,560
My life, Mu Jiu's,

818
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,150
has ended all the love and hatred of the Jingyou Mountain.

819
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,710
In the future,

820
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,750
promise me,

821
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,460
on my behalf,

822
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,850
do not fear anyone

823
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,990
or anything.

824
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,820
Continue to fight endlessly

825
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,000
against fate.

826

are willingly showing me your back.

857

Do you trust me now?

858
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,910
Nothing about trust.

859
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,490
We are just demons from the Cold Spring Palace.

860
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,040
That's why you saved me.

861
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,810
If anything happens to you,

862
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,730
Master won’t let me go.

863

The Cold Spring Palace loses Lady Fu Ling,

864
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,030
Lord Chong Zhao can take the place.

865
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,440
Isn’t that better?

866
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,090
Consider it a way to repay you for saving my life in the Outlanders' City.

867

I don't want to owe anyone anything.

868

You saved me from Bai Shuo's sword.

869

Aren't you afraid that she will hate you?

870
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,200
From the day I became a demon,

871
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,680
I knew this day would come.

872
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,060
Since we can't go back,

873
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,270
there's nothing to worry about.

874
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,180
You shouldn't have saved me.

875
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,070
Did you want to die?

876
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,260
Didn't you always want me to give up?

877
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,800
If you want to me to give up,

878
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:29,230
you shouldn't be kind to me

879
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,450
nor give me any hope.

880
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:57,920
Today,

881
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,310
when you were injured,

882
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,130
did you feel anything strange?

883
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,280
What's strange?

884
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:04,580
Nothing.

885
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,140
I'm going back to the Cold Spring tomorrow.

886
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,470
You'd better think about

887
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,790
how to explain to Master.
