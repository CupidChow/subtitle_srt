00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,910
[Episode 12]

19
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,329
I hope you can tell me

20
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,480
everything you know,

21
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,820
including your past.

22
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,230
Does my past

23
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,320
have anything to do with what's happening now?

24
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,290
You need to say it

25
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,990
so we can know if it's relevant or not.

26
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,400
Do it for Fan Yue.

27
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,740
Don't use Master as an excuse.

28
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,770
Even if he's lost his memory,

29
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,700
he's not someone you can use.

30
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,630
I have no intention of using him.

31
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,380
I'm not an ungrateful person.

32
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,260
Fan Yue saved me several times.

33
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,520
I feel indebted to him

34
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,810
and don't want him to die.

35
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,980
But the one you should be worrying about is not me

36
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,920
but him.

37
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,200
Reopening the Wutong Contest

38
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,390
was originally a deal between Fan Yue and the King of Outlanders.

39
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,620
But now, the King has actually turned against him

40
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,880
and sent people to kill him.

41
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,550
Something must have changed.

42
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,890
We don't know

43
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,920
what's happening behind the scenes,

44
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,570
and we don't know

45
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,890
what will happen next.

46
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,710
But all the clues point

47
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,380
to one time:

48
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,270
seven years ago.

49
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,000
Seven years ago,

50
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,140
you left the Outlanders' City.

51
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,600
Seven years ago,

52
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,780
the King sealed the City

53
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,079
and canceled the Wutong Contest.

54
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,270
And seven years ago,

55
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,920
a monster appeared in the City.

56
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,370
These things must be connected.

57
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,550
If you don't know the answer,

58
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,310
we can search for it together.

59
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,680
Tian Huo,

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,100
you don't have to like me,

61
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,530
but can you trust me just this once?

62
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,070
Have you heard of the Outlander King's Sword?

63
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,430
Seven years ago,

64
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,970
I wanted to use the Outlander King's Sword

65
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,740
to destroy the City.

66
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,200
What?

67
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,580
The King of Outlanders

68
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,780
is not a simple hereditary title.

69
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,730
It's passed down with the Outlander King's Sword.

70
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,510
Legend has it that the first King of Outlanders

71
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,960
found pieces of divine meteorite

72
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,450
in the Eastern Sea

73
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:41,680
and forged them into the Outlander King's Sword.

74
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,140
With the power of the Sword,

75
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,710
he built the Outlanders' City

76
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,120
and gave the Outlanders a home.

77
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,730
The Sword gives the Outlanders' City vitality.

78
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,070
But the Sword's power

79
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,760
is not infinite.

80
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,980
Every ten years,

81
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,830
the King of Outlanders must pull the Sword out

82
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,790
and temper it with his own blood

83
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,250
to restore its energy.

84
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,410
When the throne was passed to Hua Lin,

85
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,730
he couldn't hold onto it

86
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,590
because he was born weak

87
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,190
and couldn't pull the Sword out.

88
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,610
Then how did Hua Lin become the King?

89
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,120
In the City, besides the Hua family as the royal lineage,

90
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,880
there is another big family, the Mei family.

91
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,580
For generations, the Mei family has shouldered the duty

92
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,130
of supporting the Hua family and defending the City.

93
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,800
In that generation,

94
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,090
General Mei had only one daughter

95
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,120
named Han.

96
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,670
The old King of Outlanders made a deal with General Mei

97
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,300
to ensure the Hua family could stay on the throne.

98
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,090
What kind of deal?

99
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,280
Hua Lin would marry Mei Han as the crown princess,

100
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,090
and the Mei family

101
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,710
would offer General Mei's spiritual power

102
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,340
to Hua Lin

103
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,570
to rebuild his weak body.

104
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,140
General Mei died because of this.

105
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,430
Hua Lin's spiritual veins were reforged.

106
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,840
He drew the Outlander King's Sword

107
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,620
and became the new King of Outlanders.

108
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,510
Not long after, he fulfilled his promise and married Mei Han.

109
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,260
[After the queen falls, the famine will be gone.]

110
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,090
Everything changed seven years ago.

111
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,570
That year, a famine broke out in the Outlanders' City.

112
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,920
In the dry riverbed,

113
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,510
a boulder suddenly appeared,

114
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,410
carved with a so-called divine prophecy.

115
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,490
"After the queen falls,

116
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,090
the famine will be gone."

117
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,910
Those nine words

118
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,970
sentenced my mother to death.

119
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,890
Burn her, burn her!

120
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,020
Everyone went mad,

they all deserved to be buried with her!

174
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,570
So I stormed into the sword vault.

175
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,580
I wanted to destroy the Outlander King's Sword

176
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,240
and the Outlanders' City.

177
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,480
Sister, stop!

178
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,210
The Sword is the foundation of the City.

179
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,110
If you destroy it, the City will fall.

180
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,870
Get lost!

181
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,130
If you hadn't revealed Mother's whereabouts,

182
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,590
she wouldn't have died!

183
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,370

184
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,640
I didn't mean to.

Don't think I don't know.

188
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,290
you, as the crown prince, would lose everything too.

189
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,250
You couldn't bear that!

190
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,910
It's not true.

191
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,590
I want everyone to be buried with her!

192
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,830
In the end, I failed.

193
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,400
I couldn't destroy the Outlanders' City.

194
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,090
So,

195
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,120
you left the Outlanders' City

196
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,790
and never wanted to return.

197
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,740
When I woke up,

198
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,030
I was already outside the City.

199
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,670
They threw me out

200
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,930
and completely abandoned me.

201
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,790
The solution you're looking for

202
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,270
is not in my past.

203
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,030
Not necessarily.

204
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,030
Who's there?

205
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,420
It's you.

206
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,590
How much did you hear?

207
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,210
I was just passing by.

208
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,410
I didn't hear anything.

209
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,890
Fine. I'll tell you.

210
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,390
I saw your impressive spiritual power

211
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,940
and came to ask for guidance.

212
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,210
I really didn't hear much.

213
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,520
How much is "not much?"

214
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,440
Probably from the part

215
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,530
where you mentioned the Outlander King's Sword.

216
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,950
So that's everything.

217
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,100
Ms. Bai.

218
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,090
Help me!

219
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,180
He's the Young Master of the Fox Clan.

220
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,510
You can't kill him.

221
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,370
I won't kill him.

222
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,650
I'll just cripple him.

223
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:49,730
Bai Shuo!

224
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,330
Bai Shuo!

225
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,030
What's wrong?

226
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,940
Master is not doing well.

227
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,230
Yue.

228
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,800
I'm Grandfather.

229
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,720
I'm Qi Feng.

230
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,740
From now on,

231
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,900
Yue

232
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,330
must stay safe and sound,

233
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,290
free from illness and misfortune.

234
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,060
No.

235
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,300
Grandfather!

236
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,530
Grandfather!

237
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,890
No!

238
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,260
No.

239
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,680
Master.

240
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:28,940
Shuo.

241
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,630
Mu Jiu

242
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,920
left so quickly.

243
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,550
Tian Huo.

244
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,060
They...

245
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,490
Why did you push me out?

246
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,840
Master trusts Bai Shuo the most now.

247
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,990
Leave her to it.

248
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,610
What's wrong with you?

249
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,730
Did you have a nightmare?

250
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,120
I saw blood.

251
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,260
Blood everywhere.

252
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,060
They were all dead.

253
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,630
Who was dead?

254
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,190
Grandfather.

255
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,850
Qi Feng.

256
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,370
Grandfather,

257
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,730
Qi Feng?

258
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,770
And many others—people I don't even know.

259
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,160
But they were all dead.

260
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,040
[Qi Feng]

261
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,050
So those nameplates in the secret chamber

262
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,960
are for his departed loved ones.

263
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,730
How much pain must he have endured back then

264
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,520
to make it this far?

265
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,160
Shuo.

266
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,330
When I saw them die

267
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,630
in front of me one by one,

268
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,680
it hurt…

269
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,700
so much here.

270
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,740
Why did they have to kill them?

271
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,800
Why am I the only one left?

272
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,520
They're just people in your dream.

273
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,550
It's over now,

274
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,200
so don't dwell on it.

275
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,570
People in my dream?

276
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,340
People in your dream.

277
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,420
Although they won't appear again,

278
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,760
somewhere you can't see,

279
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,310
they'll be silently watching over you.

280
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,730
Do you have someone in your dream too?

281
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,470
Yes.

282
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,160
He's always

283
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,090
in my dream.

284
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,300
Does it hurt you too?

285
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:20,960
Yes.

286
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,180
When I lost him,

287
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,560
it was so painful that I thought I couldn't go on.

288
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,790
But looking back,

289
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,180
I've realized that

290
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,960
since we're the ones still alive,

291
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,800
we should live well

292
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,260
for them

293
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,090
and for ourselves.

294
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,760
I'm glad I have you, Shuo.

295
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,600
Does Bai Shuo truly care for Master,

296
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,920
or is she pretending?

297
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,110
Keep an eye on Master.

298
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,040
I'm going out.

299
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,730
Where to?

300
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,650
The Outlander Palace.

301
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,250
They've already sent assassins.

302
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,520
They won't show you mercy.

303
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,400
Perfect.

304
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,290
I won't show them mercy either.

305
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,320
How dare they harm Master?

306
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,540
It's unforgivable.

307
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:11,850
Tian Huo.

308
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,200
Tian Huo!

309
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,380
Keep an eye on Master.

310
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,130
I've been looking for you everywhere.

311
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,710
So you're hiding here.

312
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,610
She's long dead because of you.

313
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,730
Now you're pretending to mourn

314
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,220
and acting all fake. Who are you trying to fool?

315
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,520
This is my mother's courtyard.

316
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,450
You don't deserve to touch the tree she planted!

317
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,790
You're later

318
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,670
than I expected.

319
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,190
What?

320
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,300
Were you too busy saving

321
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,920
the Master of Bright Moon Palace?

322
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,950
You've always tried to stay out of trouble,

323
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,940
but now you openly go against Bright Moon Palace.

324
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,100
Looks like you've got some backing.

325
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,950
Ever since the Eternals and demons entered the City,

326
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,330
everything that's happened

327
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,840
is planned by you and the one behind you.

328
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,750
Tell me.

329
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,740
What's your scheme?

330
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,220
Since it's a scheme,

331
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,890
I'm not going to tell you.

332
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,140
I warned you before—

333
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,340
leave the Outlanders' City

334
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,960
and never come back.

335
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,950
For the sake of your mother,

336
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,200
I'll spare your life

337
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,130
one last time

338
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,600
as long as you listen to me.

339
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,750
Spare my life?

340
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,920
You don't get to do that.

341
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,660
I'll kill whoever wants to kill Master.

342
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,980
Do you really think you can beat me?

343
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,790
Have you forgotten how you got

344
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,670
your spiritual power?

345
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,630
If my grandfather hadn't

346
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,130
passed on all his spiritual power to you,

347
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,710
you'd have lost your throne long ago.

348
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,240
Today,

349
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,450
I'm taking back what belongs to the Mei family.

350
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,390
Another one?

351
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,620
Perfect.

352
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,060
No one can leave tonight.

353
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,200
Princess,

354
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,350
His Majesty already held back

355
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,770
in the strike just now.

356
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,420
Don't trespass on

357
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,260
the last bit of his affection for you.

358
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,150
Please leave.

359
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,210
Stop acting!

360
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,280
The monster you raise

361
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,620
secretly created evil cultivators,

362
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,160
and yet you claim to care about your people.

363
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,090
I don't care what your scheme is,

364
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,540
but since you've hurt Master,

365
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,500
no matter the cost,

366
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,400
I'll kill you.

367
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,880
You're wrong!

368
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,580
I didn't create the monster.

369
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,830
You did!

370
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,420
You're actually using the sword vault to create evil cultivators?

371
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,200
You said I made this monster.

372
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,760
Why is that?

373
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,220
Hua Yong?

374
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,190
How did this happen?

375
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,480
I saw him at the inn before.

376
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,550
He was perfectly fine.

377
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,640
What did you do to him?

378
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,100
What did we do?

379
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,630
Didn't you see it with your own eyes?

380
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,520
His Majesty used his own blood

381
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,520
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

382
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,610
to make the crown prince normal again.

383
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,610
Over the years,

384
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,950
if not for His Majesty feeding the prince with his blood,

385
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,180
he would've long lost his sanity

386
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,850
and turned into a complete monster.

387
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,290
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

388
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,060
How else do you think he could hold back when facing you?

389
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,050
During the day, Hua Yong

390
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,470
is no different from a normal person.

391
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:27,200
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

392
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,060
But at night,

393
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,490
after he falls asleep,

394
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,910
he turns into a monster.

395
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,720
What exactly happened?

396
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:33,400
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫

397
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,840
What does it have to do with me?

398
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,390
Have you forgotten

399
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,630
what you did?

400
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,010
Seven years ago,

401
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,580
you stormed into the Underground Palace,

402
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,200
trying to destroy the Outlander King's Sword.

403
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,290
Sister.

404
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,860
♫Across thousands of miles♫

405
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,230
Sister.

406
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:08,450
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

407
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,180
You can't die.

408
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,230
Hua Yong shielded you from the attack of the Sword

409
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:18,510
♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

410
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,970
and pulled out his spiritual bone

411
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,750
to save you.

412
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,200
♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

413
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,880
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

414
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,120
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

415
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,970
♫My love brought tears♫

416
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,940
♫Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completeness♫

417
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,190
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

418
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,820
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

419
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,650
♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

420
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,190
With that extra spiritual bone in your body,

421
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,000
♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

422
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,940
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

423
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,380
you were able to break through the cultivation limits of Outlanders.

424
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,840
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

425
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,290
But Hua Yong,

426
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,220
♫The daylight burns through, and the stars shine bright♫

427
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,540
without his spiritual bone,

428
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,110
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

429
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,050
couldn't resist the sword energy's devoration

430
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,220
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

431
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,680
and turned into a monster.

432
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,500
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

433
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,500
Everything you have today

434
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,290
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

435
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,950
♫To protect the world for eternity♫

436
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,310
was bought with Hua Yong's life.

437
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,030
There's only one way to save him.

438
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,550
What is it?

439
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,230
The Contemplation Stone.

440
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,730
What do you want?

441
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,670
I want Bai Shuo.

442
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,520
Master would never let you take Bai Shuo.

443
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:19,920
And I'll never disobey

444
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,060
his orders.

445
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,200
The Outlanders' City forbids all magic,

446
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,360
and Fan Yue is already gravely injured.

447
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,700
He has no strength left to fight.

448
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,150
If you hand over Bai Shuo to me,

449
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,150
I'll spare Fan Yue's life.

450
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,200
Otherwise,

451
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,950
none of you can leave the City alive.

452
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,580
One is your master who saved your life,

453
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,590
and the other is your brother who gave you his spiritual bone.

454
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,790
Do they both

455
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,680
mean less to you

456
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,830
than Bai Shuo, who has no blood ties to you?

457
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,180
Weigh the stakes,

458
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,950
Lady Tian Huo,

459
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,170
and make your choice.

460
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,680
Mas…

461
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,250
Master is asleep?

462
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,390
Did your master used to

463
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,680
have nightmares too?

464
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,460
In the past, Master never slept deeply,

465
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,960
so he never had dreams.

466
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,170
Never slept deeply?

467
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,720
Being the Demon King of the Polar Region

468
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,250
means he could never let his guard down.

469
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,830
As demons,

470
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,820
we've fought through countless battles.

471
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,750
You'll never understand

472
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,440
what Master has gone through.

473
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,320
Where have you been?

474
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,290
Why are you staring at me like that?

475
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,130
If I say I want your life,

476
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,690
will you give it to me?

477
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,260
I told you to keep an eye on Yong.

478
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,730
How did he suddenly appear?

479
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,220
I don't know.

480
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,340
Perhaps it's the bond of blood.

481
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,160
The crown prince sensed his sister,

482
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,660
or maybe he sensed that you were in danger.

483
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,640
I didn't plan

484
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,350
to let her know about Yong.

485
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,960
Your Majesty,

486
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,850
what she's meant to know,

487
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,820
she'll find out sooner or later.

488
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,350
What do you think

489
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,250
she'll choose?

490
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,350
Whatever her choice,

491
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,970
as long as they want the Heart Flame,

492
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,800
they'll definitely come to the Fenlan Banquet.

493
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,750
Send word to Zhen Yu.

494
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,390
Tell him to come

495
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,410
after the Fenlan Banquet

496
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,750
to get what he wants.

497
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,460
Yes.

498
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,050
You just lost blood.

499
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,450
Your spiritual power has been weakened.

500
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,310
Please take a good rest.

501
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,800
So,

502
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,820
you misunderstood Hua Yong back then.

503
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,970
Someone who risked his life to protect his sister

504
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,160
would never betray his own mother

505
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,630
for wealth and power.

506
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,860
Since you're loyal to Fan Yue

507
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,010
and feel guilty toward Hua Yong,

508
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,490
why don't you just agree

509
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,470
to the King's terms

510
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,490
and hand me over?

511
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,920
I don't want to do that.

512
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,070
You don't want to?

513
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,330
Lady Tian Huo, I doubt your feelings

514
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,100
for me run that deep.

515
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,620
Bright Moon Palace

516
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,090
will never bow to Hua Lin.

517
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,500
As for our predicament,

518
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,560
I don't believe there is only one solution.

519
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,910
You don't believe that either,

520
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:00,600
do you?

521
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,070
I never thought

522
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,510
it would take something like this

523
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,200
to get a bit of acknowledgment from you.

524
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,960
But there's one thing I don't understand.

525
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,480
If, as Hua Lin said,

526
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,910
he's trying to save Hua Yong,

527
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,610
the first thing he should have done

528
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,300
is take back the spiritual bone from you.

529
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,710
But he hasn't.

530
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,810
Isn't that strange?

531
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,560
He didn't tell me much.

532
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,510
The Outlanders' City

533
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,410
is no longer the same as it once was.

534
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,670
Too many secrets are hidden in the dark.

535
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,790
There's another question.

536
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,910
If Hua Lin only wanted the Contemplation Stone,

537
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,540
he could have captured me directly.

538
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,510
Why go through such a convoluted plan?

539
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,610
When we got the second Heart Flame,

540
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,560
if not for Fan Yue sacrificing his own spiritual power

541
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,900
to break Rong Xian's realm of resentment,

542
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,450
I might be trapped there forever,

543
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,100
and he'd never get the Contemplation Stone.

544
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,750
Unless...

545
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,850
Unless

546
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,210
part of his plan

547
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,200
requires us

548
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,440
to dispel Rong Xian's resentment.

549
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,640
Exactly.

550
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,880
Hua Lin must be

551
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,710
hiding more secrets.

552
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,760
Blood formation…

553
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,160
Altar?

554
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,510
What are you doing?

555
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,520
Yong.

556
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,350
You heard everything?

557
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,740
Don't be afraid.

558
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,350
I'm saving you.

559
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,270
Saving me?

560
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,480
Using blood for formations is forbidden magic.

561
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,800
What's wrong with me

562
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,940
that you need to save me like this?

563
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,670
Wait until tomorrow night.

564
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,710
When everything is over,

565
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,410
I'll tell you everything.

566
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,920
Since several years ago,

567
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,400
I've been having strange

568
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,780
nighttime visions from time to time.

569
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,820
You said they were just dreams,

570
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,720
but they were not,

571
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,110
were they?

572
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,850
Seven years ago, I shielded my sister from the Sword's attack,

573
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,600
but I showed no symptoms of devoration.

574
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,880
You said it was because you made me take some pill,

575
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,720
but that wasn't true either,

576
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,510
was it?

577
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,120
A monster has been lurking in the City for seven years,

578
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,650
and it's still not been caught.

579
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,530
And for these seven years,

580
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,700
I can't remember what happened at night.

581
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,050
It's because I am the monster,

582
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,390
right?

583
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,490
What's the point of knowing all this?

584
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,050
All you need to know is that

585
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,370
I will save you.

586
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,030
But sustaining life with blood is forbidden.

587
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,670
If the Eternals and demons find out,

588
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,930
the Outlanders' City will fall!

589
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,530
Then let them disappear first.

590
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,140
If they disappear,

591
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,660
who can destroy the Outlanders' City?

592
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,540
What are you planning?

593
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,690
There is an ancient formation

594
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,170
that uses Eternals and demons as sacrifices

595
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,460
to create a deity.

596
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,780
Create a deity?

597
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,400
Those Eternals and demons think

598
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,310
that by dispelling Rong Xian's resentment,

599
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,580
they can rest easy.

600
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,080
What a bunch of ignorant fools.

601
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,940
This time,

602
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,990
I truly have to thank Fan Yue and Bai Shuo.

603
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,730
If they hadn't dispelled Rong Xian's resentment,

604
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,930
I wouldn't be able to open the ancient barrier here.

605
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,880
Where is the barrier?

606
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,210
I don't see it.

607
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,370
The core of the barrier

608
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,060
is sealed beneath Rong Xian's tomb.

609
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,640
The Formation Key from Grand Master

610
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,680
can help me open the core.

611
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,950
Once the barrier is opened,

612
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,690
the entire Outlanders' City will be covered.

613
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,130
No one can get in,

614
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,290
and no one can get out.

615
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,110
Then those Eternals and demons in the City

616
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,140
will be

617
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,190
completely

618
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,560
helpless.

619
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,790
What about Chong Zhao?

620
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,430
Are you abandoning him?

621
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,770
I've given him a way out.

622
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,380
But since he wants to die,

623
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,970
it's not my fault.

624
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,630
Chong Zhao.

625
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,840
What's wrong?

626
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,650
Nothing.

627
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,120
I just feel uneasy.

628
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
I saw your lights still on

629
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,740
and made you some calming tea.

630
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,500
Thank you.

631
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,020
Still no response

632
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,200
from Sect Leader?

633
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,650
Is it because he's been too busy with official matters?

634
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,560
No matter how busy,

635
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,340
with evil cultivators in the Outlanders' City,

636
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,400
Master would never stand by and do nothing.

637
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,320
I'll write another letter

638
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,350
and personally send it to him.

639
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,160
For a thousand years,

640
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,630
the Outlanders have been trapped in an isolated city,

641
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,200
struggling to survive.

642
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,470
You're my heir.

643
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,260
Only by becoming a deity

644
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,470
can you have the power to defeat Eternals and demons

645
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,560
and lead our people to rise

646
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,510
and walk out with dignity.

647
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,050
Sacrificing others

648
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,520
to make me a deity?

649
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,400
That's the way you've chosen?

650
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,210
The existence of the City

651
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,510
depends on the Outlander King's Sword.

652
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,920
But I'm old now

653
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,940
and can no longer pull the Sword out.

654
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,280
Nor can I inject life into it again.

655
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,660
If the Outlanders' City falls,

656
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,970
where can our people go?

657
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,880
But this time,

658
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,720
with the help of the Master of Cold Spring Palace,

659
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,700
who told me how to create a deity,

660
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,320
I have to risk it all.

661
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,680
The Master of Cold Spring Palace?

662
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,640
He's the Demon King.

663
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,210
If he could create a deity,

664
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,390
why would he tell you

665
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,620
instead of becoming a deity himself?

666
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,320
I know he's up to something,

667
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,810
but I have no other choice.

668
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,190
Neither you nor the City has any time left.

669
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,050
The Eternals and demons

670
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,680
don't allow evil beings to exist.

671
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,370
Seven years ago,

672
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,840
when you began to change,

673
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,070
I canceled the Wutong Contest

674
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,540
and hid the Outlanders' City

675
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,240
in order to protect you.

676
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,590
Seven years have passed,

677
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,620
and your condition has worsened,

678
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,250
now endangering your life.

679
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,750
I'm holding the Contest again

680
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,250
to make you a deity.

681
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,460
It's only for the Outlanders

682
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,790
but also to save you.

683
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,570
This is the only chance for survival.

684
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,910
But this is evil!

685
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,120
Nature has its own laws.

686
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,560
Defying fate will only bring greater disasters.

687
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,760
But if we don't do this,

688
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,440
the only road ahead leads to death.

689
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,640
Your death

690
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,070
and the deaths of the Outlanders.

691
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,460
Not all Eternals and demons are evil.

692
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,360
Just because they're Eternals and demons,

693
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,350
they deserve to die!

694
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,270
What about my sister?

695
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,830
She's sworn loyalty to the Master of Bright Moon Palace.

696
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,090
Do you want to harm her?

697
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,860
Yong.

698
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,160
Wait one more day.

699
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,770
One day later,

700
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,340
with the Eternals and demons in the City as offerings,

701
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,520
you can fully recover,

702
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,160
and the Outlanders

703
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,370
can be liberated once and for all.

704
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,840
Divinity, you're in a hurry.

705
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,410
Where are you going?

706
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,450
Demon,

707
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,280
it's you again.

708
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,640
I've warned you—

709
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,760
the Outlanders' City is dangerous,

710
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,010
but you wouldn't listen.

711
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,790
Now, even if you want to leave,

712
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,120
you won't be able to.

713
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,900
What do you mean?

714
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,170
Nothing much.

715
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,590
I just want to tell you

716
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,350
the Outlanders' City

717
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,090
is bound to meet its doom.

718
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,670
But

719
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,410
I do feel a bit reluctant to see you die.

720
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,450
Still, the offer stands:

721
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,310
If you're willing to leave your sect

722
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,380
and join Cold Spring Palace,

723
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,050
I might just

724
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,000
spare your life.

725
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,120
Dream on!

726
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,590
You followed me?

727
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,970
Bai Shuo told me you left the inn late at night

728
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,950
and asked me to protect you,

729
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,780
or I wouldn't have bothered.

730
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,270
You really do keep being fooled

731
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,500
by this demon woman.

732
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,630
You've teamed up with Bright Moon Palace?

733
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,680
You said you refuse to be a demon,

734
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,110
but it turns out you just refuse

735
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,350
to work with me.

736
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,160
Is it because Bai Shuo is in Bright Moon Palace

737
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,750
that you're willing to work with them?

738
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:57,970
I was born an Eternal

739
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,970
and will remain one for life.

740
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,900
I'd never ally with the Demon Race.

741
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,580
The Fenlan Banquet is tomorrow night.

742
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,310
Cold Spring Palace is definitely scheming something.

743
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,950
We must find it out tonight.

744
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,720
Of course.

745
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,890
She'll be interrogated.

746
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,440
But since I captured her,

747
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,290
we demons

748
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,810
will handle the interrogation.

749
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,510
Are you going to tell me,

750
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,110
or should I make you?

751
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,870
Should I call you Lady Tian Huo

752
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:27,900
or...

753
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,550
the Princess of Outlanders?

754
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,670
Cut the crap!

755
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,120
What's Cold Spring Palace plotting in the Outlanders' City?

756
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,480
Are you working with the King of Outlanders?

757
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,340
Go ask your father.

758
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,570
By the way,

759
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,070
don't think I don't know

760
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,610
Fan Yue is no longer

761
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,800
the same Master of Bright Moon Palace.

762
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,820
Why do you have to die here with him?

763
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,950
Speaking of which,

764
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,230
Lady Tian Huo,

765
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,690
you're very powerful.

766
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,340
Why don't you consider joining Cold Spring Palace?

767
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,960
Joining Cold Spring Palace?

768
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,210
Those in Cold Spring Palace are all cold-blooded.

769
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,280
You'll never understand the bonds we share in Bright Moon Palace.

770
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,240
I told you,

771
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,080
if I see you again,

772
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,860
I'll kill you!

773
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,640
Not yet.

774
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,000
She hasn't told us about their scheme.

775
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
No matter what their scheme is,

776
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,420
I'll figure it out myself!

777
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,260
You're still so full of yourself.

778
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,990
Back in Ning'an City,

779
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,010
you acted recklessly like this,

780
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,880
thinking you could save your father.

781
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,050
And what happened?

782
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,470
You could only watch him die

783
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,210
right in front of you.

784
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,320
Shut up.

785
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,800
When your father died,

786
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,580
you couldn't do anything.

787
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,530
Seeing you in great pain

788
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,460
made me so happy.

789
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,420
I said, shut up.

790
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,520
Honestly,

791
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,740
you should thank me for showing mercy

792
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,180
and letting you meet your dad

793
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,900
for the last time.

794
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,930
He could rest in peace.

795
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,790
I wonder if Lady Tian Huo is asleep yet.

796
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,310
If I give her this gift,

797
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:22,400
hopefully, she'll be willing to teach me some techniques.

798
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,040
Who are you?

799
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,210
How dare you kidnap the Young Master of the Fox Clan?

800
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:32,870
Shut up!

801
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,750
I'll turn you into a dead fox if you keep talking.

802
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,900
You think you can escape?

803
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,889
It's not bad to take someone with me before I die.

804
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,920
He's the nephew of the Master of Jingyou Mountain.

805
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,530
Aren't you afraid of Chang Mei leading the Fox Clan

806
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,719
to destroy Cold Spring Palace?

807
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:44,500
Exactly.

808
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,120
My aunt will…

809
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,989
If I were afraid of trouble, I would've long died.

810
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,370
You guys should be worrying about

811
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,070
whether you can make it out of this city alive.

812
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,030
Ms. Bai,

813
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,120
save me.

814
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,300
See you again.

815
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,220
That crazy woman…

816
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,880
-It hurts so much! 
-Why did you suddenly come?

817
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,710
Do you know

818
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,840
what kind of chance I've missed because of you?

819
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,330
Ms. Bai.

820
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,300
Tian Huo.

821
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,370
What happened?

822
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,550
Who were those two people?

823
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,140
Why is Ms. Bai so angry?

824
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,210
Tian Huo.

825
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,000
I already know

826
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,170
what happened just now.

827
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,590
I should've killed her just now.

828
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,500
That way, she wouldn't have had the chance to escape!

829
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,950
Shuo.

830
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,860
Have you ever killed anyone?

831
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,670
Saying you'll kill someone

832
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,740
and actually doing it

833
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,840
are two different things.

834
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,810
Besides,

835
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,670
you knew we needed to get

836
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,070
Cold Spring Palace's scheme out of her,

837
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,740
so you wouldn't kill her at that moment.

838
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,880
Alright.

839
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,710
Don't blame yourself.

840
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,700
You're not a cold-hearted machine.

841
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,600
You're a living, breathing person.

842
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,610
♫When you engrave your love into my heart♫

843
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,040
♫When my star falls only for you♫

844
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,430
♫When the heavens fall♫

845
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:52,940
♫I can still connect with you through the waning moon♫

846
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,180
♫When my pain blurs my eyes♫

847
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,690
♫Out of the countless stars, I see only you♫

848
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,160
Thank you.

849
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:10,200
♫As you turn into a falling star and crash into my heart♫

850
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,190
Mu.

851
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,380
I'm fine now.

852
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:08,820
Really?

853
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,140
We can't afford to lose

854
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,210
the battle in the Outlanders' City.

855
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,830
We won't lose.

856
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,110
Cold Spring Palace is indeed colluding with the Outlanders.

857
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,420
Tian Huo.

858
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,230
Did you recognize

859
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,400
who that person in black was?

860
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,570
His spiritual power is on par with mine.

861
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,950
At first, I suspected it was Hua Lin,

862
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,900
but the techniques didn't match.

863
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,830
Could it be Wu Zhao?

864
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,970
Wu Zhao, though the deputy general to the King,

865
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,380
isn't that powerful.

866
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,180
But that was seven years ago.

867
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,320
What if something's changed

868
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,090
in these seven years?

869
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,790
The upcoming Fenlan Banquet

870
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,630
is definitely a trap.

871
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,330
But no matter what,

872
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,070
the vision from the Contemplation Stone must come true.

873
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,080
We must get

874
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,390
all three Heart Flames.

875
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,680
That means

876
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,310
we must

877
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,630
attend that banquet.

878
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,810
Shuo is right.

879
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,800
We must attend it.

880
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:15,840
It's late.

881
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,080
You asked me out alone.

882
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,070
What is it?

883
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,770
There are too many people in the inn.

884
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,760
I asked you out

885
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,260
to ask if you got anything

886
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,120
out of Fu Ling tonight.

887
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,460
Before we could get anything out of her,

888
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,960
Fu Ling was rescued by someone.

889
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,060
Who could rescue her from the hands of Bright Moon Palace?

890
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,130
The person who helped her

891
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,250
could use spiritual power.

892
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,720
An Outlander?

893
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,360
I searched the city tonight.

894
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,060
No other demons

895
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,890
from Cold Spring Palace

896
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
other than Fu Ling.

897
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,100
But the fact that an Outlander openly came to her rescue

898
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,320
means someone high-ranking

899
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,500
in the Outlander Race is colluding with Cold Spring Palace.

900
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,800
Tomorrow's banquet is not just a banquet.

901
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,230
I'll send you away now.

902
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,070
No.

903
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,240
Shuo.

904
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,890
Can you stop being so willful?

905
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,890
I told you,

906
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,450
you don't need to worry about me.

907
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,150
When will you understand

908
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,970
that I'm no longer the same Bai Shuo from Ning'an City?

909
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,790
Miss, sir.

910
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,810
Stop arguing.

911
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,960
Play with the dough instead.

912
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,920
Good girl.

913
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,870
We won't argue anymore.

914
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,910
Give this to Shuo.

915
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,980
She loved playing with it when she was little.

916
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,130
Zhao.

917
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:55,540
I...

918
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,210
It's late.

919
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,500
Go back now.

920
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,010
My relationship with Cold Spring Palace must stay hidden.

921
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,360
You have to dress the wound yourself.

922
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,810
Thank you, General.

923
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,630
The Fenlan Banquet is tomorrow.

924
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,030
Before that,

925
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,920
His Majesty doesn't want any more mistakes.

926
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,650
Lady Fu Ling,

927
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,310
please stay here for recovery.

928
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,050
Is this the will of the King

929
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,140
or yours?

930
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,750
Does it make a difference?

931
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,590
Not really.

932
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,310
Hua Lin can never imagine

933
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,330
that you

934
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,300
are my master's true ally,

935
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,490
while he's merely a decoy,

936
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,760
a decoy

937
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,910
to shield you

938
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,450
from suspicion and harm.

939
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,350
I must thank you, General,

940
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,850
for revealing the location of the City

941
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,630
so Grand Master could plan ahead.

942
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,580
I need to thank your master for giving me the pill

943
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,450
that boosted my spiritual power.

944
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,270
You're being too modest, General.

945
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,470
In terms of strength,

946
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,920
military achievements,

947
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,190
bravery, and foresight,

948
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,540
Hua Lin is no match for you.

949
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,280
He was born weak,

950
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,260
yet the Mei family would rather sacrifice their patriarch

951
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,520
than let someone else take the throne,

952
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,230
just because he's of royal blood.

953
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,260
If I were you,

954
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,120
I'd never accept it either.

955
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,380
I know you've been hunkering down

956
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,560
for many years.

957
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,320
At the Banquet tomorrow,

958
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:49,140
we'll reap the rewards together.

959
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,380
Don't go to the Banquet?

960
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:02,900
Bai Shuo.

961
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,660
What are you talking about?

962
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,390
I know what you're doing.

963
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,440
You're saying the Banquet is dangerous

964
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,700
to trick us into giving up

965
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,350
so you can take the third Heart Flame for yourself,

966
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,280
right?

967
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,900
-Exactly.
-That's it.

968
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,590
We're representatives from various sects.

969
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,400
Although we can't use magic here,

970
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,730
we have the backing of our sects

971
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,870
outside the City.

972
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,410
Who dares do anything to us?

973
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,930
-Yes.
-Exactly.

974
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,130
I've said what I need to say.

975
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,340
You can believe me or not.

976
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,450
Whether you go to your doom

977
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,410
is up to you.

978
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,030
Stop!

979
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,230
What are you talking about?

980
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:44,960
Anyone sensible

981
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,810
can see the situation in the Outlanders' City.

982
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,510
Since the Outlanders' Tomb,

983
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,770
this has ceased to be just a simple contest.

984
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,590
If it weren't for me and the Master of Bright Moon Palace

985
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,810
breaking Rong Xian's realm of resentment,

986
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,710
do you think you could even stand here now?

987
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,760
One wrong move,

988
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,910
and we'll all die

989
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,480
in the Outlanders' City.

990
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,660
The three Heart Flames

991
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,480
are absolutely going to Bright Moon Palace.

992
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,360
Since you don't stand a chance,

993
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,790
why take the risk?

994
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:10,550
You...

995
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:12,220
Don't look down on us.

996
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,290
-Yes.
-Yeah.

997
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,260
Calm down.

998
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,380
I'm not looking down on anyone.

999
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:18,440
I'm just trying to make you see reality.

1000
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,630
Whether you live or die

1001
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,840
has nothing to do with me.

1002
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:22,150
The reason I'm here

1003
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,550
wasting my breath

1004
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,360
is because I think there are still some…

1005
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,280
kind people among you.

1006
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,870
But that's all I can say.

1007
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,490
From here on out,

1008
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,140
you can walk

1009
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,480
whatever path you choose.

1010
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,150
Make it clear.

1011
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,440
What are you talking about?

1012
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,590
Is she trying to scare us?

1013
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:45,800
-Yes.
-Exactly.

1014
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,280
Will those Eternals and demons trust us?

1015
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,040
The ones who are afraid of death will.

1016
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,010
The ones who aren't won't believe anything we say.

1017
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,920
There are three visions from the Contemplation Stone.

1018
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,500
The first two have come true.

1019
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,240
There's just one left.

1020
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,260
That is, me holding all three Heart Flames, along with the mons…

1021
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,340
Hua Yong.

1022
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:08,700
We'll be here together.

1023
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:09,890
Where is this?

1024
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,410
The Underground Palace.

1025
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,080
It's where the Outlander King's Sword is kept.

1026
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,200
At the Banquet,

1027
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,290
I'll find a way to get inside there.

1028
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,780
I'll go with you.

1029
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:17,660
-No.
-No.
