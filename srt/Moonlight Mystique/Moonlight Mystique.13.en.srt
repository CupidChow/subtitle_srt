00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,360
May I be like the stars

2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,580
and you like the moon.

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,670
As long as the world remains,

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
so shall we.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,830
I only wish to stay with the one I love,

6
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,060
watching every sunrise and sunset.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I want to be with you forever.

00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
Eternals and demons walk different paths.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You and she are ultimately different.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,600
Have you ever

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,789
truly cared for me?

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,250
No.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
Never.

14
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,720
In this life and the next, through all lifetimes…

15
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,310
May we live and die together,

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
and share life and death as one.

[Episode 13]

19
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,760
I'll go with you.

20
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,560
No.

21
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,610
Master.

22
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,630
You haven't recovered yet,

23
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,660
so you mustn't risk it.

24
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,170
I'm fine now.

25
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,140
You guys are making me look like a loser.

26
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,850
Fan Yue is never a loser,

27
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,180
nor would he ever see himself as one.

28
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,810
Don't you ever say something like that again.

29
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,990
Then let me go with you.

30
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,530
I know that

31
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,350
entering the palace this time is fraught with danger.

32
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,780
But how could you expect me to watch you

33
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,870
risk your life?

34
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,590
Have you considered my feelings?

35
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,910
If you stay silent,

36
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,940
that means you agree.

37
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,650
Tian Huo is not here.

38
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,960
No, don't!

39
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,450
I'm not looking for Tian Huo.

40
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,610
I'm here for Ms. Bai.

41
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,150
You...

42
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,980
Looking for me?

43
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,490
Ms. Bai,

44
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,070
thank you for saving my life last night.

45
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,860
I, Mu Jiu, always return favors.

46
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,390
This second Heart Flame...

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,470
I'll give it to you.

48
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,560
Consider it as repaying your kindness.

49
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,310
I’ll take you up on that then.

50
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,600
Huo, do you think...

51
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,600
I'm a generous person?

52
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,540
By the way,

53
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,170
you guys were talking about...

54
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,940
the Underground Palace.

55
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,140
This is it, right?

56
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,839
You eavesdropped on us again?

57
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,700
No.

58
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,649
I didn't mean it.

59
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,630
I happen to hear it

60
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,580
when I came to deliver the Heart Flame.

61
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,760
I swear

62
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,840
I will never tell anyone.

63
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,390
Itching for trouble again, aren't you?

64
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

65
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,880
I'm here to help you.

66
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,640
Really!

67
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,700
How'll you help?

68
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,610
Wait.

69
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,390
Are you serious about helping?

70
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,170
Of course.

71
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,090
When we were in Rong Xian's realm of resentment,

72
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,960
we were...

73
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,980
inseparable as we faced life and death together.

74
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,010
Right, Huo?

75
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,400
Quit pretending to be friendly.

76
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,020
Tian Huo didn't even enter the realm of resentment.

77
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,280
We don't need your help.

78
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,770
We need his help.

79
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,020
That pesky fox is so annoying.

80
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,930
And yet, Bai Shuo

81
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,120
believed his nonsense.

82
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,810
Don't worry about him, Mu Jiu.

83
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,160
Just remember,

84
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,570
no matter what happens tonight,

85
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,480
you must protect Master.

86
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,140
Understood.

87
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,560
Actually, our master hasn't been

88
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,060
happy all these years.

89
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,990
It'd be nice

90
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,230
if he can maintain

91
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,740
this disposition.

92
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,930
There are no "what if's" in this world.

93
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,800
If our master hadn't forsaken

94
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,480
his former innocence,

95
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,140
he wouldn't have lived to this day.

96
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
M-Master.

97
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,680
I...

98
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,670
I was talking nonsense just now.

99
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,450
Regardless of how you may be,

100
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,040
I will still like you

101
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,360
and be loyal to you.

102
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,050
What was Fan Yue like before?

103
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,010
How did Fan Yue

104
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,670
fall in love with Bai Shuo?

105
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,490
Fall in...

106
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,620
love?

107
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,520
This is the entire process of how

108
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,920
you got to know Bai Shuo.

109
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,890
From Unbridled Pavilion to Bright Moon Palace,

110
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,030
to Lanling,

111
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,810
and now in Outlanders' City,

112
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,170
I can't tell at which part did you fall in love.

113
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,920
Master.

114
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,900
Don't be fooled by her.

115
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,020
Are you sure you didn't miss out on any details?

116
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,700
Absolutely not.

117
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,600
Master.

118
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,930
Regardless,

119
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,220
we had something to do with

120
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,130
Bai Shuo's father's death.

121
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,620
Although we may be allies with Bai Shuo now,

122
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,800
it's only so that we can activate the Contemplation Stone.

123
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,030
Sooner or later,

124
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,840
we and Bai Shuo are bound to go our separate ways.

125
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,810
Xi.

126
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,909
Fenlan Banquet is happening tonight.

127
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,780
Love, hate, kill, greed.

128
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,740
I don't know which Contemplation is next,

129
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,909
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

130
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,210
or what might actually happen.

131
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,270
No matter what threats lie ahead,

132
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,420
I'm not afraid.

133
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,600
But Fan Yue...

134
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:01,830
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

135
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,850
I only remember you.

136

You're the one who saved me

137
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:03,890
and treats me well.

138
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:11,980
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

139
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,680
Be careful!

140
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,080
Blocking the knife for me?

141
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,760
You could have died, you know?

142
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,740
I'm fine.

143
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,800
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫

144
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,240
I said I would protect you.

145
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,680
I won't forget

146
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,980
these words.

147
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,460
Luckily,

148
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,600
I still have you.

149

He couldn't let his guard down.

152
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,960
We demons

153
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,360
fought among a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood.

154
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,140
You will never understand

155
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,090
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

Must you enter the palace?

160
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,870
I have to go.

161
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,640
Is it because of the Contemplation Stone?

162
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,120
Some things speak for themselves,

163
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,600
even if you don't mention them.

164
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,700
You chose to travel with the demons because

165
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,820
you wanted to gather the Five Contemplations and become stronger, right?

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,120
Is the next Contemplation here in Outlanders' City?

167
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,460
Yes.

168
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,830
Ultimately, this is my own problem.

169
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,570
Chong Zhao.

170
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,840
I know you don’t care about that Wutong Spirit Pill.

171
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,950
Just stay here in the inn.

172
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,180
Don't go and risk yourself.

173
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,700
You may have things you want to do,

174
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,580
and the Eternals are not willing to support you.

175
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,470
Shuo.

176
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,610
But, I will.

177
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,740
So,

178
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,620
what’s your plan for tonight?

179
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,920
Who was it who said the Outlander Palace was dangerous,

180
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,200
but is still going anyway?

181
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,490
Let's go.

182
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,380
Bei Chen.

183
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,850
You know the Outlander Palace would be dangerous,

184
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,980
yet you're still going?

185
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,050
Ms. Bai.

186
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,570
I know you mean well.

187
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,260
But Kunlun collapsed a thousand years ago.

188
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,510
Although it has been rebuilt,

189
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,590
we have yet to regain our vitality.

190
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,650
Kunlun needs the Wutong Spirit Pill.

191
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,250
I'm here by order of my master.

192
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,480
Although I know there's not much hope,

193
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,640
I can't just give up.

194
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,270
I'll do my best.

195
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,410
You won't be able to talk them out of it.

196
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,890
The disciples of Kunlun never let their master down.

197
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,260
Aren't you the same?

198
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,960
The responsibility of Lanling

199
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,520
has always rested with you, hasn't it?

200
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,280
Let's go.

201
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,950
We should set off.

202
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,860
I'll be alright entering the palace myself.

203
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,050
You all should stay here in the inn.

204
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,750
You think there's danger?

205
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,940
If we don't come back in four hours,

206
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,140
don't hesitate.

207
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,010
Leave Outlanders' City immediately and report it to our master.

208
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,650
Yes.

209
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,120
[Peace and joy]

210
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,650
Today is the Fenlan Festival.

211
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,440
There are no longer deities in this world.

212
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,660
Who are they making their wishes to?

213
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,260
To themselves.

214
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,840
The Outlanders were abandoned by the various races,

215
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,660
and had no deity to pray to.

216
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,590
By writing their wishes on the latern,

217
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,210
[Fortune]

218
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,220
they are reminding themselves to

219
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,540
rely on no one but themselves for whatever they desire.

220
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,930
That's right.

221
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,240
Indeed, in this world,

222
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,400
it's better to rely on yourself than to depend on others.

223
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,360
Shuo.

224
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,220
Let's go set off a sky lantern too.

225
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,340
Okay.

226
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,180
It's not yet time for the banquet anyway.

227
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,240
[Contemplation]

228
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,860
[Contemplation] [Peace]

229
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,240
Take it.

230
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,040
This is yours.

231
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,720
Thank you.

232
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,520
What did you write?

233
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,510
Nothing.

234
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,550
Someone as cold-hearted as you has secrets too?

235
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,140
If it weren't for this moment

236
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,160
and the tough battle ahead,

237
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,250
this would be the most memorable scene

238
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,500
I've ever witnessed.

239
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,560
Shuo.

240
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,780
We're not lovers.

241
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,680
Right?

242
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,330
I've asked Cang Shan

243
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,570
how we got to know each other.

244
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,500
-Actually...
-I’m sorry.

245
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,100
About everything that has happened before.

246
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,980
And also,

247
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,580
regarding your father...

248
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,150
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,060
How I wish I am not him,

250
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,220
but how I also wish I am him.

251
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,210
At least he can protect you.

252
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,690
How beautiful!

253
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,080
Fireworks!

254
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,180
So beautiful.

255
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,010
It's time to enter the palace.

256
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,130
Shuo.

257
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,830
I don't know when he'll be back.

258
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,610
But for now,

259
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,970
let's say our goodbyes.

260
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,730
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

261
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,230
♫You are the light I yearn for♫

262
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,400
♫You are my determined way home♫

263
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:15,750
♫Let this moment stay forever♫

264
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,860
♫I'm hugging you in the crowd♫

265
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,750
♫Let's never let go♫

266
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,820
♫The stars light up your eyes♫

267
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,510
Are you angry?

268
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:51,760
Just now, I...

269
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,280
What happened just now?

270
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,050
I don't remember.

271
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,520
Anyway,

272
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,060
remember what I told you.

273
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,530
If you ever find yourself in danger again,

274
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,990
protect yourself first.

275
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,790
But it's you I want to protect more.

276
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,910
Given that we came together,

277
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,180
we must make it back together.

278
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,330
Shuo.

279
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,150
What's wrong?

280
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,150
Nothing.

281
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,090
Things are unpredictable tonight.

282
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,100
You don't have to force yourself.

283
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,280
I promised I will help you,

284
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,650
and I will stand by that promise,

285
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,800
no matter what happens.

286
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,360
Nan Wan.

287
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,550
Be polite.

288
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,220
Thank you.

289
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,350
Are you really drinking that?

290
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,670
Hua Lin doesn't seem to be taking us

291
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,260
Eternals and demons seriously, does he?

292
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,840
He invited us to the banquet,

293
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,110
but he is late himself.

294
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,460
It's whatever the host prefers.

295
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,060
As an Eternal, you should be more patient.

296
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,850
If it weren't for the Wutong Spirit Pill,

297
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,270
who would ever visit

298
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,140
such a deserted place?

299
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,530
Would you?

300
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,080
His Majesty is here.

301
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,410
Something came up today,

302
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,830
which caused me to be late.

303
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,210
I have been remiss in my duties to you all.

304
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,080
Allow me to

305
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,450
offer my apologies to everyone.

306
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,400
There's no need to be so polite.

307
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,860
Hurry up and burn the Wutong branch,

308
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,800
so that we can summon the third Heart Flame,

309
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,720
and select the winner of the Wutong Martial Arts Contest.

310
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,290
I can't bear to

311
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,350
stay in this

312
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,050
Outlanders' City any longer.

313
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,460
Don't worry, Divinity.

314
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,740
The Wutong branch

315
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,160
is in the wooden box.

316
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,070
All of you joined the Wutong Martial Arts Contest

317
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,790
to win the Wutong Spirit Pill.

318
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,609
The winner tonight

319
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,040
will win the pill.

320
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,220
But I

321
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,579
have something to tell you.

322
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,880
I've decided hat

323
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,780
from today onwards,

324
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,339
I'll open up Outlanders' City

325
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,349
and let the Outlanders entire the world.

326
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,000
From now on,

327
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,290
the Outlander Race

328
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,599
will no longer

329
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,319
be trapped in Outlanders' City.

330
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,619
I ask that

331
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,290
you relay my words

332
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,750
to your sect after you return.

333
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,000
In the future,

334
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,580
as our Outlanders roam the world,

335
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,890
I also ask for your

336
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,130
kind attention and care,

337
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,600
and not make things difficult for them.

338
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,530
What are you even thinking?

339
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,550
Empty talk from a fool.

340
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,470
I know, right? What a joke.

341
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,980
What? How is that possible?

342
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,430
How can we stand with the Outlanders?

343
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,040
Outside of Outlanders' City,

344
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,980
the Eternals, demons and humans

345
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,120
each have their own regions.

346
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,870
How can there be any spare land for the Outlanders?

347
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,020
If the Outlander Race wants to step out of Outlanders' City,

348
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,240
you must have a blessed place to reside in.

349
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,380
Would this place

350
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,130
be carved out by us Eternals,

351
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,670
or by the demons?

352
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,520
We demons have no room

353
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,140
to accomodate the Outlanders.

354
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,560
You Outlanders are born with weaker spiritual powers.

355
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,870
If you guys are living well in Outlanders' City,

356
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,930
what's the point of wandering around?

357
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,440
Right?

358
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,340
Yeah.

359
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,090
-Yeah.
-You've overestimated yourself.

360
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,820
That's right.

361
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,020
Are the Eternals and demons

362
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,820
really unable to accommodate the Outlanders?

363
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,920
Oppressing the weak with power.

364
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,310
It's the same everywhere.

365
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,900
Just now,

366
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,290
what I said

367
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,080
was just some of my thoughts.

368
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,020
Since you all think it's inappropriate

369
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,650
for Outlanders to enter the world,

370
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,180
I will

371
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,690
give it some more thought.

372
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,150
Tonight,

373
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,530
let's wrap up the contest first.

374
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,040
As per the contest's traditions,

375
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,780
we need

376
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,420
the Three Races to gather

377
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,990
and burn the Wutong branch together,

378
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,810
in order to stimulate the third Heart Flame.

379
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,040
Well...

380
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,130
So this is the Wutong branch?

381
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,590
Now,

382
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,180
everybody, please

383
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,440
burn the Wutong branch together.

384
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,710
It's lit.

385
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,370
Look!

386
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,430
Look up!

387
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,960
-Heart Flame? 
-That's the Heart Flame!

388
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,540
That's the third Heart Flame.

389
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,620
It has finally appeared.

390
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,440
What's going on?

391
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,250
Your Majesty,

392
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,330
why is the third Heart Flame

393
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,230
looking so dull?

394
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,180
This Wutong Martial Arts Contest hosted by the Outlanders

395
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,800
is not a scam, is it?

396
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,430
Indeed.

397
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,550
The ritual is not over yet.

398
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,580
Everyone,

399
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,170
please calm down.

400
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,020
May I ask Ms. Bai

401
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,410
to hand over the two Heart Flames that are with you?

402
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,430
-What?
-She has both Heart Flames?

403
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,240
She has both Heart Flames?

404
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,120
-How did Bai Shuo get both Heart Flames?
-Didn’t Mu Jiu have the Heart Flame previously?

405
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,880
Heart Flame?

406
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,680
Her?

407
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,880
Hand over the Heart Flame. Give it up now!

408
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,670
It seems that

409
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,850
I can't hide anything from you, Your Majesty.

410
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,940
Mu Jiu gave me this Heart Flame.

411
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,330
Are there rules that state

412
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,830
we are not allowed to give this Heart Flame to each other?

413
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,140
Not really.

414
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,670
Then what do you mean, Your Majesty?

415
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,970
Are you trying to take back

416
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,690
the Heart Flames that already have an owner?

417
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,940
Of course not.

418
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,990
The Wutong Heart Flame

419
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,120
was created as one.

420
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,090
The third Heart Flame

421
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,030
needs the other two

422
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,510
in order to be awakened.

423
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,060
-Hand it over! 
-Hand it over!

424
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,410
-Hand it over! 
-Hand it over!

425
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,200
Hand over the other two Heart Flames!

426
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,840
No one can own both of them.

427
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
Just her?

428
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,900
Give them up now!

429
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,830
Hand it over!

430
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,370
During the Fenlan Banquet,

431
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,070
whether those Eternals or demons attend,

432
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,010
the Bright Moon Palace

433
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,810
would definitely be the focus of the King.

434
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,480
I heard that the Fox Clan

435
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,330
are best at hiding and running away.

436
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,110
You shall first sneak into the Underground Palace tonight

437
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,380
and see if Hua Yong is there.

438
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,600
If he's not in the Underground Palace,

439
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
try your best to bring him them.

440
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:13,890
I got it.

441
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,820
What about you?

442
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,950
The third Heart Flame will be created after

443
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,280
the Eternals, demons and the King of Outlanders

444
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,670
burn the Wutong branch together.

445
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,210
After we get the third Heart Flame,

446
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,620
I'll meet you in the Underground Palace.

447
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,650
No problem.

448
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,810
Leave it to me.

449
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,720
But,

450
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,540
you have to prepare two things for me.

451
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,250
One of it is the map of the palace,

452
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,670
and the other is Hua Yong's portrait.

453
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,400
This is...

454
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,700
Look!

455
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:02,960
The Heart Flame!

456
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:04,850
The Heart Flame.

457
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,230
It's fused together.

458
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,850
Now that the three heart flames have come together,

459
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,370
Your Majesty, please tell us

460
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,730
how we'll be deciding the final winner.

461
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,390
It's the Wutong Martial Arts Contest.

462
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,490
Of course we'll need to fight.

463
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,600
What are you doing? Do you want to fight?

464
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,320
What are you doing?

465
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,360
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

466
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,970
Hua Lin.

467
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,060
What exactly do you want?

468
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,610
You Eternals and demons

469
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,470
are full of hypocrisy,

470
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,050
deceiving the world for your own glory.

471
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,200
Since you despise the Outlander Race this much,

472
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,950
I will

473
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,320
kill al of you and bur your bones

474
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,560
here in the Outlanders' City.

475
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,660
What on earth is this place?

476
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,370
It's so creepy.

477
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,380
Hua Yong?

478
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,070
Hua Yong?

479
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,340
Did the King of Outlanders used evil magic to offer this sacrifice?

480
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,400
Who is he offering this sacrifice to?

481
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:54,610
No.

482
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,760
This is too strange.

483
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,950
I must not let Tian Huo and Bai Shuo in.

484
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,420
I have to take Hua Yong away.

485
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,080
Where do you want to take him?

486
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,590
What are you doing?

487
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,580
Let me tell you.

488
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,000
I'm the young master of the Fox Clan.

489
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,830
If anything happens to me here in Outlanders' City,

490
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,930
my aunt will definitely come for all of you.

491
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,790
As long as today's plans are successful,

492
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,790
let alone Chang Mei,

493
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,620
your entire clan could come

494
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,620
and we Outlanders wouldn't even give a damn.

495
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,910
Just now,

496
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,530
I've given you one last chance.

497
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,110
If you are willing to give us Outlanders a way out,

498
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,630
I can also

499
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,720
give you all a way out.

500
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,010
But unfortunately,

501
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,630
you didn't cherish the opportunity.

502
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,480
Today's dire situation

503
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,540
is entirely of your own making.

504
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,470
Hua Lin.

505
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,770
If you dare to act rashly,

506
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,480
Bright Moon Palace will definitely not spare your life.

507
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,860
You are restricted by the Magic Restriction,

508
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,610
and you are also seriously injured.

509
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,830
You don't have to pretend you're fine.

510
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,410
At this point,

511
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,970
tonight,

512
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,630
I ask that

513
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,140
you die here too.

514
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,040
Hua Lin.

515
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,710
Even if you kill all the Eternals and demons in the city today,

516
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,470
it only brings you temporary relief.

517
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,530
The Eternals and demons will seek their revenge one day.

518
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,900
How can the Outlanders

519
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,440
stand against the fury of the world?

520
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,310
After tonight,

521
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,530
we, the Outlander Race,

522
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,190
will no longer be trapped in this lonely city

523
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,710
and be bullied by the Eternals and demons ever again.

524
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,830
As Outlanders,

525
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,410
there'll be no place that is off-limits,

526
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,990
and there'll be nothing we cannot do.

527
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,830
All rules

528
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,540
shall be decided by the Outlanders.

529
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,610
Decided by the Outlanders?

530
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,150
-On what grounds?
-Yeah.

531
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,580
Who’s afraid of who?

532
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,720
You are not just looking to vent your anger.

533
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,360
What exactly do you intend to do with the lives

534
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,030
of all these Eternals and demons?

535
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,660
Don't worry.

536
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,770
Soon,

537
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,310
you will know the answer.

538
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,380
Your Majesty,

539
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,080
I advise you to stop now.

540
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,450
The Lanling disciples are at the inn.

541
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,110
Once they figure out something is wrong,

542
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,570
they will report to the sect immediately.

543
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,760
Within tonight,

544
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,780
the Five Eternals of Lanling

545
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,130
will arrive in Outlanders' City.

546
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,640
I

547
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,230
forgot to tell you.

548
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,880
The Outlanders' City's barrier has been activated.

549
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,720
No one from outside can get in,

550
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,610
and no one from inside

551
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,330
can similarly get out.

552
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,650
How are we going to get out then?

553
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,830
Tonight,

554
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,990
you'll only die here in Outlanders' City.

555
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,510
Take them down!

556
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,190
Get the Heart Flame!

557
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,480
Heart Flame!

558
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,160
Let's get out of here!

559
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,120
Zhao.

560
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,020
Are you okay?

561
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,050
I'm fine.

562
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,790
Let's get out first.

563
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,070
Do what you have to do.

564
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,370
Let's go.

565
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,530
Let's go.

566
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,090
There's no time.

567
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,430
Hurry and get vision from the Contemplation Stone.

568
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,660
Only by breaking Hua Lin's scheme

569
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,770
can we save everyone.

570
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,720
You go to the Underground Palace.

571
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,080
I'll distract Hua Lin.

572
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:27,890
If you don't stop,

573
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,600
I'll destroy these three Heart Flames immediately.

574
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,410
You think you can threaten me

575
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,010
with just these three Heart Flames?

576
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,540
If these three Heart Flames are not important,

577
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,690
why did you drop everything and come after me?

578
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,820
The Eternals and demons had already fallen for your trap.

579
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,560
You could have simply ordered for our arrest,

580
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,950
but you just had to retrieve the first two Heart Flames

581
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,210
from Bai Shuo.

582
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,450
This proves

583
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,680
you also need these three Heart Flames.

584
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,500
Even if you know,

585
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,780
so what?

586
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,720
No one can stop my plans.

587
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,900
Your plans

588
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,430
are doomed to fail.

589
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,210
I've already made my arrangements

590
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,530
in the Underground Palace.

591
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,080
Do you think you can stop everything

592
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,610
just by luring me away?

593
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,270
What exactly do you want?

594
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,700
Given that the situation is settled,

595
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,730
I can now tell you.

596
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:22,970
I want

597
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,550
all of the Eternals and demons in the city to become offerings,

598
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,910
so as to make Yong a deity.

599
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,890
Sacrificial altar?

600
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,680
Where is Mu Jiu?

601
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,060
Did he fail to come in

602
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,340
or did something happened?

603
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,910
This is the third scene from the Contemplation Stone.

604
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,430
We are here in the Underground Palace,

605
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,700
we have three Heart Flames,

606
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,630
Hua Yong,

607
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,160
and you.

608
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,870
All conditions have been met.

609
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,230
Why is there no response?

610
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,610
Are we missing something?

611
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,440
You've gone crazy.

612
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,090
Zhen Yu is a sinister man.

613
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,480
You have no idea what might

614
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,840
emerge from evil magic.

615
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:21,730
Do you know

616
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,230
if you take just one wrong step,

617
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,880
he won't even have

618
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,170
the chance to live?

619
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,730
If I don't do this,

620
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,340
Yong won't get to live for long either.

621
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,250
There will be no Outlander

622
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,240
who can wield the Outlander King's Sword.

623
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,090
By then, we Outlanders

624
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,900
will be in dire straits.

625
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,730
One day,

626
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,030
you will understand my choice.

627
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,580
You're always so full of yourself.

628
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,060
Whether it was seven years ago

629
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,480
or seven years later,

630
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,570
even though you knew that sacrificing mother

631
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,350
would not eliminate the famine,

632
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,680
you still would not dare to go against the people's will

633
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,350
to protect her.

634
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,020
Now,

635
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,440
you know full well that making Hua Yong a deity

636
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,030
wouldn't truly solve

637
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,010
the Outlanders' discrimination,

638
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,520
yet you refuse to face the truth.

639
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,940
Hua Lin.

640
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,920
You are just a coward.

641
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,480
A complete and utter coward!

642
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,200
When I was young,

643
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,480
I used to ride on your neck,

644
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,970
and I even stood on your shoulders

645
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,080
to reach out of the stars in the sky.

646
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,380
At that time,

647
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,860
I really thought my father

648
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,050
was the strongest hero in the world.

649
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,300
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

650
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,830
But why...

651
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,480
Why did you become like this?

652
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,610
I've never

653
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:45,090
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

654
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,800
given up on your mother.

655
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,440
I tried my best to save her.

656
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,540
Save her?

657
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:55,180
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

658
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,230
It was you who made her jump into the furnace.

659
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,140
The plan we had discussed

660
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,490
was for your mother to fake her death

661
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,510
so as to reassure the people.

662
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:01,150
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫

663
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,440
What did you say?

664
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,750
Fake her death?

665
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,190
I gave her the Fire Protection Pearl,

666
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,640
and left a escape passage

667
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,140
under the furnace.

668
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,680
She should have been able to survive.

669
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,930
Burn her to death!

670
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,510
But,

671
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,620
something went wrong.

672
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,320
We were just one step away,

673
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,010
♫Across thousands of miles♫

674
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,640
but it cause me,

675
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,520
you,

676
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:26,930
and Yong

677
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,470
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

678
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,560
to lose her forever.

679
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,790
Mother!

680
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,560
No!

681
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,680
Don't!

682
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:43,370
♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

683
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,380
So what went wrong?

684
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,290
Wu Zhao was tricked by a sorcerer.

685
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,980
The Fire Protection Pearl he gave me

686
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,340
♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

687
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,100
was fake.

688
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,270
Wu Zhao?

689
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,390
Princess,

690
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,940
are you calling for me?

691
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,350
Why are you here?

692
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,190
Didn't I tell you to guard the Underground Palace?

693
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,830
The Underground Palace is under control.

694
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:13,699
No.

695
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,210
In other words,

696
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,750
the whole Outlanders' City has been controlled,

697
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,420
including you, Your Majesty,

698
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,219
and the Princess.

699
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,580
Wu Zhao.

700
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,120
What do you mean?

701
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,050
A long time ago,

702
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,130
I thought to myself,

703
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,850
you were born weak

704
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,159
and indecisive.

705
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,960
You could wield the Outlander King's Sword

706
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,280
all thanks to the Mei family's help.

707
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,980
No matter how I see it,

708
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,639
you are just not as good as me.

709
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:38,090
What makes you worthy of being the king of this Outlanders' City,

710
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,469
while I am not?

711
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,000
How dare you!

712
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,550
You've been hiding your power all this time.

713
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,510
You...

714
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,830
didn't use an Outlanders' techniques.

715
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,530
Where did you

716
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,230
learn those evil techniques from?

717
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,150
You can work with Cold Spring Palace,

718
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,120
so why can't I?

719
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,520
You were the one

720
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,330
who saved Fu Ling last night.

721
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,490
At this point, I don't have to hide it anymore.

722
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,190
It's a grand celebration tonight.

723
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,310
I not only want the life of the Eternals and demons,

724
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,680
but also

725
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,670
your life.

726
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,800
I said

727
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,290
I'll see you again.

728
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,070
Why do you have spiritual power?

729
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,480
If you Eternals and demons can work together,

730
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,900
of course I'll also have my allies

731
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,490
in Outlanders' City.

732
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,040
Why?

733
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,770
Do you regret

734
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,910
not killing me last night?

735
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,100
-Don’t touch her!
-Don’t touch her!

736
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,530
One is the Polar Region's Demon King,

737
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,880
and the other is the head disciple of Lanling.

738
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,540
Both are willing to sacrifice their lives for you.

739
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,530
Bai Shuo,

740
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,380
you are indeed quite something.

741
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,570
Last night, your sword

742
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,940
was stained with my blood.

743
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,090
Do you think I should

744
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,110
avenge with blood too?

745
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,080
Why don't you kill me immediately instead?

746
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,240
You are only this fearless because

747
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,700
you know that the Contemplation Stone is in your body.

748
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,410
If I kill you by force,

749
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,950
wouldn't I suffer from the backlash of its divine power?

750
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,120
I don't like

751
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,590
your petty tricks.

752
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,450
No.

753
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,870
Actually,

754
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,560
I don't like

755
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,950
all of you.

756
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,870
Why are you

757
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:32,040
relentlessly cornering me,

758
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,000
and even forcing the person who was most important to me to die?

759
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,480
Is it all because of the Contemplation Stone?

760
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,210
It's not just because of that,

761
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,270
but also because

762
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,820
your happiness

763
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,170
seems too jarring.

764
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,660
You probably don't know that

765
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,390
the first time we met

766
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,340
wasn't at the Governor's Mansion,

767
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,330
but at the Unbridled Pavilion.

768
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,990
You were so full of vigor

769
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,780
and so carefree.

770
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,320
Back then, I thought

771
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,160
such a carefree person

772
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,070
deserve to suffer more.

773
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,370
Crazy.

774
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,390
Crazy?

775
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,840
To me, that sounds like

776
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,160
a compliment.

777
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,540
In this world,

778
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,930
rather than being a good person,

779
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,430
I'd rather be a madman.

780
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,620
At least, I'm happy.

781
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,060
For example,

782
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,920
I just want to play a game with you now.

783
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,730
A city full of Eternals and demons,

784
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,950
all caught up in the net

785
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,270
for the blood sacrifice tonight.

786
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,570
Your death is near,

787
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,200
but I can give you a chance.

788
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,180
Between Fan Yue

789
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,530
and Chong Zho,

790
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,780
pick one.

791
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,580
Whoever you choose,

792
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,930
I can let him go.

793
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,430
Shuo.

794
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,610
Don't believe her.

795
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,630
Fan Yue!

796
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,260
I don't need you to believe me.

797
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,850
I just need you to choose.

798
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,390
If you don't choose,

799
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,340
both of them will die.

800
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,730
Bai Shuo,

801
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,630
you claim to be a man of honor.

802
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,250
I'm curious to see

803
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,680
how you will choose

804
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,060
between two difficult choices?

805
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,360
What should we do?

806
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,500
We can't get out.

807
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,350
How can we break through this barrier?

808
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,000
Stop complaining and think of something.

809
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,250
I didn't expect that attending the Wutong Martial Arts Contest

810
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,210
would cost me my life.

811
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,880
Ms. Bai did remind me that

812
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,000
the banquet will be dangerous.

813
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,950
I'm here on my master's order.

814
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,600
So why are you here?

815
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,960
Why did you come when you knew it was dangerous?

816
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,270
Why did you save me just now?

817
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,840
The various sects of the Eternals are meant to stay united.

818
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,560
You haven’t answered my question.

819
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,730
What a pity.

820
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,060
What's a pity?

821
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,760
I...

822
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,480
have a younger brother.

823
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,050
He was born with a weak spiritual vein.

824
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,280
He won't be able to live long.

825
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,490
I heard that this Wutong Spirit Pill

826
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,780
can repair the spiritual vein.

827
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,890
So...

828
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,710
So that's the reason for

829
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,370
your rash and hasty behaviour earlier.

830
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,640
It's all for naught.

831
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,480
How long have you

832
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,860
been planning for this day?

833
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,980
For how long?

834
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,650
From the day I was adopted by the Mei family,

835
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,880
I haven't had a day where I didn't think about rising to power.

836
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,380
You were born a prince.

837
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,410
No matter how weak you are,

838
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,880
people will do everything

839
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,920
to make you a king.

840
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,210
And I,

841
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,470
being born at the bottom,

842
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,040
have been bullied since I was young.

843
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,640
I asked why,

844
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,870
but they told me

845
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,570
this is my life.

846
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,950
A wretched life.

847
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,990
These scars

848
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,810
were not incurred on the battlefield,

849
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,260
but from Outlanders.

850
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,410
I was homeless when I was young.

851
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,910
I've had enough of people's evil.

852
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,630
I had to rely on the Mei family to make a comeback.

853
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,160
That's why I became a tool for the Mei family

854
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,760
to protect the royal family.

855
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,940
Grandfather treats you like his own child.

856
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,890
Mother treats you like her own brother.

857
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,680
How could you be so cold?

858
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,660
Cold?

859
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,790
When your mother was forced to die,

860
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,230
who wasn't cold?

861
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,510
Speaking of Mei Han,

862
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,410
she did treat me well.

863
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,090
But unfortunately,

864
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,330
she's a blocker in my path to becoming king,

865
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,000
so she has to die.

866
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,160
What did you do to her?

867
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,620
Blame her for being too smart.

868
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,280
Seven years ago, there was a famine in Outlanders' City.

869
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,470
I instigated the people to overthrow Hua Lin,

870
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,300
but she found out.

871
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,490
Do you think

872
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,580
I could still keep her?

873
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,090
In order to kill her, I just had to

874
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,020
use a stone with the engraved words,

875
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,370
"After the queen falls, the famine will be gone."

876
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,760
But I underestimated your love for her.

877
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,780
In the face of the people's demands,

878
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,470
you chose to send her away and hide her.

879
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,980
I had to change my plan.

880
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,650
It's you.

881
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,760
You used Hua Yong?

882
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,470
Yes.

883
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,450
The one who exposed your mother's hiding place

884
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,520
was not Hua Yong.

885
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,250
It was me.

886
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,970
It was also me

887
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,440
who pinned the blame to Hua Yong.

888
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,600
I just didn't expect that

889
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,690
when Mei Han stood up to face everything,

890
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,640
you were still trying to protect her.

891
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,620
I could only lie that I found the Fire Protection Pearl

892
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,790
and suggested for Mei Han to fake her death.

893
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,680
You believed me,

894
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,150
and Mei Han threw herself into the furnace,

895
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,390
taking all the secrets with her

896
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,890
and dying completely.

897
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,130
Then, I just claimed that I was deceived by a sorcerer,

898
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,120
and didn't know that the Fire Protection Pearl was fake.

899
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,330
You believed it too.

900
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,070
I didn't blame you then

901
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,220
because you're Mei Han's sworn brother.

902
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,480
I didn't know you were such a beast.

903
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,830
I'll kill you!

904
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,960
♫What kind of flower would never bear fruit?♫

905
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:57,980
♫What kind of fruit never sees a flower?♫

906
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:07,840
♫Withstanding the stillness, you are a broken piece of me♫

907
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,050
You mustn't die!

908
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,550
I haven't forgiven you yet.

909
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,700
I won't let you die.

910
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,120
You can't die.

911
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,950
♫I am the fruit to your flowers♫

912
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,870
Hua Lin was indeed a good father.

913
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,870
Seven years ago, you tried to wield the the Sword and destroy the city,

914
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,380
but got wounded by the sword's energy.

915
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,420
Did you think it was mere luck that you survived?

916
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,460
It was Hua Lin who sent you out of the city for medical treatment,

917
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,680
in order to save your life.

918
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,550
It was only then you had the fortune of meeting Fan Yue.

919
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,880
Why didn't you tell me?

920
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,620
I want you to leave the Outlanders' City,

921
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:36,650
♫Across thousands of miles♫

922
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:38,200
and live a carefree life.

923
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,100
I don't want to repeat

924
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,860
your mother's tragedy.

925
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:46,200
♫The pain of parting lingers♫

926
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,260
No, no, don't die!

Don't die!

928
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,950
Father!

929
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:55,870
♫ I light a lamp with no wick to carry me through the rest of my days♫

930
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,120
Don't die, Father!

00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,860
Don't die! Don't die!

♫Flowers in the wind, sand in the water♫

933
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,430
Hearing you call me father,

934
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,290
I can die without regrets.

935
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,710
♫May I ask, what do the gods see in the world?♫

936
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,010
♫Sadness from infatuation, anger, and parting♫

937
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,860
♫My love brought tears♫

938
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,560
Father!

939
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,880
♫Greed for gathering, for holding, and for completeness♫

940
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,080
♫I was never a flower, but I withered on my own♫

941
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,800
No!

942
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:29,510
♫I fell between your brows and became a good fruit♫

943
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,540
♫The grand dream of life is hard to let go♫

944
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,240
No!

945
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,890
♫Searching for the path, the answers, yet found nothing♫

946
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,830
♫With a heart full of compassion for the people, I let go of my obsessions♫

947
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,730
♫I cultivated myself to be free of desires, offering myself as a sacrifice to the moon♫

948
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,110
♫The daylight burns through, and the stars shine bright♫

949
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,000
♫Through the Buddhist dust, I see the moon in the sky♫

950
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,110
♫I am but a mortal, destined to fade♫

951
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,390
♫But I went through a thousand calamities for a promise♫

952
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,180
♫I severed emotions, desires, and the fate between you and me♫

953
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,840
♫To protect the world for eternity♫

954
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,310
Mei Han said I was wrong.

955
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,260
Hua Lin said I was wrong.

956
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,170
Even you said I was wrong.

957
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,480
Today, I will show you exactly

958
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,060
who can save the Outlanders' City.

959
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,000
Still undecided?

960
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,850
I'm not that patient.

961
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:26,890
I'll count to three.

962
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,040
If you don't choose,

963
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,120
you'll have no choice.

964
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,160
One.

965
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,760
Two.

966
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,960
Three.
