No matter when or where...

7
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,740
or how we met,

8
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,040
I wouldn't have changed a thing.

9
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,010
I couldn't have.

10
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,620
Not how I feel.

11
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,590
Let's see this through.

12
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,390
We might be wrong sometimes.

13
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,760
And we might have regrets.

14
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,260
As for regrets,

15
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,600
let's just save them for later,

16
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,800
when we have time.

17
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,970
Okay.

18
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,050

(Episode 11)

20

I'm home.

21
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,770
- You're back? - Yes.

22
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,240
Want some chocolate?

23
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,480
Mom sent it for my college entrance exam.

24
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,710
Really?

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,480
Oh, right.

26
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,150
She said she enjoyed this. And thanks.

(Nu Ri's Album)

28
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,410
I'm making things hard for you.

29
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,580
If I weren't around, it might be less tough on you, right?

30
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,590
Nu Ri.

31
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,790
After your exam,

32
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,630
we need to have a talk.

33
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,659
My exam is the day after tomorrow.

34
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,499
- So we'll talk then? - Yes.

35
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,130
Gosh, let's just talk now.

36
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,200
Is this about Mom?

37
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,040
Why?

38
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,569
Do you want me to go live with her again?

39
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,880
If you want to, that's your call.

40
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,310
What is he on about?

41
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,350
It's sweet.

(Rice Cakes: We root for the CSAT-takers.)

43
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,840
- Welcome. - Hi.

44
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,010
Can I help you find something?

45
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,710
For the CSAT, are sticky rice cakes the traditional gift?

46
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,280
She's not a big fan of taffy.

47
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,550
Oh, in that case...

48
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,349
Try one. They're delicious.

49
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,780
Oh, thank you.

50
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,960
I'll take one of these, then.

51
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Okay.

52
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,330
Prepping for a meeting.

53
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,300
A little different than usual, right?

54
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,740
Give me a pat on the back!

55
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,180
Which of these two should I use to cheer you on?

56
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,580
It's a honey pastry and a red bean rice cake.

57
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,680
Chewy and sweet.

58
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,990
Both, of course.

59
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,960
And...

60
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,460
That day it snowed, you left something behind.

61
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,940
One of you was more nervous than the person taking the exam.

62
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,339
And the other, who teaches the CSAT-takers,

63
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,540
just left rice cakes and bailed.

64
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,350
What?

65
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,710
Seok Joo?

66
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,450
- When did you see him? - Last night.

67
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,450
He came by the study room. He said he's too busy to come today.

68
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,620
Really?

69
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,089
Is it because of me?

70
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,530
Yes, probably.

71
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,259
Because if I bomb the exam, you'd give him hell.

72
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,660
Isn't that on you, though?

73
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,540
Just drop me off up ahead.

74
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,869
Why?

75
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,540
Are you meeting up with that giant halfway?

76
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,479
- Yes. - I see.

77
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,439
Eun Nu Ri, you're not even trying to hide it anymore.

78
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,609
I've already seen the mess that hiding things causes.

79
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,050
From now on, I'm just going to be honest.

80
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,080
So, I'll be honest.

81
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,650
You should take a trip.

82
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,460
Until my scores are released, I just want to relax and have fun.

83
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,359
If you score your own test after you finish today,

84
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,860
you'll get a rough idea of your score, won't you?

85
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,100
Whatever.

86
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,230
Just go already.

87
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,370
You've worked hard too.

88
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,310
Okay, I get it.

89
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,509
You have your test identification slip, right?

90
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,140
- Yes. - Double-check.

91
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,350
Do well on your exam today.

92
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,380
Once you're done,

93
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,950
we can have all the fun you want, okay?

94
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,320
Yes! It's finally over.

95
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,230
The truth is, both Nu Ri and her brother...

96
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,060
probably already know.

97
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,160
That on a day like this, the one who's most nervous...

98
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,800
is me.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,170
Because her report card...

100
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,640
is my report card.

101
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,970
I honestly...

102
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
had no idea.

103
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,710
That at some point, she started falling behind in class.

104
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,850
By the time I realized, it was too late.

105
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,750
And for all the sins that I cannot recall,

106
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,920
I ask for your forgiveness.

107
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,690
If you have committed such sins, my son...

108
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,060
For your penance, say the Lord's Prayer three times.

109
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,130
Amen.

110
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,210
(Sunwoo Hae)

111
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,450
Did she get in okay?

112
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,780
Yes.

113
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,950
Now that the day's actually here, I can't believe how nervous I am.

114
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,190
Then you should go to a church or a temple.

115
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,520
Many families will be there. You won't feel alone.

116
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,590
My mom went to a temple on my exam day too.

117
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,430
Do you know any good temples?

118
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,469
Yes, but that one's kind of far.

119
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,499
You wouldn't know any churches, would you?

120
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,699
A holy site would be fine too.

121
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,909
You can probably just find one online, right?

122
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,579
I'm not some AI assistant.

123
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,079
I can't just spit out an answer the second you ask.

124
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,850
It'd be a lot faster to look it up than to ask me.

125
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,180
Oh, right.

126
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,820
You said your audition was today, right?

127
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,160
Looks like we'll both be on pins and needles.

128
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,959
Yes, it's been a while, so...

129
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,760
I'm so, so nervous.

130
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,160
Let's just hope they both pass, okay?

131
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,400
Call me when you're done. Let's get something good to eat.

132
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,450
What?

133
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,930
Showing up here dressed like that...

134
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,629
I look like I shouldn't be here. You know what I mean?

135
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,700
Like, an exorcist or something.

136
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,299
I don't think you'll ever lose to someone possessed.

137
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,370
Right?

138
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,600
What were you doing?

139
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,510
I came to confess my sins and say a few prayers.

140
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,580
It's my sister's college entrance exam day.

141
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,479
Do you come to church often?

142
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,150
I'm not super religious or anything.

143
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,650
But lately, I've needed somewhere to find some peace of mind.

144
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,420
When I was a kid,

145
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,520
I wanted to be a priest.

146
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,390
What's with that reaction?

147
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,659
I'm kind of offended.

148
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,160
Hey, no need to get offended.

149
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,230
Anyway, here are your cheering props.

150
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,670
You actually bought them?

151
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,970
I was just kidding.

152
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,080
Thanks.

153
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,220
So, what was it I left behind?

154
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,420
I'm not the type to leave things behind.

155
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,620
Me.

156
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,030
You left me behind at your place. How could you forget?

157
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,900
- What? - I'll let it slide this one time.

158
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,900
You're so weird.

159
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,470
Should I say a prayer while I'm here?

160
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,240
Want to join me?

161
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,110
You know, when we first met...

162
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,380
in the radio booth,

163
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,250
I asked you out of the blue if you'd been crying.

164
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,550
Now that I am on the receiving end of some comfort,

165
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,450
I've realized that my approach was inappropriate.

166
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,590
It's just that my personality is naturally a bit rumpled.

167
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,730
Who are you praying to?

168
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,830
To Mo Tae Rin.

169
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,500
Unlike him, I'm not very merciful.

170
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,070
I wasn't asking for mercy.

171
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,370
I just...

172
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,910
wanted to say that.

173
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,180
If you're naturally rumpled,

174
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,920
then just stay rumpled.

175
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,990
That's part of the reason I was drawn to you.

176
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Amen.

177
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,369
No, that's not it at all!

178
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,310
- That's not what I meant! No! - Hey!

179
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,770
Is the owner here?

180
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,379
Oh, you're here.

181
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,579
- No customers at all? - Hello.

182
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,480
Oh, Ms. Firefighter, hello.

183
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,950
Why call her a firefighter all of a sudden?

184
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,649
Let's just say it's because of our first meeting.

185
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,020
She just grabbed a fire extinguisher and started spraying it everywhere.

186
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,159
That time...

187
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,960
It must've been a pain to clean up, right?

188
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,460
Hurry up!

189
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,300
You hurry up!

190
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,729
Oh, that.

191
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,140
Is it still hard for you to see yourself as a kid?

192
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,540
How did I end up like this?

193
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,339
Don't we have some of those sheet masks left in the fridge?

194
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,509
You were a tough kid, Hae.

195
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,879
Guess this'll make your skin barrier tougher too, Hae.

196
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,979
I'll go get one.

197
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,010
Hey, that's my mask!

198
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,720
Hold on, before you put that on.

199
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,690
You know, I'm still officially Jin Mu Yeong's agent.

200
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,820
We have many offers to republish that out-of-print collection...

201
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,860
- after the show aired. - Really?

202
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,759
That's fantastic!

203
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,930
And I'm telling you because I want you to do it.

204
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,500
A huge payday?

205
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,630
This time, you might just be able to.

206
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,140
I think you might be right.

207
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,610
There's just one problem.

208
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,240
Where did I put the original file?

209
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,210
What?

210
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,810
Oh, right!

211
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,379
You must have it. I wrote it on your laptop, remember?

212
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,290
My laptop? Oh, that one was ancient. I replaced it a long time ago.

213
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,720
- What? - Wait a minute.

214
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,160
You're telling me you didn't back it up?

215
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,690
You're right. That is a problem.

216
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,769
So how were you planning to release a revised edition?

217
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,600
What, were you just going to copy it from the book?

218
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,870
Hey, that would work.

219
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,709
Were you always this careless?

220
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,340
So much for that huge payday.

221
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,279
Goes to show, the title was prophetic.

222
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,750
"A World Made of Ash." Seriously.

223
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,349
I should've known from the very beginning.

224
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,550
"A World Made of Gold!"

225
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,449
"A World Made of Gold Bars!" Now that would've been great!

226
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,750
Oh, honestly...

227
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,720
I just really, really...

228
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,119
hate guys who are writers.

229
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,589
Hey, what about me?

230
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,860
I was talking about you.

231
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,800
Unbelievable.

232
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,040
Who is it? Why aren't you checking?

233
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,670
What?

234
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,540
- Is that Sang Yeop? - Gosh.

235
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,770
No.

236
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,610
No, word has really gotten out that I quit.

237
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,110
Now everyone wants to get coffee.

238
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,780
Okay, bye now.

239
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,860
Yes, Director.

240
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,330
Oh, I'm in a meeting. What's up?

241
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,160
Hey, I'm the wicked stepsister now! So wicked!

242
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,300
You know what?

243
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,870
I'm not the least bit surprised you're the wicked stepsister!

244
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,710
Come hang out and have a beer. Gi Ppeum said he's buying pizza.

245
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,410
You think Gi Ppeum will place the order right?

246
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,050
Thank you.

247
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:42,049
Oh, hello.

248
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,690
Oh, hi there.

249
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,860
I already ordered, but did you want anything else?

250
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,860
What did you order?

251
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,360
Tae Rin has to watch her figure from now on, so...

252
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,070
Even for her "last supper," she's still counting calories.

253
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,399
I got the whole wheat crust.

254
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,839
So, two whole wheat pizzas?

255
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,970
No, just one whole wheat.

256
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,209
Come on, look how many people we have.

257
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,539
What? Isn't one more than enough?

258
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,440
No way. It's not enough at all.

259
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,680
Next time you buy food for a shoot, make sure you get extra.

260
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,580
Better to bring nothing at all than not enough for everyone.

261
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,050
Hey, should we get this combo?

262
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,630
Okay.

263
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,300
Welcome.

264
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,370
To confess your love through the language of flowers...

265
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,810
might be a coward's way.

266
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,980
In a way, flowers are...

267
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,480
like an instant confession of love.

268
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,220
Oh, that's pretty good.

269
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,260
"Flowers are..."

270
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,889
"an instant confession of love."

271
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,960
Get out.

272
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,700
Hae.

273
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,600
Let's republish "Waegeum."

274
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,399
I've already set everything up.

275
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,140
I also looked into other publishers.

276
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,010
You know the books still in print? They're starting to sell again.

277
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,239
Publishers are taking stock of their remaining copies...

278
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,040
and deciding whether to do another print run.

279
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,910
The timing is perfect. You have to do this!

280
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,220
- I will. - Right.

281
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,450
Wait, really?

282
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,319
Even if all publishers disappeared and only yours was left,

283
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,760
I still wouldn't work with your company.

284
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,990
No!

285
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,730
You have to do it with me.

286
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,730
I had to track down the warehouse of that bankrupt publisher, but...

287
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,370
The contract you signed was a mess, and the only one who can fix it...

288
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,170
is me!

289
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,710
What's with all the confidence?

290
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,109
If you will hate me anyway, I've decided to embrace it. So what?

291
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,679
Hey, hey, don't talk. I had this whole...

292
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,020
I wrote down all I was going to say, and I rehearsed it.

293
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,190
Stop ambushing me with questions. You're throwing me off.

294
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,120
Okay, what was I saying? Right...

295
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,820
Oh, my business card! Right. Here.

296
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,829
This is my card.

297
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,730
Call me anytime.

298
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,669
- And if I don't? - I'll just keep showing up!

299
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,700
And if I do?

300
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,470
I'll still show up from time to time.

301
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,110
I'm taking these flowers!

302
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,810
Good job.

303
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,019
Why does he act so bright all the time?

304
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,720
(Sunwoo Chan)

305
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,960
I forgot everything. You're so distracting, I swear.

306
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,359
- This looks amazing! - Gosh, thanks for the food!

307
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,260
- Enjoy! - Enjoy!

308
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,910
This is so good.

309
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,269
That's so true.

310
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,180
So good it's worth starving for tomorrow.

311
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,510
Oh, while I was reading the script,

312
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,620
I found an odd stage direction. May I ask about it?

313
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,290
I wonder what he found odd.

314
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,850
The part where Kongjwi...

315
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,259
suddenly erupts, unable to contain her rage,

316
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,859
and sweeps the entire feast off the table.

317
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,059
Isn't that such a waste of food?

318
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,430
The actress playing Kongjwi must be nervous.

319
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,229
She has to get it all in one clean sweep.

320
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,230
No way.

321
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,899
It'd be weird if Patjwi stepped in to stop her, right?

322
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,900
As long as the prop food is okay, it shouldn't matter, right?

323
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,000
Did she poison the food?

324
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,610
That's it. She figured it out.

325
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,010
It's not that I'm smart.

326
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,510
Maybe you're just a little slow?

327
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,980
If you look at this line here,

328
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,490
Kongjwi is smart too, you know.

329
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,020
But Patjwi is just so devious.

330
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,560
Pat, pat.

331
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,459
Why have you been going "pat, pat" since yesterday?

332
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,060
Because I'm Patjwi. Pat, pat.

333
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,659
Oh, Gi Ppeum, when you think about going on set soon,

334
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,400
you must be so excited. Pat.

335
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,899
Hey, that's getting on my nerves.

336
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,640
I'm not an employee here,

337
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,940
so I'm free to "pat, pat" all I want. Pat, pat.

338
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,410
But you definitely said...

339
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,550
I wouldn't be going on location for a while.

340
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,679
- That I could take my time with it. - Getting what?

341
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
My driver's license.

342
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,320
I found out after I hired him.

343
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,220
Wait, when you posted the job, didn't you require a license?

344
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,259
And you, Gi Ppeum...

345
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,589
Someone tells you to take your time, and you actually take your time?

346
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,830
How do you expect to survive in the real world?

347
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,659
Seriously, do you even want to work? How can you be so nonchalant?

348
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,730
Hey, hey, lay off Gi Ppeum.

349
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,000
If you hadn't pushed me, I'd have taken my time on a project,

350
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,799
and Gi Ppeum would have her license by now.

351
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,209
So what if he has it? He's a beginner.

352
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,969
You want Tae Rin to ride with someone...

353
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,109
who has zero driving experience?

354
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,649
Expecting me to have experience without a chance to get any...

355
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,049
- is completely absurd. - Oh, is that so?

356
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,279
You all must have had a chance to gain experience.

357
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,290
Were any of you perfect drivers from day one?

358
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,350
Me too.

359
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,789
I'll get it as soon as possible...

360
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,389
and practice day and night.

361
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,229
This is driving me crazy.

362
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,330
I can't be the one to back her up on set,

363
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,670
so what happens to my Tae Rin?

364
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,410
I guess I'll just have to drive myself, then.

365
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,349
Dragging my exhausted self home after every shoot.

366
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,380
On a two-hour drive home from the set.

367
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,920
I guess I brought this on myself.

368
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,259
Here you go.

369
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,060
Oh, come on.

370
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,500
If you do this every time, it puts me in a tough spot.

371
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,470
Just make sure you water it well.

372
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,470
Take care.

373
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,670
What?

374
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,410
- What was that about? - What just happened?

375
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,739
Did you just give her flowers?

376
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,209
I was giving out leftover flowers to the shops nearby.

377
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,609
Can't sell them, but they're fresh. It's a shame to waste them.

378
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,820
No, I mean...

379
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,350
What was that about?

380
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,050
Some hyacinths, chrysanthemums, and a few roses.

381
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,919
Do you want some too? I have extras.

382
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,860
No!

383
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,360
No, that's not...

384
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,830
Why would you give those to her?

385
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,469
You're practically begging her to get the wrong idea.

386
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,270
Why would she get the wrong idea?

387
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,539
I'm the one who will!

388
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,940
Don't you do that.

389
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,140
Follow me.

390
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,020
Hey, hey, Je Yeon! Seong Je Yeon!

391
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,990
Slow down a little.

392
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,489
Are these small scissors all you have?

393
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,690
Don't you have any bigger ones?

394
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,560
Oh, what about poisonous flowers?

395
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,900
Hey, you can't sell something like that.

396
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,770
Oh, this one's good.

397
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,800
Could a person fit in here?

398
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,140
What are you doing?

399
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,910
Tae Rin's starting a new project,

400
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,550
and I guess I've gotten a little obsessed with it.

401
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,050
Wait, I thought you were taking a break.

402
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,989
Mo Tae Rin's agency...

403
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,730
Isn't that the one that didn't even have chairs?

404
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,360
- You, honestly... - What?

405
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,760
What's this?

406
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,200
Oh, that?

407
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,000
I got this brochure at the hospital during my last check-up.

408
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,840
They're having a clinical trial overseas.

409
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,370
But, an overseas clinical trial...

410
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,680
Does that mean you must live there for several months?

411
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,450
If you go, will it cure you?

412
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,380
We won't know until we try. Neither me nor the doctors.

413
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,720
I haven't been doing so well lately, you know.

414
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,190
Like what happened last time.

415
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,220
They said the progression is a bit on the faster side.

416
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,770
But, I mean...

417
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,010
That's not... I mean...

418
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,510
There are new drugs,

419
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,580
and they're coming out all the time.

420
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,220
And we're here together right now.

421
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,860
We'll get through this, right?

422
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,200
Is that even a question?

423
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,470
We will get through this.

424
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,670
I won't make you worry.

425
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,440
The bouquet? Did you finish it?

426
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,350
Oh, speaking of which, I was going to show you...

427
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,580
the one that needs the director's approval.

428
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,550
Hold on a second.

429
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,230
(Saint Augstine Wellness Medical Center)

430
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,420
No.

431
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,890
You absolutely cannot have ramyeon.

432
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,430
Who ordered it this time?

433
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,160
Is this jjajang ramyeon?

434
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,000
Just retire already.

435
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,270
If I retire, who's going to pay for my ramyeon?

436
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,080
Seong Je Yeon!

437
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,990
Coach?

438
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,259
Are you seeing someone?

439
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,490
You always disappear when you start dating someone.

440
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,130
When have I ever done that?

441
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,930
My wife sent me on an errand, I have to go.

442
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,670
I'm leaving the key over there.

443
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,640
Coach.

444
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,710
Have you ever been in a long-distance relationship?

445
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,410
Long-distance?

446
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,879
You really are seeing someone, aren't you?

447
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,879
No, I'm just asking if you have.

448
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,520
Of course I haven't.

449
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,320
You can try it and let me know how it goes.

450
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,890
Not that it would do me any good.

451
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,030
Just don't overdo it, and lock up when you leave.

452
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,830
You're way too stiff right now.

453
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,730
See you.

454
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,030
All right.

455
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,689
Excuse me, could I get one order of ramyeon?

456
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,230
You like your noodles al dente,

457
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
right?

458
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,270
How did you...

459
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,199
I've never even eaten ramyeon here before.

460
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,270
From an old interview you did.

461
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,270
I recognized you when you came in before too.

462
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,210
But you seem really shy,

463
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,540
and I didn't want to make you uncomfortable.

464
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,280
I'm not.

465
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,620
And yes, al dente for the ramyeon would be great.

466
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,449
Could you make it when my company gets here?

467
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,420
I just had a moment of weakness.

468
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,960
Right now, I have absolutely no self-control.

469
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,660
Can you please keep me in check?

470
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,800
I'm a total wreck.

471
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,880
What on earth...

472
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,110
What's going on with you, here of all places?

473
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,010
I ordered ramyeon.

474
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
You what?

475
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,390
Could you eat it for me?

476
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,120
I'll just pretend I'm watching a mukbang.

477
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,720
Goodness. I thought it was something serious.

478
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,590
Can you handle the smell?

479
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,430
Even if I beg, you can't give me any.

480
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,669
I mean, one bite probably wouldn't hurt...

481
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,100
But still, no way.

482
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
No way?

483
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,740
Got it. Message received.

484
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,310
This tastes amazing after a workout.

485
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,990
It's so good.

486
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,190
The noodles are perfectly al dente, aren't they?

487
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,060
The person who made it is a fan of mine.

488
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,860
Oh, really?

489
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,960
This is hilarious.

490
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,800
Why did I order this just to watch you eat?

491
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,139
Are you only eating the noodles? What about the broth?

492
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,910
It's incredible if you have it with a piece of kimchi.

493
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,540
Why are you just watching? It's delicious.

494
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,149
I have to make up for the pizza I ate yesterday.

495
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,780
And I have the press conference for my new show.

496
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,620
A new show?

497
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,490
Maybe I should watch it.

498
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,059
- What's it called? - "Starving for Love."

499
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,890
Gosh, that's bleak.

500
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,190
Tell me about it.

501
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,030
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

502
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,900
What is it? You have to tell me.

503
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,900
Oh, as long as I don't drink the broth,

504
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,870
it should be fine, right?

505
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,870
Don't you have your ramyeon broth tea bags?

506
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,510
You always carry them with you.

507
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,980
What was that?

508
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,880
I asked if you have the tea bags.

509
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,020
I'm leaving.

510
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,850
Wait...

511
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,800
I'm an actor.

512
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,530
I have my principles.

513
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,170
And there's a line I've drawn that I swore I'd never cross.

514
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,039
- Right. - I keep saying no,

515
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,370
but you just keep pushing it on me.

516
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,040
You cross that line and tell me to just have one bite.

517
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,609
So what am I supposed to do?

518
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,179
Just shove it back at you?

519
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,049
It's rude to keep refusing.

520
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,619
I'd have no choice but to take just one bite.

521
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,650
You're the one who told me not to give you any!

522
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,390
I was just doing what you said.

523
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,860
"Oh, well, if you insist..."

524
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,130
"Just one bite."

525
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,430
That's all it would've taken.

526
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,400
When you called, I came right away without asking any questions.

527
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,470
I came, I ate what you said, and I didn't give you any.

528
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,680
I did everything you asked, so why make me the bad guy?

529
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,110
I don't like eating this late either, you know.

530
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,080
If I'd given you some, you'd be angry about that too.

531
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,780
You don't like it? Then why'd you lick the bowl clean?

532
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,290
Yes, I can tell you hated it.

533
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,489
Okay, you're right.

534
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,720
I absolutely love it.

535
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,459
This ramyeon's the best. They know how to make it right.

536
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,800
Okay, I get it.

537
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,970
Well, thanks for eating it.

538
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,550
You can't just leave while you're still upset.

539
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
I'm sorry.

540
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,990
I didn't realize you were that hungry.

541
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,029
I'm exhausted, so I'm going to head out.

542
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,829
Oh, well, let me at least see you get a cab...

543
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,830
I drove.

544
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,370
I see.

545
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,500
I'll be waiting for your call.

546
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,149
This might start happening more often, by the way.

547
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,150
I start shooting soon.

548
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,760
More often?

549
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,460
Got it.

550
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,690
Input received.

551
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,090
So well-behaved.

552
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,060
I'm leaving.

553
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,170
Well-behaved?

554
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
- Hi. - Hello.

555
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,620
- I'll just sign the guestbook. - Okay.

556
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,650
So awkward.

557
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,530
- Thanks. - Take care.

558
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,660
I guess the waiting room is over there.

559
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,030
Okay.

560
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,440
They're still setting up.

561
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,710
- What? - Guess we'll have to wait.

562
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,240
Okay.

563
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,610
- So... - Yes?

564
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,080
Notice anything different about me?

565
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,320
I got it.

566
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,490
- Your hair? - Nope.

567
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,129
- Your outfit? - My outfit changes every day.

568
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,390
What, do you think I only own one?

569
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,060
- Your heart? - Wrong.

570
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,760
Gosh, that's not on the table. Definitely not.

571
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,270
It's this. Look.

572
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,839
What?

573
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,769
Tae Rin gave it to me.

574
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,840
- Really? Tae Rin did? - Yes.

575
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,710
That girl is really something...

576
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,210
Well, are you going to put it on for me?

577
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,250
Okay.

578
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,320
Have you ever done this for a girl before?

579
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,330
- Is this your first time? - Yes.

580
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,939
- Hold on. - Okay.

581
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,940
There.

582
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,350
- You got it? - Let me see.

583
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,420
Ta-da!

584
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,950
Is it pretty?

585
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,719
- It's beautiful. - Thank you.

586
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,990
Okay, see you later.

587
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,329
So pretty!

588
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,929
You're here? Oh my.

589
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,630
- Welcome. - Gosh, congratulations.

590
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,870
Congratulations.

591
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,069
Thank you.

592
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,810
Here, just slip this inside.

593
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,369
Use it on your honeymoon.

594
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,009
Yes, okay. Thanks.

595
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,140
Oh my, you look so beautiful.

596
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,350
Congratulations.

597
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,950
You know, I really thought...

598
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,550
you'd spend your life as a bachelor, focusing on environmental activism.

599
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,789
Hey, living with Ji Hye is basically an environmental movement in itself.

600
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,590
Oh, right. That's true. Yes.

601
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,290
Ma'am.

602
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,060
Congratulations.

603
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,899
It's even prettier in person than in photos.

604
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,370
- Really? - Yes.

605
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,210
You made it.

606
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,409
Oh my, congratulations.

607
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,679
- It's been a while. - Goodness!

608
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,650
- Ji Hye, come here. - Why?

609
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,250
Gosh.

610
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,350
You look so handsome.

611
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,590
Yes, that's right.

612
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,419
Oh, it's so pretty.

613
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,759
I love it.

614
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,960
Thank you.

615
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,759
Oh, is Je Yeon going to catch the bouquet?

616
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,060
What? No.

617
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,300
No way. Goodness.

618
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,840
Oh, I absolutely hate it. Being the center of attention.

619
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,539
I can barely even MC this thing. But the bouquet is too much...

620
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,170
I'm not planning on it either.

621
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,580
Looking at the photos of the bouquet,

622
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,279
all the hard times we had together flashed before my eyes,

623
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,450
and I started getting all emotional, you know?

624
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,519
So, Bebap's job was to grant wishes,

625
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,190
but who grants Bebap's wishes?

626
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,789
That was the thought that started this whole project.

627
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,160
Gosh, things were so hectic during the shoot...

628
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,200
that I never got to film that interview.

629
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,570
I should ask you now.

630
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,570
So, Bebap, what was your wish?

631
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,740
My wish...

632
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,709
I'd say I have about 3,467 of them.

633
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,980
Gosh, that's a lot.

634
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,109
Then what about one you wished for back when you were Bebap?

635
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,480
If you had to pick just one?

636
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,749
"I'm sobbing my eyes out when it's totally inappropriate,"

637
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,060
"and people are looking at me like I'm crazy."

638
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,230
"And that's how it would all end."

639
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,960
"In real life too."

640
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,230
Yes.

641
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,970
Oh, I see!

642
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,640
- Like in a sitcom? - Yes.

643
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,310
Oh, my gosh.

644
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,550
That's how "Beat and Bebop" always ended, you know?

645
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,620
It was always so absurd.

646
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,289
Should we take a picture?

647
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,290
Yes.

648
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,490
Gosh, I've never seen anyone jump that high before.

649
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,690
And you said you didn't want to.

650
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,900
I told you I have good reflexes.

651
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,570
It's because you made this.

652
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,100
Hold on, stay still.

653
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,870
- Why? - Hold up the flower.

654
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,109
Hey, no, what are you doing?

655
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,180
- Hey, come on! - But...

656
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,880
Gosh, seriously, what is this?

657
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,920
That's it, that's it.

658
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,720
Okay.

659
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,519
Got it.

660
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,050
- How'd it turn out? - You look great.

661
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,790
Nice.

662
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,190
Just capturing the moment.

663
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,990
I'm going to keep this.

664
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,100
I feel like I'll want to look at it for a long, long time.

665
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,740
Then we'll have to see each other for a long, long time.

666
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,840
- Right? - Yes.

667
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:50,380
I wish this would never wilt. It's so beautiful.

668
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,680
Okay, there's a way for that.

669
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,590
I can make it last for five years, easy.

670
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,320
- Really? - Yes.

671
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,759
I have a way. Come on, let's go.

672
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,760
This is fun! Let's go.

673
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,960
- You're good at this. Right there. - I'll try my best.

674
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,700
- Oh! - You're a natural.

675
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,940
Hey.

676
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,580
- About those wishes... - Yes?

677
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:26,120
What are the other 3,466?

678
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,620
Why ask?

679
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,220
What, are you going to grant one?

680
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,320
Yes.

681
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,790
Just one?

682
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,860
A school trip.

683
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,200
The thing is...

684
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,000
I've never been on a school trip before.

685
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,340
All right.

686
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,600
I'll make it happen for you, okay?

687
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,370
Then should we leave the car?

688
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:53,510
A real school trip needs a charter bus.

689
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,780
Right.

690
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,549
- Then... - Yes?

691
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,350
Should we also try to rely less on our electronics?

692
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,950
No devices, just go wherever our feet take us.

693
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,390
Can we just look up a good spot for grilled clams?

694
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,630
No, seriously, that's it. Just that one thing, please?

695
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,830
Okay, fine.

696
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,739
Here, let's each put one on.

697
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,939
When did you bring these?

698
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,140
Of course I brought them. For that school trip vibe.

699
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,380
- Music, cue! - Music, cue!

700
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,109
Gosh, the ocean!

701
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,880
The Pohang ocean!

702
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,780
- There must be something there. - There?

703
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,610
The weather is perfect.

704
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,619
We really picked the perfect day for this, didn't we?

705
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,990
Gosh, this is so great!

706
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,459
Gosh, the color of the ocean is gorgeous.

707
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,460
Right.

708
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,800
We also have to go see the flowering tree we planted.

709
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,029
I wonder if they'll be okay until next spring.

710
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,140
Well, they have to endure the cold anyway.

711
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,910
I guess that's just part of life.

712
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,580
I guess you can't just experience the good things in life.

713
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,050
If you could live like that, would you?

714
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,949
I don't know.

715
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,490
From what I can tell,

716
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,320
you'd be quick to forget the hard times...

717
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,160
and hold on to the good times for as long as possible.

718
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,970
Oh, this came out great.

719
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,809
Should we head to the library in a little bit?

720
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,910
What do you say, Sunwoo Hae?

721
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,709
Sounds like a plan.

722
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,710
Okay.

723
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,089
Oh, hello there!

724
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,720
I love curry!

725
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,889
Tae Rin! How have you been?

726
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,230
Did you get the curry I sent you?

727
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,429
Oh! There was a package at my door today.

728
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,470
- I guess that was the curry. - Right.

729
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,740
- Thanks, I'll enjoy it. - Good.

730
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,410
Congratulations on starting your curry business.

731
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,339
I heard you're doing it with your wife.

732
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,410
You know my wife's family is in the food business.

733
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,209
I've got to promote it a lot too.

734
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,010
I seriously love curry.

735
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,989
It's been a while, sir.

736
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,320
It has been, Director Bang.

737
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:54,060
Actor Nam's fan club sent over some food.

738
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,589
The team's bringing it up. We should all eat together.

739
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,900
Gosh, I swear. Our Lov-Joonies drive me crazy.

740
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,630
I need to take a bunch of photos to show them.

741
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:03,970
Oh, right!

742
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,600
You know, it's a shame we couldn't end up on the same team.

743
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,940
Right?

744
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,140
Have you been well?

745
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,270
I've been well, thanks.

746
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,739
And you? Have you been well?

747
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,580
Well, let's just say I've had my share of headaches.

748
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,249
Can we talk for a second?

749
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,720
It's been too long.

750
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,790
Of course.

751
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,660
The press conference is today, right?

752
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,230
Go on, you got this!

753
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,970
Cute.

754
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,000
By the way, about that night...

755
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,510
It wasn't really about the ramyeon, was it?

756
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,439
Unbelievable.

757
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,180
It was about the ramyeon, okay?

758
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,080
And now you're laughing?

759
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,520
Okay, I was a bit sensitive.

760
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,890
Yes.

761
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,529
Oh, right, Tae Rin.

762
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,029
I heard you started a new project.

763
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,229
Oh, yes.

764
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,230
Okay, well, on this new set,

765
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,130
try to be a bit more friendly.

766
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,130
You know you can be a real downer.

767
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,440
It's much better when people smile. Like me. See?

768
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,639
The way you live your life starts to show on your face.

769
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,740
Get it?

770
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,380
Gosh, thanks for the advice.

771
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,450
I heard Tae Rin is on "Kongjwi and Patjwi."

772
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,820
Word is she was brought in to save the show.

773
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,790
If it were me, I never would've thrown her into a mess like that.

774
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,490
It was Tae Rin's decision.

775
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,990
And since she made up her mind, I'll give her my full support.

776
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,860
She worked under me for so long,

777
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,829
I never knew you two were so courageous.

778
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:46,640
Well, now's your chance to find out. If you'd like.

779
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,839
Even people who live under the same roof...

780
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,910
can be complete strangers to each other.

781
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,740
I wanted to send you flowers for your opening,

782
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,380
but no one would give me the address.

783
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,680
We don't need any flowers. That kind of thing is just for show.

784
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,920
Why not send something practical instead?

785
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,820
It's been a while since we launched, anyway.

786
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,420
Something practical?

787
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,030
I'll have to think about that.

788
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,870
I can't believe the library is closed.

789
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,969
From now on, let's check online before we go.

790
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,439
No, starting right now.

791
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,109
And the grilled clam place was closed.

792
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,140
Oh, wait.

793
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,909
I found that little diner that disappeared.

794
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:30,310
You know, the one we made that wasted trip for?

795
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,150
It didn't close down. It just moved to a new neighborhood.

796
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,250
We should go eat there next time, okay?

797
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,320
Okay? Pretty good find, right?

798
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:42,860
Amazing.

799
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,630
Extraordinary.

800
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,230
- Inspiring. - Cocky.

801
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,030
That's mean.

802
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,670
Sorry.

803
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,470
Should I keep going?

804
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,470
I love you.

805
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,240
Stop it.

806
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,080
What? You don't love me?

807
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,350
I love you.

808
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:11,990
I'm happy.

809
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,460
Me too!

810
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,559
What should we eat?

811
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,859
Okay, let's go grocery shopping before we head to our place.

812
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,629
- Sounds good. - What do you feel like eating?

813
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,670
I'm craving some barbecue.

814
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,340
- Okay, so pork belly, veggies... - Deal!

815
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,070
Sausages.

816
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,480
We bought a lot.

817
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,410
Gosh...

818
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:38,310
Fireworks are going to be so much fun.

819
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,080
This is my first time.

820
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,150
You're going to love it.

821
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:56,830
Wait, why...

822
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:58,230
Why isn't it here?

823
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,640
Did we forget something?

824
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,070
This place is in the middle of nowhere.

825
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,209
I thought we went over every detail when we were shopping.

826
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,210
Yes.

827
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,310
I know, but...

828
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,120
The lighter...

829
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,990
- The fireworks... - No, wait.

830
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,189
I... I got this.

831
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,589
Trust me.

832
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:24,889
There has to be something in this house.

833
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,260
Something we can use to light them, right?

834
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,600
You just keep getting everything ready.

835
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,970
Leave it to me, okay?

836
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,530
The fireworks...

837
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,370
I promise, I'll make sure we get to do them.

838
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:38,970
There must be something.

839
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,280
Fireworks...

840
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,810
How could I make such a dumb mistake? Goodness.

841
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,290
Oh, come on.

842
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,859
Come on, be in here...

843
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,060
Find anything?

844
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,310
Yes.

845
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,580
Seriously!

846
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:21,919
Oh my gosh!

847
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,020
Thank you.

848
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,660
Hae!

849
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,890
Okay, I found the matches!

850
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,130
Hae?

851
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,270
Hae!

852
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:56,890
Are you okay?

853
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,420
Why? Did you see a bug?

854
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:02,360
Are you okay?

855
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,830
Yes.

856
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,560
Of course I'm okay.

857
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,600
Gosh, I...

858
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:18,840
I overreacted.

859
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,380
Sorry.

860
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,120
I'll have to peel this fruit again, won't I?

861
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,389
Should we just wash it off?

862
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:34,760
I'm going to peel a new one.

863
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:37,460
This guy, seriously.

864
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,570
Ta-da!

865
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,229
What? You found it?

866
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,570
Put on your coat.

867
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,100
Let's go outside and set off fireworks.

868
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,579
Oh my, what brings you here so late?

869
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,809
I'm staying the night. My boiler's broken.

870
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:58,310
The repairman said he can fix it tomorrow.

871
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,350
Oh, Seok Joo, you're here.

872
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,920
I was just about to boil some water for ramyeon.

873
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,120
Should I make two?

874
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,450
She said she's not having any.

875
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,390
I quit ramyeon!

876
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,960
I never really liked it anyway.

877
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,930
No "just one bite," okay?

878
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,400
What?

879
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,970
Why are you giving Chan such a hard time?

880
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,070
No, really, I'm fine.

881
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,240
You're really not having any? Chan makes great ramyeon.

882
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:27,410
I'm not having any, I said!

883
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,950
But more importantly...

884
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,020
Don't you have something to tell me?

885
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,250
I thought that was why you came.

886
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,360
Oh, right.

887
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,160
"Oh, right"?

888
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,430
I want to keep working,

889
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,770
and I don't want to get dropped in and make a mess of things.

890
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,570
I don't want people to hate me.

891
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,099
The owner's nepotism hire, the young master, the heir...

892
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,210
All that nonsense.

893
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,210
The company.

894
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,410
I don't want to inherit it.

895
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,710
I...

896
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,420
When did I ever say I was handing it over to you?

897
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,790
I never said I was handing it over. Not from the very beginning.

898
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:12,390
What?

899
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,790
Sleep well, son.

900
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,840
Je Yeon.

901
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:16,610
Leave.

902
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,920
I don't want you to see me like this. Leave.

903
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,250
Leave.

904
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,420
No.

905
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:26,390
Then...

906
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,890
Don't turn on the light.

907
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:30,860
Please.

908
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,130
What did you wish for on this one?

909
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,900
Something I'm desperate for.

910
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:25,650
Ta-da!

911
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,380
It came true.

912
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,730
Shall we laugh again tomorrow?

913
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:45,000
Like a new episode.

914
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,540
Like in a sitcom.

915
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:53,110
Yes.

916
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,380
Hey, can I borrow a pen?

917
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,750
No.

918
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,020
What? Don't be so cheap.

919
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:46,720
I told you to put the pen back when you're done.

920
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,660
It keeps going missing, especially the one with the long nib.

921
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,490
I guess I left it at school.

922
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,700
"Long nib" this and "long nib" that.

923
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,260
It's just a pen.

924
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,460
"Just a pen"?

925
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:00,000
Do you know how much effort I put into breaking in that nib?

926
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,300
"Just a pen?"

927
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:07,279
You burned the toast.

928
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,579
"Just toast."

929
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,379
Gosh, you're so annoying.

930
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,650
Everything's "just" something to you, isn't it?

931
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,680
Why are you playing the victim again?

932
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,790
I guess you're throwing a fit since Ms Ja Kyung is leaving.

933
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,490
"Just a fit."

934
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,859
We're decorating the tree this weekend, right?

935
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,359
There's a star ornament I want to put up, and I'm bringing it.

936
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,360
Don't you dare bring that huge thing over.

937
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,329
I swear I'll snap his legs in half...

938
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,870
and hang them all over the tree.

939
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,370
Yes, right. And how would you do that?

940
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,039
Are you bringing him here on purpose?

941
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,740
Because you don't want to hear what I have to say?

942
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:43,479
Scolding me and embarrassing me in front of my boyfriend...

943
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,779
You wouldn't be that cruel, would you?

944
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,280
Do I look like the kind of person who'd care about that?

945
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:49,450
I'm heading to school.

946
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:52,250
"Just school?"

947
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,890
Gosh, this is so annoying.

948
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,389
Seriously!

949
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:58,560
Hey, take this. Eat it on your way.

950
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,900
Just go already. Goodness.

951
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:08,199
Okay, where's the entrance?

952
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,969
- Over there? - Looks like it.

953
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,369
Oh, there it is.

954
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:12,909
Hey, I'm going by myself from here.

955
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:15,239
- It's okay, this is heavy. - No, we'll say goodbye here.

956
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,850
Gosh, you're so stubborn.

957
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,879
You won't be visiting often, will you?

958
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,550
Why would you even ask that?

959
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,259
I'll make my triumphant return after I've had all my fun.

960
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,360
Hey, come visit with your girlfriend.

961
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:31,589
I'll teach you how to surf.

962
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:32,930
Oh, are you a good surfer?

963
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:34,229
Not at all,

964
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:37,430
but the moment I decided to go, I was already a pro.

965
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,400
I'm going to own that place.

966
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,340
Get ready, Australia!

967
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,039
Oh, here.

968
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,480
They say first timers on long flights can get motion sickness.

969
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:50,109
So take this if you start to feel sick.

970
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,679
There are also eye drops and a mist in there.

971
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,950
Use them if it gets dry.

972
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:55,850
You're so thoughtful.

973
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,290
Thank you so much.

974
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,859
Our Hae is a bit of a handful, so please take good care of him.

975
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,220
A handful? Me?

976
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,799
Well, you do have your moments.

977
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,760
- What do you mean? - I'll take good care of him.

978
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,700
Sorry we can't decorate the tree together this year.

979
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,869
And don't just slack off on it because I'm not there.

980
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:18,510
Okay, I got it.

981
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,770
Goodness.

982
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,710
Oh, and this.

983
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,150
What's this?

984
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,880
Here. For Christmas.

985
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,450
A wetsuit.

986
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,490
But you can't even float.

987
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,440
Stay healthy, all right?

988
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,080
And write to me.

989
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,150
You too.

990
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,790
Promise you'll write.

991
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,660
- Okay? - Okay.

992
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,119
Let go. Just go.

993
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,829
- Go on, go. - Just a little further.

994
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,230
Go on, get out of here.

995
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,770
Have a safe trip.

996
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,620
Excuse me, are you Kang Jong Yeop?

997
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,750
Yes?

998
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,220
Hello. Well...

999
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:41,360
Your friends from Class 2-1 sent you this bouquet.

1000
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:44,389
But I didn't win anything.

1001
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:47,960
You don't need to win an award to be celebrated.

1002
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,900
I just need a confirmation photo. Can you look here for me?

1003
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,300
"A for Effort" award?

1004
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,140
What's an "Effort Award?"

1005
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,740
I'm Grand Prize material.

1006
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:08,650
I guess they thought your effort deserved the Grand Prize.

1007
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:13,150
So is that why your friends sent these flowers?

1008
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,120
What are they?

1009
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,430
They're small chrysanthemums.

1010
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,530
Their meaning is...

1011
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:22,600
"A cheerful spirit."

1012
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:27,600
Okay, time for that confirmation photo.

1013
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,769
Ready?

1014
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:32,340
Smile! One, two!

1015
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:36,240
See? It came out great, didn't it?

1016
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,960
Hae, what are you doing here?

1017
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,430
Hey.

1018
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,600
Did you finish your deliveries?

1019
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,470
Yes.

1020
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:02,300
Are you hungry? Let's grab a bite and then head to work.

1021
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,440
- Hey. - Yes?

1022
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,140
About this delivery job...

1023
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,780
I think I might have to quit.

1024
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,890
It feels like...

1025
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,960
I should quit things.

1026
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:25,890
I'm scared.

1027
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:39,670
Don't talk about quitting.

1028
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:42,380
Just worry about tying your shoelaces.

1029
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:46,250
Tie them again.

1030
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,980
And then get back out there.

1031
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,800
I'm serious, I don't want to die.

1032
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,830
I just want to live a normal life.

1033
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,770
I want that for you too.

1034
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,220
I shouldn't have said that. Sorry. Let's go.

1035
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,130
Where should we hang it?

1036
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,340
- The tinsel. - How about right here in the front?

1037
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:47,310
That's it.

1038
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,450
Gosh, it's so pretty.

1039
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,519
No, really, it's beautiful.

1040
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,749
- Hey, you're here. - Hello.

1041
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,320
Je Yeon, you look so pretty.

1042
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,689
Gosh, and now right here,

1043
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:04,229
if we add this one too...

1044
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:06,330
- Goodness! - It's pretty.

1045
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,859
- Hello. - You made it.

1046
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,699
- Hello. - Nu Ri, you're here?

1047
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,870
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

1048
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,570
Oh, you brought coffee.

1049
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:20,369
Gosh, this is so pretty.

1050
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,279
- Perfect finishing touch, right? - Absolutely perfect.

1051
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,710
- The button. - Gosh.

1052
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,110
- Goodness! - Isn't it pretty?

1053
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:26,480
There.

1054
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:27,980
- Gosh! - Goodness.

1055
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,160
Oh, Nu Ri.

1056
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:36,620
That's pretty.

1057
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,960
It's cute.

1058
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:46,970
It's a little plain.

1059
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,410
What would look good?

1060
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,010
Oh, the flower bloomed!

1061
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,580
He'll be so happy when I tell him.

1062
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,390
Oh, wait a minute.

1063
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:13,660
Pil Du, food's ready.

1064
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:21,340
The rice came out perfectly.

1065
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:23,570
Chan.

1066
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:25,840
Here, take this.

1067
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,580
Yes, hello?

1068
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,080
Oh, yes, hello.

1069
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,520
Pardon?

1070
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,470
Wait.

1071
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:13,050
Pil Du.

1072
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:18,730
I've sinned too much...

1073
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:33,940
- Doctor, get the scissors ready. - Yes.

1074
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,180
- Attach the ECG leads. - Right.

1075
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,029
Doctor, he's in PEA.

1076
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:55,660
Give him epinephrine and prepare for intubation.

1077
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,860
Yes.

1078
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,169
One, two, three, four...

1079
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:00,900
Oh, please.

1080
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:04,710
One, two, three...

1081
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:06,570
He's in V-fib.

1082
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:09,010
Shock him.

1083
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,050
- Goodness, you startled me! - Gosh!

1084
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:07,900
No, please, no.

1085
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,750
Looks like I'm running out of flowers.

1086
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:30,050
Je Yeon, can you bring me those flowers?

1087
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,720
Yes.

1088
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:35,390
Thanks.

1089
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:49,070
This one?

1090
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:02,850
Hae.

1091
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:04,150
Yes?

1092
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:12,190
It's nothing.

1093
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,130
Okay.
