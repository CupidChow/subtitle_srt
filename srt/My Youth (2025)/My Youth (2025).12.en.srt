00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,370
(Song Joong Ki)

2
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,070
(Chun Woo Hee)

3
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,510
(Lee Joo Myung)

4
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,510
(Seo Ji Hun)

5
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,890
(My Youth)

6
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,930
How is he? How's Hae?

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,199
Hae...

8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,400
He's still...

9
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,570
unconscious.

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,110
Excuse me, what about his sister? Did you get a hold of her?

11
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,050
Seok Joo is on his way with her.

12
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,989
You acted quickly, so there's no brain damage.

13
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,060
He's currently breathing on his own.

14
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,230
Oh, thank goodness.

15
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,530
Thank you.

16
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,029
He did hit his forehead when he fell.

17
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,369
There was a lot of blood.

18
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,530
We've treated it.

19
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,840
And based on his last exam,

20
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,640
he's not at the point where he needs a pacemaker just yet,

21
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,940
but his condition is progressing a little on the faster side.

22
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,010
We heard about a clinical trial.

23
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,119
Is Hae eligible for it?

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,720
Would it help him get better?

25
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,550
The patient's decision is important, so we'll discuss it when he's awake.

26
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,390
Okay.

27
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,230
Thank you.

28
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,010
(Absolute rest)

29
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,800
How is he?

30
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,230
- What? - Sir.

31
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,200
Where's my brother?

32
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,799
Wait, what happened to my brother?

33
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,499
What's wrong with him?

34
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,309
Well, you know how your mom was sick...

35
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,110
But in his case, we were fortunate to catch it early.

36
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,840
He's going to be okay. All right?

37
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,750
We're just waiting for him to wake up.

38
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,150
Once he's more stable,

39
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,450
they said he should wake up soon.

40
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,660
Hae... Oh, no...

41
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,560
My goodness. What do I do?

42
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,169
What's going to happen to him?

43
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,270
- It's okay. - Je Yeon.

44
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,569
Oh, what am I going to do?

45
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,939
Poor Hae. What do I do?

46
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,510
Don't worry.

47
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,850
Gosh, Mr. Chan.

48
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,869
I'm guessing you all haven't eaten yet?

49
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,980
I didn't know how many people would be here,

50
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,810
so I just packed whatever I could.

51
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,950
Please eat something while it's still warm.

52
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,250
Nu Ri must have been so scared.

53
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,460
Thank you for bringing all this food.

54
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,860
You went to a lot of trouble.

55
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,560
I just felt like I had to do something.

56
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,730
Nu Ri.

57
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,210
You can go home now.

58
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,410
You have work tomorrow, and there are plenty of people here.

59
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
Your son...

60
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,250
He must have lived a good life.

61
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,990
He's clearly loved by so many.

62
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,690
He is.

63
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,060
If he didn't have a father like me, he would've had an even better life.

64
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,030
Thanks for coming with me.

65
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,770
Take care of yourself.

66
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
Go on.

67
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,850
(Final Episode)

68
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,870
Oh, Seok Joo.

69
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,770
- Goodness. - What... How...

70
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,670
Like this?

71
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,180
Hey!

72
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,010
Nu Ri.

73
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,680
Hey, what about school?

74
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,550
- You... - Is that really important now?

75
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,150
Seriously? What is this?

76
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,220
So this is what you had to tell me?

77
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,560
Is this why you told me to go to Mom's?

78
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,060
Is this what you meant when you said we couldn't live together anymore?

79
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,630
I have so much to yell at you about, so why did you have to get sick?

80
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,299
Why didn't you tell me? Why?

81
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,569
Why are you sick? Why?

82
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,170
Why are you sick?

83
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,140
Because telling you...

84
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,950
felt more painful than the sickness itself.

85
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,660
Hae...

86
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,320
Why do you always try to handle everything on your own?

87
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,589
You know you can lean on me.

88
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,760
Okay, okay.

89
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,700
We're family.

90
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,870
Oh, no...

91
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,280
Hey.

92
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,180
Kim Seok Joo, stop crying!

93
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,549
You're supposed to be comforting me.

94
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,850
You have to comfort me first! I've been holding it in too!

95
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,390
Hey, hey. Everyone.

96
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,760
Hey, come over here. Come on.

97
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,070
This is a hospital. We need to be quiet. You hear me?

98
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,740
Now that you've seen he's awake, you can all go.

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,839
You, to school. You, to work.

100
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,940
Go. Hurry up.

101
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,580
- It's so loud, my goodness. - I'm not going.

102
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,850
I'm going to stay by his side.

103
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,450
I'm not going to work either.

104
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,350
Nu Ri.

105
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,750
Go to school...

106
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,960
and find that pen of mine, will you?

107
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,590
It's not just any pen.

108
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,930
I'll be checking to see that you're home.

109
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,760
Now, go.

110
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,570
Take Nu Ri with you. Hurry.

111
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,800
Go.

112
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,210
All right, I'm going.

113
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,550
I have to get to work.

114
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,090
I'll take Nu Ri with me.

115
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
Okay.

116
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,490
Thanks.

117
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,030
For what?

118
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,570
You must've wanted to see him first.

119
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,670
Thanks for being so patient.

120
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,980
I'll call you.

121
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,150
Okay. I'm leaving now.

122
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,239
The good thing is, we discovered it early.

123
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,370
And you've been managing it well up to now.

124
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,410
It's still early enough that we can explore our options.

125
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,140
So I absolutely recommend you go.

126
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,480
Getting a spot in a clinical trial isn't easy,

127
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,380
and this is a race against time.

128
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,360
So, please talk it over and let me know your decision.

129
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,390
That must have been a huge shock.

130
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,500
It was supposed to be our first Christmas date.

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,130
And I ruined it.

132
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,200
Don't feel sorry.

133
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,870
To be honest, my family is Buddhist,

134
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,540
so it's okay.

135
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,950
Your dad was probably more shocked than I was.

136
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,690
He was here until a moment ago. He's just resting.

137
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,420
Okay.

138
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,400
I hope this doesn't leave a scar.

139
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,810
Mr. Geon No waited all night, and then...

140
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,040
he figured you would yell at him if he didn't open the shop.

141
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,810
So he went to the dawn market.

142
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
He knows me well.

143
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,250
Oh, but...

144
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,420
Did you have to call everyone?

145
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,260
I was afraid something might happen to you.

146
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,530
I thought that might be the last time.

147
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,970
I called everyone I possibly could. So what?

148
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,310
Thank you.

149
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,109
Thank you.

150
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,740
What did the doctor say?

151
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,510
What do we do now?

152
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,750
Do you remember talking about a clinical trial?

153
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,250
The best thing we can do right now...

154
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,560
is to join it once I've recovered a little.

155
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,530
But since it's a clinical trial,

156
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,460
we don't know how effective the drug will be,

157
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,570
And even if the drug turns out to be effective,

158
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,470
by the time it's commercially available,

159
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,340
there's no guarantee my body can hold out that long.

160
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,110
Even if I die, I want to be here.

161
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,850
With the people I love.

162
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,850
No.

163
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,420
You should go.

164
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,960
You have to go.

165
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,130
To be honest...

166
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,830
When I first heard about the trial at the flower shop...

167
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,900
Since I was unemployed...

168
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,300
I'm not going to lie, I did picture us leaving together.

169
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,040
It'd be great at first, wouldn't it?

170
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,810
Us, together in a strange country.

171
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,980
But then, eventually...

172
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,420
We'd feel like we're sacrificing for each other.

173
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Especially you.

174
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,120
You'll think I'm sacrificing everything...

175
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,430
just to be by your side.

176
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,960
We'd just end up...

177
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,900
wearing each other down.

178
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,940
Je Yeon.

179
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,440
Why are you thinking about all this?

180
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,280
Why did you think that far ahead?

181
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,150
I wanted to pretend it wasn't true,

182
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,380
but that's the reality of it.

183
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,090
In your heart, you've already sent me there.

184
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,790
What are we going to do now?

185
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,560
For now...

186
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,530
How about we make a promise? Any promise.

187
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,670
For something good.

188
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,070
Stamp it.

189
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,710
Copy it.

190
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,429
- Hello. - You're here.

191
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,900
Hey, Je Yeon. Where's Hae?

192
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,840
He just fell asleep.

193
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,410
Gosh, what terrible timing.

194
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,750
Je Yeon, you should go get some rest. You'll collapse at this rate.

195
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,010
I'll stay here with him.

196
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,919
Hae gave me the key to the flower shop.

197
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,490
Okay, give it to me. I can stop by when I get a chance.

198
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,630
Can I take care of it?

199
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,049
(Mo Tae Rin)

200
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,489
Hey, can we watch the premiere of "Starving for Love" together?

201
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,190
We've always watched the premiere together.

202
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,859
If you want a cozy night watching it alone with Bebop,

203
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,830
I won't stop you.

204
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,830
Oh, please.

205
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,970
Where did he go? Why are you alone?

206
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,010
I don't want to be without Hae.

207
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,950
He wants to break up already?

208
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,420
Gosh, that guy. What should I do with him?

209
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,320
I was going easy on him because he's with my friend.

210
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
I ought to just...

211
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,340
Hae...

212
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,440
He's sick.

213
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,050
To get better, he has to go far away.

214
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,520
But...

215
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,820
What if something goes wrong while he's there?

216
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,390
What if I never see him again?

217
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,140
No, even if I don't...

218
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,440
Even if I never see him again, it's okay.

219
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,380
As long as he's alive.

220
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,550
Even if I'm not with him,

221
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,560
as long as he's alive and well.

222
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,030
How can this be happening?

223
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm so scared, Tae Rin.

224
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,850
What's going to happen to Hae?

225
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,130
He's going to be okay.

226
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,770
Chan.

227
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,150
Have you eaten?

228
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,520
Oh, hey, when did you get here?

229
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,560
You should get something to eat.

230
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,600
Let me just get changed, and I'll make you something.

231
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,870
I was thrilled to get your call out of the blue.

232
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,139
Thank you for the offer.

233
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,610
I took too long to get back to you, didn't I?

234
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,680
Well, Je Yeon...

235
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,550
told me I could trust you with it.

236
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,820
The rights to my original work...

237
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,320
I'm signing them all over to you.

238
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,890
I promise I'll take good care of it.

239
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,030
To be honest, from your reaction when we met,

240
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,760
I didn't think you were going to sell.

241
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,030
I need the money.

242
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,770
I have to go away for a while, unexpectedly.

243
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,339
So, how will we stay in touch?

244
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,870
Should we just use the phone or do video calls?

245
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,970
How long will you be gone?

246
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,280
A little over two years.

247
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,710
But your forehead...

248
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,679
What happened?

249
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,780
Oh, this?

250
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,920
I got overexcited getting ready for a date and took a fall.

251
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,320
Wow, you must have been really excited.

252
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,729
Tae Rin will be here soon.

253
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,290
If you have time, why don't you join us for dinner?

254
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,500
I'll have to take a rain check.

255
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,970
It's cold out. Make sure you don't catch anything.

256
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,200
Well, I should get going.

257
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,130
Back when I went by Beat,

258
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,300
a coworker I saw on set every day suddenly disappeared.

259
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,200
His name was Bibap.

260
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,710
One day we were hanging out, eating, fighting,

261
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,040
and I'd make him cry.

262
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,910
So...

263
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,450
Did you use me as an excuse to cry again?

264
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,780
No.

265
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,190
For some reason, I just don't think he would cry.

266
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,060
So I figured I should try not to, either.

267
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,490
Because he'd be strong about it.

268
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,900
And I'm sure he still is.

269
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,270
So I guess I should try to be too.

270
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,300
It was good to see you.

271
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,270
- Are you not seeing me anymore? - No.

272
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,010
I'm going to keep seeing you.

273
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,880
Well, I don't want to.

274
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,149
So what?

275
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,649
Stop bothering Je Yeon.

276
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,220
You worry about yourself.

277
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,390
I'm always good to her.

278
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,290
Gosh.

279
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,640
I seriously can't stand you.

280
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,720
I couldn't find the pen.

281
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,120
But I got you this instead.

282
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,289
Mine was too small. I didn't think your stuff would fit.

283
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,259
Where did you get the money for this?

284
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,800
I worked part-time at Geon No's.

285
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,870
I wanted to get it for you.

286
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,040
Are you that moved?

287
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
No...

288
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,540
You...

289
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,110
Wait, you get an allowance from me, and from that guy too.

290
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,950
So where did all that money go that you had to work part-time?

291
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,219
Does that big jerk make you work for him or something?

292
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,420
No!

293
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,390
I was buying something nice,

294
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,020
so I just chipped in a little. What's the big deal?

295
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,260
Stop being so frugal all the time.

296
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,530
You need to let it show sometimes.

297
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,670
How you're really feeling.

298
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,070
Like if you're hurting or having a hard time.

299
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,550
You know, when you were little, Nu Ri.

300
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,990
I'd always have you check out library books,

301
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,260
and it was only on payday...

302
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,590
that I'd buy you a new storybook. Remember?

303
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,730
But the first time I bought you a new book,

304
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,170
you said it had a funny smell.

305
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,980
I shouldn't have skimped on that.

306
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,050
I didn't read them anyway, so whatever.

307
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,420
You were smart to save your money.

308
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,260
Nu Ri.

309
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,900
Hey, can you take a picture of me?

310
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Why?

311
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,200
For what?

312
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,940
My new book is about to come out.

313
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,280
I want to put my photo in it this time.

314
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,380
Go change your clothes.

315
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,490
Put on the nicest thing you own.

316
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,610
Hey.

317
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,040
Ready to go?

318
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,590
Go with your son.

319
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,470
After you sent his mother away like that,

320
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,410
you were tormented with guilt your entire life.

321
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,980
Looking back on it all now,

322
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,890
I realized we got off on the wrong foot.

323
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,430
We fought with each other,

324
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,330
we shared our meals,

325
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,240
and we even raised a child together.

326
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,410
I was always floundering in my own fantasies,

327
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,880
but you always brought me back down to earth.

328
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:32,720
But were you really okay living a life like that with me?

329
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,060
What could you have possibly wanted with a guy like me?

330
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,770
Love?

331
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,110
That's the one thing we did right, wasn't it?

332
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,210
And when you're back,

333
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,980
if what I want is to love you again...

334
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,790
What do you say we give it another shot?

335
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,220
Maybe for once,

336
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,290
we should try having a proper breakup.

337
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,400
We've already been apart for over ten years.

338
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,170
What's one more year?

339
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,840
Gosh, you're really something else.

340
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,670
You lucked out, that's what.

341
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,040
You know, a long time ago...

342
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,210
Do you remember when I came looking for you?

343
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,250
"Come with me."

344
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,190
I know I have no right to say this,

345
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,620
but I've never once thought of you as a burden.

346
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,500
I'm the one who made it hard on you from the very beginning.

347
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,800
I'm glad you realize that.

348
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,470
Right?

349
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,170
What a relief.

350
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Dad.

351
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,580
Yes?

352
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,280
That old photo album of mine...

353
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,750
Why did you hold on to it all this time?

354
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,360
That old relic.

355
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:51,090
A relic's only meaningful when it's discovered in the present.

356
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,100
All those pictures...

357
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,570
Who do you think took them all?

358
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,510
Always trying to take the credit...

359
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,440
Bye.

360
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,410
Hold on...

361
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,760
Extended Closure.

362
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,429
It's not temporary. For lease.

363
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,060
But it's not for lease.

364
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,830
You're coming back to it.

365
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,030
Oh, right.

366
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,669
What should I put? I'm so bad at this kind of thing.

367
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,740
I know.

368
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,440
So what are you going to do there?

369
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,040
You won't just be at the hospital the whole time, right?

370
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,680
I need to think about you.

371
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,009
Well, that's a given.

372
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,580
Maybe I'll get the reissue ready.

373
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,520
Good idea.

374
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,790
Then while you're at it,

375
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,460
you should write something new too.

376
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,869
(You said you didn't like writers.)

377
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,670
Oh, come on...

378
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,410
You really hold a grudge.

379
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,210
It just stuck with me.

380
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,010
I noticed you've never written a love story.

381
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,750
Why bother?

382
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,980
Are those really that interesting?

383
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,020
You don't think they are?

384
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,690
I'm speaking as a reader.

385
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,230
Seriously, your writing is great.

386
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,430
That's a bold claim.

387
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,270
All of a sudden, I want to do everything I can for you.

388
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
Do it.

389
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,550
When you get back.

390
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,550
Well, let's not get too dramatic.

391
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,990
I'll just live like I always have.

392
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,060
Miss you...

393
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,300
and just live my daily life.

394
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,560
The life you'll return to.

395
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,870
I'm worried about the time difference.

396
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:20,440
I know I'll want to check on you every single day.

397
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,210
To see if you're doing well, if you're okay.

398
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,780
I'll have to try not to do that too much.

399
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,620
Let's try our best to sync up.

400
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,760
When our day and night meet.

401
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,090
Okay?

402
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,730
Okay.

403
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,470
What is it?

404
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,970
What is this? What is it?

405
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,680
You keep it.

406
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,820
So you want me to manage it for free?

407
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,759
Correct answer from someone...

408
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,790
who studied business in Seoul National University.

409
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,330
I knew you were smart.

410
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,659
- When... - Yes?

411
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,860
When you get back,

412
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,900
I'm going to collect all my back pay.

413
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,170
Double.

414
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,840
Go ahead.

415
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,710
- Still don't know what to write? - If it's not a lease...

416
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,350
Yes, I'm looking at it now.

417
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,150
I like the fourth mock-up.

418
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,950
Okay, let's go with this one.

419
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,760
About that...

420
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,160
I can keep in touch with the author through video calls,

421
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,660
so you don't have to worry.

422
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,360
Tell her not to worry about the time difference.

423
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,830
I'll work around her schedule.

424
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,630
Okay. Yes, I'll call you then.

425
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,340
Ta-da!

426
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,180
It's so strange seeing you work.

427
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,780
Seeing you actually earning a living.

428
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,680
Oh, the tea's gotten cold.

429
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,289
I guess I'll have to brew a new pot to about 65 degrees.

430
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,860
Oh, right. I meant to ask.

431
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,260
About the revised edition...

432
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,859
It should have something extra compared to the original, right?

433
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,430
Is there anything new we could add?

434
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,229
Like an interview with the author...

435
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,270
An interview?

436
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,470
With you?

437
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,800
What about an audiobook?

438
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,740
A new short story...

439
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,110
That might be too much?

440
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:31,770
Even a really short one...

441
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,139
is still asking a lot, isn't it?

442
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,310
Actually, I was already thinking about writing something new.

443
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,150
Oh, that's great!

444
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,320
I'll do my best to help.

445
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,149
Just stick to your poetry.

446
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,890
You were scribbling something about "Instant Love" or whatever.

447
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:48,260
If there's even just one person who reads my poetry,

448
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,390
I write for that one person.

449
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,230
- I write my poems... - I'm heading out.

450
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,530
Yes, you should go.

451
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,060
See you at the airport.

452
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:40,210
(On vacation)

453
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,500
He must've used it roughly.

454
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,100
All right. Time to start the day!

455
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,210
Okay.

456
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,030
Hello, everyone.

457
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,660
Hello, hello.

458
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,870
How is everyone?

459
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,370
Ah, thank you.

460
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,670
Okay, got it!

461
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,940
Let's move to the other side, please!

462
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,870
Okay, moving out!

463
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,330
Hey.

464
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,000
Pat, pat.

465
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,260
Pat, pat!

466
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,970
How do I look? Perfect, right?

467
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,800
Perfect.

468
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,740
- Let's go. - Okay.

469
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,170
How are you feeling?

470
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,070
Great.

471
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,179
(Congratulations)

472
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,550
Congratulations on graduating, Nu Ri.

473
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,179
Hae made this graduation bouquet for you.

474
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,820
He said it won't ever wilt.

475
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,550
What's this?

476
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,820
I can't believe he did this.

477
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,590
Hey, can you hold this for a sec?

478
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,570
Just a graduation... just a bouquet, just a congrats.

479
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,070
- And it's from your brother. - Gosh.

480
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,000
You really know how to hold a grudge.

481
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,680
Nu Ri.

482
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,210
Congrats on graduating.

483
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,550
Congrats to you too.

484
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,480
Oh, you're Seok Joo, right?

485
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,920
Hi, I'm Choi Sa Rang.

486
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:36,950
Oh, right.

487
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,690
I heard your boyfriend got into a school in Seoul?

488
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,920
But Nu Ri is moving into the dorms. What will you two do, so far apart?

489
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,130
If only I had studied a little harder...

490
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm sorry, Sa Rang.

491
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,600
No.

492
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:51,429
Even if you had done much better, it would've turned out the same.

493
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,440
It's okay.

494
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,869
Are you done?

495
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,600
No, I'm not.

496
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
I love you.

497
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,480
Sa Rang!

498
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,710
What? You're here.

499
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,519
What? What are you doing here?

500
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
You know my brother?

501
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,620
Of course!

502
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,320
Congrats on graduating and getting into college.

503
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,490
- Where are Mom and Dad? - They went on a trip.

504
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,789
Apparently, they mixed up the date.

505
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,030
And they went anyway?

506
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,830
I barely made it here myself.

507
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,270
I got my driver's license.

508
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,700
Oh, me too.

509
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,540
Nu Ri.

510
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,170
Mom!

511
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,480
Congratulations on graduating.

512
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,550
Your brother would be so proud.

513
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,720
He probably would've just said, "Proud."

514
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,750
Hello there!

515
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,450
I'm the Choi Boy!

516
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,620
Is your friend's name "Choi Boy?"

517
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,860
I have no idea.

518
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,430
I'm so embarrassed I could die.

519
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,770
That's it.

520
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,130
We should just break up.

521
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,270
We're 20 now. Let's agree not to say rash things.

522
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,540
I'm yours. Forever.

523
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,880
Okay.

524
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:08,440
We'll be serving your meal now.

525
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,150
- Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy your meal.

526
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,320
- Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy your meal.

527
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,489
Okay, so today's meal is completely within your diet plan.

528
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,200
I just tried to make it as tasty as I could.

529
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,499
Why do you keep going to all this trouble?

530
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,999
I enjoy doing it, so it's no trouble at all.

531
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,030
That's not what I mean.

532
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,799
All this grocery shopping, food prep,

533
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,940
and the time you take to plate it so nicely...

534
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,680
You could be practicing your driving.

535
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,509
I even had to park the car for you earlier.

536
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,049
I was reviewing "Femicide for Love" yesterday...

537
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,319
and just made this while I was at it.

538
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
Honestly.

539
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,890
You always have an answer for everything.

540
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,020
So?

541
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,420
What did you think?

542
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,460
I don't know good acting from bad,

543
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,729
but the pasta scene felt a little awkward.

544
00:40:58,730 --> 00:40:59,860
I don't know.

545
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,970
It felt kind of unnatural.

546
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,329
That can't be right.

547
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,600
Really? What was awkward about it?

548
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,909
No, I mean, what was so awkward and unnatural about it?

549
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,940
I have to know what it was to fix it, right?

550
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,380
Go on, you can be honest.

551
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,850
I said tell me. Hurry up.

552
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:22,080
I'll play it for you right now. Tell me what you think to my face.

553
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,390
Be honest.

554
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,590
Hey, Gi Ppeum...

555
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,319
Go to the van and grab me anything.

556
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,590
- Take your time but hurry up. - Okay.

557
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,900
Gosh, I'm so tired.

558
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,330
Gosh, this spot is so tight...

559
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,440
I wonder what your definition of "tight" is.

560
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,769
I told you. Turn the wheel fully and ease in slowly.

561
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,069
Just get the back end in.

562
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,140
Slowly straighten the wheel. Like so.

563
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,580
Like this?

564
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,350
I thought you were a good student.

565
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,990
How can you have no spatial awareness?

566
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,490
Oh, is it because, mathematically, this is just too simple for you?

567
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,030
Excuse me? What's with the informal tone?

568
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,160
- What was that? - You think I want to be polite?

569
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,900
At this rate, the museum will close before we park.

570
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,970
Seriously. Don't take this the wrong way.

571
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,270
Are you hungry, by any chance?

572
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,980
No...

573
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
Where are you going?

574
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,720
Tae Rin, I'm sorry.

575
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,050
Tae Rin.

576
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,760
All right, keep it coming!

577
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,030
All right, keep it coming!

578
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,400
This is the last chance. Last chance. Come on, let's do this.

579
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,770
Enjoy your meal.

580
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,380
Welcome.

581
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,320
No tables here either.

582
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,090
We missed the exhibition because we were parking.

583
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,360
And now I'm actually starving.

584
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,960
Excuse me, when do you think a table will open up?

585
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,699
Is there a waiting list I can get on?

586
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,160
We don't have a list.

587
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,230
Everyone just recently sat down, so I'm not sure when one will open.

588
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:55,500
Oh, Ma'am.

589
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,340
Gosh, it's you.

590
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,670
Mom.

591
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,640
Well, what are you...

592
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,280
What are you two doing here?

593
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,320
So you still come here.

594
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,380
Yes.

595
00:44:08,381 --> 00:44:10,920
You're the one who taught me about all these great places.

596
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,390
So, are you two a thing?

597
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,660
No.

598
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,930
- We're not? - Of course not.

599
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,700
You're just my tax accountant.

600
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,400
"Just" your tax accountant?

601
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,370
I'm just going to use the restroom.

602
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,010
And I'm not running away, ma'am.

603
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,330
Don't ask me why I'm alone.

604
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:58,630
I just didn't want to go home.

605
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,240
What's going on?

606
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,410
No broken boiler at home these days?

607
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,420
Oh, actually, my water got shut off.

608
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:17,820
Can I crash at your place tonight?

609
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,420
Sure.

610
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,989
But is it just you chasing after her?

611
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,260
Gosh, Mom.

612
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,760
- It's mutual. - Mutual, my foot.

613
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,630
That's right. It's mutual.

614
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,140
(On vacation)

615
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,950
Hey, guys.

616
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,090
You're very thorough.

617
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,430
And one face did come to mind.

618
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,930
If you could see me now,

619
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:40,800
what would you say?

620
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,340
I'd say I miss you.

621
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,380
I guess I said it out loud.

622
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,500
What was that?

623
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,530
What are you... What are you doing here?

624
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,230
Want to go to the sea with me?

625
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,200
All of a sudden?

626
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,570
Have you been drinking?

627
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,840
Yes.

628
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,310
I had a drink after work.

629
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,280
And I was just writing my will.

630
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:22,610
Excuse me?

631
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,110
Wait, why would you...

632
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,120
I update it every year.

633
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,190
I looked at last year's version, and I found something.

634
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,190
"When will I finally leave the shallows..."

635
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:40,700
"and swim out into the deep sea?"

636
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,270
And not just emotionally shallow.

637
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,770
They meant the shallow end of a pool.

638
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,840
I got that from the context.

639
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,480
Oh, right. You said you were a good student.

640
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,420
Are you a good swimmer too?

641
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,190
Well...

642
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,820
Guess not.

643
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,590
I mean, I can swim a little.

644
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,060
But I'd be the one driving.

645
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,260
And with my skills...

646
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,099
With your skills, even if we left right now,

647
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,240
we wouldn't get there until the day after tomorrow.

648
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,910
So, for tonight, how about...

649
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,210
you come up to my place first?

650
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,760
I...

651
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,130
I don't go into just anyone's home.

652
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,960
So maybe you should make me...

653
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:46,330
your boyfriend.

654
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,510
I'll see how you behave.

655
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,150
Oh, come on.

656
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,910
Well, since I was invited,

657
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:07,580
I might as well go on up.

658
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,620
Is it this way? Oh, or this way?

659
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,020
This way?

Your son's a great writer.

He is, isn't he?

663
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,810
Where is he? Did you come back alone?

664
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,880
You're back sooner than we expected, aren't you?

665
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,480
I came to get ready for the book launch party.

Finally.

669
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,980
I told you the title should've been, "A World Made of Gold Bars."

00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,420
Here's your coffee.

671
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,620

00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,760
I heard you have the rest of Seonwoo Hae's novels.

00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,700
They'll be hard to adapt.

What is it this time?

683
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,070
What's the "practical" reason you called me here?

684
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,340
You could have just sent it by mail.

685

You trust me, right?

729
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,160
You can. But...

730
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,770
you have to review the script first.

731
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,070
Should I give it a read, then?

732
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,110
Always thinking about work, this one.

733
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:04,179
If you keep this up, you might as well join the company.

734
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,780
Wait, you're not an employee yet?

735
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,990
Wow, what a dedicated volunteer.

736
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,649
You're a real inspiration.

737
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:14,260
No, no. It's just...

738
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,920
I'm feeling a little insecure.

739
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,860
I do like this kind of work, but...

740
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:22,700
I'm just not sure if a company like this...

741
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,039
Shouldn't I be spreading my wings in a bigger world?

742
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,040
Hey.

743
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,740
What's wrong with "a company like this?"

744
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,110
Go on, spread your wings. Please.

745
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,280
I'm home.

746
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,990
(Waegeum)

747
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:08,410
(To Sung Je Yeon, from Sunwoo Hae)

748
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:18,220
(Handle with care 3)

749
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:35,940
(World Made of Ash)

750
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,350
(Handle with care 4)

751
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,800
Oh, look, another new sprout.

752
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,070
How cute.

753
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,270
Our dynamic is really weird.

754
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,139
You two are friends.

755
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,539
Seok Joo is so formal with him.

756
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,310
But you're so informal with him.

757
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:20,810
You're right.

758
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,949
Hey, how come you never show me a little respect?

759
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:26,510
They're always using all their formal titles with me.

760
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,850
Sir. Mr. Hae.

761
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:34,519
Sir. Sir? Mr. Hae.

762
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,160
Gosh, hey. Stop it! Stop it already.

763
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:39,790
Just go back to how you were.

764
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,160
Seriously, what's gotten into you?

765
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:45,430
Should we meet up on this day every year?

766
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,400
What would the four of us even do? It sounds kind of pointless.

767
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:53,510
We all went to the same school. We can just call it a reunion.

768
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,139
Not that I've ever actually been to one.

769
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,779
Make a time capsule and open it ten years from now?

770
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,880
You want to make a cheesy promise like that?

771
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,080
So should we bury the time capsule somewhere on the outskirts?

772
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:04,689
Seoul is too crowded.

773
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,749
And you're sure that spot won't get redeveloped?

774
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,760
That it'll even still be there?

775
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,089
If we bury it, would that be real estate speculation?

776
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:12,759
No, that's bad for the environment.

777
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,830
Then let's put it in a bottle and toss it in the sea.

778
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,430
That's bad for the environment too. No.

779
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,669
How about suggesting an idea instead of just shooting everything down?

780
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:21,670
All right, fine.

781
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:24,240
Anyone want more coffee? I'm getting another cup.

782
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,610
I'll have one! And let's get dessert too.

783
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,310
- Sounds good. - Me too.

784
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:30,850
Hey, get me one too!

785
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,810
But you didn't finish your coffee.

786
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,590
Back during your shoot,

787
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,860
you wrote those letters, right?

788
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,290
- Yes. - What did you write?

789
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:45,860
You're really not going to tell me?

790
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,960
Nope.

791
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,200
So you'll have to wonder forever.

792
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,370
Gosh, seriously...

793
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,680
Is this...

794
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,050
a dream?

795
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,410
Please tell me it's not.

796
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,650
Can't I just stay asleep?

797
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:47,990
I want to keep looking at you.

798
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,600
Can't I?

799
00:59:58,030 --> 00:59:59,130
Excuse me.

800
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:01,470
I'm looking for someone named "Start of Spring."

801
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:05,440
Oh, yes.

802
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,310
(To "Start of Spring")

803
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,880
- Goodbye. - Thank you.

804
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,620
(To "Start of Spring")

805
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,980
The first season I ever experienced.

806
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,150
That year.

807
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:54,060
I wonder if anyone else remembers that first snow.

808
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:22,520
The me in the photograph, frozen in a moment,

809
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,620
sometimes looks like a stranger.

810
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,560
More and more, as time goes on.

811
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,230
I was so innocent.

812
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:35,900
I had dreams.

813
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,230
I loved.

814
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,470
So endearingly clumsy.

815
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,880
So bright it hurt my eyes.

816
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,950
That's how dazzling it was.

817
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,890
Some moments still remain.

818
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:00,620
Perhaps forever.

819
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:05,890
As if they are the present.

820
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:10,470
I'd only forgotten for a little while.

821
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,470
I was so happy to greet...

822
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,000
all the things that never really disappeared.

823
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:42,730
Wait, how is this...

824
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:28,680
Hi.

825
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,250
What?

826
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,950
Our vacation was until next month.

827
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,390
Let's go see the flowers.

828
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,060
They're blooming.

829
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,539
Is it really you?

830
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,240
Wait, am I dreaming again?

831
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,120
Look.

832
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,290
I have a reflection in the mirror.

833
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:19,090
And I have a shadow.

834
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,840
Can I take a picture of you too?

835
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:41,180
So, are you going to say hi back or what?

836
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,380
You're really here.

837
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,190
You're warm.

838
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,260
Hi?

839
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,130
Hi.

840
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:41,510
Hoping that somewhere, we'll meet again...

841
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,980
with a happy hello, again and again.

842
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,620
From Sunwoo Hae.

843
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:54,560
(Thanks to the viewers who shared every moment with us.)

844
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:29,260
(On vacation)

845
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:42,170
(My Youth)
