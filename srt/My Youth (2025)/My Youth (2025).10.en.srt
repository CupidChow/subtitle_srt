(Episode 10)

7
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,430
Oh, okay.

8
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,600
Okay, I'll come by then, and we can talk more.

9
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,600
Okay, thank you so much.

10
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,100
Okay, goodbye.

11
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,910
Who was that so early?

12
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,380
The hospital.

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,850
It's almost time for my check-up.

14
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,260
Did you sleep well?

15
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,560
Why are you covering up?

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,200
I'm too...

17
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,470
exposed right now?

18
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,240
Oh, come on.

19
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,740
Go back to sleep.

20
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,280
Where are you going?

21
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,350
To make you some food.

22
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,369
Haven't you started the rice?

23
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,270
Just wait a minute. I'll get breakfast ready for you.

24
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,050
Should I do it?

25
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,520
I'm really good at getting the water level just right.

26
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,050
Hold on.

27
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,790
First, let's get your hair dry.

28
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,519
You'll catch a cold. Come on.

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,820
What about breakfast?

30
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,730
I can do it myself.

31
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,630
Because I want to.

32
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,170
Stop being awkward and just accept it.

33
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,870
Okay.

34
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,080
This mole on the back of your neck...

35
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,549
Here. No, right here.

36
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,950
Hey! That tickles.

37
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,849
You read the letter, didn't you?

38
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,050
Traitor.

39
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,090
Wasn't the plan for you to find it by accident?

40
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,759
It was a masterpiece.

41
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,060
The spelling was perfect and everything?

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,600
But...

43
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,470
the stationery looked like it was from a long time ago.

44
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,069
The person who wrote the beginning...

45
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,140
didn't feel like the same person I'm with now.

46
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,440
What are your plans for today?

47
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,579
Practicing arranging the bouquet.

48
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,649
In that case, I'll work on the wedding script.

49
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,849
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

50
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,649
- You got this. Don't be nervous! - Come with me.

51
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,889
- Spray some water on that. - Here, put it on.

52
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,489
- Put it on. - Thanks.

53
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,560
Nu Ri, let's do a chant too.

54
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,760
All right.

55
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,499
One, two, three!

56
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,700
- You got this! - You got this!

57
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,369
- Thank you. - Hurry inside.

58
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,840
- Thank you. - You'll do great.

59
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,500
- Okay, I'm off. - Okay.

60
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,910
I'm so nervous.

61
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,980
Should I go grab some coffee?

62
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,409
Give you two some privacy.

63
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,619
I'm going to go get one for myself.

64
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,750
I'll have a hot coffee.

65
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,149
In that case,

66
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,819
I'll have an English Breakfast milk tea with no sugar.

67
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,220
Around 165 degrees, so I can drink it immediately.

68
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,859
Would that be too much to ask?

69
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,230
You're a real piece of work.

70
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,060
What?

71
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,000
You know...

72
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,070
I may have gotten older, but I don't feel like I've grown up.

73
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,950
Most days, I needed someone to comfort me,

74
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,020
and you were always there for me.

75
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,090
In the end,

76
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,490
I just end up right back here next to you.

77
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,230
I guess to other people, my life must seem pretty pathetic.

78
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,730
But I don't care what other people think.

79
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,670
As long as you don't see me that way.

80
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,080
Are you wearing that perfume? The one I like?

81
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,510
Yes.

82
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,080
I figured even if you tire of me, you'd still like this scent.

83
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,949
You can be a bit much sometimes.

84
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,050
Liar.

85
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,160
Gosh, you're something else.

86
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,290
And I guess I am, too.

87
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,130
I'm starting to feel a little better.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,900
I guess this is why they say you need a kid in the house.

89
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,870
Using him as an excuse to just patch things up so easily.

90
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,900
I never would've done that in the past.

91
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,409
Come on.

92
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,110
I thought we were finally starting to feel like a real married couple.

93
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,580
You think so? A real married couple?

94
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,650
What?

95
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,890
Can I help you find something?

96
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,659
Oh, I need to buy a textbook for my English class.

97
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,129
Where's the foreign language...

98
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,730
Oh, my gosh. What was that?

99
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,699
Gi Ppeum, what are you doing here?

100
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,530
I just stopped by for a bit before my class.

101
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,039
It's so nice having a bookstore near the office.

102
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,010
You must come here a lot. You still don't have your license.

103
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,309
I just keep failing the on-road test.

104
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,509
I'll get it eventually.

105
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,910
The foreign language section is this way.

106
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,650
So, Gi Ppeum, what did you buy?

107
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,719
Oh, well...

108
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,549
I was just buying Tae Rin's magazine.

109
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,490
But that's not out for a while.

110
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,960
But the thought is very delicious.

111
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,230
So, what did you buy that you have to hide?

112
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,900
Well, the thing is...

113
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,910
I just like homemaking.

114
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,439
If you like it, why hide it? Are you ashamed?

115
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,580
No, I'm not ashamed at all.

116
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,980
It's just that older people say that if a man works in the kitchen,

117
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,919
something important will fall off.

118
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,780
I've never seen any studies that show that.

119
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,850
Maybe I missed that study?

120
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,120
I mean, I can't even find my own textbook right now.

121
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,730
I told you, it's this way.

122
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,300
I guess you have no sense of direction.

123
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,370
Oh, you're here!

124
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,809
The security guard was saying...

125
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,010
that some guy's been lurking around every night for the past few days.

126
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,750
When you're coming and going, check in with me or Gi Ppeum.

127
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,950
- You never know. - Okay.

128
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,150
Right. When's the press conference for the show again?

129
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,619
"Femmicide for Love?"

130
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,430
That's still a few weeks away...

131
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,599
Are you prepping for the promotion schedule already?

132
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,069
Of course. You have to be prepared.

133
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,470
I was so lean during filming. I can't show up looking all bloated.

134
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,480
- Anything popular. - What's the most popular?

135
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,309
Something like instant rice.

136
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,510
Oh, Nu Ri!

137
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,120
Great job today.

138
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,980
Kimchi!

139
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,020
Oh, come stand over here.

140
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,129
Let me get a picture of you with this background.

141
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,130
Should we?

142
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:10,600
- Come on, over here. - Goodness.

143
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,460
- Let me get a shot. - Okay.

144
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,770
One, two, three!

145
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,010
Give me a break. Goodness.

146
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,779
They said they can't make the milk tea without sugar.

147
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,450
What? Why can't they just leave out the sugar?

148
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,020
Well, I guess I'll manage. Thanks.

149
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,350
Oh, that looks heavy. Here, let me get it.

150
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,650
- Here. - Thanks.

151
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:37,019
I'm just going to use the restroom.

152
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,160
- I'll drink it when I get back. - Okay.

153
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,470
Oh, it's cold now.

154
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,070
How was your practical exam?

155
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,970
Oh, should I not have asked?

156
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,110
To be honest, I'm not really sure.

157
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,880
I think my mind was just all over the place the whole time.

158
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,650
Thinking about meeting my mom.

159
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,329
You know, this is how art is.

160
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,330
It's born from anguish.

161
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,870
So you decided to meet your mom.

162
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,570
Yes.

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,369
Actually, Hae came to see me.

164
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,909
Gosh, he was furious.

165
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,709
No way. He found out because of you...

166
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,880
I had a huge fight with him because of that.

167
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,049
What are you going to do about this?

168
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,350
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,090
Why even make a secret if you couldn't keep it?

170
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,490
I guess your mom is doing better for herself now.

171
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,499
When that happens,

172
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,830
all that longing you pushed aside comes rushing back.

173
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,040
That's what happened to me.

174
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,069
For me to...

175
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,380
to expect Hae to forgive me...

176
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,110
is asking for too much, isn't it?

177
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,680
Yes, well...

178
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,719
If he's going to hate me anyway,

179
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,619
I might as well take it while doing everything I can for him.

180
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,189
If you're going to do it, you must be tough and see it through.

181
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,690
Don't give up until the very end.

182
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,230
- You can do it! - You can do it.

183
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,039
Maybe I should have used preserved flowers.

184
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,269
I mean, fresh flowers eventually wilt.

185
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,979
"To all the distinguished guests who have joined us today..."

186
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,980
No, wait.

187
00:10:41,981 --> 00:10:43,779
Maybe I should've used lily of the valley?

188
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,819
If it's a simple ceremony, the bouquet should be simple.

189
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,790
"Today's ceremony will be held without an officiant."

190
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,259
Oh, no.

191
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,499
No. It should be...

192
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,370
"Thank you all for taking the time to be here."

193
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,339
You don't even have me on your mind.

194
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,970
Sung Je Yeon, honestly...

195
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,810
"The star of the show."

196
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,820
Let's give a warm round of applause as we welcome the bride.

197
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,960
Okay, and now, the groom will make his entrance.

198
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,500
Please, welcome the groom.

199
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,160
Hey.

200
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,730
Here I am making this bouquet, and you're right here next to me,

201
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,130
writing all that.

202
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,900
You can't blame me for getting ideas.

203
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,740
The groom is supposed to enter first.

204
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,850
You're getting me all mixed up.

205
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,850
The bride is the star of the show.

206
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,450
Even at a time like this,

207
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,190
you can still focus.

208
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,590
I guess that's how you got into Seoul National University.

209
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,200
Focus.

210
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,340
Stop it.

211
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,040
Go back to focusing.

212
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,980
Just stay still.

213
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,380
Hey, stop it.

214
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,880
Stop.

215
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,520
Don't.

216
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,220
Hey, I said stop!

217
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,730
You really have a knack for getting attention.

218
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,500
You mean you didn't want me to?

219
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,470
Just tell me, and I'll do it.

220
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,139
- You mean it? - But...

221
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,680
what's this business card?

222
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,749
Is this from when you moved the chairs?

223
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,149
If you're not going to kiss me, then just drop it.

224
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,450
Fine.

225
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,390
Whatever.

226
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,160
Se said she wants to meet.

227
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,290
She was asking about the publication rights.

228
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,229
If you're okay with it,

229
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,160
it would be better than selling to a scam artist.

230
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,499
The director's a much better option.

231
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,069
Besides, she was always well-known for content development.

232
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,239
When are you going to meet her?

233
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,639
I was thinking sometime soon.

234
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,770
But thanks to you, now I'm having second thoughts.

235
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,380
Suit yourself.

236
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,750
Sung Je Yeon.

237
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,080
Sung Je Yeon.

238
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,119
You are so infuriating.

239
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,749
You're ridiculous now that we're dating.

240
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,620
What's so ridiculous?

241
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,520
What's so ridiculous?

242
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,559
- Hold on. Who is it? - I don't know.

243
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,329
Didn't you say your sister wouldn't be home till late?

244
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,229
I told her to stay out late with that jerk.

245
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,440
Stay here.

246
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,040
What? You're here?

247
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,979
Why do you just show up without even calling...

248
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,609
and let yourself in like that?

249
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,479
You think I wanted to come? Mom sent a package for you.

250
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,720
Here. Eat up and get lost. This goes in the fridge.

251
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,090
Hello.

252
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,400
Goodness. I'm so sorry, I was right behind you.

253
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,970
Hey, this is Nu Ri's. I'll put them...

254
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,639
- over here. - What?

255
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,840
What is this?

256
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,780
What is this?

257
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:14,149
How dare you point your finger? You'd better put that hand down.

258
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,390
I said, what is this?

259
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,360
After all the years you two haven't seen each other...

260
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,190
Gosh, fate is really something.

261
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,659
It works out so easily.

262
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,860
"Easily?"

263
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,069
We confessed our feelings a total of four times,

264
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,569
and she only agreed after turning me down three times.

265
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,769
Does that sound easy to you?

266
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,270
Oh, like the story of the three visits?

267
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,439
Hey, even Liu Bei only visited Zhuge Liang three times.

268
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,509
Really? That happened to Zhuge Liang?

269
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,880
He sounds like a stand-up guy.

270
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,320
Just go on in after her.

271
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,389
You know she likes it.

272
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,420
Give me a minute.

273
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,119
Seok Joo, do you want a tangerine?

274
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,630
You can have Hae's share too.

275
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,230
So, how have you been?

276
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,430
Is the restaurant still pretty slow?

277
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,370
Don't you guys have team dinners at your company?

278
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,810
We always welcome large parties.

279
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
Sure.

280
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,579
As if that's something to brag about.

281
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,050
Spilling our embarrassing story to Kim Seok Joo.

282
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,990
Am I less than Zhuge Liang or something?

283
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,919
No, it's just...

284
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,230
It's because Seok Joo made it sound so weird.

285
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,660
It's not like we got together easily.

286
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,460
You know we didn't.

287
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,070
I can't stay here, I'm so embarrassed.

288
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,210
So then...

289
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,480
How do I get out of here without making it weird?

290
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,349
Wait, hold on.

291
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,079
Should we pretend to have a fight?

292
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,520
But then Geon No would worry.

293
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,419
Let's just say something urgent came up for me.

294
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,890
Why should you leave? They should be the ones to go.

295
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,200
They probably don't know we can hear them.

296
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,870
Gosh. He's crazy about her.

297
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,639
Something urgent just came up.

298
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,210
I think I should get going now.

299
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,680
I'll see you around.

300
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,680
Hey, aren't we rescheduling our driving practice?

301
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,449
I really have to pass this time. My mom found out.

302
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,920
Hey, that's because you...

303
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,059
You're making it sound like it's my fault you failed your test.

304
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,290
Figure it out yourself.

305
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,360
Sung Je Yeon.

306
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,799
Will you be okay getting home alone?

307
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,200
Yes, of course.

308
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,070
- Okay. - I'm heading out.

309
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,670
See you.

310
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,180
Bye.

311
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,449
You heard all of that?

312
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,690
Loud and clear.

313
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,390
Didn't you want us to hear it?

314
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,330
I want to be alone.

315
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,990
Everybody, get out.

316
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,400
I was leaving anyway. This is ridiculous.

317
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Hae.

318
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,610
Can I have one of these supplements?

319
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,350
No, you can't. You have nutritional overload.

320
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,019
I may not look it, but I'm running on fumes.

321
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,620
I said no!

322
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,729
What? Is it really that good?

323
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,930
Knock yourself out.

324
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,369
Does Seok Joo still not know?

325
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,769
It's not good news. Why go telling everyone?

326
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,969
It'll just scare him.

327
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,340
So he can find out on his own, just like I did?

328
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,039
The way you leave your pills around, he's going to find out soon.

329
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,480
I meant to take it earlier, but I forgot.

330
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,220
I need to go to the doctor's too.

331
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,690
Maybe it'd be better if I just went with Seok Joo?

332
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,960
Good grief.

333
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,659
It's been a while!

334
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,900
Long time no see.

335
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,300
- How have you been? - Good.

336
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,570
Hey, sorry to bother you on your time off.

337
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,399
It's the audition for "World Made of Ash 3."

338
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,239
Oh, it's fine. You're here on a weekend, too.

339
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,579
Is it an audition for high schoolers?

340
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,739
Yes. Sang Yeop from your team.

341
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,750
Since they're young, I need him to follow them.

342
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,780
Here's the audition script and...

343
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,249
Got it.

344
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,589
Okay, I'll book a practice room then.

345
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,050
I have to make a good tape to send over.

346
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,960
Gosh, you're a lifesaver.

347
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,290
How've you been?

348
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,859
You're glowing. The time off must've done you good.

349
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,699
Gosh. I guess it shows?

350
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,040
Well, I have good reason to.

351
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,639
Hey, come back to work already. You're making me jealous. Here.

352
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,869
Okay.

353
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,070
Oh, right.

354
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,839
Did you hear about "Kongjwi and Patjwi?"

355
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,209
Apparently, things are a mess over there.

356
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,149
The actress playing Patjwi suddenly dropped out.

357
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,649
Oh, no. Aren't they already filming?

358
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,650
They're in a mad scramble to find a replacement.

359
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,390
We don't have any actors who'd be a good fit.

360
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,560
Hey, could I have the script? You have it, right?

361
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,299
The female lead is a third-generation chaebol.

362
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,169
But at the start of the show, she falls so madly in love...

363
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,499
that she throws it all away.

364
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,439
She could just go back and inherit it all anyway.

365
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,339
I'm sure part of why he likes her is because she's rich.

366
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,469
The number of chaebol characters is a reflection of our society's...

367
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,669
Here we go with the social critique.

368
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,379
I'm not allowed to criticize it?

369
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,880
Gosh, let's just order some food.

370
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,380
Tae Rin, salad for you?

371
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,980
I don't care anymore.

372
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,720
Chicken feet.

373
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,919
With extra glass noodles.

374
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,519
Rice balls. No, on second thought.

375
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,089
We have to make fried rice in the sauce...

376
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,930
Wait, hold on a second.

377
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,060
Oh, this...

378
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,470
I actually made this at home and brought it in.

379
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,939
What? Gi Ppeum, you can cook?

380
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,510
Oh, no. I just enjoy it.

381
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,279
And Tae Rin, this one is for you.

382
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,710
I made it low-calorie.

383
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,610
Thank you, Gi Ppeum.

384
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,849
Looks so delicious.

385
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,920
This one's for everyone.

386
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,789
- Amazing. - Oh, that's a relief.

387
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,559
I wish our manuscript submissions were this good.

388
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,430
I'm sure something that stands out will come along eventually.

389
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,230
Eventually?

390
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,240
Thank you for the food, Gi Ppeum. This is really delicious.

391
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,080
Gosh, it's freezing.

392
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,950
What?

393
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,500
I finally caught up with you.

394
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,070
What is it? Why are you...

395
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,300
You're the solicitor the security guard mentioned.

396
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,509
Gosh. That security guard.

397
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,979
After giving him three coffees, he calls me a solicitor?

398
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,309
You've come here three times?

399
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,679
Today was my third.

400
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,380
The first day, I was just loitering and got chewed out.

401
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,220
So I explained the situation,

402
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,019
and he even gave me some snacks.

403
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,789
Then why didn't you just come inside?

404
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,820
You know everyone in there anyway.

405
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,860
That's exactly why I couldn't.

406
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,660
I'm...

407
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,700
I'm part of your personal life.

408
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,770
Can I get your number?

409
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,509
I came because I wanted to ask you in person.

410
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,880
So you've been doing this for days?

411
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,450
Weren't you cold?

412
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,880
Of course, it was freezing.

413
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,250
So when are you free?

414
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,690
I'll check my schedule and let you know.

415
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,000
Do you need a ride?

416
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,739
No, I still have some work to finish.

417
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,240
I have to head back to the office.

418
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,640
I'll get going.

419
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,010
What was that?

420
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,290
He's kind of cute.

421
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,589
Oh, right.

422
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,090
Hey, you've heard of Kim Anmin Books, right?

423
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,730
If you have the CEO's contact information...

424
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,930
They went bankrupt?

425
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,070
Prison?

426
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,800
Oh, so does that mean their publishing rights are void?

427
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,610
What's the exact book you want to republish?

428
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,740
- Goodness. - I'll see what I can find out.

429
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,579
Actually, a production company is adapting it into a film,

430
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,680
so they've probably already handled the rights.

431
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,750
Yes, I'll figure it out on my own.

432
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,990
Okay.

433
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,900
(Resignation)

434
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,270
I know this just goes to the HR department.

435
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,000
But still...

436
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,010
I wanted to see you...

437
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,740
and give you this letter I wrote myself.

438
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,250
Oh, I got this for you on my trip.

439
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,420
You went on a trip and felt like buying me a gift?

440
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,449
Don't you hate me?

441
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,550
No.

442
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,420
During the past six years at my first job,

443
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,430
There were more good times than bad.

444
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,060
And that includes you.

445
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,500
I would've been hurt if you'd just submitted this to HR and left.

446
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,240
I'll make sure to wrap up the rest of the auditions.

447
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,180
Je Yeon.

448
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,090
I was very fond of you.

449
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,020
I know.

450
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,790
I hope you won't let yourself be so lonely.

451
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,319
- Are you okay? - Yes.

452
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,679
Who's going to train me now?

453
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,220
I emailed an updated manual to the team.

454
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,959
Hello.

455
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,889
Oh, hello.

456
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,729
Here. These are for you.

457
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,499
Please take good care of her.

458
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,700
- Please have some of these... - Wait, are you Hae's father?

459
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,070
- I'm sorry, who are you? - Oh, my apologies.

460
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,569
Yes, I'm the CEO's...

461
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,140
better half. No, wait.

462
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,379
- I'm her husband. - I see.

463
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,879
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

464
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,080
Oh, that's all right.

465
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,010
There are more people inside, right?

466
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,380
Hello.

467
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,249
- Oh, you're her friend. - Yes.

468
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,689
It's been a long time.

469
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,889
How have you been?

470
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,419
Here, have some of these pastries.

471
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,630
Gosh, thank you.

472
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,429
What are you doing here?

473
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,399
What do you think you're doing? Who let you in?

474
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,269
I just told them I was your husband.

475
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,200
Your secretary sent me right up.

476
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,939
Oh, honestly!

477
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,540
You're even more beautiful when you're at work.

478
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,810
Honey!

479
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,609
How can you be this beautiful?

480
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,410
- You're even more... - Let's go inside. Now.

481
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,249
- What? - Get over here!

482
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,349
But I was just greeting...

483
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,090
All right, keep up the great work!

484
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,090
Go team!

485
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,259
Oh, just a second.

486
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,920
I was supposed to give this to them.

487
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,059
I can't tell if this is cute or just plain crazy.

488
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,460
You're the publisher who was meant to come by this afternoon?

489
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,029
Well, I couldn't show up empty-handed.

490
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,470
So I made a bit of an effort.

491
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,800
Honey, this is delicious. Here, have one.

492
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,739
So, why are you here, Mr. Publisher?

493
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,210
Oh, well...

494
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,380
Should we maybe sit down?

495
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,480
It's just that...

496
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,489
I heard the original novel for your movie is out of print.

497
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,259
I came here today because my company would like to republish it.

498
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,160
You mean, your son's novel.

499
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,329
If it's republished when it hits theaters,

500
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,400
the cross-promotion would be great. There's no downside.

501
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,769
But is he even interested in republishing it?

502
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,939
I'm going to prepare a backup plan first,

503
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,640
and then I'll try to meet with him.

504
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,479
But I feared you'd be uncomfortable, so I wanted to ask you first.

505
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,880
Why would I be uncomfortable? It's just business.

506
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,979
I just hope...

507
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,390
you can persuade the author.

508
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,860
I came up with all these other pitches just to persuade you.

509
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,659
That's why I brought all these snacks and everything.

510
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,459
That actually had the opposite effect.

511
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,930
Let's not do that again.

512
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,800
Oh, right.

513
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,369
I haven't even passed out the letters I wrote.

514
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,800
I'm just going to step out for a...

515
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,509
Just keep these to yourself.

516
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,309
Don't hand them out. Please.

517
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,540
But I was up all night writing...

518
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,650
Honey.

519
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,480
Oh, Honey.

520
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,850
Oh, Honey...

521
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,160
Gosh. What's with all the studying?

522
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,499
So how'd your practical exam go?

523
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,530
Did it go well?

524
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,030
How should I know? The judges are the ones who decide.

525
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,669
What are you looking for?

526
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,800
Found it.

527
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,550
I'm going to give your mom an old photo of you.

528
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,720
To show her how you've grown up.

529
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,950
Seriously.

530
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,720
So cute.

531
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,420
You were so adorable.

532
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,230
Stop it.

533
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,630
Any idea where she is now?

534
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,839
Knock it off.

535
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,399
No, seriously, I haven't seen her around lately.

536
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,409
- Seriously, where did she go? - I told you to stop!

537
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,579
- Nu Ri! - I told you to knock it off!

538
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,909
- What's your problem? - Nu Ri, where'd you go?

539
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,910
Nu Ri!

540
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,749
What? I didn't push you that hard.

541
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,090
Don't be so dramatic.

542
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,690
What is it?

543
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,360
Are you really hurt?

544
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,760
Hae.

545
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,060
What's wrong?

546
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
What?

547
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,700
Who are you?

548
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,270
Excuse me.

549
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,709
Have you happened to see Nu Ri?

550
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,940
She looks like this.

551
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,480
Seriously.

552
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,479
Don't talk to me for a whole week.

553
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,679
What's with you?

554
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,079
Excuse me. Have you seen her?

555
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,050
Nu Ri, you need to come home now!

556
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,220
Call me when you're done. I'll come pick you up.

557
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,630
- Hey, Nu Ri. - Yes?

558
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,200
Here.

559
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,040
- Hello. - Hello.

560
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,600
- Oh, you're here. - Hello.

561
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,640
- Where's Sang Yeop? - He's in traffic, so he'll be late.

562
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,579
Okay, then. As I mentioned in the group chat,

563
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,880
you'll all be partnering up with each other today.

564
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,920
And you'll each get an hour for individual practice.

565
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,490
Any questions?

566
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,460
Are you quitting the company?

567
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,330
Yes.

568
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,600
This is the last thing I have to do here.

569
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,670
I'll set you up with the audition schedules, so don't worry.

570
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,370
Okay, for now, let's get to practice.

571
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,150
Yes, it's me.

572
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,979
What are you doing the day after tomorrow?

573
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,280
Why?

574
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,020
I'm not feeling too well, so I have to go to the doctor.

575
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,489
I was hoping you could come with me.

576
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,460
Aren't you a little old to need a chaperone?

577
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,890
Are you going under anesthesia?

578
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,989
I can't drive you anyway, you know that.

579
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,800
If I needed a driver, I wouldn't have called you, would I?

580
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,629
Come on, just do this for me.

581
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,300
But I have plans that day.

582
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,899
What time's your appointment?

583
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,139
I'll work around your schedule.

584
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,070
I'll text you. Thanks.

585
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,880
Yes.

586
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,980
Unbelievable.

587
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,280
("Kongjwi and Patjwi")

588
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,459
Instead of a rose, how about I put you in the vase?

589
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,630
All blood-red?

590
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,530
- This is so good. - Who do you think you are?

591
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,300
I'm just going to...

592
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,699
If you don't want to lose to him, you've got to...

593
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,069
Director, when are you available?

594
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,210
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.

595
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,690
Hey.

596
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,430
Can I...

597
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,330
stay over with my mom tonight?

598
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,340
I just want to talk with her a little longer.

599
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,870
Yes, sure.

600
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,239
Do you need a ride?

601
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,880
She said she drove.

602
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,010
Alright.

603
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,720
Get something good to eat with your mom.

604
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,050
I'll make sure to eat well, too.

605
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,760
What are you doing? Go on, she must be waiting.

606
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,030
- Okay. - You have a good meal.

607
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,680
"After all that trouble to sell it, I even had to process a refund."

608
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,380
"If anyone has the right to be angry over a speck of dust, it's me."

609
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,249
- She's going to get the role. - "Why is she the one complaining?"

610
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,080
"I can't believe you said that. I swear, I could just..."

611
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,360
Who is it?

612
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,130
Delivery. You ordered the chicken feet, right?

613
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,060
What? I didn't order any...

614
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,230
Sunwoo Hae?

615
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,200
What?

616
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,810
It's a delivery.

617
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,810
Wait, no...

618
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,410
Why are you here all of a sudden? How did you even get here?

619
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,580
Well...

620
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,450
Wait.

621
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,390
Gosh.

622
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,890
So this is what your place looks like.

623
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:57,489
Seriously, why did you just show up without saying anything?

624
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,830
You can't just show up like this.

625
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,070
So, you ordered the chicken feet, right?

626
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,139
Since it's my first time here, I was wondering what to get you.

627
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,609
Right, you can always use toilet paper.

628
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,610
Thanks.

629
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,739
I mean it.

630
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,610
But really, why are you here all of a sudden?

631
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,480
Because I missed you.

632
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,450
Hey, stop it. You're making my heart race.

633
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:28,819
But I have to finish reviewing this.

634
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,860
I won't take up much of your time. I just...

635
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,060
wanted to see your face before I headed home.

636
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,629
- Perfect. - What?

637
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,869
This just got delivered today.

638
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,069
I noticed you didn't have one when I was at your place last time.

639
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,670
It's a must-have for modern life.

640
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,070
Take it with you since you're here.

641
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,810
What is it?

642
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,979
- A robot vacuum? - Yes.

643
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,309
Hey, this is so expensive...

644
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,480
No, it's fine. I got a really good deal on it.

645
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,520
I can just clean myself.

646
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,319
Seriously, you need to return this.

647
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,420
Really?

648
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,229
- I mean it. - But this is...

649
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,959
They say it's super convenient.

650
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,000
Seriously, Sung Je Yeon.

651
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,000
Oh, right.

652
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,339
I bought this for you.

653
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,240
- What is it? - Here.

654
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,910
What is this?

655
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,650
Oh, my gosh, what is this?

656
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,019
- It's so pretty. - A ladle rest.

657
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,319
I got it for a great price, 50 dollars.

658
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,720
What? This was 50 dollars?

659
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,929
Hey, you're the one who needs to return something, okay?

660
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,530
Don't be ridiculous.

661
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,900
Hold on, I just have to take this call.

662
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,840
Yes, hello?

663
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,610
Yes, I was just watching it.

664
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,579
Let me finish reviewing this, and then we can video call.

665
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,610
Okay.

666
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,779
Anyway, it's not much, but please have a seat.

667
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,519
Can I get you some coffee or something?

668
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,820
No, I'm okay.

669
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,420
You get back to work. I'll get going.

670
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
Yes?

671
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,860
Well...

672
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,360
When's your doctor's appointment?

673
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,140
Do you want me to go with you?

674
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,070
I've got plenty of time.

675
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,410
Doesn't look like it.

676
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,280
Don't worry.

677
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,119
Seok Joo already said he'd go with me.

678
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,950
Well, then...

679
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,460
How about we meet up after your appointment?

680
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,160
I'll treat you to something good.

681
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,560
Yes, with the money I get from returning this.

682
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,060
In that case...

683
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,669
You remember that place I said had amazing food?

684
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,669
Back when I was loading trucks.

685
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,870
Sounds good.

686
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,910
Okay, I'm really leaving now.

687
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,770
Bye.

688
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,980
Don't go.

689
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,349
Hello.

690
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,690
- Hello. - What?

691
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,359
Oh, it's just you, Gi Ppeum?

692
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,259
The other two are on a smoke break right now.

693
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,630
- Have a seat. - Okay.

694
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,429
- You're here. - Yes.

695
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,030
You're looking good.

696
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,530
You think so?

697
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:26,940
I guess I'm pretty happy these days.

698
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,479
I wonder why you're so happy, and I think I know why.

699
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,910
Oh, please.

700
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,780
Oh, hold on. I just got a text.

701
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,319
Forget the driving practice.

702
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,950
I'm just going to give you that stock tip I promised and be done.

703
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,490
Let's meet up after work.

704
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,490
Deal.

705
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,819
Who was that? Kim Seok Joo?

706
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,590
Yes. I've got a debt to collect.

707
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,989
You need to stop paying attention to him.

708
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,659
How can I ignore one of my fans?

709
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,559
- He said he's your fan? - Yes!

710
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,069
He was so shy, even when they were just taking a picture.

711
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,499
Okay, enough about Kim Seok Joo.

712
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,070
So, you heard the actress playing Patjwi dropped out, right?

713
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,509
That role...

714
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,480
Couldn't Tae Rin do it?

715
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,309
What do you think, Director?

716
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,179
Actually, their team reached out yesterday.

717
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,790
They called to ask about Mo Tae Rin's availability.

718
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:21,319
With Kwon Do Eun and Director Han, it's too good a project to pass up.

719
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,359
It's a great project, so I wanted Tae Rin to do it too.

720
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,600
Goodness.

721
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,729
Well, look at that. We finally agree on something.

722
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:32,370
But joining a project mid-shoot at this stage...

723
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,839
is a lot of pressure on my actor.

724
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,070
But what if I say...

725
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,710
I still want to do it?

726
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,610
What would that mean?

727
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,180
Well...

728
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,720
Let's go.

729
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,219
Are you sure you'll be okay?

730
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,250
I couldn't stop thinking about it, either.

731
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,759
If we meet them and they decide I'm not a good fit,

732
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,060
then there's nothing we can do about it.

733
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,200
Let's go see them.

734
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,330
- Let's go. - Let's go.

735
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,570
Let's go.

736
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,440
(Wanmi Jokbal)

737
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,209
Seriously, why insist on meeting for something you could've texted?

738
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,580
There's a reason I want to meet in person.

739
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,850
This is good.

740
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,150
If you're going to eat, eat well.

741
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,220
Hey, watch and learn.

742
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,959
You put it on top, see?

743
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,160
Then you take this...

744
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:30,990
and dip it.

745
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,560
You dip it in the soybean powder.

746
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,469
When you know how to do something,

747
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,939
you always have to show off and ruin it.

748
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,140
Like with your driving.

749
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,940
So good.

750
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:50,150
Goodness grief.

751
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,950
Do you think I'd do well in the entertainment industry?

752
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,290
You?

753
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,120
Don't even think about it.

754
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,260
What? Are you serious?

755
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,700
If you're being serious, then...

756
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,370
Forget it.

757
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,740
I mean, nothing in life is easy,

758
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,169
but you don't have the stomach for it.

759
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,340
All you've ever done is study.

760
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,180
Come on, just stick to your numbers.

761
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,780
Do you think my mom would let me?

762
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,220
I shouldn't have bailed that day.

763
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,470
Hey.

764
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,769
Just give me one move.

765
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,300
I don't think one move is going to do it.

766
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,970
Then how many, exactly?

767
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,810
Geon No, I'm here!

768
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,079
Oh, hi.

769
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,809
What brings you here?

770
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,509
I was craving Geon No's food.

771
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,649
I see.

772
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,280
I don't know when I'll get another chance.

773
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,349
I'm going to Australia.

774
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,550
"Australia?"

775
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,219
- What? - Don't ask.

776
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,359
I already bought my ticket, so don't try to stop me.

777
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,789
Goodbye, Korea!

778
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,390
Wait, no. Were you serious about leaving?

779
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,729
- Really? - Please don't go!

780
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,070
Please don't go.

781
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,930
Oh, no.

782
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:20,969
You spilled everything.

783
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,569
Geon No, what's gotten into you? You're being dramatic.

784
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,709
It's not like we saw each other all that often.

785
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,579
But you came by for rice wine a few times.

786
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,209
I was actually really proud and happy about it.

787
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,580
Exactly, stay and drink with us. Where do you think you're going?

788
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,420
You don't even speak English.

789
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,180
Hey!

790
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,790
Do you want me to give you the bookstore?

791
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,119
You can just go and clean it once in a while.

792
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,519
I'm not getting rid of it. It was my grandma's dying wish.

793
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,730
No.

794
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,559
Goodness.

795
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,630
Look at you, pouting again. Hae.

796
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,029
Come visit Australia with Geon No.

797
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,200
I'll be a master surfer by then.

798
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,139
- Geon No. - Yes?

799
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,639
You knocked that over on purpose, didn't you?

800
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,840
Let's start over.

801
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,710
- Excuse me. - Yes?

802
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:05,449
Are you sure you can make it home on your own?

803
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:07,420
You had a lot of that rice wine earlier.

804
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,490
Gosh, you reek.

805
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,419
Come on, I'll walk you home.

806
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,989
Oh, come on, really!

807
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,460
It's just right up ahead.

808
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,490
Hey.

809
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,729
You kept telling me to clean the bookstore,

810
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:21,830
so while I was...

811
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,430
You wrote this.

812
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,940
What am I supposed to do when I miss you?

813
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:39,149
It's just so far away.

814
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,980
We can just video call.

815
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,420
Come on, stop. You're being so cheesy.

816
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,520
I'm leaving.

817
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:50,990
Hey.

818
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,200
Let me walk you home.

819
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,860
Hey!

820
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,340
(Yeonjung University Hospital)

821
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,350
How have you been feeling lately?

822
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,949
Do you have any abnormal sensations or dizziness?

823
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:15,950
They've been happening a little more often lately.

824
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,189
Have you been taking your medication regularly?

825
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,919
- Yes. - And you haven't had...

826
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,390
- any vomiting after taking it? - No.

827
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,530
There's a clinical trial that's about to start.

828
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,300
It's not in the country.

829
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,500
Your case is exceptionally rare,

830
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,299
and while a complete cure might not be possible,

831
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,470
we may be able to ease the severity of your symptoms.

832
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:50,750
Hey.

833
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,550
Hey, Seok Joo.

834
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,420
Hey.

835
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,500
Look, instead of me trying to explain it,

836
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,160
I thought it best if you heard it directly from the doctor.

837
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,229
You're shocked, aren't you?

838
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,530
Of course, I am.

839
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,039
Does Nu Ri know you're sick?

840
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,939
Nu Ri has her college entrance exams coming up.

841
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,470
It would just get in the way of her studying.

842
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:13,680
Goodness.

843
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,750
The disease only started progressing recently.

844
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:21,750
For a long time now, I think I knew this day would come.

845
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,920
I just...

846
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:27,219
didn't want you to be too shocked if something happened to me.

847
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,389
You think knowing means I won't be shocked?

848
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:31,029
It just means I'm shocked now instead of later.

849
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:32,160
No, but you...

850
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,700
Do you know why I liked you so much?

851
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:38,800
For me,

852
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,600
it's because you made my life a little more complicated.

853
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,640
It's because you accepted me for who I am.

854
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,780
But now...

855
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,680
It's your life that's getting complicated.

856
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,730
There was a time when it was simple, too.

857
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,140
Thanks to you.

858
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,210
You should go.

859
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,010
I don't want you to see me fall apart.

860
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:24,510
You're really leaving?

861
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,480
I said go.

862
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,170
The person you are trying to reach is unavailable...

863
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,610
Are you sure you gave me the right address?

864
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,110
This is a hospital.

865
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:26,510
Are you crying?

866
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:56,040
What do you want me to do?

867
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:00,880
I've been there, so I know.

868
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:04,080
Not just rushing in and asking why they're crying...

869
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,910
or trying to comfort them.

870
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,250
Sometimes, they just want to be left alone.

871
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,500
I'm just going to do my own thing.

872
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,730
It's so cold out, you're going to turn into an icicle.

873
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:00,500
It's so cold.

874
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,500
Gosh, it's freezing.

875
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:12,410
Do you...

876
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,680
Do you drink?

877
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,990
Do you eat chicken feet?

878
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:19,990
Yes, I guess.

879
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,760
Seriously? These things?

880
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,800
You've arrived at your destination.

881
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,069
Route guidance is finished.

882
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,010
- Is this it? - Yes.

883
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,009
The GPS says it is.

884
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,149
It's not like they just remodeled, right?

885
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,650
Maybe it closed down?

886
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,019
Well, the food wasn't that great anyway.

887
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,320
- I thought you said it was good. - I take it back.

888
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,219
- What did they serve again? - Korean home-style food.

889
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,489
What? That sounds amazing!

890
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:58,060
How many side dishes were there? What was the main course?

891
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,429
Calm down, let's just go inside.

892
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:01,460
You must be hungry.

893
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,700
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

894
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,539
I ordered us some ice cream, too.

895
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,210
Of course, you did. Good call.

896
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,510
Hey, by the way...

897
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,810
How'd you get the time off? It's a weekday.

898
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:19,609
Yes, aside from prepping for an audition, I'm pretty free.

899
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,620
I see.

900
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,950
Aren't you curious why I have so much free time?

901
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,660
Of course, I am.

902
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,060
When it comes to you, I want to know everything.

903
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:32,790
I...

904
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,470
I quit my job.

905
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,299
What?

906
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,570
Don't worry, I left on good terms.

907
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:46,610
Now, I'm worried.

908
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,179
How am I supposed to feed us?

909
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,110
You eat so much.

910
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,550
Just don't let me starve. I love a good bowl of rice.

911
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:57,919
Of all the times,

912
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,290
for that restaurant to go out of business...

913
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,160
They had great rice there.

914
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,360
I thought if I quit,

915
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,530
I'd feel, I don't know...

916
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,830
Like I'd be lost again like I was before.

917
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:12,570
But somehow...

918
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,740
It's just this feeling...

919
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,270
I think...

920
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:22,580
You look relieved.

921
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:24,380
Yes.

922
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,350
Yes.

923
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,380
- I think that's it. - Yes.

924
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:34,790
I'm not sure where being unemployed is going to lead me.

925
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:35,990
But...

926
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:38,890
I have you.

927
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,000
It's just that...

928
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:46,270
when you have a landmark,

929
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:49,070
it makes for a pretty good guide.

930
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,009
I'm the landmark?

931
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,710
No, you're the Bulguksa Temple.

932
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,310
How is that supposed to guide you? You need someone on my level.

933
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:00,580
Wait. Hang on a second.

934
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,089
What? Who is it?

935
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:06,120
Sang Yeop.

936
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,189
What a great kid.

937
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:09,420
That's great to hear.

938
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,260
It's nothing.

939
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:23,439
"Je Yeon. Thanks for everything."

940
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,409
"I'll make sure to pass the audition."

941
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,840
"See you then. You got this too, Je Yeon!"

942
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,180
Seriously, does "You got this" really need a heart emoji?

943
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,649
He still hasn't done his military service?

944
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,949
He has to do one more project first.

945
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:40,059
And it would be perfect if that was "World Made of Ash 3"

946
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,819
Can the author even have a say in the casting?

947
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,390
- No. - I should've put it in my contract.

948
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,260
Don't text him back.

949
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,899
If you text back, when he's on some long march in the army,

950
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,570
all he'll be thinking about is you. Just don't do it.

951
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:53,800
What? Would that be so bad?

952
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,999
It's not okay with me.

953
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,070
- He's just a kid. - Absolutely not.

954
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,510
What? It's just purely business.

955
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:02,809
Fine. I'll do it right here in front of you.

956
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:05,850
Here. "Great job, Sang Yeop."

957
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,350
Whatever. I'm not looking.

958
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,420
What's taking our order so long?

959
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,360
I'm going to go check on it.

960
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,360
Finish up with that by the time I get back.

961
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,330
Yes, sir.

962
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,560
And one more thing.

963
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,130
No long paragraphs.

964
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:22,060
Keep it short and simple.

965
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:24,869
Goodness.

966
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,370
Where did the long march come from?

967
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,039
Thank you.

968
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,070
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

969
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:31,970
There.

970
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:15,720
What's wrong? Are you dizzy?

971
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,220
Yes.

972
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,450
I think my blood sugar is low.

973
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,320
Here, you should eat some of this first.

974
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:25,260
I'm just going to go wash my face.

975
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,460
I can't tell if my blood sugar is low or if I'm just sleepy.

976
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,270
- I'll be fine after I wash my face. - Wait.

977
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,639
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?

978
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,969
Where? To the men's room?

979
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,070
Yes.

980
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,710
I've wanted to see one since I was a kid.

981
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:45,480
Please, just stay here.

982
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,849
And don't wait for me right outside either.

983
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,020
I'll be right back.

984
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:18,470
Looks like the restroom is under construction.

985
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,040
I'll have to take the long way around.

986
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,250
Maybe this isn't the right way.

987
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:29,749
Excuse me.

988
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,149
How many restrooms are there here?

989
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,589
There's one on every floor. And they don't have a passcode.

990
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:36,889
Are any of them under construction?

991
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:39,330
No, they're all working just fine.

992
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:41,200
Thank you.

993
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,730
Of course. Thank you.

994
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,550
You're back?

995
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,390
So...

996
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,230
Don't get mad,

997
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,030
just calm down and hear me out.

998
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:03,500
There's a really good explanation.

999
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,810
Okay.

1000
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:08,240
This place is just so big,

1001
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,850
and I've never been here before.

1002
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,220
I was completely lost.

1003
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,850
I told you I should've gone with you.

1004
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:22,090
You have a terrible sense of direction, don't you?

1005
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:23,790
Yes, I do.

1006
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:33,300
From now on, I guess I'll have to just do what you say.

1007
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:37,270
Except for coming to the men's room with me.

1008
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:38,710
I won't.

1009
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,510
I'm not curious anymore.

1010
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,340
It's snowing.

1011
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,980
- Oh, you're right. - Hey, it's snowing.

1012
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,320
So it is.

1013
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,560
Looks like the first snow of the season.

1014
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,930
I guess so.

1015
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:28,220
Honey, it's snowing.

1016
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:31,560
You should look out the window instead of at those papers.

1017
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,460
It's snowing.

1018
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:37,470
Do you think it'll stick?

1019
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:40,400
If it does, we should build a snowman.

1020
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,210
Sure.

1021
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:54,820
The whole world is going to turn white.

1022
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:01,289
- Thank you. - Enjoy. Thanks.

1023
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:03,460
- Have a good one! - You too. Thanks.

1024
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,010
Come on, time to eat.

1025
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,120
Gi Ppeum.

1026
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,759
Aren't you hungry?

1027
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,489
Didn't you say you'd finish that today?

1028
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:37,690
After I eat.

1029
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,859
Oh, right. I'll finish it after I eat.

1030
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,160
- I got it. - Okay?

1031
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:48,000
Here, you can eat while you read.

1032
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:51,970
I packed a perfectly balanced lunch for you.

1033
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:55,039
Just thinking about Tae Rin finally starting her project,

1034
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,139
I'm so excited.

1035
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:59,209
You think I can't get mad just because you're being nice?

1036
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,519
I'm not like that.

1037
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,850
Gosh, it's snowing.

1038
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,760
Maybe watching the snow will cheer you up.

1039
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,090
Just for ten minutes.

1040
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:12,960
I'm not religious,

1041
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,000
but who do you think makes it snow?

1042
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,200
I'd just like to thank them.

1043
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,180
Gosh.

1044
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,550
Hey, that looks great.

1045
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:40,320
One, two, three!

1046
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,299
How did you finish the whole plate by yourself?

1047
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,900
It's a single serving.

1048
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,300
It was gone in just a few bites.

1049
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:55,570
Is there anything you want to eat?

1050
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:59,040
If you see something you like, read it out.

1051
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,010
Fish cake soup.

1052
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:07,680
That's it?

1053
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,150
I was hoping you'd be hungrier.

1054
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:19,189
"Assorted skewers, 12 dollars."

1055
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:20,459
"Rolled omelet, 8 dollars."

1056
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,199
"Additional charge for cheese."

1057
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,700
"Pressed pork, chicken feet..."

1058
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:25,930
You just had chicken feet.

1059
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,440
Seriously, you're hilarious.

1060
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:35,110
Then why'd you make me read it?

1061
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:38,680
You're smiling.

1062
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:41,820
Looks like you're in a better mood.

1063
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:47,020
Since you're feeling better, you should pick something to eat.

1064
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,400
This has nothing to do with my mood.

1065
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,000
No matter what, I wanted to hold your hand today.

1066
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,520
Are we ready for this?

1067
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:18,990
- Of course not. - Then what's this?

1068
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:20,190
Cheers!

1069
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,570
The snow's going to stick today.

1070
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:37,970
What if the roads get icy?

1071
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,040
That's true.

1072
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:53,120
Puff.

1073
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,760
I remember.

1074
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,470
You used to do that just as hard before too...

1075
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:05,870
to make it heal faster.

1076
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,710
You have to blow like this.

1077
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:23,250
It's all in the breath, not your voice.

1078
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:41,599
We're being so silly.

1079
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,800
What do you mean?

1080
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,509
I'm not the silly one.

1081
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:47,010
That's usually what the silly ones say, you know.

1082
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:48,510
Whatever.

1083
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,789
I think I'm starting to get it now.

1084
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:58,820
What?

1085
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,360
When you're too happy,

1086
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,460
it can be scary, too.

1087
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,280
No matter when or where,

1088
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:27,080
or how we met,

1089
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:30,450
I would never have turned back.

1090
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,630
I could never have...

1091
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,330
turned back these feelings.

1092
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:48,800
(My Youth)

1093
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:51,470
What are we going to do?

1094
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:54,570
Going abroad is his best option.

1095
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:57,240
So you have to go far away to get better?

1096
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:59,940
Oh, no.

1097
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,080
Oh, no. Hae...

1098
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,350
Even if it means I die, I want to stay here,

1099
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,450
next to my loved ones.

1100
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,950
I don't want to part ways with Hae.

1101
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:14,419
What if something goes wrong while he's there?

1102
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:15,590
(To Sung Je Yeon)

1103
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,660
Some moments will feel...

1104
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:21,060
And maybe forever will feel...

1105
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:23,330
like this very moment.
