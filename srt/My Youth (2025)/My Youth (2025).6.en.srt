(My Youth)

6
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,489
(Episode 6)

7
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,529
Hey.

8
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,429
Hey, are you really sure I don't have to go?

9
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,629
There's no reason for you to come.

10
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,770
All you'd do is just grab the contract anyway.

11
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,700
I'll just sign it on the spot.

12
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,799
All right, got it. Call me.

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay.

14
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,439
Didn't his career end after some fraud scandal?

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,639
Really?

16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,909
He didn't seem like the type to scam people.

17
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,579
He seemed like such a nice person.

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,749
You're so hopelessly naive.

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,150
Just look up "Sunwoo Hae fraud case."

20
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,320
No, you jerk. Darn it.

21
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,130
Oh, that's right.

22
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,159
Did they take down that old video?

23
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,399
I saw it, you know. The kid didn't even cry. Stone-cold.

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,129
Yes, but even that seemed like an act to me.

25
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,940
Gives you the creeps, doesn't it?

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,510
He has to know, right? That he's why his mom died.

27
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,140
It's all in the past. Just give it a rest.

28
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,979
Why are you all stooping so low?

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,679
You should focus on your own career instead of minding others' business.

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,749
You can't even handle your one actress.

31
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,989
- Why you little... - That's enough. Stop it.

32
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,689
- I said stop! - Let me go.

33
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,360
Knock it off!

34
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,059
Ouch!

35
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,790
What? Ouch!

36
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,659
What was that?

37
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,029
I never had a sponsor.

38
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,200
And the fraud was committed by the jerks using my name.

39
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,370
And I'm the one who worked to pay for it.

40
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,940
And my mom... I...

41
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,540
I know darn well I'm the reason she's dead.

42
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,710
Get your hands off her, you punk.

43
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,760
Let's go.

44
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,069
What are you doing here?

45
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,600
Geon No said he was coming.

46
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,410
You...

47
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,240
You heard everything, didn't you? From the start?

48
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,810
If you heard all that, then why...

49
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,549
Why would you just stand there and listen?

50
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,590
From now on, just ignore anything you hear about me.

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,560
Don't waste your energy on pointless things.

52
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,790
Pointless?

53
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,289
How could you say that's pointless?

54
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,689
I mean, don't engage with every little thing.

55
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,730
People are going to talk no matter what.

56
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,429
What good will it do for you to get down in the mud with them?

57
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,929
Well, I'm getting in the mud.

58
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,400
And if I'm in, I'll fight until I'm black and blue. Got a problem?

59
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,609
Why do I feel like I'm the only one overreacting?

60
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,010
Then what am I supposed to do?

61
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,279
What, should I act happy about it?

62
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,480
Seeing you get insulted for no cause and treated so horribly...

63
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,950
The woman I like is going through this because of me.

64
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,050
Because I've seen how you've lived, and I know you.

65
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,060
You've worked so hard.

66
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,730
I just hated seeing you humiliated like that.

67
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,030
What is all this commotion?

68
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,470
Our guests will be here any minute. What in the world is going on?

69
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,070
Explain.

70
00:03:52,071 --> 00:03:54,739
Dong Jun grabbed Je Yeon's collar,

71
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,239
and that's when Sunwoo Hae walked in.

72
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,180
- Sunwoo Hae? - Yes.

73
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,280
I can't believe them...

74
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,050
Sung Je Yeon.

75
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,750
Han Dong Jun. You two...

76
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,060
I'm here for the publication rights.

77
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,830
The original author's approval.

78
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,760
You said you needed it.

79
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,940
You were the representative?

80
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,310
So that's why the name was...

81
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,610
That's impossible.

82
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,009
That's right.

83
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,280
I was the one using that name.

84
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,990
Did you know?

85
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,130
That Sunwoo Hae is actually Jin Mu Yeong?

86
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,730
Am I just supposed to stand here?

87
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,070
Sorry things are a bit of a mess for your first visit.

88
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,510
Why don't we talk in my office?

89
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,039
This way. I can show you...

90
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
The signature.

91
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,310
Do I have to sign today?

92
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,720
I'm not really in the mood.

93
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,450
I'm not the one in a hurry.

94
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,490
I think I'll head out for today.

95
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,330
You're leaving?

96
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,030
The other party's name on the contract.

97
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,330
Correct it before you leave.

98
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,470
- Yes. - And the meeting date.

99
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,940
Reschedule it for as soon as possible.

100
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,740
You, just get out. I can't stand the sight of you.

101
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,880
Sunwoo Hae!

102
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,990
I'm heading out.

103
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,060
See you after your meeting.

104
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,230
Gosh.

105
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,960
You just suck the life out of me.

106
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,030
Go on.

107
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Hey, are you okay?

108
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,150
I'm fine.

109
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,250
Please, just go.

110
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,260
(Jin Mu Yeong, Real name, Sunwoo Hae)

111
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,830
Are you sure you're okay?

112
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,430
Yes.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,739
Oh, you have a nosebleed.

114
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,940
Oh, come on.

115
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,980
I bet he was pretty upset earlier, too.

116
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,049
It's not like I just stood by because I agreed.

117
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,480
Since when are you so chummy with him?

118
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,350
Next time you see him, be sure to tell him that.

119
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,690
To his face.

120
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,180
You're still here?

121
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,689
The CEO didn't say anything else?

122
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,659
Let's talk on the way out.

123
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,359
We have to reschedule the meeting.

124
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,559
Hey, let me see. The spot where you...

125
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,960
Stop, I'm serious.

126
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,700
It's so humiliating, for real.

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Why?

128
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,900
What is?

129
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,300
Do you think I like being seen like that?

130
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,610
That I don't feel humiliated?

131
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,270
Getting grabbed by the collar and all.

132
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,980
I was already upset, and then you had to start in on me.

133
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,180
This is driving me nuts.

134
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,390
You were really annoying.

135
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,720
Pointless, you say?

136
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,230
Yes.

137
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,860
Why are you laughing?

138
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,660
Why are you hugging me?

139
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,130
Real smooth, aren't you?

140
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,940
Hold still.

141
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,220
Your face is so puffy, I could see it from a mile off.

142
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,890
Here, hold this against it.

143
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,160
Just stay still.

144
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,760
No, I'll do it.

145
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,530
All right.

146
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,060
So, when do you want to have the meeting?

147
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,999
If you can't come to the office, we can work with your schedule.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,229
- Just make sure you sign. - Don't worry, I'm going to.

149
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,770
With that much money on the line?

150
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,740
And while I'm at it...

151
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,239
I might make them sweat a little.

152
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,310
You are something else.

153
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,110
Hey! If you mess with them, I'm the one who gets burned!

154
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,079
- Hey! You... - What?

155
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Hey, don't use your hands.

156
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,989
Gosh.

157
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,720
- No. It's fine. - Hold on.

158
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,090
Yes. Here.

159
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,730
Here.

160
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,700
Stop treating me like a gorilla!

161
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
You know...

162
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,309
Wouldn't a gorilla be calmer than you?

163
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,640
You just couldn't resist, could you?

164
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,110
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

165
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,080
So...

166
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,279
All that gossip from my co-workers.

167
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,590
You're not going to keep dwelling on it, are you?

168
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,490
Well, once the show airs,

169
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,760
I figure that's how they'll talk.

170
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,289
When I was a kid,

171
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,729
I'd get in trouble with my mom for secretly watching you on TV.

172
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,799
What?

173
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,500
There have to be other people like me out there.

174
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,440
You know something?

175
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,840
It's like you haven't changed at all, you know?

176
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,849
Still carrying that heavy bag,

177
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,580
and how you charge head first into everything.

178
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,819
You're living life on the straight and narrow.

179
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,019
Exactly.

180
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,090
I really am on the straight and narrow.

181
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,230
It's the world that's crooked.

182
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,660
So just keep doing what you did today.

183
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,669
- Like what? - Clearing yourself of fake charges.

184
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,500
And getting payback for me when I get hit.

185
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,610
All right, let's try this again.

186
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,010
Signal on.

187
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,289
Check your side mirror.

188
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,349
Okay.

189
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,819
Oh, look, the car behind is waiting for you.

190
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,119
- Okay, now. - Now?

191
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,720
- Now? Right now? - Yes, now!

192
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,359
- Gosh! - Gosh!

193
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,099
Are you just going to drive straight forever?

194
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,029
We're going to end up on the freeway at this rate!

195
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,399
I can merge at the next opening.

196
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,599
It's not like it's my last chance.

197
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,339
Come on, I thought you signed up for driving school.

198
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,710
If you're going to drive like that, go practice there!

199
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,879
Instead of working three jobs,

200
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,149
focus on your driving!

201
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,410
Did it ever occur to you that you're the one distracting me?

202
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,020
Are you taking a bad day out on me or something?

203
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,250
You know what?

204
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,820
Don't even bother getting your license.

205
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,759
I can't stand the thought of someone like you on the road.

206
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,029
What do you mean, "someone like me?"

207
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,199
You can talk after you teach me properly!

208
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,499
How much better can I possibly teach you? Seriously!

209
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,370
Hey, eyes on the road! For crying out loud!

210
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,710
Hey, Son.

211
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,210
This is kind of...

212
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,349
Why's he here again?

213
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,719
So, I heard you stopped by the house.

214
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,820
Oh, for goodness' sake.

215
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,490
Are you really becoming Seok Joo's little lackey?

216
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,520
Seok Joo's a total weirdo, don't you think?

217
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,960
Don't say that. Seok Joo's a nice guy.

218
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,300
Hey, by any chance,

219
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,130
- my old photo albums... - Yes?

220
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,599
No, never mind. No way you'd have them.

221
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,810
What are you talking about? I have all your old albums.

222
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,210
Your mom treasured those things like they were sacred.

223
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,410
I'll...

224
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:22,810
Deliver them to me, or use a courier.

225
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,750
I'll use a courier service.

226
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,719
This thing... Would you look at this?

227
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,520
I'll send it by courier. Okay, bye!

228
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,990
Hi, I have a delivery.

229
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,629
That'll be five dollars, please.

230
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,700
Got some free time?

231
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,639
Didn't you say you were starting some publishing company or whatever?

232
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,739
Well...

233
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,139
I just finished a deadline, so things are slow right now.

234
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,610
That's not what I mean.

235
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,649
Gosh, this is ridiculous.

236
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,310
This photo album...

237
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,889
So...

238
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,719
this album...

239
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,519
Even when I was really...

240
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,190
Even when I had nowhere to live and was scraping by, you know?

241
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,929
I left it with someone I trusted.

242
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,400
I always made sure to get it back.

243
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,500
These photos.

244
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,099
These are irreplaceable moments.

245
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,170
Right.

246
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,540
I guess it was cheaper to get the album back than your kid.

247
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,410
Listen, if Seok Joo bothers you again, you tell me.

248
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,720
I'll go set him straight, you hear?

249
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,119
I'll go and teach him a lesson he won't forget.

250
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,659
Just because he's her son... There's a limit to what I'll allow.

251
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,790
I'm leaving!

252
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,490
Okay.

253
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,959
So, no flower for me?

254
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,030
Fine.

255
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,030
I'm off.

256
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,639
(Sunwoo Hae)

257
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,010
(Sunwoo Hae)

258
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,230
Where could Sung Je Yeon be?

259
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,610
Do you really...

260
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,839
have to get your license?

261
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,610
We need to stop at a gas station on the way.

262
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,180
He said to return it with a full tank of gas.

263
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,550
I can't even get mad anymore.

264
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,820
Where are we supposed to return it?

265
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,260
Aren't you cold?

266
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,730
Hey.

267
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,629
How long have you been standing there?

268
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,229
Why are you here?

269
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,500
For a while now.

270
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,969
It's just, you know...

271
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,369
My brother told me to return his car here.

272
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,809
Though I have no idea where "here" is.

273
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,650
Who are you? This is Nu Ri's house.

274
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,809
Je Yeon.

275
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,450
We need to have a little talk.

276
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,289
- But, it's too risky here. - Risky?

277
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,950
Let's go somewhere less conspicuous.

278
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,990
What? Wait. Where are you taking me?

279
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,630
You'll keep this a secret, right?

280
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,369
I'm telling you, he'll tear me to shreds.

281
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,939
Is Sunwoo Hae the type of guy to make a fuss about someone dating?

282
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,739
He didn't even say anything about my grades being a mess.

283
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,340
You think he'll just let this slide too?

284
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,279
I'm a little hesitant to say this, but...

285
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,349
if your grades are terrible and you're dating on top of that,

286
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,919
isn't he the type to lump it all and blow up about everything?

287
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,920
You don't sound very hesitant.

288
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,590
Anyway...

289
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,159
- Who are you, really? - She and my brother are a thing.

290
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,259
A "thing?"

291
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,589
Gosh, he's actually seeing someone?

292
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,659
A "thing..."

293
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,589
He's not really the type. I thought he'd call it a waste.

294
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,699
Wait a minute.

295
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,129
Did you just criticize my brother?

296
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,530
No, I respect him for being so thrifty.

297
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,840
Hold on.

298
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,510
It's nothing, really, but...

299
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,179
Here you go.

300
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,540
Treat yourself to something nice.

301
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,850
Thank you.

302
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,479
When an adult gives you something...

303
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,189
My brother said to say, "Thank you" and accept it.

304
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,490
You did the right thing.

305
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,129
Lunch was good here, wasn't it?

306
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,190
Yes.

307
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,229
Oh, thank you.

308
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,430
Thank you for the meal.

309
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,169
According to the contract, at the end of this month,

310
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,900
Your term is set to expire. You're aware of that, right?

311
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Yes.

312
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,340
I...

313
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,979
In the garden you've so carefully tended,

314
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,150
do I belong?

315
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,910
What could be the problem?

316
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,880
I've given it a lot of thought.

317
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,650
You're the one who taught me all of these wonderful things.

318
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,420
You've done so much for me and taught me everything, but...

319
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,490
I guess I just wasn't good enough.

320
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,260
Well...

321
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,630
You've clearly given this a lot of thought, haven't you?

322
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,199
So...

323
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,069
are you in talks with any other agencies?

324
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,670
If not, I can make some calls for you.

325
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,570
Oh, no, that's all right.

326
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,280
Just you offering...

327
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,579
is enough. Thank you.

328
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,580
All right.

329
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,750
As for your next project...

330
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,120
it's an awkward time to be choosing one.

331
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,349
You must've worn yourself out reading scripts for nothing.

332
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,420
Not at all.

333
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,560
Please give them my regrets.

334
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,790
I will.

335
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,370
Ever since you were this little,

336
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,470
I'd hug you when you cried, and comfort you and send you to shoots.

337
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,510
There was a time I was more devoted to raising you than my own children.

338
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,880
You've worked so hard all this time.

339
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,950
Yes.

340
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,180
You have, too.

341
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,630
Oh my gosh.

342
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
Hey, aren't you Tae Rin?

343
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:15,899
I'm sorry, who...

344
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,240
What? You don't remember me?

345
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,809
I took such good care of you back in high school.

346
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,479
Oh, are you Hye Bin?

347
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,679
Yes!

348
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,140
Gosh, what a surprise running into you.

349
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,010
You're on social media, right?

350
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,119
I recently started my own enzyme supplement business.

351
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,320
We should go get a coffee or something.

352
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,419
I'm so sorry,

353
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,259
but let's do it next time. It'll be my treat.

354
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,160
Oh, you're busy.

355
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,059
Then again, even back in the day,

356
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,429
you were so busy you could hardly ever make it to school.

357
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,500
No, it's not that.

358
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,300
It's just the state I'm in right now...

359
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,400
Could you please let go?

360
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,340
Oh, my.

361
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,970
Who made her cry?

362
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,340
It wasn't me.

363
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,450
Hey, why are you making this so awkward for me?

364
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,820
No, I...

365
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,720
All right, that's enough.

366
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,560
Pretend to wipe your tears and hide your face.

367
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,960
You need to cry some more, don't you?

368
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,790
You can just go that way.

369
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,900
What are you giving me now?

370
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,740
Coffee, cigarettes,

371
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,669
and a handkerchief.

372
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,510
With all this, is he really not hitting on me?

373
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,070
Excuse me?

374
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:31,880
I'd appreciate it if you just went on your way.

375
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,879
No, I was just...

376
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,010
Gosh, this is so annoying.

377
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,150
Hitting on you?

378
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,190
Me?

379
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,930
What's with her? Why is she being so nosy?

380
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,060
Oh, right. My bag.

381
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,400
My bag.

382
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,340
Can I have it back, please?

383
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,709
Why do you keep crying?

384
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,739
What, you want me to think about it and get back to you?

385
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,279
About why I keep crying?

386
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
Yes.

387
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,950
Here's my business card.

388
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,590
You can let me know when you have an answer.

389
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,620
You're so weird.

390
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,589
Look who's talking.

391
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,859
Knock yourself out.

392
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,859
That you went out of your way to follow me and say that...

393
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,160
is what's really weird.

394
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,930
That day,

395
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,669
I thought we had a pretty good vibe on the rooftop.

396
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,670
"We?"

397
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,040
"Good vibe?"

398
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:38,309
Just be straight with me.

399
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,240
That way I'll know how to act around you.

400
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,749
You left your bag behind, so I picked it up for you.

401
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,979
And I'm offended you think I'm hitting on you.

402
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,620
No, that's not what I meant by "be straight with me!"

403
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,820
Look,

404
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,519
whenever a guy approaches me, I just assume he's hitting on me.

405
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,929
I assume he has an ulterior motive.

406
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,689
Sure, at first they say it's just kindness or goodwill.

407
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,760
But in the end, they all want the same thing.

408
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,570
Why would you be any different?

409
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,440
Seems like you're feeling a little better now.

410
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,840
- That's a relief. - Hey!

411
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,639
Are you messing with me right now?

412
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,980
I'm not.

413
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,079
Oh, so we're talking informally now?

414
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,549
You're so condescending.

415
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,249
I mean, if you were just honest, it might at least be cute.

416
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,479
Why do you keep upsetting me?

417
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,749
I'm already feeling down as it is!

418
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,920
Condescending...

419
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,589
If I did have ulterior motives...

420
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,659
If I were hitting on you, would you be less upset?

421
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,999
What, so if I wasn't upset,

422
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,829
were you just going to say you had no ulterior motives?

423
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,469
Why are you twisting things?

424
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,429
No, I actually don't have any.

425
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,799
If I did, I wouldn't be doing this either.

426
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,999
No, my point is,

427
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,339
why even ask if I'd be less upset?

428
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,939
You need to be less upset.

429
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,939
You have to calm down for us to have a conversation.

430
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,480
I was just trying to get you to calm down.

431
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,550
Hey.

432
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,660
You.

433
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,020
If you fall for me, you're dead meat.

434
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,560
What? As if I...

435
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,330
Why would I...

436
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,680
Oh, hey.

437
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,079
- Hey. - Yes?

438
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,419
Does Mo Tae Rin come here often?

439
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,420
Oh, hey.

440
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,050
Here.

441
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,419
Take this back to your parents' place for me.

442
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,829
Put it somewhere out of sight.

443
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,960
(Sunwoo Hae)

444
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,030
So this was the favour you wanted to ask.

445
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,500
Here.

446
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,499
I went on a blind date,

447
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,040
and she gave me this. She said her hobby is pottery.

448
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,970
A blind date?

449
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,509
Oh, it's beautiful.

450
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,550
- She made this? - She bought it.

451
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,179
You can return the favour sometime. I'll be in touch.

452
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,790
Hey, if this is about Mo Tae Rin, she doesn't come here often.

453
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,120
That wasn't the favour I had in mind, though.

454
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,590
I'm off.

455
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,040
Hi, Bebop!

456
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,909
Hi, Beat!

457
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,210
Can you pay my taxi fare?

458
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,039
Seok Joo went that way. Go ask him to pay.

459
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,780
What? When?

460
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,579
Is that what Kim Seok Joo said? That there was something between us?

461
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,089
Tell him he's dreaming!

462
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,650
I'd rather not have known.

463
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,420
You go tell him yourself.

464
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,889
Excuse me, you need to pay the fare.

465
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,630
Oh, right. Just a second.

466
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,799
Hey!

467
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,000
What are you doing? Hurry up.

468
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,169
Seriously.

469
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,940
What are you doing, just showing up here?

470
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,239
Keep the change.

471
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,080
- All right, thank you. - Thank you.

472
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,720
Are you even allowed to eat this?

473
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,560
I thought you were on a diet.

474
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,500
Oh, the shoot's over. I'm jobless right now.

475
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,529
But is the shop always this slow?

476
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,430
Well, since you're here, why don't you buy something?

477
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,100
Sung Je Yeon said you buy flowers all the time.

478
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,009
You're right.

479
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,140
She used to buy them for me most of the time.

480
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,780
Why did I take it all for granted?

481
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,179
Wait, you talked about that with Je Yeon?

482
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,090
I've been walking on eggshells, I couldn't even reach her.

483
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,890
Oh, Seok Joo gave me this.

484
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,560
His blind date gave this to him. Here, have some more.

485
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,359
Why are you telling me this?

486
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,800
It's not like I'm telling you specifically.

487
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,039
After all these years, the only thing I've improved at...

488
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,910
is reading people, not my acting.

489
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,969
A blind date?

490
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,539
I can't speak for your acting,

491
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,409
but you've surely gotten taller.

492
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,179
Are you mocking me because I've never won an acting award?

493
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,519
Why would I bother to mock you? Do you have a victim complex?

494
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,919
What does a retiree know?

495
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,549
I've been acting for ten years longer than you have.

496
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,149
Hey, I debuted first.

497
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,219
Look at you, talking so casually to your senior.

498
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,189
Aside from the legendary veterans, I'm basically the most senior actor.

499
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,300
How should I address you then, my esteemed senior?

500
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,099
You can talk down to me all you want.

501
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,869
Just please buy some flowers, customer.

502
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,870
How can you not buy a single thing? Unbelievable.

503
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
Here.

504
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,510
What?

505
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:44,980
Give this back to Kim Seok Joo when he comes by.

506
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,680
Oh, okay.

507
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
What?

508
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,899
What? Was I supposed to figure out a way to say no?

509
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,300
I don't know.

510
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,300
I said I don't know either! Gosh!

511
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,440
I'm just so confused today.

512
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,640
Can't you just go?

513
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,280
Seriously.

514
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,110
Fine, I'll go.

515
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,380
Can I borrow 50 dollars?

516
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,760
(Your checkup is scheduled on Wednesday)

517
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,600
Hey, what's with the face?

518
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,970
I said "borrow," not "have."

519
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:44,910
Welcome.

520
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,409
- Oh, what's that? - Squid.

521
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,310
- Thank you. Have a good day! - You too. Come again.

522
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,110
Excuse me, how much is this?

523
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,680
Four for ten dollars.

524
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,190
This is salty.

525
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,460
Here, drink some water.

526
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,170
Hey, what are you...

527
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,610
Take it easy today. Those tests were pretty strenuous.

528
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,210
Okay, I will.

529
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,720
Thank you.

530
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,380
Thanks for everything.

531
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,530
She's about to lose it.

532
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,360
Here you are.

533
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,530
Gosh.

534
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
Got it!

535
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,200
Here you go.

536
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,799
- Thank you. - Okay.

537
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,040
Say thank you.

538
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,369
Want some?

539
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,440
Can I?

540
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,079
It turned your teeth pink. Let me see.

541
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,080
Okay.

542
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,350
Yes, they are.

543
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,420
Sweet.

544
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,190
Go right!

545
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,860
Watch out for the glass!

546
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,229
My hand is stuck! Gosh.

547
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,329
Okay, I'm free. Seriously.

548
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,600
What did you buy?

549
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,899
Wait a minute.

550
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,900
What is it?

551
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:19,369
Didn't you just hear something outside?

552
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,370
What sound?

553
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:22,470
I thought your dad already passed by...

554
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,880
Get back! Hide!

555
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,180
Over there! Quick!

556
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,680
Hey, get down!

557
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,020
Quiet.

558
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,919
Okay, the coast is clear. Let's go.

559
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,019
Let's go.

560
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,690
No footsteps. Quietly...

561
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,630
Over there, hurry up!

562
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,500
Oh, gosh.

563
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,410
Gosh!

564
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,370
What?

565
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,040
(Sunwoo Hae)

566
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,650
What's this doing here?

567
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,240
What are you doing in the kid's room?

568
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:30,970
Well...

569
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,410
You scared me.

570
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,979
You just got here?

571
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,779
We were supposed to get breakfast this morning, remember?

572
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,249
I'm starving.

573
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,920
Okay, let me stash this real quick. Wait for me outside.

574
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,919
All right. Hide it well and come on out.

575
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Okay.

576
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,459
Gosh, that made me jump.

577
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,759
I guess Mom's off work now.

578
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,000
You really need to get your intel right.

579
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,170
Seriously, what kind of company makes its CEO pull an all-nighter?

580
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,300
Hey! My hand.

581
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,609
Just grab a bite and hit the sauna.

582
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,810
Seriously!

583
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,709
If you ever put in the wrong address for a delivery again, I swear...

584
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,910
I love you, brother.

585
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,019
Wait, why are we hiding again?

586
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,279
So what then?

587
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,450
Should we just march over and say hello?

588
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,960
- Just stay still. - Let's just stay put.

589
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,689
By the way, what were you hiding earlier?

590
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,990
Oh, an old photo album.

591
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,540
I was worried you'd be upset if you saw it...

592
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,040
I've been in a bad enough mood this whole time as it is.

593
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,940
Because you don't like Hae's mom.

594
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,810
Hae's mom's name was...

595
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,750
Mu Yeong, wasn't it? Jin Mu Yeong?

596
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,790
If only we hadn't gone to that backwater town back then,

597
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,390
my life never would have gotten tangled up with yours.

598
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,300
Are we really going to dredge up all this old stuff right now?

599
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,629
"Dredge up?"

600
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,939
The part where you dump women often and abandon your own kid?

601
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,539
We haven't even gotten to that part yet.

602
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,839
Come on.

603
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,510
That's pretty harsh for this early in the morning.

604
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,080
When you say things like that, it's genuinely upsetting.

605
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,879
It was a fated connection for its time.

606
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,679
Oh, "a fated connection for its time?"

607
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,180
That's a fancy way to put it.

608
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,249
Why didn't you wait for me back then?

609
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,719
Was Hae's mom that great?

610
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,819
Listen...

611
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,859
After you left for Seoul back then without a single word,

612
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,530
I had a really hard time, too.

613
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,899
I couldn't just wait for you forever...

614
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,600
and waste away in that seaside town.

615
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,400
But I came back to you in the end, didn't I?

616
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,869
You told me to come back if I was ever unhappy, so I did.

617
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,870
Come back?

618
00:31:41,871 --> 00:31:43,910
You never came back after what happened to his mother!

619
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,810
Oh, for goodness' sake.

620
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:53,520
You really don't hold anything back, do you?

621
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,390
Look, that was just a tragedy.

622
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,390
I needed comfort.

623
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,520
And you're not that kind of person for me.

624
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,700
Then what am I to you?

625
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,600
What exactly am I to you?

626
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,730
Do you even love me at all?

627
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,070
I wouldn't be here if I didn't love you.

628
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,340
So why on earth am I still in love with you?

629
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,270
Sometimes I just don't get it.

630
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,510
You still let your emotions get the best of you around me.

631
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,820
You just start yelling.

632
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,020
Being with me takes you back to when you were young, doesn't it?

633
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,220
Back when we were passionate.

634
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,230
You still haven't moved on from that time.

635
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,500
I'm going to stay somewhere else for a while.

636
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,930
Get back here!

637
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,070
Hey, Sunwoo Chan!

638
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,810
I'll finish moving this.

639
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,140
Go on inside.

640
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,120
You know...

641
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,419
He didn't just show up on his own. I asked him to...

642
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,620
come and help me with something.

643
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,530
I wasn't trying to ruin your mood by having him over.

644
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,530
Have you eaten?

645
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,800
- What about you? - Come on, I booked us breakfast.

646
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:51,460
Seriously, where on earth did I put it?

647
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,680
Oh, my gosh!

648
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,850
Good grief.

649
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,659
I don't know what she sees in him.

650
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,200
Why isn't she looking forward?

651
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,850
- Hello. - Oh, hello.

652
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,559
Here.

653
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,360
I had some extras again today.

654
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,060
Oh, here you go again.

655
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,159
You really don't have to.

656
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,960
You didn't let me pay for ice cream last time either.

657
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,029
If you keep doing this,

658
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,370
I'll have to stop accepting things from you.

659
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:12,610
They're going to wilt soon anyway, so please, don't worry about it.

660
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,140
Hey!

661
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,480
Yes?

662
00:36:17,481 --> 00:36:19,250
Well, I'll get going. Take care.

663
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,190
Gosh.

664
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,090
Is he just really shy?

665
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,560
When is he ever going to confess his feelings?

666
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,530
You don't get it?

667
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:34,160
He's giving them to every neighbour to hide that they're really for me.

668
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,830
He's not my type, though.

669
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,039
- Ouch. - Just toss the rest of the flowers.

670
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,540
Isn't it a hassle every single time?

671
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,110
You keep giving them away for free. Yes, that'll bring in customers.

672
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,989
And if you do something like that, I bet your hair will be ripped out.

673
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:57,990
I'd bet money on it.

674
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,120
Yes, you're right.

675
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,859
The thought of Sa Rang doing that really upsets me.

676
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,390
I'd rip all his hair out.

677
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,030
Sa Rang as in love? With whom?

678
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,569
- A boyfriend? - No.

679
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,639
No, it's just, you know...

680
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,210
A future love, I guess?

681
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,450
Our Nu Ri needs to find someone someday.

682
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,749
- I'm popular, you know. - Oh, really?

683
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,849
No, really, you have no idea.

684
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,990
Take that back. Right now.

685
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,010
Hey, you didn't say you were coming over today.

686
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,580
What?

687
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,349
Wait, how did you even find my place?

688
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,650
Pardon the intrusion.

689
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,590
What's this?

690
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,130
No, seriously. What brings you here all of a sudden?

691
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,830
Oh, this...

692
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,199
Since it's my first time here, this is for you.

693
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,529
- What? - And...

694
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,640
this is something to snack on during our review session later.

695
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,370
Since they're for a student, I made sure to get healthy options.

696
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,310
Why didn't I even think of that?

697
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,879
That's what I'm here for.

698
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,179
You're something else, you know?

699
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,719
You're so thoughtful and detailed. Not what I'd expect from you.

700
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,219
Must be in my nature.

701
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,220
Right!

702
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,119
Oh, I forgot to get coffee.

703
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,560
Don't worry, I was just about to brew some coffee.

704
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,930
Anyone watching would think they're a married couple with a kid.

705
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,110
Ouch, it's hot!

706
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,040
Hey, are you okay?

707
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,580
It's not hot.

708
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,250
What?

709
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,020
Why didn't it boil?

710
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:15,320
Hey, it's not even plugged in.

711
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,100
Why wasn't it plugged in?

712
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,630
Are you a dummy?

713
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,439
You...

714
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,009
- You should go. - What?

715
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,310
You being here...

716
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,909
I'm all nervous. Go home.

717
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,210
Go on.

718
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,050
Hurry up and go.

719
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,080
That was surprisingly cute.

720
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,890
Oh, what am I even saying?

721
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,230
Oh, that book...

722
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,369
Where did you get this?

723
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,899
It was really hard to track down.

724
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,740
It's been out of print for a long time.

725
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,139
An autograph...

726
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,540
Could you sign it for me?

727
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,250
An autograph...

728
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
Sure.

729
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,320
("Waegeum")

730
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,229
Here you go.

731
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,559
Gosh!

732
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,899
Gosh, this is incredible.

733
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,300
So, how did you end up submitting your debut novel?

734
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,670
I was eating ramen and using a book as a pot stand,

735
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,340
and I saw an ad for a writing contest in it.

736
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:40,280
It offered prize money if I won, so I sent in my manuscript.

737
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,249
- I kind of hate you right now. - Why?

738
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,779
It was the first thing you ever wrote?

739
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,179
And you didn't even enter the major contests?

740
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,320
I didn't even know those existed in the first place.

741
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,189
It's not like I ever wanted to become a novelist anyway.

742
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,759
Okay, now I really, really hate you.

743
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,960
Oh, come on.

744
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,059
By the way...

745
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,259
How long have you two been together?

746
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,330
Dating, I mean.

747
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,270
Was that too forward of me?

748
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,239
It's just that you look so good together.

749
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,439
We're just...

750
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,510
Yes, we're just friends.

751
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,109
The kind of friends who cringe when people say stuff like that.

752
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,550
- I see. - Just friends.

753
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,220
Right.

754
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:22,689
See? That's what I mean.

755
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,190
That gives me the chills.

756
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,859
Well, I'll be going.

757
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,289
And please tell the producer I said hello.

758
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,529
Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

759
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,890
Take care.

760
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,170
So...

761
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,940
So you came to suck up to the producer's daughter.

762
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,540
Well, a little of this, a little of that.

763
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,379
I'm going to take off.

764
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,710
I have to get back to the office.

765
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,580
Want a ride?

766
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,319
Someone's in a good mood.

767
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
Am I?

768
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:04,059
Meeting a fan has you on cloud nine, doesn't it?

769
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,330
You're half right, and half...

770
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,930
So, how far are you letting me take you?

771
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,240
To the ends of the earth?

772
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,369
This...

773
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:16,870
Is this really giving me a ride?

774
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,680
Well...

775
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,610
It is a little inappropriate.

776
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,550
I guess people aren't all that harsh on you after all.

777
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,449
What's that supposed to mean?

778
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,790
I'm talking about that student, Yu Eun Ji.

779
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,460
I was just...

780
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,130
in it for the money when I wrote it,

781
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,300
But thanks to her, it feels meaningful now.

782
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:43,870
Hey, but...

783
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,239
How do you think she even got her hands on that?

784
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,300
- Oh, you mean your first book? - Yes.

785
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,939
Hey, speaking of that.

786
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,880
"My Beloved Gorilla?" What kind of title is that?

787
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,679
I mean, seriously.

788
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,209
And you say, "I wish the world were a bit more beautiful?"

789
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,210
Unbelievable.

790
00:42:59,211 --> 00:43:00,950
You wish the world were more beautiful?

791
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,619
Who does? You?

792
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,990
You.

793
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,459
You're the one who wrote it.

794
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,460
I wrote that?

795
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:09,860
Seriously, all three were the same. Did you plagiarize it or something?

796
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,030
I don't know. I guess that's just how I was back then.

797
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,730
I don't remember.

798
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,430
Hey.

799
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,800
Just ask me for it.

800
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,840
I never have anyone in the passenger seat anyway.

801
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,090
You get to the office safely.

802
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,330
I'm going to take off from here.

803
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:51,030
This whole setup is pretty inefficient, don't you think?

804
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,200
You said you have to go back, so I can't ask you to hang out.

805
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,310
But I don't want to see you go.

806
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,810
Je Yeon!

807
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,510
What? Oh my gosh!

808
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,490
Oh, Sang Yeop.

809
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,689
Since when are we so casual?

810
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,930
I just like calling you that more than "Team Leader."

811
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,129
Still, people might get the wrong idea.

812
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,099
It wouldn't hurt to be careful, right?

813
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,200
The wrong idea?

814
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,239
Then who's this?

815
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,100
I saw him getting out of your car.

816
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,739
Don't tell me...

817
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,740
Your boyfriend?

818
00:44:32,741 --> 00:44:35,080
No! It's not like that.

819
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:39,720
He's just...

820
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:43,850
a cast member.

821
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,660
Oh, the guy who's on that show with Tae Rin these days.

822
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,529
Hi, I'm Lee Sang Yeop.

823
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,829
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

824
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,260
Oh, it's fine.

825
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,099
By the way, did you do something different with your hair?

826
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,229
What?

827
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,739
Oh, no, my hair...

828
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,969
It looks really good.

829
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:03,570
What?

830
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,310
Well, this cast member will be on his way.

831
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,880
- Well, take care. - You head on in.

832
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,919
Are you heading to the office?

833
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,520
Yeah, the director summoned me about my military enlistment.

834
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,489
We have to set a date.

835
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:20,790
I see.

836
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,859
If you got your draft notice, you should hurry up and enlist.

837
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,890
You have to fulfil your duty to your country, don't you?

838
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,060
Go be a lifer for all I care.

839
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,700
Sir.

840
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:37,439
So...

841
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,439
The original author of "World Made of Ash."

842
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,179
We're coordinating a meeting date with him.

843
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,110
So I have to see that ugly face again.

844
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,780
Fine, whatever.

845
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:47,950
I'm putting you on leave. Go rest.

846
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,990
It's a "vacation," if you catch my drift.

847
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,020
Han Dong Jun is on suspension too, starting today.

848
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,690
For causing a scene at the company,

849
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,429
I'm sorry.

850
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,359
My personal feelings aside,

851
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,300
the way you threw a lifeline to everyone involved...

852
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,200
That was the right thing you did.

853
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,940
But he threw the first punch.

854
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,650
Six years.

855
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,890
My 1st vacation in 6 years. No...

856
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:25,990
More like a suspension, I guess?

857
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,270
This is lasting a long time.

858
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,649
Hello! I'm the new hire starting today.

859
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:55,949
I'm Choi Gi Ppeum!

860
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,949
I'm the only one here. You don't have to be so loud.

861
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:59,960
Got it!

862
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,990
The chairs haven't arrived yet.

863
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:06,430
Just grab an unopened box from over there and take a seat.

864
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,600
It's not like I'm standing here to look cool or anything.

865
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,219
Oh, Tae Rin would be perfect for this.

866
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,319
She'd know just how to sell a line like this.

867
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,919
All done.

868
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,590
What's next?

869
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,330
This newbie is clueless.

870
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,230
Oh, should I go get some coffee?

871
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,800
Now that's a great idea.

872
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,039
And get something for yourself too, if you'd like, Gi Ppeum.

873
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,040
Okay.

874
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,010
Grab a power strip, too.

875
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,580
Head!

876
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,049
No stray thoughts!

877
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,219
I'm trying not to!

878
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,759
Focus.

879
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,860
Last one!

880
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:12,930
Head!

881
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,110
What?

882
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,080
What are you doing here?

883
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:33,880
Beats me.

884
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:38,990
Gosh.

885
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,490
How much are you going to watch?

886
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:46,560
Let's see.

887
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,060
I...

888
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,040
As much as I want.

889
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,940
- Great work! - Great work!

890
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,380
Great work, everyone!

891
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,390
Oh, no...

892
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,160
Oh, come on.

893
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,489
Who snores during meditation?

894
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:19,659
I didn't say anything weird, did I?

895
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,259
I wasn't talking in my sleep, was I?

896
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,699
Just stop coming here.

897
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,399
How many times is that just this week?

898
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,440
We're all out of pain relief patches at the dojang because of you.

899
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,070
Unbelievable.

900
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,040
Maybe my mind is wandering because I'm not busy.

901
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,650
Yes, I'll make it nice and full. Thank you. Bye.

902
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,280
Okay.

903
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,190
Hi.

904
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,559
What's with the look?

905
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,290
It feels like I've been seeing you a lot lately.

906
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,060
Have we?

907
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,400
Seems like the plants change spots a lot, too.

908
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,200
That?

909
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,469
If a plant is in one spot too long, people think it's not selling well.

910
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,940
How would you know that? What, are you a mind reader?

911
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,810
Then go ahead and try reading my mind.

912
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,110
- Why would I? - Good point.

913
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,320
What was that about?

914
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:24,130
What did you do back when you got suspended?

915
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,190
What?

916
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:30,830
I mean, the vice principal suspended you, remember?

917
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,530
Kept you out of school for a week.

918
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:36,970
Oh, right.

919
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:39,409
But why bring that up now?

920
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:40,709
It's not exactly something to be proud of.

921
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:43,710
Because I just got hit with something similar.

922
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,450
I earned money.

923
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,749
Took on more construction jobs.

924
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,450
And did some package loading and unloading, too.

925
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,359
Oh, that place.

926
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,259
There was this one place with an amazing home-style meal.

927
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,760
I wonder if it's still around.

928
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,030
Did you go there often back then?

929
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:04,700
Not really.

930
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:09,000
If I stopped to eat, that meant less time to sleep.

931
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,439
That day, after my shift, I was about to crash,

932
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,279
but I was afraid I wouldn't wake up in time.

933
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,710
And it was my first day at my new school.

934
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:19,880
I basically pulled an all-nighter and got on the bus...

935
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,250
and, of course, I fell asleep on it.

936
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,390
So you just kept sleeping after you got here?

937
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,400
So you were watching me the whole time?

938
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,600
I was the class president.

939
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:43,240
I was trying to set an example. Imagine how annoying it was for me.

940
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,640
Gosh.

941
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,279
I need to get back to work. Will you keep distracting me?

942
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,479
What are you doing after this?

943
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,019
I've got a part-time shift at Geon No's.

944
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,419
And after that?

945
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,750
Go home and sleep, of course.

946
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,750
I see.

947
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,490
That suspension must have really hit you hard.

948
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,160
You've kind of lost it, haven't you?

949
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:06,800
Tell me about it.

950
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,870
Why am I even here?

951
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,609
Why are you looking at me like that?

952
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,140
How am I looking at you?

953
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,190
Why do this after you've rejected me?

954
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,520
Sung Je Yeon, karma will get you, you hear me?

955
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,530
Trust me, it already got me.

956
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,270
Yes, Director.

957
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,469
Go ahead. What is it?

958
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:54,279
I just hired a new person. What should I have him do?

959
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,349
Well, the company rules, document templates,

960
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:59,580
the company car policy... And stuff like that, you know.

961
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,149
What about experience? How many years does he have?

962
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,990
Experience? None.

963
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,560
Apparently, he just got back in the country.

964
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:08,889
I'm not even sure if he's graduated.

965
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:11,490
But you're supposed to hire someone with experience...

966
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,070
Excuse me. One bouquet, please.

967
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,840
What's the occasion?

968
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,909
You've never bought flowers before.

969
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:26,710
A mentor who was very special to me switched companies,

970
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,579
and it seems like they could use a visit.

971
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,280
Trying to make an impression?

972
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,110
Man or woman?

973
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,849
Why does that matter?

974
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:41,220
How long will it take? Are you going straight there now?

975
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,090
What, are you sad to see me go?

976
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,530
I ask all my customers the same thing.

977
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,930
Would you like a card to go with that, ma'am?

978
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,900
A woman, 30 minutes, going straight there. No card.

979
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,320
Gosh.

980
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:15,120
That wasn't like me.

981
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,900
All right. See you then, Mr. Accountant.

982
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,700
Take care.

983
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,810
Are you Ms. Bang Han Na?

984
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,780
Here.

985
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:40,320
Whatever the occasion, congratulations.

986
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,849
You know, this is the first time I've ever bought a bouquet myself.

987
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,050
Oh, my.

988
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,019
Where is it? Is this the place?

989
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,620
Gosh, this place is incredible.

990
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,159
What? Mo Tae Rin?

991
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,599
What are you doing here?

992
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,860
Hey there.

993
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,029
I'm the one who snuck her over.

994
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,229
You!

995
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:02,500
You traitors!

996
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,790
All that talk about conviction and faith...

997
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,930
You left spouting all those lofty words.

998
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,859
So, where's the new hire manual I asked for?

999
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,300
I emailed it to you.

1000
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,129
You know I don't give this manual out to just anyone, right?

1001
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,340
You're a lifesaver. Thanks.

1002
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:39,610
So, how is it being the first guest at "The New Utopia?"

1003
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:44,609
What about this is so "utopian?"

1004
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:45,950
You said it yourself.

1005
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:48,079
Instead of a company you have to work at,

1006
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:51,219
the point is to build one that people want to work at.

1007
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:52,549
Well...

1008
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,719
The company name is a little...

1009
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,359
I never thought it was strange, but...

1010
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,330
It does sound a bit like a cult, doesn't it?

1011
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:05,900
You're laughing? You think this is funny?

1012
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:08,539
You should've run this by me...

1013
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,369
if you were going to join a company like this!

1014
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:12,210
What do you mean, "a company like this?"

1015
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,010
Oh, right.

1016
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,440
Tae Rin.

1017
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:19,610
Take a look.

1018
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,620
If you like it, I'll do what it takes to land it.

1019
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,550
"Kongjwi and Patjwi?"

1020
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,759
I worked so hard to get you into modern dramas,

1021
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,259
and they want to stick her back in the Joseon era? Are you for real?

1022
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,759
Actually, it's a modern crime drama.

1023
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,460
When did you get so quick to jump to conclusions?

1024
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,430
Snack delivery!

1025
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:40,940
- Oh, is he... - A celebrity.

1026
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,439
Gosh, a real celebrity.

1027
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,110
Hello.

1028
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,579
Say hi. This is our actress, Mo Tae Rin.

1029
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,950
And my former co-worker, Sung Je Yeon.

1030
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:52,979
It's nice to meet you.

1031
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,549
Get out while you still can.

1032
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:55,979
You're dead set on being a manager?

1033
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,319
What are you talking about...

1034
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,950
to a top talent from the prestigious University of Hong Kong?

1035
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,489
I'm Choi Gi Ppeum.

1036
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:04,229
This was the only place that offered me a job right away.

1037
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:05,589
Around here,

1038
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,099
they value driving skills more than your education.

1039
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,260
What a shame.

1040
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,800
Let me give you a hand.

1041
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:16,639
Why is this here?

1042
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,909
Because it looked like it belonged there.

1043
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,109
It just felt right.

1044
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:21,279
More like you didn't know how to throw it out!

1045
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,449
Schedule a pickup, add a sticker, and they'll come get it.

1046
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:25,749
So...

1047
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,320
Should I look into a cleaning service, too?

1048
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,149
First, we should probably ask the building management office.

1049
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:34,320
All right, then, Gi Ppeum, you've got your first task.

1050
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,690
I'll go check with the management office.

1051
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,190
- Go ahead. - Okay.

1052
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:46,669
He reminds you of when you were a rookie, doesn't he?

1053
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:49,339
No, I was way quicker on the uptake.

1054
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,670
Oh, come on.

1055
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,519
I threw in a few extra stems.

1056
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,550
Tell them we'd love to have their business again.

1057
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,090
I wonder if he only sent them for the business.

1058
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,690
Ms. Bang Han Na sent flowers.

1059
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:12,089
Director.

1060
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:14,899
That flower delivery, the one from when Tae Rin was on the radio...

1061
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,799
The one you sent.

1062
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,229
By any chance,

1063
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:20,469
did you order from that shop on purpose?

1064
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:22,000
What shop? I don't know. Why?

1065
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:25,870
Fate is a funny thing.

1066
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,040
So cruel, isn't it?

1067
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:36,180
Why do I feel like I'm really being punished?

1068
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:40,520
Normally,

1069
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,360
I would've shaken it off after whining about being punished.

1070
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,260
Hey.

1071
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,600
Who are you talking to? You're kind of creeping me out.

1072
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,529
That's what I'm saying.

1073
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,499
I couldn't say a thing back.

1074
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,640
Why is she being so weird?

1075
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,669
But the shaman said there was nothing here.

1076
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:00,909
Oh, what...

1077
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:04,250
Hey, stop it! That's actually scary!

1078
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:06,049
And another thing.

1079
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:09,150
Didn't I tell you not to waste money on that shaman?

1080
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:10,850
She was wrong about every single thing.

1081
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:18,160
Then it must be here.

1082
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,460
Hey, are you okay?

1083
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:25,970
Let me see.

1084
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:27,870
Are you hurt?

1085
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:31,540
Yes, I'm fine.

1086
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:36,479
- Thank goodness it's shatter proof. - I'm sorry.

1087
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,950
No, it's fine, really.

1088
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:55,760
(Please come to the hospital for the checkup results.)

1089
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:03,770
Eight, nine, one hundred.

1090
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:08,779
One, two, three, four.

1091
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,510
I'd forgotten for so long...

1092
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,119
what it feels like to have feelings for someone.

1093
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,620
How do you "vanish into blackness?"

1094
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,320
Is that some kind of poem?

1095
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,620
Hi.

1096
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:20,250
Hello.

1097
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,170
I think I blew it.

1098
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:52,210
Happy birthday, Mom.

1099
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,790
I'm coming to see you tomorrow.

1100
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,250
Can I tell her about you?

1101
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:04,429
Hey, why even ask?

1102
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,190
Of course, you should tell her.

1103
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,060
What are you going to tell her?

1104
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:11,570
I'm not telling.

1105
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:15,740
Mom.

1106
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:18,510
You...

1107
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,640
will like her too.

1108
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:25,410
Yes.

1109
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:46,830
And you haven't had any related symptoms?

1110
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,640
Like unusual fatigue...

1111
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,170
or any loss of sensation?

1112
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:56,440
I'm prescribing a new medication for you to take along with it.

1113
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:59,850
The thing is, it's not covered by insurance...

1114
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,350
Am I dying?

1115
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:07,050
Amyloidosis is a very difficult and tricky disease.

1116
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,120
There aren't many cases in Korea either.

1117
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:11,660
When am I going to die?

1118
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,060
Well, to put it bluntly,

1119
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,230
we don't know if it'll be tomorrow or ten years from now.

1120
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:20,900
I know how agonizing that must be.

1121
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:32,250
If I...

1122
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,620
ever got the chance to meet my 19-year-old self,

1123
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:39,820
then...

1124
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:43,790
I'd give her some major spoilers about the rest of my life.

1125
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,459
"Have fun while you still can."

1126
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,030
"This is what you should invest in."

1127
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:52,230
"And dodge the day you get slapped."

1128
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:56,370
What about you?

1129
01:03:57,970 --> 01:03:58,970
Me?

1130
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:01,480
Well...

1131
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:04,250
I'd probably just buy him a meal.

1132
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:07,920
Hey, that makes me sound so shallow.

1133
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,990
Come on, give him some spoilers too.

1134
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,920
"At the end of the day,"

1135
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,560
"life is one big gamble."

1136
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,630
Good opening.

1137
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,069
I'm not sure about the rest, though.

1138
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:29,599
What's he going to think when he hears that?

1139
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,940
Come on, dig a little deeper.

1140
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:37,880
"Since it's a gamble,"

1141
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,520
"some days you'll win an insane amount."

1142
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:50,630
"And on other days,"

1143
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,890
"you'll get completely wiped out."

1144
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:59,930
(Congratulations on your graduation.)

1145
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:19,320
(Sung Je Yeon)

1146
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,940
Delivery for 505 in Building 102.

1147
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:44,380
Oh, this looks great.

1148
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,579
- Thanks. - Thank you. Take care.

1149
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,950
(Rose, 1 dollar each)

1150
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:52,950
"For you, most days..."

1151
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,420
"will probably be about losing a lot..."

1152
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,700
"and only winning a little.'

1153
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,300
"But even so,"

1154
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,230
"you're not going to bet on misfortune."

1155
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:14,010
Not the you...

1156
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,840
that I know.

1157
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,740
What?

1158
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,970
What did you tell your mom about me?

1159
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:48,980
Did you badmouth me?

1160
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,850
- What? - Well...

1161
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,819
Bet you're wondering why I'm here.

1162
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:56,820
Yes.

1163
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,419
Getting excited?

1164
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:00,420
You have to be. I know you are.

1165
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,940
I...

1166
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:22,480
I like you.

1167
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:28,620
I see.

1168
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:33,250
Now? Of all times?

1169
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,320
Gosh.

1170
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,090
Am I...

1171
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,560
way too late?

1172
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,410
I guess I'm a real jerk.

1173
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,250
I shouldn't feel this good.

1174
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,930
But the world

1175
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,640
looks kind of beautiful right now.

1176
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,550
(My Youth)

1177
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:40,149
Let's make him think about just you.

1178
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:42,480
You have to set the mood first!

1179
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:43,650
What are you trying to do?

1180
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:45,790
I have a plan.

1181
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,690
What did you want to be, Tae Rin?

1182
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,360
Hae wrote a book?

1183
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:54,830
I'm going to die.

1184
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:56,860
If this happens again,

1185
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:00,270
the end will be like this.

1186
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,970
Why are you doing this to me?

1187
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:08,610
Let's stop seeing each other.

1188
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:11,110
To you,

1189
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:15,980
I mean just that much.
