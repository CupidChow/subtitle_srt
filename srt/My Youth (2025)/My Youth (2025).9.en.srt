(Chun Woo Hee)

00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,510
(Lee Joo Myung)

(My Youth)

6
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,160
(Episode 9)

7
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,820
The person you have called...

8
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,190
Hey, Taxi!

9
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,980
Sir, you dropped your phone.

10
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,350
Thank you.

11
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,350
(Missed Call, Sung Je Yeon)

12
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,329
Excuse me...

13
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,299
I was told Sung Je Yeon was here.

14
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,869
Okay, let me check. Please wait over there.

15
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,870
Okay.

16
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:12,739
Are you Sung Je Yeon's guardian?

17
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,739
- We spoke on the phone, right? - Oh, yes, that's right.

18
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,139
How is Je Yeon? Is she okay?

19
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,239
She has acute appendicitis and needs to go into surgery.

20
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,409
This way, please.

21
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,510
Okay.

22
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,809
What a relief.

23
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,410
Oh, what a relief.

24
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,750
Go away. I can't stand the sight of you.

25
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,090
Are you okay?

26
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,019
Should I get the doctor?

27
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,030
No, it's fine. I just had a painkiller.

28
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,970
Why are you crying?

29
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,240
I'm sorry, Je Yeon.

30
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,080
It's all my fault.

31
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,450
I was so worried something had happened to you.

32
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,650
I was losing my mind.

33
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,590
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,689
I'm sorry I got mad.

35
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,200
You and your wild imagination. What were you picturing this time?

36
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,560
I...

37
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,570
I'm not who you think I am.

38
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,110
I can't be that person.

39
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,380
"But even so,"

40
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,310
"you're not going to bet on misfortune."

41
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,310
Not the you...

42
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,350
that I know.

43
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,290
But I always bet on the worst outcome.

44
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,420
Like an idiot.

45
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,230
I'm the one who can't live without you.

46
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,970
Then just be the person I know you are.

47
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,140
Be the person that I know.

48
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,140
Where have you gone?

49
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,850
Always leaving me...

50
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,850
behind.

51
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,520
If you're not going to take me with you,

52
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,360
come back.

53
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,890
- Come back, and... - I'll stay with you.

54
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,780
I want to be with you.

55
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,160
Promise.

56
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,430
Sealed.

57
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,670
Copied.

58
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,779
I'll go get the doctor.

59
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,820
No. Don't go.

60
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,580
Don't go. Just stay here.

61
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,650
Stay with me.

62
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,459
Did the flower shop go out of business or something?

63
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,659
Don't you know anything?

64
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,400
Instead of worrying about that, redo this problem.

65
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,439
I have my practical exam for the photography department soon.

66
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,039
The bus ride is over two hours one way.

67
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,079
I have to rent and carry the camera, lenses, and all this other gear.

68
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,939
Just ask Hae to give you a ride.

69
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,279
It's a secret from Hae until after I pass the exam.

70
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,949
If the first and last digits are the same...

71
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,749
Besides, you're supposed to be my college prep tutor.

72
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,989
I do everything you say, but my scores aren't improving.

73
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,090
Why are you blaming me when you're the one who's slow?

74
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,029
- What? - You got your brains from your mom,

75
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,660
so it must be real nice for you.

76
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,369
How is she doing these days?

77
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,430
Is she well?

78
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,110
Why are you asking about Mom? You two don't share any memories.

79
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,840
Hey, kid. You can't just touch anything here.

80
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,349
It's a camera. For taking pictures.

81
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,450
It's Chan's.

82
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,620
You're pretty.

83
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,550
This kid's got good taste.

84
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,919
Want to try taking a picture?

85
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,590
Yes, please.

86
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,630
All right.

87
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,800
Just press this round button here.

88
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,470
See anything?

89
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,559
The camera I use now? She's the one who gave it to me.

90
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,959
That's why I like her.

91
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,259
It's like we have a special memory, you know?

92
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,559
Gosh, that woman is something else.

93
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,699
She wouldn't even acknowledge me for bringing you home.

94
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,499
So you two were all chummy behind my back?

95
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,969
Must be nice. Why don't you ask her for a ride?

96
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,039
You're so petty.

97
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,670
I just want to do well on my exam. All I'm asking for is a ride.

98
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,010
Okay, fine.

99
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,849
I'll take care of it. I'll give you a ride, so don't...

100
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,149
Don't worry.

101
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,250
- You promise? - I said I would.

102
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,159
(Sunwoo Hae)

103
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,190
Hey.

104
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,390
When are you getting here? Hurry up.

105
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,760
I can't make it home tonight.

106
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,569
Yes, something just came up.

107
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,300
Could you let Nu Ri know?

108
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,739
And make sure she eats, too.

109
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,410
For a couple of days.

110
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,869
Okay, I have to go.

111
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,109
Seriously...

112
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,009
He's telling you to feed a grown-up. How embarrassing.

113
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,409
I'm almost twenty myself.

114
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,779
Tell me about it.

115
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,279
Especially coming from him. He's always been responsible.

116
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,119
But he always treats us like we're helpless kids, right?

117
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,320
And now he's staying out all night?

118
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,940
You've had a rough time.

119
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,840
Yes.

120
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Right.

121
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,219
Shouldn't you call your office?

122
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,390
Oh, right. Work.

123
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,590
You have to step down as a manager.

124
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,390
I'm on leave anyway.

125
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,229
You should head back so you're not late.

126
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,659
And take the chair with you.

127
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,729
I'm supposed to be on my best behavior.

128
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,970
I can't just leave you here when you're sick.

129
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,769
I'll be here to take care of you until you're discharged.

130
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,280
Oh, I couldn't ask you to do that.

131
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,649
So you're really not going?

132
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,250
Nope. I'm staying right here with you.

133
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,820
And do what?

134
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,790
What would you like?

135
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,560
Stroke my hair like you did before.

136
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,970
Get some more sleep.

137
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,490
What?

138
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,690
Hey.

139
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,160
What are you doing here so late at night?

140
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,600
Oh, I must have fallen asleep...

141
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,970
Perfect timing.

142
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,310
Is there anything you want?

143
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,880
Or anything you need?

144
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,710
I feel I asked you to pull strings and came empty-handed.

145
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,420
So I thought I'd get you something to sweeten the deal.

146
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,289
You might as well just threaten me. Or give me an ultimatum.

147
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,390
That's your specialty, isn't it?

148
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,659
Think of it as a recruitment offer and consider it.

149
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,859
You can start at the bottom and learn the ropes.

150
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,370
What do you even see in me?

151
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,899
What makes you trust me?

152
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,870
If I can't trust you, my whole life has been a failure.

153
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,369
The success or failure of your own life?

154
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,279
I thought you weren't the type to stake that on your own kid.

155
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,110
Oh, you caught me.

156
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,880
Maybe I had one too many.

157
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,459
I understand everything you're saying, sir.

158
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,960
That's the kind of choice a CEO has to make.

159
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,660
Is your generation always...

160
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,370
so eager to be "understanding?"

161
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,799
Why can't you just do what you're told?

162
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,969
So I can keep you by my side.

163
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,909
You already have one of those. Someone who does exactly as told.

164
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,379
Who? Chan?

165
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,050
Gosh! Hardly.

166
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,579
So what if he does what he's told?

167
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,050
He has to want to be here.

168
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,390
Did something happen?

169
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,559
I needed comfort.

170
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,460
And you're not that kind of person for me.

171
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,530
Am I really...

172
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,130
the problem?

173
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,299
I don't want anything.

174
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,640
I need a favor.

175
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,170
A student has a practical exam.

176
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,840
It's a four-hour round trip by bus.

177
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,710
If you do this for me, I'll consider it.

178
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,979
I'm serious.

179
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,479
- But... - I don't have a license.

180
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,890
So please, give her a ride.

181
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,659
Seriously? At your age...

182
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,729
- Ouch! - Then why'd you even buy a car?

183
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,729
I thought I'd get my license right away.

184
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,059
Unbelievable.

185
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,660
I know you're my son, but honestly...

186
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,030
Wait, what's all this about a student?

187
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,369
- He ran away from home? - Yes.

188
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,540
Then as of right now, I'm running away too.

189
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,449
I'm going to crash at Min Kyung's for now.

190
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,489
I'll still go to school, but I'll ignore Sunwoo Hae's calls.

191
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,520
Right. If your teacher calls him, he'll find out you ran away.

192
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,419
Wait, isn't getting caught kind of the point?

193
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,030
I've never even imagined living with anyone but him.

194
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,060
But he's even sleeping over?

195
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,500
Take your time.

196
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,739
Sa Rang!

197
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,300
Hey! Hey, Choi Gi Ppeum!

198
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,939
The house is a pigsty now that you're gone.

199
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,479
Then clean it up, you pig.

200
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,209
Did you manage to sneak the suit out past Mom?

201
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,409
Yes.

202
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,549
- Hello. - Hello.

203
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,819
- Choi Gi Ppeum. - Yes?

204
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,020
Can I borrow some money?

205
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,749
Seriously...

206
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,890
I'm still crashing at my friend's place.

207
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,160
I actually already took some out for you.

208
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,690
Thanks.

209
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:16,359
I'm actually here on an errand for the director.

210
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,559
- I'm heading out. - Okay.

211
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,260
- Enjoy your meal. - Thanks.

212
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,769
Hello.

213
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,240
- I'm here to pick up a takeout. - So why'd he get kicked out?

214
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
Well...

215
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,509
He took a leave from the college he worked so hard for and came back.

216
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,379
Said something about how studying "wasn't his path."

217
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,250
That sounds like my brother.

218
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,110
- Oh, right. - Bye.

219
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,259
Since I don't have a license,

220
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,560
I got that lady you have all those memories with.

221
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,230
Let her know the schedule.

222
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,700
So you don't have a license.

223
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,130
That lady is so cool.

224
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,369
But it'll be kind of awkward if it's just me and her.

225
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,740
Then just ask Seok Joo to go with you.

226
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,110
Well, look at you, Choi Sa Rang. So smart.

227
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,580
Are you sure you left the passport here?

228
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,480
It's not here.

229
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,320
Gosh, where could it be then?

230
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,450
You think Je Yeon has it?

231
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,090
That must be it.

232
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,990
She's probably holding onto it so you can't go anywhere.

233
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,160
Excuse me? Is anyone here?

234
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,889
Well, look who it is.

235
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,530
Hurry up and go to your workout.

236
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,230
Hello.

237
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,470
What on earth happened to Je Yeon?

238
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,110
My goodness, appendicitis?

239
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,940
Oh, where are my manners? Here's my card.

240
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,509
I parked the car where you asked.

241
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,779
So, are you moving the chairs now?

242
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,880
- Oh, yes. - Yes.

243
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,649
I really enjoyed your show.

244
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,090
I read the article, too.

245
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,019
That the author of "World Made of Ash..."

246
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,429
is Bebop.

247
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,590
Oh, right.

248
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,930
I'm Bang Han Na.

249
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,760
Oh, hello.

250
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,540
Mr. Jin Mu Yeong?

251
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,300
Yes.

252
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,309
I saw the "World Made of Ash" movies,

253
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,770
and I transcribed the whole book by hand.

254
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,909
Its prose is dark and cynical, but...

255
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,680
the underlying message itself is actually so warm, and...

256
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,480
Well...

257
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,979
Did I do that?

258
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,689
In true fantasy, the world-building can't just be background setting.

259
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,520
It has to comprehensively embody the author's intent...

260
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,790
Could I get a handshake?

261
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,060
Oh, sure.

262
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,729
I'm glad you enjoyed it. Thank you.

263
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,929
- Yes. - But who...

264
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,029
This is my colleague, Choi Gi Ppeum.

265
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,839
- Oh, nice to meet you. - Yes.

266
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,569
Now that the fan meet is over, should we go move those chairs?

267
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,639
Oh, right.

268
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,310
How it explores worldly desires while keeping a moral line...

269
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,750
The intricate world-building...

270
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,250
That's enough, Gi Ppeum.

271
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,449
Have you eaten?

272
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,919
We're about to eat. Would you like to join us?

273
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,119
Oh, no, thank you.

274
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,460
I'll just help you with the chairs and be on my way.

275
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,600
Excuse me, but...

276
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,930
are the rights to your other novels available?

277
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,199
This industry is all about the IP,

278
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,839
and you've already had one book adapted.

279
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,870
Plus, you clearly have a dedicated fanbase.

280
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,109
So, regarding the rights,

281
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,779
I'd love to discuss it with you sometime.

282
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,949
But I don't really know much about that business.

283
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,050
I do.

284
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,720
I'll visit your flower shop to buy a plant.

285
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,720
Could I just have a cup of tea, please?

286
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,760
Of course.

287
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,170
I'm home.

288
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,670
Oh, you're back?

289
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,469
Hey.

290
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,740
How many times do I have to say perilla oil is better than sesame?

291
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,020
(Sesame oil)

292
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,300
Give it here.

293
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,200
Hey!

294
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,669
Didn't I tell you specifically to use perilla oil for this?

295
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,309
Nu Ri likes sesame oil more.

296
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,839
Oh, come on!

297
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,140
Did you two get in a fight?

298
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,380
She seemed really ticked off.

299
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,550
No, her birth mother showed up.

300
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,880
And I...

301
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,389
told her she should go live with her.

302
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,660
What? Why are you just telling me this now?

303
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,729
You didn't even talk to me about it?

304
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,700
I wasn't thinking straight.

305
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,129
I'm going to fix it.

306
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,769
I thought I played a part in raising Nu Ri, too.

307
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,099
Oh, please.

308
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,439
With grades like hers? What part did you play in that?

309
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,539
What?

310
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,709
Look at me right now. I'm the one who took half a day off...

311
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,809
to come here and clean this mess. Who's doing that?

312
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,810
Me.

313
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,449
I swear...

314
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,650
You always act like you're carrying the whole burden.

315
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,150
Always looking for credit.

316
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,659
You got paid for tutoring her every single time, right?

317
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,489
You said that was for my travel expenses.

318
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,489
Look who's talking about taking credit.

319
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,860
Just get the seasoning right.

320
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,660
It's salty!

321
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,670
Gosh. The nerve.

322
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,709
Nu Ri.

323
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,520
So, I've been thinking.

324
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,390
Why'd you run away from home?

325
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,390
To make a point, right?

326
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,860
Exactly.

327
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,819
To show them just how hurt and angry I am.

328
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,759
But your brother's busy right now.

329
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,759
Wouldn't it be more effective when he has time?

330
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,960
So you'd have his full attention.

331
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,329
So how about you go home for today,

332
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,599
and we'll make your point next time? After your exams.

333
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,700
Okay?

334
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,439
Nu Ri, what do you say?

335
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,940
Well?

336
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,339
Oh, come on. What was that?

337
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,880
You're unbelievable.

338
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,280
Thanks, Sa Rang.

339
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,020
All right, let's get back to studying.

340
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,690
I'll take you home after you finish your online lecture.

341
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,189
Okay.

342
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,260
I'm just going to run to the bathroom.

343
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,100
This is your chance to get on her brother's good side.

344
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,939
(Send to Start of Spring)

345
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,100
(Hello.)

346
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,410
(Last episode airs now!)

347
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,890
Is that your phone going off?

348
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,320
What?

349
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,789
Mine?

350
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,320
Sounds like it.

351
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,330
I see.

352
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,330
The flower shop's social media.

353
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,740
We're closed, but alerts won't stop. I'll be quick.

354
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,409
Hello. I'm Choi Sa Rang, Nu Ri's friend.

355
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,909
We met the other day.

356
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,609
Nu Ri's with me right now, so please don't worry.

357
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,109
I'll make sure she gets home safely.

358
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,949
I swear, these two...

359
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,950
What is it?

360
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,550
Oh, is that her tall friend?

361
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,690
Yes.

362
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,389
He is really tall.

363
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,490
Yes.

364
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,560
Wait, how do you know him?

365
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,169
Well...

366
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,639
- In front of your house... - In front of our house?

367
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,570
No, I mean, not at the house. I just ran into him by chance.

368
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,780
I see.

369
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,649
You kept this from me?

370
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,680
No, I...

371
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,279
It's your sister's private life.

372
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,479
Unbelievable.

373
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,890
You're getting pretty bold, aren't you?

374
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,690
No, look, it's my sister's private life, so...

375
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,100
Aren't you hungry?

376
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,040
- Should I order some ramyeon? - Let's break up.

377
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,470
What?

378
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,609
Did you forget I also help manage the flower shop's account?

379
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,939
I can't stand guys who go behind my back.

380
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,979
No, that's not it. Nu Ri, I...

381
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,279
Nu Ri, I was wrong.

382
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,479
I was just worried he'd be worried.

383
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,650
Nu Ri, I'm sorry!

384
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,819
I can't believe I missed the premiere.

385
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,160
And it's already the finale.

386
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,660
Why aren't you watching the show when you're in it?

387
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,669
The show itself just wasn't that important to me.

388
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,170
Aren't you curious how you came across?

389
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,939
How could you not watch it?

390
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,440
I told you.

391
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,510
Just seeing you a few more times was enough for me.

392
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,280
I thought I might get to see you a few more times.

393
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,280
That was a big reason I agreed to do the show.

394
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,550
Was that...

395
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,020
for real?

396
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,029
Seriously, what do you take me for?

397
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,199
People will say anything to win someone over.

398
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,359
Hey, it's not like it worked on you.

399
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,730
You turned me down flat, so what are you even talking about?

400
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,799
Let's just call a truce...

401
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,400
and focus on the show.

402
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,990
Thank you.

403
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,790
For what?

404
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,390
For showing that no matter what I was like before,

405
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,430
I'm now a decent person,

406
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,540
living life to the fullest,

407
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,980
and surrounded by good people.

408
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,190
I wish there is a TV where your mom is.

409
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,859
Yes, that would be nice.

410
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,870
Yes.

411
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,970
I saw there was a scene where you wrote a letter.

412
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,200
Were you writing to your mom?

413
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,110
Hey, what? What is it?

414
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,219
You...

415
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,219
That was me writing a letter to myself.

416
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,890
You weren't paying attention, were you?

417
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,959
I was too busy focusing on the present.

418
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,390
Oh, were you now?

419
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,930
Sung Je Yeon.

420
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,740
Hey.

421
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,680
What?

422
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,060
Is a guy like me okay for you?

423
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,930
It's not that I don't have those pathetic thoughts, but...

424
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,210
being apart from you...

425
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,910
I don't think I can go through that again.

426
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,750
I want to do everything with you.

427
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,090
From now on,

428
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,890
no matter what happens,

429
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,530
how much it hurts,

430
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,430
or how upsetting things might get...

431
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,980
Still, let's do everything together.

432
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,910
Okay.

433
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,590
The man you know...

434
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,889
I'll become him.

435
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,990
Good.

436
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,240
Look forward to it.

437
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,210
Don't be too surprised.

438
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,610
Okay.

439
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,449
Hey.

440
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,650
Are you bored?

441
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,550
You're the one who wanted to do this.

442
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,750
Right.

443
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,149
The bubbles are bigger,

444
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,460
and this whole setup is way better.

445
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,029
No, that's not it.

446
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,030
This is fun.

447
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,870
Want to go again? Let's go again.

448
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,369
Sure, one more time.

449
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,370
Okay.

450
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,040
Gosh!

451
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,750
It's been so long.

452
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,759
I was at the studio today, working on some guitar riffs.

453
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,820
For the new album.

454
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,429
But the guys just won't listen.

455
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,360
Min Kyu, that must be so hard on you.

456
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,830
No, it's okay. Seeing you makes it all better.

457
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,969
Oh, right.

458
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,770
You said you were looking for a tax accountant, right?

459
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,740
Our sound engineer's younger brother is a tax accountant.

460
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,539
I could introduce you.

461
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,080
I already found one.

462
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,110
I did, but...

463
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,090
Well, it's just that something happened.

464
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,650
Or maybe not.

465
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,820
Maybe nothing happened.

466
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,029
What was that about?

467
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,430
Why are you getting all serious? You're ruining the fun.

468
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,799
What's with you all of a sudden?

469
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,740
I thought we agreed to just be friends.

470
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,970
No.

471
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,040
Why can't we?

472
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,079
Should we head out?

473
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
I'm tired.

474
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,350
So we're just blowing bubbles? No strings attached?

475
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,510
Good.

476
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,480
Great.

477
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,380
Good.

478
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,980
Maybe adjust your glasses a little?

479
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,780
That's it. Good.

480
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,790
Good, the look is perfect. Good.

481
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,159
Yes, that's great.

482
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,360
One, two.

483
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,760
Oh, that's great.

484
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Manager.

485
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,499
- Are you heading back to work now? - Oh, hey, Seok Joo.

486
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,970
I was supposed to be heading back, but I can't miss this. You?

487
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,509
I faked an off-site meeting to get out.

488
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,509
The general manager looked like he was in a foul mood.

489
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,710
I'm just going to go home, and...

490
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,820
Okay, good. Just tilt your head down a little.

491
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,749
You said Mo Tae Rin is your client, right, Seok Joo?

492
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,560
What's she like in person? She seems so cute on her show.

493
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,689
How can she enjoy it like that with everyone staring at her?

494
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,030
Man, I could never do that.

495
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,160
Me neither.

496
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,029
How can anyone stand all that attention?

497
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,339
- Let's take a quick break. - Great work.

498
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,369
Tae Rin, this is great. You're looking so beautiful.

499
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,470
You think so?

500
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,189
Kim Seok Joo?

501
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,429
Oh, my.

502
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,629
She's looking this way.

503
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,260
I think she recognizes you, Seok Joo.

504
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,300
Yes, thank you.

505
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,570
What?

506
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,310
Hello!

507
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,410
How have you been?

508
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,810
What's going on?

509
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,410
Why is he over there?

510
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,980
Hey!

511
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,749
That time...

512
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,919
Gi Ppeum, were you at the office then?

513
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,119
When he came by?

514
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,549
No, he's in my driving class.

515
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,760
Gosh!

516
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,290
What? Why are you so happy to see me?

517
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,829
Hey.

518
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,929
Please, just let me get a picture with Mo Tae Rin.

519
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,499
Oh, ma'am, please...

520
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,429
- Oh, I can't. - Please, I'm begging you.

521
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,699
My daughter's a huge fan.

522
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,470
No, I... I can't.

523
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,310
So it's a no, then.

524
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,409
I guess I'm just a useless mom...

525
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,340
Oh, come on, don't say that.

526
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,619
I'll see what I can do.

527
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,820
Really?

528
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,910
Oh, hello there.

529
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,780
Oh, how have you been?

530
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:57,109
I was in the area for work and happened to see you.

531
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,850
You know him too? I know him as well.

532
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,979
How do you know him, Gi Ppeum?

533
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,919
He's in the same class as me.

534
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,360
I haven't seen you around at all lately.

535
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,490
Don't tell me you got your license.

536
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,490
No.

537
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,460
Tae Rin.

538
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
- Hello. - Hello.

539
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,300
Well, it's just...

540
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,239
Just one picture together...

541
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,410
With me? Why all of a sudden?

542
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,009
- Hello? - Our manager...

543
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,750
Oh, so you're a fan of Tae Rin's?

544
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,860
You're a fan?

545
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Gosh.

546
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,690
Why, though?

547
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,190
Why...

548
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,729
You should've said something sooner.

549
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,929
You must've been too shy when you came to the office.

550
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,469
- I... - You two, get closer.

551
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,369
Gi Ppeum, go get something for her to sign.

552
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,740
- Get a few! - Oh, okay.

553
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,540
No, not me. The person over there...

554
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,840
- I'll go right now. - Ma'am.

555
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,710
Ma'am, where are you going?

556
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,749
- Is this spot okay? - No...

557
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,920
Okay. One, two, three!

558
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,049
Okay, one more. Looks good.

559
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,960
One, two, three!

560
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,649
Well, well. Staying out all night, were you?

561
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,650
What?

562
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,150
And you've been ignoring my calls.

563
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,950
Did you snitch and tell him I was here?

564
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:48,320
I told him to come here. You like pizza, right?

565
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,829
And I knew you wouldn't answer my calls.

566
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,929
Look, sir...

567
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,299
It's not like Nu Ri just ran away to be mean or anything.

568
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,729
Ran away?

569
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,629
You ruined everything!

570
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,099
We already broke up. So why did you suggest pizza?

571
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,299
Nu Ri.

572
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,470
This "let's break up" habit of yours is getting really old.

573
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,979
You've been like that since we were in tenth grade.

574
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,640
Gosh, since tenth grade?

575
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,009
So what's next, your three-year anniversary?

576
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,780
Can I go get a Coke?

577
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,069
Get one for yourself, too.

578
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,440
You are the one buying me this.

579
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,890
This is good.

580
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,959
I've been looking at prep schools for photography.

581
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,219
If you really cram starting now...

582
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,890
I'm going to take my practical exam for photography.

583
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,959
A practical exam? When?

584
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,159
We were fighting, so I asked Seok Joo for a favor.

585
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,829
And his mom said she'd give me a ride.

586
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,129
Kim Seok Joo doesn't have a license.

587
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,969
I thought all adults had one.

588
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,370
So if you're going to be mad, be mad at Kim Seok Joo.

589
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,710
Okay.

590
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,410
Okay, I will.

591
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,579
You're not mad?

592
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,849
If you say it's okay, then I guess it's okay.

593
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,450
Tell me the schedule, so I can send you with something.

594
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,860
Okay.

595
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,730
Nu Ri.

596
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,730
But can you do one thing for me?

597
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,510
About when your mom came to see you...

598
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,010
I think you're making her wait for too long.

599
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,680
The way I hurt you with my words...

600
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,019
I'll make it up to you.

601
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,620
- So you have to... - Me too.

602
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,859
Secretly contacting Chan's dad,

603
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,460
I was lying to you.

604
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,959
I'll meet with my mom.

605
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,300
I've been thinking about it anyway. It's not because I'm upset with you.

606
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,670
Okay, I get it.

607
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,609
All right, everyone, go get dinner. We'll meet back here at 7pm.

608
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,040
- Okay. - Got it.

609
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,779
Okay, we'll go grab a bite and be right back.

610
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,319
Can I have one?

611
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,120
Sure, go ahead.

612
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,289
What name should I put on it?

613
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,600
"Kim Seok Joo, Tax Accountant?"

614
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,400
"Mr. Seok Joo?"

615
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,370
Or just "Seok Joo?"

616
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,169
Just "Seok Joo?"

617
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,970
"Seok Joo" it is. Okay.

618
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,339
I can't believe it. I had no idea you were a fan.

619
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,780
You accused me of ulterior motives. Unbelievable.

620
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,479
- I'm not your fan. - No, I'm just saying...

621
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,679
What's with you?

622
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,320
Before, my co-workers were around, so I was a little flustered.

623
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,319
So was I supposed to just say,

624
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,919
"Hey, we blew bubbles together?"

625
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
Of course not.

626
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,890
That's my personal life. This is work.

627
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,440
So that's a no.

628
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,640
Why are you smiling?

629
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,910
Because you included me in your personal life?

630
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,120
Do you still dislike me?

631
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,050
Didn't you say you disliked me?

632
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:42,089
You're the one who made a scene about not having any interest in me.

633
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,729
So why are you asking me?

634
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:48,400
Didn't you say you needed me for the bubbles you couldn't blow?

635
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,130
Oh, come on.

636
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,970
I was just saying that.

637
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,970
I can't believe you're still hung up on that.

638
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,880
I don't dislike you.

639
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,940
As for having feelings...

640
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,080
I thought you weren't making a move.

641
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,450
I guess I have some now.

642
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,550
So when should we do it again?

643
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,780
Blow bubbles.

644
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,390
As soon as possible.

645
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,830

649
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,720
Oh, hey.

650
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,590
Oh, your wedding invitations are out?

651
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,829
How did we not know that?

652
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,600
- I never would've guessed. - Me neither.

653
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,429
- You really couldn't tell? - Here, have some of this.

654
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,630
Thank you.

655
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,099
What did you think of the finale?

656
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,369
The editing was insane, right? I was crying.

657
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,540
From watching yourself?

658
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,939
If it wasn't for me, she wouldn't have seen the finale.

659
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,049
Why?

660
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,850
Actually, I don't really care.

661
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,020
This is...

662
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,990
- Gosh. - The wedding invitation.

663
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,390
Congratulations.

664
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,619
Congratulations.

665
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,530
But still, to marry a writer you see every day?

666
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,960
I must have been out of my mind.

667
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:37,729
We're just booking a restaurant and keeping it small.

668
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,639
- Just come and relax. - Okay.

669
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,299
And as for you, Bebop, feel free to just...

670
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,940
make the bouquet and the boutonniere for us.

671
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,240
All right. I have to pay you back somehow.

672
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,079
Pay me back for what?

673
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,120
Well...

674
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,420
You're the one...

675
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,920
who kept bringing me on for jobs.

676
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,430
And that's how Je Yeon and I got back together.

677
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,800
Oh, my gosh!

678
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,070
This is crazy, seriously.

679
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,440
I see.

680
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,700
So that's what happened!

681
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,009
Congratulations.

682
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,240
On getting back together. Oh, my.

683
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,350
- Thank you. - Thank you.

684
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,050
Oh, hold on.

685
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,550
(Nu Ri)

686
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,689
- Hey, Nu Ri. - Oh, hey.

687
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,459
I rented the camera,

688
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,889
and my exam schedule is out. It's super early in the morning,

689
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,359
so I'll stay nearby the night before.

690
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,460
Okay, got it.

691
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,969
And you made sure to pack everything listed in the guidelines, right?

692
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:48,599
Stop nagging. I'm not a kid anymore.

693
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,110
- I'm not nagging... - I'm hanging up.

694
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,480
Nu Ri.

695
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,680
Nu Ri? Eun Nu Ri?

696
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,879
Is someone in your family applying to college?

697
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,120
My sister wants to major in photography.

698
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,790
I see.

699
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,320
And...

700
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,819
according to her homeroom teacher,

701
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,820
apparently,

702
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,890
she's actually pretty talented.

703
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,969
She was always good at drawing, even when she was little.

704
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,200
Gosh.

705
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,809
Your sister's amazing. To know what she wants already.

706
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:23,810
Yes.

707
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:27,139
At her age, all I cared about was getting into college.

708
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,310
- Not me. - Drawing a line, are we?

709
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,479
No, but...

710
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,819
Are you saying getting into college isn't everything?

711
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,819
No, I'm saying that's how I felt.

712
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,020
Je Yeon, you should be our host.

713
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:43,960
Me?

714
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,530
But...

715
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,870
Aren't people from school coming, too?

716
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,400
Yes, they are.

717
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,210
Well...

718
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:01,540
Then...

719
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,820
I just...

720
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,190
I have some things to clean up in the back.

721
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,449
I'll let you guys talk.

722
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,920
- Excuse me. - Okay.

723
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,159
What's wrong? Did you lie to Bebop about your degree or something?

724
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,699
What? Of course not.

725
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,230
Why are you so nervous?

726
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,839
No, it's just...

727
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,470
I was worried he'd ask why I dropped out of school.

728
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:32,780
Was it that obvious?

729
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,379
I thought you were trying to get me to leave.

730
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,650
Oh, come on!

731
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,620
You're going to host the wedding, right?

732
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,920
About that...

733
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,720
I'm going to have to think about it.

734
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,060
So, did you decide to do it? The host gig?

735
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,600
I mean, it's Jin So Ra's wedding.

736
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,330
I want to. I really do, but...

737
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,700
It's just...

738
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,240
I need to think it over.

739
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,940
That's it?

740
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,779
Just...

741
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,410
What's the point of bringing up the past?

742
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,379
Dropping out isn't something to be proud of.

743
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,020
Why not? It's your story. It's interesting.

744
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,760
It's the most interesting story in the world.

745
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,670
What?

746
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:39,410
Je Yeon.

747
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:44,480
The guys you used to date...

748
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,220
Even if you talk about your exes,

749
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,649
I'm fine.

750
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:50,650
What?

751
00:45:50,651 --> 00:45:52,489
The only topic you'd be awkward about with me...

752
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,420
is your dating history, right?

753
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,829
Hey, it's okay. That's all in the past.

754
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:02,260
You're not still in touch with them, are you? Right?

755
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:06,269
Yes, it's all fine. It's in the past.

756
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:08,099
Just texting is fine. Just that.

757
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,240
But don't meet up with him alone or anything.

758
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:14,039
But does that even make sense to you?

759
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,139
I mean,

760
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,179
it's over between you, so why stay in touch?

761
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,949
I mean, come on!

762
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,080
This is...

763
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,790
Stop, okay?

764
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,859
Where are you going? Don't go, okay?

765
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,760
Stay with me, please?

766
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,360
Let's just stay here.

767
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,630
But why aren't you answering me?

768
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,100
- What? - You're not in touch, right?

769
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,369
It's really in the past, right?

770
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:42,600
Oh, come on! What do you take me for?

771
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,040
Beat, you idiot.

772
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,210
What do you mean?

773
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,010
Bebop, you're the bigger idiot.

774
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,549
Hey, isn't that a puppy? Let's go!

775
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,819
No, it's not!

776
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,420
Yes, it is. Come on.

777
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:57,990
Come on, hurry!

778
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:59,690
Why did you leave me behind?

779
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:02,420
Dad.

780
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,660
Was I such a burden?

781
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,699
Then what am I to you?

782
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,230
What exactly am I to you?

783
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,800
Do you even love me at all?

784
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,220
Oh my, you startled me.

785
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:31,590
I was wrong.

786
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,290
What I said was harsh.

787
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,259
Is that all you think was harsh?

788
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,059
Running away from home was wrong, too.

789
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,499
Not contacting once and making you come find me...

790
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,600
All of it was wrong.

791
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,540
Gosh, this place hasn't changed a bit.

792
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,410
Mister?

793
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,450
Oh, hi, Nu Ri.

794
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,550
What is happening?

795
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,950
Should I give you two some privacy?

796
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:06,260
No, let's just go. Don't worry about it.

797
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,519
Wait, where are you going?

798
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,130
I said I was wrong.

799
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:11,959
Nu Ri has no idea.

800
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,759
You're the one who has no idea.

801
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,459
Did you even know she has her entrance exam?

802
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,200
She has her practical exam early tomorrow.

803
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,299
You packed your toiletries and everything, right?

804
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,400
- Yes. - Yes.

805
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,739
- Let's go. - And you?

806
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,510
Nuri said it would be awkward if it was just her and you.

807
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,480
You can't just say that!

808
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,619
Oh, here.

809
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,749
He wanted me to give you this to say thanks.

810
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,749
He said they're tea bags.

811
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,860
But he wasn't sure if you'd like them.

812
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:42,760
Oh, my.

813
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,530
Tell him I said thank you.

814
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,739
I forgive you. You can thank your son for that.

815
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,269
Oh, have a safe trip.

816
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,970
Good luck, Eun Nu Ri!

817
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:59,680
Aren't you going?

818
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:02,779
I have night blindness. You'll have to drive.

819
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,610
And Seok Joo said he doesn't have a license.

820
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,150
I see.

821
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,149
Right, I should get going.

822
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,850
Wait, if he goes...

823
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,420
Am I sharing a room with him?

824
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,690
- I don't want to. - You should've gotten your license.

825
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,359
Deal with it.

826
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,829
Don't pick on my husband.

827
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,160
"My husband?"

828
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,399
"My husband..."

829
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,629
- Hey! - Gosh!

830
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,630
Wait.

831
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,700
Not in front of the kids.

832
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,110
It's bad luck. Don't look.

833
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:34,810
Mo Tae Rin!

834
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,810
Hey, what gives?

835
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,579
I told you I'd come to your office. Why the surprise visit?

836
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,850
Well, you always gave me rides.

837
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,619
I really wanted to give you this, and I couldn't wait.

838
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,630
What is it?

839
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,560
Ta-da!

840
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,969
I was too busy with work to visit you in the hospital.

841
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:01,339
A welcome-back present.

842
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,570
Oh, you...

843
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,409
You really...

844
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:05,410
Here you go.

845
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,210
Thank you.

846
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,149
It's so pretty.

847
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:16,079
Make sure you show this off to Bebop when you see him.

848
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,189
Flaunt it.

849
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,990
Okay, I'll flaunt it!

850
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:23,060
So...

851
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,029
I...

852
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:30,069
Have I mentioned we're dating?

853
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,470
You just did.

854
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,599
So you're really dating?

855
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,900
It's all thanks to me, right?

856
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,440
I'm the one who told you about booking that mover guy, remember?

857
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:40,779
To be honest, I really didn't want to tell you.

858
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:43,080
He had his reasons, though.

859
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,749
Don't be so hard on him.

860
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,449
If he makes you cry one more time,

861
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,449
tell him he'll have me to deal with.

862
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:51,450
Okay.

863
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,889
Hey, get in.

864
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,089
What's this?

865
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,430
Did you come to pick me up?

866
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,800
What?

867
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,729
Hey, this is the same kind of car you had, right?

868
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:09,139
Yes, I was used to this model, so the director got me the same one.

869
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,310
Gosh, nice of her.

870
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,780
Oh, here.

871
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,210
Actually, the director was asking about you.

872
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:19,710
Here.

873
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,280
I found this to give you.

874
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,659
I should probably flee the country.

875
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,560
Gosh. So...

876
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,060
What did you need my help with today?

877
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,229
My interview prep.

878
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,030
The photoshoot went well, but I still have the interview.

879
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,170
I want to do well.

880
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,200
All right.

881
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:46,439
"Your recent appearance in that nostalgia show was pretty unusual."

882
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,009
"What are your thoughts on that?"

883
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:50,480
Gosh, that sounded really natural.

884
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:53,779
"If through my past..."

885
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,850
"people can recall fond memories, then that's good."

886
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:01,159
Will people think I'm fake, just trying to act good?

887
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,560
What's so bad about that?

888
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,160
I wish everyone would be a little more phony and hypocritical.

889
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,830
To be honest, I don't really remember back then.

890
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:14,099
I was just...

891
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,600
like an animal, I guess?

892
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:18,140
Why I was like that...

893
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:21,580
That's why variety shows and interviews are so hard for me.

894
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,179
Everything gets recorded.

895
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,980
It's a record of my own humiliation.

896
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:31,149
Back then, your brain wasn't fully developed yet.

897
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:33,050
Everything's embarrassing at that age.

898
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:36,890
I guess it's fully developed by now.

899
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,570
No.

900
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:48,370
No.

901
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,470
I even know how to pretend to be cool now.

902
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,740
See? You've matured.

903
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,179
All right, next question.

904
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,009
So, who's the latest deadbeat you're...

905
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,210
"If..."

906
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,849
"If you hadn't become an actress, what would you be doing today?"

907
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:05,849
This one's really hard.

908
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,990
I've been stuck on this for days.

909
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,630
What about you?

910
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,659
If you hadn't become a manager, what do you think you'd be doing?

911
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,860
I don't know.

912
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:19,329
Hey, come on. You were stuck on it for days.

913
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,099
How am I supposed to answer in a few seconds?

914
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,310
Well, people always used to say it.

915
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:27,239
They'd never met a manager from a top university.

916
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,240
Gosh.

917
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,850
People really love slapping labels on everything.

918
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,279
I mean, look at me. I'm still stuck with the "former child actor" label.

919
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,390
Then should we just get rid of them?

920
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:41,389
You just be Mo Tae Rin.

921
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,330
And I'll just be Sung Je Yeon.

922
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,929
I'm glad I'm doing this with you.

923
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,930
Thanks to you, I can talk about this.

924
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,330
Sure.

925
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,070
But at least with interviews, you have a list of questions.

926
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:00,080
But when it comes to talking about myself...

927
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,710
When and how to say things...

928
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:06,880
I just have no idea.

929
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,319
I think...

930
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,290
if you hadn't become a manager,

931
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,590
you would have just been the real Sung Je Yeon.

932
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:20,960
Just Sung Je Yeon.

933
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:26,900
It's just, since we've been apart, I've really come to realize it.

934
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:31,109
You're always so considerate and perceptive,

935
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,970
and you work so hard to fix things.

936
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:35,280
You took such good care of me.

937
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:37,210
You're a great listener.

938
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,820
But I wish you were only like that when you're at work.

939
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:46,660
And I'm sure I didn't help matters.

940
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:56,129
Am I digging my own grave here?

941
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,330
Yes.

942
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:00,139
So it was you? You're the one who made me this way.

943
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,639
That's right!

944
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,169
I'm the culprit. What about it?

945
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:04,370
Exactly!

946
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,939
All right, next.

947
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:06,940
Okay.

948
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,939
"What was your hardest moment in your career as an actress..."

949
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,550
"and how did you overcome it?"

950
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:38,170
Sung Je Yeon.

951
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:40,540
So, am I still...

952
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,280
supposed to act like I don't know you?

953
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,250
Were you curious to see too?

954
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,450
How I turned out?

955
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,520
I was curious about you too.

956
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,690
If you'd gone off to college...

957
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:58,890
Whatever you became,

958
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,360
I wondered if we would ever meet again.

959
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,070
Stuff like that.

960
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:21,320
(Handle with Caution)

961
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,940
(Handle with Caution)

962
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:59,190
"To Sunwoo Hae, Sung Je Yeon."

963
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,130
"I like you."

964
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,060
"What about you?"

965
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,130
Who's this?

966
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,360
Where are you?

967
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,599
What are you up to?

968
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,160
Me? I'm practicing arranging the bouquet.

969
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,800
Why?

970
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,940
Because I miss you.

971
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:53,709
Hello?

972
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:54,910
Should I come over?

973
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,280
Open the door.

974
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,710
I'm here.

975
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:05,890
Gosh, you're really dedicated.

976
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,659
You can't just show up like this. I look like a mess.

977
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,190
Honestly, you're unbelievable.

978
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:15,260
I have something for you.

979
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,660
Hold on.

980
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,400
Here.

981
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,610
I made this thinking of you.

982
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:29,980
What is it?

983
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:34,949
It's a penguin, by the way.

984
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:37,420
Oh, I knew it. Of course.

985
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,250
Though I almost couldn't tell.

986
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,919
- And... - It does look like a penguin.

987
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,559
- It's cute. - Right.

988
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,859
And this...

989
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,330
got mixed in with my things.

990
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,900
Oh, so that's where it was.

991
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:52,729
I was looking all over for this.

992
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,100
- Thanks. - Gosh!

993
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:56,869
- What? - No,

994
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:58,109
wait until I leave to look at it.

995
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,110
Why?

996
00:58:59,111 --> 00:59:01,209
You can look if you drop it by accident and it falls open.

997
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:03,710
- Why? What is it? Let me see. - No.

998
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:07,420
Okay, fine. Goodness.

999
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,420
- What? Wait a second. - What?

1000
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,619
- Je Yeon. - Yes?

1001
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:13,959
You're burning up.

1002
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,060
I am?

1003
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,590
We need to nip this in the bud.

1004
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,460
Eat porridge, then take medicine. I make really good porridge.

1005
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,900
Let's not.

1006
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,429
Let's eat something good,

1007
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,430
like something salty and sweet.

1008
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,200
Something salty and sweet?

1009
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,840
- How about some galbijjim? - Yes.

1010
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,210
But doesn't that take a while to make?

1011
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:35,310
Yes.

1012
00:59:35,311 --> 00:59:37,350
I'll let it marinate overnight, so we can have it tomorrow morning.

1013
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:44,220
Gosh.

1014
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:45,950
You have a very...

1015
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,790
appetizing way of asking me to stay over.

1016
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,530
Sweet and savory.

1017
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,269
For today, you'll just have to stick with the porridge.

1018
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:00,370
Okay.

1019
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,400
Hey.

1020
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,809
No, what if you get sick?

1021
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,440
I'm trying to take it all away from you.

1022
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,880
Just stay here for a minute.

1023
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,970
Why did you have to say I should see this later?

1024
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,800
If you just hadn't said that...

1025
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,730
"To Sunwoo Hae, Sung Je Yeon."

1026
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:51,650
"You asked if I had gone to college,"

1027
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,650
"or which path my mom laid out for me I ended up taking."

1028
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:57,450
"You said you were curious, right?"

1029
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:04,260
Oh, right. Gosh.

1030
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,200
"From the moment we met again,"

1031
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:12,500
"you were asking about how I was."

1032
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,460
Where should I start?

1033
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:38,729
First off,

1034
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:41,100
college wasn't very fun.

1035
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:46,170
Just getting to my classes was a struggle,

1036
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,300
and I was barely making ends meet.

1037
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:51,870
And through it all, I kept wondering if this was the right path for me.

1038
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,380
But even having those kinds of worries...

1039
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:56,940
was a luxury I couldn't afford.

1040
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,689
After my family lost everything,

1041
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:08,689
and I had to drop out of school,

1042
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:10,690
life just went on.

1043
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,929
What in the...

1044
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,300
Oh, I'm sorry.

1045
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:15,930
What do you think you're doing?

1046
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,639
I thought you were working as a teaching assistant!

1047
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,100
It wasn't a good fit, so I switched jobs.

1048
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,970
What if I was a bad influence on the kids?

1049
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:27,779
You took a break from your studies for this?

1050
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,679
You're not happy with your major, and you don't want to transfer.

1051
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,349
Why the sudden rebellious phase? You never even had one as a teen!

1052
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,150
Do you want to see your mother collapse from all this?

1053
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:38,620
I'm sorry.

Gosh, why is this so hard to open today?

1059
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:45,690
"At times like that,"

1060
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:50,520
"I'd think of the person who lived the most inefficiently."

1061
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:54,860
"The one who slept when it was time for school..."

1062
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,830
"and worked when it was time to sleep."

1063
01:04:58,530 --> 01:04:59,630
"You."

1064
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,100
"You, eating by yourself on campus."

1065
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:06,970
"You, asking what someone like me dreamed of."

1066
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:11,180
I was just curious what someone as brilliant as you dreams about.

1067
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:14,480
"In those moments when you were gone,"

1068
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:17,620
"I realized I missed you."

1069
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,130
"I guess..."

1070
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,360
"I was lonely."

1071
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,380
Je Yeon.

1072
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,790
I love you.

1073
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:56,680
"To a friend I've drifted apart from."

1074
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,190
"When the flowers..."

1075
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,460
"of that tree are in bloom,"

1076
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,190
"let's go see it together."
