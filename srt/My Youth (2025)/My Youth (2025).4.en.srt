(Episode 4)

7
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,970
Why won't it go?

8
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,010
Did some seawater get in earlier?

9
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,580
My dad bought this for me.

10
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,090
Is it broken?

11
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,130
It just stopped for a second.

12
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,450
Director!

13
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,080
Director!

14
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,620
I'm so sorry. Director!

15
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,189
It was going so well. What? What's the issue?

16
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,389
Wol Baek can't make it.

17
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,159
- What?
- He has the chickenpox.

18
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,759
So what are we going to do about tomorrow's shoot?

19
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,929
What about the shoot the day after?

20
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,099
Oh, man! What am I going to do?

21
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,570
We're too far out. We can't come all the way back here.

22
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,540
Hey, kid!

23
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,610
Do you live around here?

24
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,740
Are your parents at work?

25
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,279
My mom went to work at the factory.

26
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,750
And my dad is a hack poet, and my mom...

27
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,289
He's not home much, so I don't really know where he is.

28
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,189
- Why?
- Well, look you.

29
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,719
You're a sharp one, aren't you?

30
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,429
Could you give me your parents' number?

31
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,730
We're shooting a movie and holding auditions here on set.

32
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,670
Was that opportunity coming my way...

33
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,010
a blessing or a curse?

34
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,909
Hey, where on earth did you find this kid?

35
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,809
He's amazing. Just amazing.

36
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,049
How are you so good?

37
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,250
He's pretty good, isn't he?

38
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,250
- Really?
- Yes.

39
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,229
Our day in the sun is coming

40
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,760
Hae!

41
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,199
Mom!

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,769
Mommy's here!

43
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,770
Mom!

44
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,270
My handsome boy.

45
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,409
Oh, my goodness!

46
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,340
Let's just move to Seoul for good.

47
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,180
Now, all we have to do is make it big.

48
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,610
I am...

49
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,620
going to be your manager from now on.

50
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,619
That means we'll get to be together every day.

51
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,389
What? If we go to Seoul, can I be with you every day?

52
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,390
Of course!

53
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,760
Oh, and I...

54
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,399
have something for you. Ta-da!

55
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,069
Gosh, shoes!

56
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,070
Go on, open it.

57
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:50,700
I clung desperately to that nameless opportunity,

58
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,370
hoping it might be the thread that would hold our family together.

59
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,340
Try them on.

60
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,139
And the award for Best Actor goes to...

61
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,410
Sunwoo Hae for "Ihwa Wol Baek!"

62
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,779
At just 11 years old, he's our youngest winner ever!

63
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,150
Hello. I'm Sunwoo Hae. I played Wol Baek.

64
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,289
I'd like to share this honour with all the children out there.

65
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,390
Thank you.

66
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,260
Grow strong, grow tall

67
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,599
No way.

68
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,429
It only grants wishes if you have a pure heart.

69
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,099
It's because of you your parents are gone.

70
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,440
They're nowhere to be seen.

71
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,710
This is killing me.

72
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,250
Please don't leave a scar.

73
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,649
("Beat and Bebop")

74
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,980
What do you mean he's been dropped?

75
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,150
Why? What's wrong with my Hae?

76
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,619
He's grown so much this past year.

77
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,560
Who'd believe Hae and Tae Rin are only a year apart?

78
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,529
- Oh, Director, please...
- Ma'am...

79
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,129
Please, just reconsider, won't you?

80
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,529
- Director...
- Look, ma'am.

81
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,829
We'll call you if a suitable role comes up.

82
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,170
What "next time?" There is no next time, Director!

83
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,940
Mom!

84
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,849
Mom, we're going to get new sneakers now, right?

85
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,550
You're starting a diet. Starting today.

86
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,220
The bigger you get, the smaller you must stay. Okay?

87
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,489
And I couldn't find a reason to quit.

88
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,260
And I couldn't stop, either.

89
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,200
Oh, Director. Hello.

90
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,729
You know the movie...

91
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,569
You know Harry Potter, right?

92
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,069
See, I'm going to make the Korean version myself.

93
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,169
Really?

94
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,340
I'm giving you the first crack. You have to take it.

95
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,649
What could I possibly do?

96
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,979
Director, thanks to you, our Hae became an overnight star.

97
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,779
Most cons begin with trust.

98
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,849
So, would you like to go out and grab a meal?

99
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,559
("Ihwa Wol Baek")

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,020
The belief that it'll work.

101
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,190
The belief that it's the real deal.

102
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,159
- If we hadn't trusted him, - That con artist.

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,929
We never would've had this debt.

104
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,670
Just wait until I get my hands on you.

105
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,500
If you hadn't trusted him in the first place...

106
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,340
All you had to do was doubt him.

107
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,840
You're an idiot.

108
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,740
You...

109
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,250
I'm so sorry.

110
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,549
I must've been crazy.

111
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,759
My poor Hae...

112
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,360
I'm so sorry.

113
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,289
Your dad is out there right now, hunting that punk down.

114
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,930
He'll catch him soon, okay?

115
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,929
And then everything will be okay, right?

116
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,470
Everything will be okay.

117
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,170
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

118
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,740
Because I'm small.

119
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,010
No, because I'm big.

120
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,950
You have no idea how much I love you!

121
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,380
You trust your mom and dad, right?

122
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,719
You have to trust us.

123
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,920
Yes, I do.

124
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,620
I think I learned too young...

125
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,829
that there's a certain comfort in disbelief.

126
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,659
You have to trust us!

127
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,100
That all that glitters...

128
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,070
is not gold.

129
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,939
The mother of Actor Sunwoo Hae, a victim of A Entertainment's fraud,

130
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,840
was found deceased in her home this afternoon.

131
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,179
Sunwoo Hae, who was the first to discover the scene,

132
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,050
is currently holding vigil at the funeral hall alone.

133
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,020
Back then, I think a thought crossed my mind.

134
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,520
Hey! Get out of the way!

135
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,019
- Are they loan sharks?
- Hey, get a shot of this!

136
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,629
You think dying solves everything? Is that it?

137
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,499
- Where's your father?
- Aren't there any adults around?

138
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,659
- Say something! Talk!
- Where did he go?

139
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,899
- Hey, that's enough.
- You must know where your dad is.

140
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,070
You need to sign this...

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,100
What's this?

142
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,939
- Unbelievable.
- Hey!

143
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,469
- Are you his father?
- No.

144
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,039
Hey, mister! Sir!

145
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,739
- What about my money?
- Stop filming!

146
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,509
- Hey, old man!
- Hey!

147
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,719
Sign here...

148
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,520
Hey, where are you going? What about my money?

149
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,390
I didn't know how to act in a situation like this.

150
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,860
Perhaps,

151
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,730
I was just waiting for someone to yell, "Cut."

152
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,339
Cut! Okay.

153
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,440
Mom, let's go home!

154
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,170
A shoot always ends eventually,

155
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,010
and with it, the performance is over.

156
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,280
I told myself this was just a scene,

157
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,650
and I was just playing a character in his place.

158
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,520
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

159
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,260
- Happy birthday, dear Sunwoo Hae - Happy birthday, dear Sunwoo Hae

160
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,730
That my performance was okay.

161
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,500
That it wasn't bad.

162
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,390
Of all the things to dream about...

163
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,229
Due to unseasonable weather conditions,

164
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,070
ship departures are being cancelled more frequently.

165
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,099
For those of you planning a domestic trip,

166
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,840
why not head for the mountains instead of the sea?

167
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,939
The sea, with its refreshing, crashing waves.

168
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,910
The mountains, full of lush greenery.

169
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,579
I already shared our schedule with you.

170
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,050
I said we have an out-of-town shoot for Tae Rin's documentary.

171
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,819
A shoot the moment we get back to Seoul?

172
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,990
And an emotional one at that?

173
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,330
Gosh, who schedules things like this?

174
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,970
Je Yeon.

175
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,670
The CEO wants to see you.

176
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,809
Maybe this is for the best.

177
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,480
If it's gotten this much buzz, more people will watch the show.

178
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,649
Ma'am, I was just about to...

179
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,579
talk to you about that video that was posted.

180
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,350
I kept trying to contact them, but they weren't having any of it.

181
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,990
How can people be like this?

182
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,089
Something so sensitive and private...

183
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,589
I had it taken down.

184
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,790
It was a huge hassle.

185
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,229
Thank you.

186
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,629
Thank you so much.

187
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,930
Oh, what a relief.

188
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,139
You know how reporters are. They never take anything down.

189
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,540
There was nothing wrong with the initial article itself.

190
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,170
The punk who attached the video to the follow-up is the problem.

191
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,939
Keep a close eye on them.

192
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,709
Try to get on their good side.

193
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,010
See if there's anything else.

194
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,979
Sunwoo Hae.

195
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,749
Even back in school, due to his financial struggles,

196
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,919
there were all kinds of rumours about him,

197
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,149
but none of them were true.

198
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,289
He just seems to have lived an honest, hard-working life...

199
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,020
What, did you get attached to him instead of Tae Rin?

200
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,330
I just think you're worrying about the wrong thing, ma'am.

201
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,769
The production team got the appearance contract signed, right?

202
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,569
If he changes his mind and quits over something this petty,

203
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,200
it'll cause trouble for many people. Check it yourself.

204
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,270
Yes, ma'am.

205
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,340
What do you mean they didn't get it signed?

206
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,379
I know he was added last-minute, but still...

207
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,309
That's not the kind of thing you just forget.

208
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,750
Hey, can you get it signed for me?

209
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,450
I'll email it to you right now.

210
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,089
I won't.

211
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,220
Absolutely not. No way.

212
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,529
(Currently delivering happiness. Emergency contact)

213
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,630
A heart?

214
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,170
Is this what he's really like?

215
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,600
Where did the flower shop owner go?

216
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,940
Oh, I just got here too, but the door's locked.

217
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,680
I guess he's out.

218
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,380
Out delivering happiness, I see.

219
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,180
Goodness.

220
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,789
Excuse me, but who are you?

221
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,429
And you are? What brings you here?

222
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,959
I have kimchi.

223
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,529
I'm her co-worker...

224
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,129
No, a friend. Wait, an old classmate.

225
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,530
Oh, really?

226
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,769
Well...

227
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,469
I'm Hae's dad.

228
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,209
Oh my goodness!

229
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,479
- Oh, hello, sir.
- Hello.

230
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,580
Hello.

231
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,380
I'm...

232
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,120
Oh, right. My wallet...

233
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,820
We're filming with Hae right now.

234
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,560
Oh, this is from her company.

235
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,329
Is Hae doing okay?

236
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,899
I saw some bad news about him.

237
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,999
You must have come because you were worried.

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,439
Yes, well... I don't know if I have the right to be.

239
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Hey, son!

240
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,010
Been out delivering happiness?

241
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,110
You're here?

242
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,309
What are you doing here?

243
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,310
What?

244
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,279
Oh, right! I made some kimchi.

245
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,019
You know you've got to have kimchi at home.

246
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,420
I have kimchi at home.

247
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,589
You should go. We're closing soon.

248
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,460
Hey, it's the middle of the day. What do you mean you're closing?

249
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,699
Seeing you is all I needed.

250
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,630
- You should head in.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

251
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,200
Oh, right. Could you give this to him for me?

252
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,140
Hey, son, don't come out! I'm leaving.

253
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,610
You two have fun now.

254
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,539
See you around.

255
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,110
- Bye.
- Okay.

256
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,900
Where did it go?

257
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,900
So...

258
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,369
Are wilted flowers recycled?

259
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,239
Wilted flowers are just regular trash.

260
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
I see.

261
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,710
The blue ones you gave me before. They wilted, so...

262
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,650
Hey, you still had them in a vase?

263
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,390
Throw them out. It's an insult to the flowers.

264
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,690
What are you smiling at?

265
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,230
What? Because you just put me in a good mood.

266
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,070
Sung Je Yeon.

267
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,680
Do you...

268
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,880
- find me awkward?
- No, not at all. Why would I?

269
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,850
Oh, I guess not.

270
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,849
Then is it 1, you feel awkward, or 2, you feel sorry for me?

271
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,690
What kind of thing is that to say?

272
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,390
Neither.

273
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,100
Maybe I shouldn't have asked for a hug.

274
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,939
About that video...

275
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,970
- The one in the article.
- Yes.

276
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,040
The CEO had it taken down.

277
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,880
I already thanked her on your behalf,

278
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,410
so you...

279
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,010
don't have to worry about it.

280
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,449
What do I have to thank her for?

281
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,590
Reporters rarely take articles down, you know.

282
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,920
She pulled some strings, so you should be grateful.

283
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,670
This is really bad timing, but...

284
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,540
Yes?

285
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,940
An appearance contract.

286
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,280
I can't believe it came out today of all days.

287
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,610
So that's why you're here.

288
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,250
A signature.

289
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,790
You'll sign it, right?

290
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,249
From now on, just...

291
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,820
get straight to the point.

292
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,190
Don't bother trying to make small talk.

293
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,459
No, that's not it. I mean...

294
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,900
Well, you're not wrong, but...

295
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,169
Seriously.

296
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,370
Everyone just walks all over me.

297
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,510
- Let me just fix your mic.
- Oh, sure.

298
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,850
You've had a lot on your mind these past few days, haven't you?

299
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,380
I'm sure this is why you hesitated to be on the show.

300
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,250
Honestly, that didn't even cross my mind.

301
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,559
I had no idea that stuff was still out there.

302
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
I'm sorry.

303
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,760
If you're having second thoughts about this,

304
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,170
I promise I'll do my best.

305
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,870
No, that's not it.

306
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,270
I just don't want to cause trouble for the show. That's all.

307
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,470
Until the very end,

308
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,480
I'll be counting on you.

309
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,910
Thank you.

310
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,650
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

311
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,499
- Hey, Nu Ri.
- Hae.

312
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,240
Don't you think I deserve an explanation?

313
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,370
Looks like they're filming something here.

314
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,910
Where are you?

315
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,050
I can explain.

316
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,820
You're really money-crazed, aren't you?

317
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,289
I heard you have to pay to get on TV these days.

318
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,419
But you're too cheap to pay for something like that.

319
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,420
Not a chance.

320
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:36,289
And the stations wouldn't advertise some random flower shop for free.

321
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,629
Definitely not.

322
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,460
- So what is it?
- Well...

323
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,229
What are you even asking?

324
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,829
I just wanted to give you a hard time.

325
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,199
Because you seem obsessed with money.

326
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,970
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

327
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,069
Here's the ice cream you ordered.

328
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,980
- Thank you.
- Oh, and...

329
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,340
This is on the house.

330
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,010
You're always giving us flowers.

331
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,789
Thank you so much. We'll enjoy it.

332
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,790
Thank you.

333
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,690
Well, it's just...

334
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,459
It's going to show me now and footage of me as a kid.

335
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,469
Are you sure you were ever young?

336
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,870
And do you still go around town handing out your leftover flowers?

337
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,040
You'll get into real trouble doing that. Seriously.

338
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,780
Eat your ice cream before it melts.

339
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,480
Eat up.

340
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,280
Good?

341
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,950
What?

342
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,619
Oh, I figured the director would be needing some coffee by now.

343
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,820
I see.

344
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,820
And you are?

345
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,190
Hello.

346
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,830
I'm his younger sister.

347
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,099
Are you on the shoot with my brother?

348
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,370
Gosh, you're all grown up.

349
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,769
Hi, I'm...

350
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,099
the manager for the actress he's filming with.

351
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,709
Wait, how do you know me?

352
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,839
Are you and my brother already that close?

353
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,840
Well...

354
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,910
You don't remember me, do you?

355
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,849
I used to read you books when you were little.

356
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,980
Books?

357
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,550
Books...

358
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,950
Just one little pebble fell out...

359
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,290
I like her too.

360
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,770
Good luck with the shoot.

361
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,600
Here, share this.

362
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,340
You just gave me something you were eating.

363
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,910
Nice to see you again!

364
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,340
She's really grown up so much.

365
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,980
I guess she didn't see it.

366
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,020
Thank goodness.

367
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Right.

368
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,419
Grow strong, grow tall

369
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,560
- This is you?
- Yes.

370
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,929
- Got a problem with that?
- What happened to you?

371
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,690
What's so wrong with me that everyone...

372
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,530
Oh, come on.

373
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,030
But you've always seemed so big to me.

374
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,040
But he's so tiny here.

375
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,509
He's so adorable, though.

376
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,870
What, am I not cute anymore?

377
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,209
When are you bringing home your report card?

378
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,309
You're cute.

379
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,910
The cutest in the whole wide world.

380
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,679
- You're a real prize, aren't you?
- Too late for that.

381
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,749
It's not too late, is it?

382
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,849
Hey!

383
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,420
That woman from earlier.

384
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,019
That's her, right?

385
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,060
Get over here.

386
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,889
- Get over here.
- But it is her.

387
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,900
Just how bad are your grades that you keep hiding them?

388
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,700
Hey, Eun Nu Ri, talk to me for a minute.

389
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,030
The weather's too nice. It feels like a waste to go home.

390
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,030
Why isn't Je Yeon picking up?

391
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,099
How should I know?

392
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,609
I think she's pretty consistent with her hobby,

393
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,310
but she never tells anyone at work what it is.

394
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,410
She even bailed on hiking with me today.

395
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,750
So,

396
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,420
now I've got nothing to do after this.

397
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,720
So what's your point?

398
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,119
Why are you telling me this?

399
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,520
You're not busy?

400
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,860
Yes, I've got the day off from filming.

401
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,560
So I can come hang out, right?

402
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,359
Come on, I know you're bored too.

403
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,300
After the whole film crew was there, it must feel empty. Are you lonely?

404
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,100
We're seeing each other soon. Do we need to meet today too?

405
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,340
You want coffee, right? I'll grab some on my way, okay?

406
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,910
I'm telling you not to come.

407
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,510
Hello?

408
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,150
Hello...

409
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,880
She hung up.

410
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,679
Oh, hello there.

411
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
Hello.

412
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:55,649
Excuse me, we're not from here. Could we ask you for directions?

413
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,580
I'm sorry, I'm lost myself.

414
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,050
Oh, my goodness, you are?

415
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,089
But you have such a wonderful energy about you.

416
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,459
Oh, thank you.

417
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,960
Do you happen to work in the arts?

418
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,899
It seems your ancestors were very virtuous people.

419
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,860
You know my ancestors?

420
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,930
I told you not to wander off on your own, honey.

421
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,340
Gosh!

422
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,750
Oh, you have company.

423
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,529
He doesn't seem to be with you. Should we help you out?

424
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,690
Want me to pretend I'm with you?

425
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,260
People like that always bother you when you're alone.

426
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,170
Thank you for your help.

427
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,270
I'm just really shy around strangers.

428
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,680
I got anxious just watching you, so I had to step in.

429
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,950
You were anxious?

430
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,010
That you'd start crying again.

431
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,720
You seem to have a pretty low emotional threshold.

432
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,620
What's a threshold again?

433
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,930
The minimum stimulus level required to trigger a reaction.

434
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,700
Flippers?

435
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,030
Oh, I do free diving.

436
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,670
I see.

437
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,500
You must be great at holding your breath.

438
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,440
That's it?

439
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,180
Such a short reaction.

440
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,639
What?

441
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,179
That banner over there is long.

442
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,679
Maybe you could read it to me.

443
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,220
(We read your fortune.)

444
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,320
So you're shy, but you're not afraid to speak your mind.

445
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,530
You must have it rough.

446
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,960
Hey, why the sudden concern?

447
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,869
Are you trying to hit on me or something?

448
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,270
You're the one who almost got played a minute ago.

449
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,009
You think this is me hitting on you?

450
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,079
You dropped the formalities and called me "honey."

451
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,210
I was pretending we were together.

452
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,710
I see.

453
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,620
Still, "honey" was a little much.

454
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,190
So, where are you headed?

455
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,890
I hope it's somewhere close by.

456
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,290
If I leave you on the street, I'm worried what someone might do.

457
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,670
Well, this is my stop.

458
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,009
From now on, if you look in your phone,

459
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,639
there are tons of apps for maps, taxis, you name it.

460
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,610
So make that your new travel buddy and find your way home safely.

461
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,950
Stop staring. You'll burn a hole through my face.

462
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,419
Are you always this nice?

463
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,089
You should be wary of people like me.

464
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,630
Don't just follow anyone around.

465
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,259
Move it. You're blocking the entrance.

466
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,400
You move it. You're blocking the entrance.

467
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,370
Where does she get all that strength?

468
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,340
Does she take supplements or something?

469
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,469
And what's your deal?

470
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,779
I know, right?

471
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,980
Turns out we were going to the same place.

472
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,280
Gosh.

473
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,350
What's his deal?

474
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,520
"Honey."

475
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,820
"Honey."

476
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,230
"Honey."

477
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,759
Why would you be looking for your "honey" here?

478
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,459
Of all words, why "honey?"

479
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,029
He could've just said "friend."

480
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,799
Get a hobby or something and stop hanging around, please.

481
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,469
I just came from my hobby.

482
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,169
Want to join me? Free diving.

483
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,470
Why would you do something like that?

484
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,740
But if he'd called me "friend,"

485
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,179
would we have to be close enough to get drinks?

486
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,380
- Like you and Je Yeon.
- Oh, right. Now I remember.

487
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,079
You were just like this as a kid. You never listened to anyone, right?

488
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,090
No.

489
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,419
Drinks? What a waste of money.

490
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,460
Drinks?

491
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,089
I'll buy. Let me get you a drink.

492
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,090
No.

493
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,730
I'm the one who knocked yours over earlier.

494
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,329
Thank you.

495
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,170
Fine, then I'll just ask Je Yeon to have a drink with me.

496
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,879
- The person you are calling...
- Oh, she rejected my call.

497
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,879
I texted her that there was a fire. Think she'll come?

498
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
What was that?

499
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:24,950
Oh, there's just something I didn't get to tell her.

500
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,820
I didn't ask.

501
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,590
Why not? I'm curious.

502
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,189
- Hello?
- What is it now?

503
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,190
I'm holding your actress hostage.

504
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,760
If you want her back, come get her.

505
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,460
Tae Rin, you said there was a fire! Where are you? Is it out?

506
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,770
Is anyone hurt?

507
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,940
What are you doing here?

508
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,610
Found you.

509
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,149
Oh, you're here too.

510
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,479
I should hope so. This is my flower shop.

511
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,580
Oh, right.

512
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,150
What do you get when a flower shop catches on fire?

513
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,560
Fireworks.

514
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,729
Fireworks.

515
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,269
I don't make a habit of hitting women,

516
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,369
but I'll make an exception for you today, Mo Tae Rin.

517
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,509
You startled me.

518
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,579
There's nothing for you to hit.

519
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,510
Oh, come on.

520
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,549
Then how about I hit you instead?

521
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,180
- There's nothing for you to hit.
- That's right. Not even worth it.

522
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,189
- Hey.
- Yes? What is it?

523
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,119
Here. This is the study guide I made.

524
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,719
- I see.
- Have Nu Ri use this to prep.

525
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,590
- I'm giving her a test this week.
- Okay.

526
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,360
- And who are you?
- A private tutor.

527
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,929
And who do you teach?

528
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:47,930
My little sister.

529
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,130
Oh, really?

530
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,500
Why would you trust this guy?

531
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,610
Hey, Sung Je Yeon.

532
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,779
Why don't you ever stand up to him?

533
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,980
What are you talking about?

534
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,790
Excuse me, but...

535
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,919
If you're all finished here, would you all mind leaving?

536
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,260
Are you two are brothers?

537
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,629
Is it true?

538
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,630
- Yes.
- No.

539
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,500
What?

540
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,970
We should get going.

541
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,469
Yes, let's get out of here.

542
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,339
- Leaving? Now?
- We're going.

543
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,910
- We're off.
- Okay, bye.

544
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,080
I'm off. See you tomorrow.

545
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,880
Stay away for a while.

546
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,150
So we're not brothers after all.

547
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,680
We're not.

548
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,689
I wonder how long that'll be true.

549
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,019
Who knows?

550
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,060
If you'd bought that basket here, we might've been brothers by now.

551
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,829
You're still holding a grudge about that?

552
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,260
How adorable. Really.

553
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,930
You look like you're doing okay.

554
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,070
I thought I saw some bad press about you.

555
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,569
Maybe going broke as a kid gave you thick skin.

556
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,070
The feeling of hitting rock bottom.

557
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,710
I know it all too well.

558
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,019
Takes all the fun out of teasing you.

559
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,120
Aren't you leaving?

560
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,720
All right, I'm going.

561
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,690
Well, this non-brother is heading out.

562
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,630
Make sure she preps.

563
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,300
Gosh, peace and quiet.

564
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,680
Right?

565
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,010
About what?

566
00:30:40,011 --> 00:30:41,949
Remember last time, during the driving test?

567
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,980
We were the only two who failed.

568
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,319
I was so nervous back then.

569
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
I was babbling nonstop.

570
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,590
You don't remember me?

571
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,319
Just because we failed together, doesn't mean I have to remember you.

572
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,760
Your vehicle assignment is ready.

573
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,030
That was just last week, though.

574
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,499
I tend to only remember the things I want to.

575
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,599
I see.

576
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,069
Well, since fate brought us together like this again,

577
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,609
let's make sure we pass together this time. Deal?

578
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,009
Don't you bail on me.

579
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,639
I'm so excited to make a new friend in Korea after so long.

580
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,080
You've got quite a personality.

581
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,780
Very bubbly.

582
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,619
Yes, well, in that case...

583
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,750
- Right.
- Yes, see you next time.

584
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,360
I saw him last week.

585
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,090
We failed the test together.

586
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,800
Oh, the license number.

587
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,770
(Resignation)

588
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,869
If I accept this right away, will it seem like I expected this?

589
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,409
Word gets around so fast around here.

590
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,350
I'm sure you must have suspected.

591
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,119
You were so influential at the company, after all.

592
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,480
And you mentored so many of our junior colleagues.

593
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,020
I haven't spoken to anyone else about this, so don't worry.

594
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,760
We should end things on a good note, right?

595
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,970
I want to say I'm rooting for you,

596
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,969
but I just can't today.

597
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,339
Maybe tomorrow will be different.

598
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,969
There was a time when I wanted to be just like you.

599
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,110
More than anything.

600
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,980
Isn't that what every woman in our line of work says?

601
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,810
But...

602
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,449
as I watched you pave your way,

603
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,220
I started wanting to forge my own.

604
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,490
You know,

605
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,289
I used to like that you weren't afraid of me.

606
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,890
Well, I found myself growing more and more afraid of you.

607
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,560
Thank you for everything.

608
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,180
Oh, dear.

609
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,660
May I ask why you're resigning?

610
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,070
Am I the only one who feels like this is out of the blue?

611
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,140
What kind of company would make you want to come to work?

612
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,940
Gosh.

613
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,439
No one's ever asked me that before.

614
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,180
That's a really good question.

615
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,050
A company you want to work for? Where do you find one of those?

616
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,179
That's a utopia.

617
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,220
Not a company.

618
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,050
That's a pretty lame answer, though.

619
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
Gosh.

620
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,860
Well, for me...

621
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,400
I can't imagine this company without you two in it together.

622
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,699
At some point...

623
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,870
it started to feel awkward being around the CEO.

624
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,740
I began to question things, like her rules and her methods.

625
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,410
Who am I supposed to whine to now?

626
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,249
What's your goal here at this company?

627
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,680
Are her beliefs truly your own?

628
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,290
Then what's your goal, Director?

629
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,460
Me? To do things my own way for once.

630
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,730
No, to prove that my instincts are right.

631
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,900
Make sure you get enough sleep.

632
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,749
No, Mom, about that package...

633
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,779
I told you I sent it to our house,

634
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,120
not the study.

635
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,719
I even bought facial masks for Auntie,

636
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,219
so make sure you share them.

637
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,319
- Bye.
- All right, take care.

638
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,490
Okay, I get it. Stop nagging me.

639
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,460
Oh, that kid from that old sitcom.

640
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,660
I heard she's going to be on TV again.

641
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,429
Is she still as pretty?

642
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,399
Oh, she was just gorgeous back then.

643
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,340
- How'd she turn out?
- I have no idea.

644
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,670
She probably didn't age well.

645
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,839
Is she going to start her own company?

646
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,510
- What was that?
- What?

647
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,449
Oh, no, it's nothing. Just thinking out loud.

648
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,549
What was it?

649
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,649
(Report Card)

650
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,990
Gosh.

651
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,920
And here I thought I had a knack for teaching.

652
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,320
Good thing I didn't become a teacher.

653
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,870
While I'm gone, you make sure Nu Ri eats.

654
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,300
Where are you going?

655
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,740
To plant a tree.

656
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,970
Know what her grades are like before you go...

657
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,370
What are you, Spinoza now?

658
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,840
What's gotten into you?

659
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,820
Eun Nu Ri, tell me.

660
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,950
Do you know who Spinoza is or not?

661
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,530
I'm checking your report card as soon as I get back. Got it?

662
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,899
Hey, be careful with my suitcase.

663
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,639
I babied that thing, even on my school trip!

664
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,870
Taking your sister's suitcase... Should I just buy you one?

665
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,440
Hey, do you really not know? Or are you just messing with me?

666
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,810
Both?

667
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,389
A disposable camera? I haven't seen one of these in a while.

668
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,730
I've never used one before, so I'm curious.

669
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,999
Oh, right. You were the Gangnam princess.

670
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,030
You probably only used fancy cameras.

671
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,439
Her Royal Highness...

672
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,710
had her days as a princess.

673
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,609
- I'll take your picture.
- Okay.

674
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,810
One, two...

675
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,209
- Oh, beautiful.
- Thanks.

676
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,410
One more.

677
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,880
One, two...

678
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,320
You look so pretty.

679
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,720
Oh, great.

680
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,930
How are you feeling? Want some more motion sickness medicine?

681
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,130
Water?

682
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,400
No, I think I just need to sleep it off.

683
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,679
You should enjoy the ocean view, too.

684
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,679
Gosh, what a view!

685
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,680
This is the life!

686
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,849
The ocean!

687
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,690
Hey, this breeze feels amazing!

688
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,519
How about you two act like friends and smile?

689
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,659
- Pretend we're close?
- But I'm not friends with her.

690
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,330
Just pretend a little.

691
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,609
No, that's not it at all!

692
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,009
You can't do this. This is seriously wrong.

693
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,549
No.

694
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,549
They're acting like children. Seriously.

695
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,880
You all worked hard.

696
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,450
You must be cold.

697
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,810
What? It's trash.

698
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,240
- Want to do it together?
- Yes, let's.

699
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,650
- Should we get a shot of that?
- Oh, sure.

700
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,850
- Hey, get over here!
- Let's do it together!

701
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,419
Why is there so much trash?

702
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,990
There's so much trash.

703
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,260
People just throw it anywhere. Unbelievable.

704
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,230
"I've grown up a lot, haven't I?"

705
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,059
"I've heard that a lot."

706
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,929
"A quick glance. Look at this kid."

707
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,870
Was there a scene we shot in the water like this?

708
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,870
- You want me to say it like this?
- Yes.

709
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,240
This is how it's done.

710
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,410
Right, you do it like this.

711
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,710
And then your line is, "Don't you recall? That morning..."

712
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,520
Gosh, this view is just...

713
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,220
so beautiful.

714
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,689
Writer, there's more over here.

715
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,360
- Oh, thank you.
- No problem.

716
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,239
I mean, look at her. She's just filming.

717
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,800
She planned this whole thing, and now...

718
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,109
Tae Rin, you tired?

719
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,110
Goodness.

720
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,480
You want me to do something about it?

721
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,410
No, I'm not tired at all.

722
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,320
Practising how to shovel really paid off, right?

723
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,690
Well, as long as you're happy...

724
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,320
Can anyone here drive a truck?

725
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,959
Oh, I can!

726
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,459
I even almost drifted a van once.

727
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,460
I can.

728
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:29,130
Ten years with no accidents.

729
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,470
I'm a professional driver.

730
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,089
What's all this?

731
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,290
If I don't go, who's going to move the equipment?

732
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,160
I said I'll move it.

733
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,759
They say a lot of deer show up around here.

734
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,800
- Aren't you worried?
- I told you, I'm strong.

735
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,530
What?

736
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,430
Don't dare get in.

737
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,810
Again.

738
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,680
Starting the engine.

739
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,850
I'm going to make this work.

740
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,290
One more time.

741
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,020
No, put it in second...

742
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,830
Move. Let me do it.

743
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,729
One more time.

744
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:39,270
The sun's going down. Are you trying to hold up the shoot?

745
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,840
All right, let's see what you've got.

746
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,790
Let me guess how you're feeling.

747
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,390
Pick one.

748
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,160
One, you're sulking.

749
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,600
Two, you're pouting.

750
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,929
- What do you mean?
- There are four choices.

751
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,569
Three, you're peeved.

752
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,739
- Four...
- Oh, forget it.

753
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,069
Just put me down for number two.

754
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,910
And stop coming up with pointless options.

755
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,569
So you are pouting.

756
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,610
No, I'm telling you, I'm not.

757
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,000
Speaking of Writer Jin Mu Yeong.

758
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,430
Has he given up on writing for good?

759
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,970
He's a really entertaining writer.

760
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,570
Entertaining?

761
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,380
It went out of print after the first run.

762
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,039
Hey, come on.

763
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,809
Someone says she enjoyed his work,

764
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,280
and you have to shut her down like that?

765
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,279
I knew it. You are sulking.

766
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,120
I told you, I'm not. Seriously.

767
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,790
I said "pouting."

768
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,390
Right.

769
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,570
See you tomorrow.

770
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,800
Good work.

771
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:22,470
Okay, I'll pass that along. Yes.

772
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,340
Oh, yes, understood. Okay.

773
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,280
- Tae Rin.
- Yes?

774
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,220
We got the script revisions.

775
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:34,980
Again?

776
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,790
How many?

777
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,520
Three.

778
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,359
Well, since you're so good at memorizing your lines,

779
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,930
I guess they trust you, so they keep sending more revisions.

780
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:48,260
All right! For tonight's wrap party, we're having pork belly!

781
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,309
You can't have any, right?

782
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:01,610
My character is gaunt from sorrow. I can't be glowing from pork.

783
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,510
I'll just memorize my lines, I guess.

784
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,790
Thanks.

785
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:22,730
Yes?

786
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,510
What are you doing?

787
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,680
Open up.

788
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,880
I can't.

789
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,020
Open up.

790
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,240
No.

791
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,869
I have to show some solidarity with Tae Rin.

792
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,580
Just say I'm being petty.

793
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,780
Bye.

794
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,290
So good.

795
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,420
(Mo Tae Rin)

796
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,100
Such a pro.

797
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,130
What do you get when a flower shop catches on fire?

798
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,600
Fireworks.

799
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,600
You have a weird sense of humour.

800
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,720
The sea is nice.

801
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,360
Is there a water deer?

802
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,390
At the beach?

803
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,370
Excuse me.

804
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:40,970
Are you okay?

805
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,110
Sung Je Yeon.

806
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,310
Stay back.

807
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,279
Pretend you didn't see me. Just go.

808
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,020
I didn't see you fall.

809
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,720
Get up.

810
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:03,930
Do you like the ocean?

811
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,160
I'm not sure.

812
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,470
I was born by the ocean, that's all.

813
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,099
You were born by the ocean?

814
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,740
Is that really so surprising?

815
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:16,170
No.

816
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,140
I just didn't know.

817
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,840
What about you?

818
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,680
Do you still like the ocean?

819
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:26,150
Well...

820
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,250
I like it all.

821
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,720
Mountains, the ocean, open fields...

822
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,390
It's really nice here.

823
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,160
Right?

824
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,400
You just don't get this feeling in the city.

825
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,700
Tell me about it.

826
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,280
What? Where did the other one go?

827
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,849
You had two bracelets, didn't you?

828
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:03,850
What?

829
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:05,950
Oh, you're right.

830
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,859
When did this break?

831
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,290
I guess this means you're going to get rich. Seriously.

832
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:11,830
You remember.

833
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:21,370
Of course, I do.

834
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,610
It's how I recognised you.

835
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,380
I see.

836
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,320
It held up...

837
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,390
for a really long time.

838
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:46,400
Sung Je Yeon.

839
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,800
Are things still awkward between us?

840
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,400
We're going to be stuck together for this whole shoot.

841
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:58,640
Just when I think I'm over it, I feel guilty again.

842
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,540
Like I dragged you into this mess for nothing.

843
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,390
Starting right now, just let it go.

844
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,790
It's a useless expression.

845
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:18,530
And don't trip again.

846
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,859
Don't you sleep well.

847
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,299
Gosh!

848
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,330
Hey!

849
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,640
Do you have a death wish?

850
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,180
Good night.

851
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,850
What's so funny?

852
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,899
- What the... A snake!
- What?

853
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,969
Hey, Tae Rin, get back!

854
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,240
Get up on something, okay? It's a snake.

855
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,039
There's nothing to get on.

856
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,710
Then get in the car.

857
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,709
Hey!

858
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,580
- Want some?
- Sure.

859
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,980
- This will wake you up.
- Thanks.

860
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,020
They weren't kidding when they said there were snakes out here.

861
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:20,219
Where's the snake?

862
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,659
- Oh, my gosh, stay back!
- Stay back.

863
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,589
- Right here.
- Gosh, it's real.

864
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:26,999
Wait, am I the only one freaking out?

865
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,559
They told us yesterday in the fields...

866
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,030
that we'd be fine if we stayed still.

867
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:32,570
Guess you weren't paying attention.

868
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:35,099
It's dangerous.

869
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,670
You're an actress. You need to be careful.

870
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,840
A snake? Where? Where is it?

871
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,009
Where's the camera? Get a camera.

872
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:43,579
- Let's go, quick!
- This way. Over here.

873
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,710
It bites. Be careful.

874
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,749
Snake!

875
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:48,680
She's completely changed.

876
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,249
- He got bit?
- Yes.

877
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,850
And apparently, the only thing here is a public health center.

878
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,860
I should get on the earliest boat and go with him.

879
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,560
Yes, okay.

880
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,800
I'll take care of the receipts, so just have a safe trip.

881
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,269
I really shouldn't be asking you to do this.

882
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:04,469
- Thank you.
- Oh, don't mention it.

883
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,969
Who do you people think you are?

884
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,400
Who gave you permission to film here?

885
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,410
Hello, sir.

886
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,369
I hope we weren't being too loud.

887
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,010
What gives you the right to film without my permission?

888
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,280
Typical. You TV people are all the same.

889
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,450
Look, I only agreed because they said they'd plant trees.

890
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,349
I never said you could film.

891
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:24,649
Right, so...

892
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,889
Well, if you could give us a moment to explain...

893
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:29,219
Look, I'm telling you, no one told me anything about this.

894
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,260
- We're really almost done...
- No.

895
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,959
- Go over there and smooth it over.
- Me?

896
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,569
- Just go and beg him. Hurry!
- Why? What are you telling me?

897
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:38,270
Oh, come on, sir.

898
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,140
What's he saying?

899
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,040
He's really not budging.

900
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:47,239
He says planting is fine, but absolutely no filming.

901
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,740
What? So we just have to leave?

902
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,620
Forget the trees. Let's just pack up.

903
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,490
If we miss the boat, our schedule's a mess. Let's move out!

904
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,990
Let's move!

905
00:51:57,991 --> 00:52:00,120
If you're just going to leave them,

906
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,260
could I stay behind and plant them?

907
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:07,829
If they're planted correctly, these guys will grow just fine.

908
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:08,930
By yourself?

909
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,569
Come on, that was a job for us all. How can you do it alone?

910
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,739
Besides, we don't have a place to stay as of tonight.

911
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,939
I'll be fine. I can sleep anywhere.

912
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,270
Please, don't worry about me.

913
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,280
You all should get going, then.

914
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,309
Thanks for your hard work.

915
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:23,780
- Great work.
- You too.

916
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:26,079
- I'm off.
- Good luck.

917
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,780
All right, then. Good luck.

918
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:29,989
Pack it up! Let's move, people!

919
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:31,519
Okay, great work, everyone.

920
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,360
- Good work.
- You too.

921
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:38,159
Hey, hurry up. Let's go.

922
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,260
I'll wrap things up here.

923
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:42,030
I'll leave it in your hands. Thanks.

924
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,040
Man, what a shame.

925
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,339
Yes, I've got all the receipts.

926
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:54,440
I'm about to get on the boat now, too. Yes.

927
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,910
Okay, I'll see you next time. Bye.

928
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:05,019
Hi. A ticket for 4pm, please.

929
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,860
Oh, dear. All afternoon ferries have been cancelled.

930
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,760
The boats can't leave because of the bad weather.

931
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,860
What?

932
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,429
But it's perfectly clear out.

933
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:16,829
For now, it is.

934
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,830
Anyway, you have to take the ferry tomorrow.

935
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,020
Hey, it's me. Well...

936
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,620
Mind if I give you a hand?

937
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:46,130
Isn't it hard doing this all by yourself?

938
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:48,630
Hey, here, let me. I'll do it.

939
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,770
You should save your strength.

940
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,769
We have to get an early start on planting tomorrow.

941
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:55,770
I see.

942
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:58,310
Must be an island thing.

943
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,510
The rain comes and goes all day here.

944
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:03,109
Tell me about it.

945
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,380
You never know with the weather, seriously.

946
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,449
(University Hospital)

947
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:13,460
Oh, right. My blood test.

948
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,760
Blood test?

949
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,490
- For a checkup?
- It's just a routine thing.

950
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,260
It was for tomorrow morning, but I can't make it now.

951
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,970
Oh, here.

952
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,399
I guess we're getting old.

953
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,970
We're falling apart.

954
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:29,970
To be honest,

955
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,970
I was wondering how I'd ever get this all planted by myself.

956
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,980
I'm glad it worked out this way.

957
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,420
If they only have one room here, too,

958
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:50,530
I'll just go sleep at the other inn.

959
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:52,530
Okay.

960
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,260
We've only got one room left.

961
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,240
We are not in a situation that calls for one room.

962
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,610
Two. Please give us two.

963
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:06,069
I'm serious. Ferries were cancelled out of nowhere.

964
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,640
Everywhere else around here is probably booked solid.

965
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,410
You take the room.

966
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,280
We'll take the room.

967
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:14,980
Hello?

968
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,350
Oh, hi. I'm the one who was just there ten minutes ago.

969
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,690
Oh, yes.

970
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,119
The handsome young man from Seoul. Yes.

971
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,160
Yes, that's me.

972
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,660
You said you had one room left, right?

973
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,030
I see.

974
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,540
Right. I understand.

975
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,800
Thank you.

976
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,840
You worked hard today. It's late.

977
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,710
You should go get some rest, too.

978
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:53,820
Don't tell me...

979
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,160
The room...

980
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:59,260
It's not gone, is it?

981
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:11,870
So, you want to sleep in the car?

982
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,480
Rock-paper-scissors for it?

983
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,609
- One and done?
- Yes.

984
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:19,850
Rock-paper-scissors!

985
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,180
Best 2 out of 3. Rock-paper-scissors!

986
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,920
Guess I'm sleeping in the car, then.

987
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,420
I do feel a little bad about it, but...

988
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:40,770
You...

989
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,070
could always sleep in the car.

990
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,340
And why would I do that?

991
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,619
Well, good work today.

992
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,450
I look forward to another productive day tomorrow.

993
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:00,920
You're being awfully formal for a couple of roommates.

994
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:05,560
Sorry, it's a habit.

995
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,099
Hey, did you by any chance...

996
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,600
finish my book?

997
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,500
Someone's curious if I liked it.

998
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:15,800
Fine.

999
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,610
I've been reading it ever since you mentioned it yesterday.

1000
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,340
It was surprisingly hopeful.

1001
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,180
I guess that's how you want to live?

1002
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,980
I asked if you liked it.

1003
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:29,620
Gosh.

1004
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,660
I hate to give you the satisfaction,

1005
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,290
but it was actually pretty funny.

1006
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:39,530
I also felt a certain...

1007
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,560
sense of kinship, I guess.

1008
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,600
I mean, my 20s were sort of like that too.

1009
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,439
How so?

1010
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,339
Just for taking a semester off school,

1011
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,470
my entire family jumped on me,

1012
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:56,140
yelling, cajoling, and scolding me.

1013
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,480
They said I was having a late teenage rebellion.

1014
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,320
Our family was united, even more then when it went bankrupt.

1015
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,589
When you were a high school senior,

1016
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:07,689
you'd study so hard, even sacrificing sleep.

1017
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:10,190
But I ended up quitting.

1018
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:13,530
Turns out I'm just the type who likes to take risks.

1019
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:22,870
The funny thing about this business is,

1020
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:27,310
a low-budget film you slaved away on can be a huge hit,

1021
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,080
or you can pour big money into one, and it'll totally flop.

1022
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:34,320
You can never really predict the outcome.

1023
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,850
So why do we keep at it?

1024
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,960
Maybe I should just quit and take another risk.

1025
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,430
The relationships you build?

1026
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,310
The time you spend together, things like that?

1027
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,020
I've never been on a set like this before.

1028
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,350
Where someone actually listens to me...

1029
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,620
and asks me...

1030
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,620
if I'm doing okay.

1031
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:19,330
Should we just sleep together?

1032
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,840
We're just going to hold hands and sleep, right?

1033
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:34,980
Yes.

1034
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:39,180
What? No.

1035
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:41,880
No.

1036
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,720
The bed...

1037
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,720
There's still only one.

1038
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,960
Should I...

1039
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:50,390
take the bed?

1040
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,490
You think asking politely makes it okay?

1041
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:55,760
To be fair,

1042
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,070
want to share?

1043
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,730
What?

1044
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,910
See, that's the kind of thing you're supposed to ask politely.

1045
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,610
Gosh, I'm so exhausted I can barely keep my eyes open.

1046
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:12,680
Lights out.

1047
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,760
Oh, right.

1048
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,260
They're not here.

1049
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,230
Yes, they are.

1050
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,670
I'm right here, breathing and everything.

1051
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:35,540
Are you really going to pretend I'm not here?

1052
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:40,010
Oh yes, you are.

1053
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,380
This feels so weird.

1054
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,420
You're not getting any funny ideas, are you?

1055
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,450
I'm not.

1056
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,930
Why not?

1057
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,499
So should I or shouldn't I?

1058
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,500
Whatever.

1059
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,330
Just forget it. Don't.

1060
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,179
You know, back then...

1061
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,210
you really...

1062
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,050
sparkled.

1063
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,680
And...

1064
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:41,440
Good night.

1065
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:05,160
"Sparkled." Past tense.

1066
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,230
I guess I don't anymore.

1067
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,020
He's gone?

1068
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:06,590
Oh, it must've been a dream.

1069
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,620
Oh, thank goodness.

1070
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,360
Hey, I'm right here.

1071
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,060
Want me to disappear?

1072
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:20,070
Such a relief.

1073
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:22,040
It was a dream.

1074
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,590
Gosh, you're really something else.

1075
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,160
So this is why you run a flower shop.

1076
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,329
I mean, the smell of the earth...

1077
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:49,360
And it clears your head of all the clutter.

1078
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,469
And the sounds... Gosh.

1079
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:53,899
I've only ever heard them on an app.

1080
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,140
It's so much better in person.

1081
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:00,540
Oh, by the way,

1082
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,340
the cactus...

1083
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:03,980
Is it doing all right?

1084
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:07,520
Hey, why do you keep assuming I killed it?

1085
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,050
Because you seem like the type who would.

1086
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,190
Just to get back at me.

1087
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,490
You know, maybe I will.

1088
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:15,460
- What?
- Not the cactus.

1089
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:17,990
You want to die? Seriously?

1090
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:20,390
You came all the way from the mainland, just like that?

1091
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:22,930
Gosh...

1092
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,029
Why would you even bring a car to an island in the first place?

1093
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,439
You're so unprepared.

1094
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,469
The producer said they'd cover all car-related expenses.

1095
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:32,170
I guess they forgot and just took off.

1096
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,540
Why is there no service?

1097
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:39,310
Call insurance first.

1098
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:41,880
- Hang on.
- Gosh.

1099
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,390
(Gas station, when you're out of gas)

1100
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:49,889
If we go to catch the ferry, it'll be cancelled due to the weather.

1101
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,990
And then we'll be trapped on the island! Again!

1102
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,530
And there will only be one room.

1103
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,429
You know how dramas always have these contrived scenes?

1104
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:59,069
Oh, so this is contrived.

1105
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,639
In the drama Tae Rin's in now,

1106
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,739
a perfectly good car suddenly breaks down.

1107
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:05,369
Why? Because the plot needs it to.

1108
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:07,580
What are you even looking at?

1109
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,640
What is it?

1110
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,510
"Gas station?"

1111
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:13,910
"When you're out of gas?"

1112
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,790
I found it.

1113
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,290
It says there's a gas station nearby.

1114
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,190
I'll go get some gas.

1115
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:28,330
Hey.

1116
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,699
Hey, no, wait.

1117
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,799
I got a public safety alert earlier about wild boars in this area.

1118
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,040
What if I run into one while I'm all alone?

1119
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,510
Hey, that's an even more contrived plot point.

1120
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:42,939
Are you avoiding insurance because you're worried about your rates?

1121
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:43,940
No.

1122
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:46,349
This area is outside their service zone.

1123
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:47,350
Give it here.

1124
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:51,049
Why are you just telling me that now?

1125
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:52,450
Gosh!

1126
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:59,230
I'm the kind of person who always follows the map.

1127
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:03,000
The ferry's been cancelled, and now the car's broken down.

1128
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:06,700
What about you? Have you always lived like that?

1129
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,400
Following the map?

1130
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:10,940
What?

1131
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:12,940
I mean...

1132
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:18,010
Have you ever had to follow a map you've never seen before?

1133
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,550
Well...

1134
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,950
Even when I wasn't sure it was the right path,

1135
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,920
there were many times I had to keep going.

1136
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,130
Like right now?

1137
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:33,130
Oh, that's right.

1138
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:35,400
You said you liked adventures.

1139
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,970
- Gosh.
- What?

1140
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,570
I've been looking forward to this since we got here on location.

1141
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:44,370
To what?

1142
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,470
Planting a tree.

1143
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:49,139
I mean, when else would I get the chance?

1144
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:51,049
If we just plant it carefully,

1145
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:54,050
I bet it would grow up all nice and straight.

1146
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,220
For it to grow big enough to be impressive...

1147
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:02,690
About five years, I guess?

1148
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,329
It'll be so beautiful when it blossoms.

1149
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:07,400
What's the flower's meaning?

1150
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,500
Not telling you.

1151
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,630
Gosh.

1152
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,940
- Hey, Sunwoo Hae.
- Yes?

1153
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:19,439
Seriously,

1154
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,310
why did you agree to do this show?

1155
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,950
You're still wondering about that?

1156
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:34,289
You've turned down every other offer until now.

1157
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:35,690
And I totally get why.

1158
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:38,389
But the fact that you accepted this one?

1159
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:41,300
I just can't seem to wrap my head around it.

1160
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:44,900
"A heart that yearns..."

1161
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:47,570
"for a friend, now parted."

1162
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,339
My, your feelings are so...

1163
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,640
admirable.

1164
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:58,750
The meaning...

1165
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:03,180
of the flower of the tree we planted.

1166
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,620
What? When did you look that up?

1167
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:09,319
You didn't have a chance to.

1168
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,490
I made it up. So what?

1169
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:18,500
Listen to Mr. Wordsmith over here.

1170
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:55,870
Hey, you're about to touch me.

1171
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:59,510
You're going to touch me! Hey!

1172
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,940
You touched me!

1173
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,610
Gosh, you're such a handful.

1174
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,720
Relax, I'm not going to bite.

1175
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,700
If you don't like it, pull away.

1176
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,100
And if I do?

1177
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:31,040
Then I'm in luck.

1178
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:50,420
(My Youth)

1179
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:51,920
What happens to us now?

1180
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:54,960
We kissed, so we can't go back to how we were.

1181
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,889
What have I just done?

1182
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:59,330
It'll be more awkward if we stay quiet.

1183
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:03,130
The 19-year-old you was like a protruding stone.

1184
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:06,200
You rose up and tripped me up anytime.

1185
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,370
The original publisher went bankrupt.

1186
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:09,899
The original's out of print,

1187
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,340
and the contract just says "original artist."

1188
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:15,540
Come back? You never came back after what happened to his mother!

1189
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,209
Can I go on a date here?

1190
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:19,310
With whom?

1191
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:20,910
Someone I like.

1192
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,780
Being curious about what they're doing is the beginning.

1193
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,550
Isn't it nice when someone who dumped you clings to you?

1194
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,260
Do you want to go out with me if you're not seeing anyone?
