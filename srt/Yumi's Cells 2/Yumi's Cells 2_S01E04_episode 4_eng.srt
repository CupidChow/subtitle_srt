00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,980
 Kim Yumi. 

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:12,950


3
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,350
 Ba Bi 

4
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,300
 Yumi's Cells 2 

5
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,930
 Episode 9 
 Heart-throbbing Battle 

6
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,320
Bye Bye!

7
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,660
 While Love was being warmly welcomed by the cells of Ba Bi's village, 

8
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,340
 another cell also met Ba Bi's cell. 

9
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,880
♫    I only wanna be with you every day.  ♫

10
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,660
♫  Does your smile which makes my heart dance  ♫

11
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,230
 Kiss 

12
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,270
Ah that scared me.

13
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,110
♫  feel my heart beat?  ♫

14
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,570
That startled me. Who knew he would come in like that all of a sudden?

15
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,360
♫  Your exciting image makes me dream again  ♫

16
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:12,100
♫  Because it is you who welcomed timid me ♫ 

17
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,490
♫  Without regret I want to love you more  ♫

18
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,940
♫  Everyday higher than the sky there  ♫

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,900
♫  My heart wants to express everything to you  ♫

20
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,140
♫  Awesome day if it becomes your day  ♫

21
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,240
♫  you can always smile  ♫

22
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,020
♫  and clear your clouds away   ♫

23
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,230
Again? 
 ♫  Every day  ♫

24
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,020
What am I supposed to do now? What was I supposed to do first?

25
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,340
Hold on. First, let me put on some saliva.

26
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,600
Uh ... so ... oh that's right, I need to open the door first. Yes.

27
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,130
Hi, I'm Ba Bi's Tongue.

28
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,880
Hi.

29
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,700
It's for you.

30
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,440
Nice to meet you. I am Yumi's tongue.

31
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,720
Nice to meet you too. I really wanted to see you.

32
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,980
You don't know how long I waited to meet you. So long.

33
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,400
The mint smells good.

34
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,090
Really? You gave me the candy.

35
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,260
Ah, did I? Anyway.

36
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,570
Come in, I'll show you around my house.

37
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,600
Thanks!

38
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,300
Here.

39
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,050
Thank you.

40
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,890
 It was a really sweet time. 

41
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,590
 It was as if time stopped because we were together. 

42
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,490
Oh! Wow!

43
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,760
It's a turntable. Can I listen to some music?

44
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,690
Of course.

45
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,060
Left right. Left right.

46
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,450
 We listened to music and danced together. 

47
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,460
- Is this ... how you do it? 
 - That's right.

48
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,790
- Do you want to go to my house too? 
 - Yes, I'd like to.

49
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,430
Earlier you were so awkward

50
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,400
but you're kind of really skilled.

51
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,540
- What's going on? 
 - What's happening?

52
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,970
- I guess the kiss is about to end. 
 - Why? Why so soon?

53
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,400
I know, right?

54
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,520
Yumi's Tongue cell, it was fun. Let's meet again.

55
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,620
- Don't go! 
 - I'll see you soon.

56
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,420
Don't go!

57
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,220
Shall we get out?

58
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,010
Yes.

59
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,880
- This is from when we went to Phuket. 
 - Is that Miss Yi Da?

60
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,480
Yes, it's Yi Da. I used to travel with Yi Da quite often.

61
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,010
Hold on. Your hair was long back then.

62
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,270
Yes, it was long for most of my twenties.

63
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,140
I think you look pretty with long hair too.

64
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,890
- Really? 
 - Yes.

65
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,190
You look pretty.

66
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,840
 With one word from Ba Bi, an era has ended. 

67
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,760
 After the long reign of short hair, 

68
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,860
 Yumi decided to grow her hair out. 

69
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,690
Thank you for your support, everybody!

70
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,930
Let's show Ba Bi long beautiful straight hair. 
  (Flowy - hair growing cell) 

71
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,190
I will use this spinning wheel to weave my hair

72
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,570
and send it out through the scalp.

73
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,980
It's not as fast as I thought it'd be.

74
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,260
I don't know if it will be possible to reach the shoulder in the spring as planned.

75
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,850
 Don't worry. I'll help you. 

76
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,040
Hi, Flowy.

77
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,400
Thank you Naughty. I needed your help anyway.

78
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,890
I didn't know which you would like, so I brought a 19+ story

79
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,330
and a 30+ story. I prepared both.

80
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,710
Rated 30+? What's the difference between them?

81
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,960
They are on different levels.

82
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,750
Can I see the 30+ story for just a second?

83
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,630
Can you handle it?

84
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,020
 Naughty Effect - If you hear a racy story 

85
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:50,330
 the speed of hair growth increases by forty percent. 

86
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,560
Why are they like that? No way!

87
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,350
If this is rated 30+ ...

88
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,890
then, of course, please tell me the 30+ rating.

89
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,660
An excellent choice.

90
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,850
Now, should we get into the exciting racy story

91
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,530
with Naughty?

92
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,910
 What is she doing, when it's time for her skin to recharge? She needs to sleep. 

93
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,800
I can't sleep.

94
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,960
 Then let's at least put on a face mask. 

95
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,350
Is it a blackout?

96
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,470
What do I do? What's going on?

97
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,080
 Are you asleep? I'm done with my get-together and I'm going home now. 

98
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,620
Hello?

99
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,140
No, I'm not sleeping yet.

100
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,360
It's not that. The electricity went out at home.

101
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,130
I don't know. Nothing is working.

102
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,330
I tried turning the breaker on and off and it's not working.

103
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,390
What? The boiler?

104
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:42,220
Is the boiler okay? It would be bad if it's not working. Check it out.

105
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,620
This?

106
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,760
- It looks like the power is out on the boiler too. 
 - Really?

107
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,120
I don't think the power light is coming on. What should I do?

108
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,410
 - I will come and pick you up now.  
 - What?

109
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,000
Sleep at my place tonight. You can't sleep there, because it's cold.

110
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,770
That...

111
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,260
Hello?

112
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,500
Oh my! Did you hear that? He asked her to sleep over.

113
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,020
Ba Bi is always straightforward.

114
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,910
I can't keep up with his pace.

115
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,570
This is really bewildering.

116
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,100
Naughty, don't lose to it!

117
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,830
You're an experienced Naughty cell!

118
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:34,070
If your opponent attacks with speed, then you win with experience!

119
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,710
  Hello? 

120
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,870
Yes, I'm listening.

121
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,280
But I'm not sure if I can do that ...

122
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,710
It's cold, so you can't sleep there.

123
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,790
That's true, but..

124
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,510
 I'll be there in ten minutes. Meet me outside. 

125
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,940
All right.

126
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,970
 Caution: slippery surface 

127
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,810
 Did you wait long? 

128
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,470
No, I just arrived.

129
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,910
- Then, I'll get going. 
 - Okay.

130
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,630
I'm on the 11th floor.

131
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,950
Oh, then the view must be really nice.

132
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,860
Who is that? Don't tell me that's Yumi.

133
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,960
She didn't take off the face mask?

134
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,050
  This is crazy, hurry up and remove it! 

135
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,590
  If we remove it, it's an even bigger problem. We don't have any makeup on! 

136
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,590
Oh my ... I didn't ...

137
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:14,260
I didn't remove these.

138
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,810
I was so overwhelmed earlier.

139
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,870
Oh my goodness.

140
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,030
If you saw, then you should've told me.

141
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,940
I thought you put them on purpose.

142
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:34,800
No way, unless I was out of my mind.

143
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,530
I guess not.

144
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,250
I should have told you.

145
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,930
Oh my gosh! I must be crazy!

146
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,780
I couldn't see the mirror since it was so dark!

147
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,930
It's not my fault!

148
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,350
You should rot in jail for at least three years for this!

149
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,380
Love, it's not the time to be focused on the face mask right now.

150
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,510
We're inside Ba Bi's house!

151
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,490
Forget the past, and look at the future!

152
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,580
It's all right. There was a blackout, so what could I do?

153
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,000
Ba Bi will understand.

154
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,390
Yes?

155
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,520
Did you bring clothes to change into?

156
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,050
Yes, I brought them.

157
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,620
Fine, then.

158
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,260
What is this?

159
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,620
Are you crazy? Where did you put her pajamas?

160
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,470
I really didn't know. It was dark so I couldn't see!

161
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,140
These punks, really!

162
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,180
Do you want something to drink?

163
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,930
I have green tea and also grapefruit juice.

164
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,150
Anything sounds good.

165
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:34,710
But ... I didn't bring my pajamas.

166
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,400
I couldn't see since it was dark.

167
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,100
Oh, then I'll bring you some comfortable clothes.

168
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,340
Wear this, it's been washed.

169
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:18,290
 Wait, why did he only give us a top? 

170
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,170
Naughty, what does this mean?

171
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,570
Hey, why are you acting so old-fashioned?

172
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,060
Since Ba Bi's clothes are long, you wear only the top, like a dress.

173
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,280
Really? Is that really what that means?

174
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:39,410
Don't listen to that fool! How can she only wear that?

175
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,110
Shut up if you don't know! Do you want her to be old-fashioned?

176
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,730
- It's a little short. 
 - Yumi, I found the pants.

177
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,510
Oh ...

178
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,820
Pants, the pants. Here.

179
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,080
No wonder.

180
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,530
I'm going crazy.

181
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,780
Yes?

182
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,360
Oh, the pajamas are comfortable.

183
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,220
I'm glad.

184
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,460
Oh, are you going to wash up?

185
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,960
How could he say a line like that without hesitating?

186
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,460
  Then we should also act without hesitation! 

187
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,420
Oh, y-yes.

188
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,230
- W-why? 
 - I also need to wash up.

189
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,930
Huh?

190
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,070
Should we do it together?

191
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,910
Uh ... I ... That ...

192
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,350
That was so sudden. W-wait.

193
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,760
This is shampoo, the conditioner, and this is the shower gel.

194
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,830
Oh.

195
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:40,640
Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel.

196
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,120
Okay.

197
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,460
Then, wash up.

198
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,030
Okay.

199
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,430
How can you imagine something like that?

200
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,020
This is unfair! Naughty told me to write this!

201
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,450
- Is the water warm? 
 - Yes.

202
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,730
Drink some of this.

203
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,530
- I'll go ahead and wash up too. 
 - Sure.

204
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,750
Oh, I take a while to wash up.

205
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,470
Oh, that's all right. Take your time.

206
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,220
I'll watch TV.

207
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,500
 That night was the most romantic night I could dream of. 

208
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,280
 Because I felt 

209
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,720
 I was loved now. 

210
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,830
 In the early stages of a relationship, a sense of dating can be summarized like this. 

211
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,740
 Dating is a Heart-Throbbing Battle. 

212
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,190
 In the morning, when you realize that your boyfriend put a pillow under and covered you with a blanket last night ... 

213
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,440
Our heart is under attack!

214
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,350
It's happening again, first thing in the morning.

215
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:12,730
Ba Bi, what a guy. He is the sort who makes your heart flutter as soon as you wake up.

216
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,670
We're also going to do our morning greeting!

217
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:21,090
Wait, we haven't even checked where Yumi's eye boogers are yet.

218
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,660
 You have to wash your face first. 

219
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,030
- Hey! Ba Bi woke up. 
 - Oh no!

220
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,820
There's no time to wash your face. Just attack!

221
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,840
Did you sleep well?

222
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,080
- My heart skipped! 
 - How could she do that as soon as we wake up?!

223
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,660
Hey. Everyone, wake up. Ba Bi's heart was stolen.

224
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,180
- What? 
 - I just woke up.

225
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,140
We also need to show her something.

226
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,720
Did you sleep well?

227
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,690
I don't even know when I fell asleep.

228
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,100
I was going to tell you to sleep in the bed, but you were already knocked out.

229
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,530
So I let you be.

230
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,440
I see.

231
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,340
But weren't you uncomfortable?

232
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,110
No, I didn't wake up once.

233
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,170
You're hungry, right? I'll make you breakfast.

234
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,910
To do that to Hunger who hasn't even woken up yet, that was mean!

235
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,310
Because we were on an empty stomach, the heart fluttering was doubled.

236
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:52,870
Hey! You just slept like crazy last night and now you come looking for heart flutters?

237
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,410
Did you come to Ba Bi's place to just sleep? Are you at a retreat?

238
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,330
You should've woken me up! Why didn't you?!

239
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,500
Sleep as much as you want when you're dead!

240
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,280
You should've woken me up.

241
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,240
I thought about waking you up, but you were sleeping so soundly.

242
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,650
Next time, I'll take a short shower.

243
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,550
So heart-fluttering!

244
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,220
When is 'next time'? When?

245
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:54,660
Yumi? Thirty minutes at home is enough, right? Can you get ready in that time?

246
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:00,430
Yes, but aren't we both going to be late because of me? You go ahead.

247
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:04,260
It's all right. We can just both be late.

248
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,740
- Let's go. 
 - Hold on.

249
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,470
It's crooked.

250
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,940
♫  Number and tango, secret, chasing the light  ♫

251
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:23,900
♫  The more the problem can't be resolved,   ♫

252
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,660
Oh no. Our heart was stolen again. 
 ♫  the more the night slips away   ♫

253
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,100
Let's go.

254
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,000
♫  Holiday where I wore out my soles 
worn from being on a stomping path  ♫

255
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,680
We have to go to work now, so last but not least,

256
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,310
let's take this and end it.

257
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,980
♫  Color holiday where I waited a long time 
which was a bit cheesy  ♫

258
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,910
Can we change what we call each other?

259
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,340
Pardon?

260
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,570
I want to.

261
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,880
What do you want to call me?

262
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,100
 Yu Mi-Ya 
 (Intimate form of her name)  

263
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,570
Yumi.

264
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:09,410
♫  A late arrival holiday where I ran on my own feet.   ♫

265
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:16,920
♫  I still remember you. It's 24th summer night.   ♫

266
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:26,350
♫  I also unconsciously pretend to forget even my old face  ♫

267
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,010
♫   Holiday where I spread my two arms 
and let my body go on the wind's path  ♫

268
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:35,070
 Dating is a heart-throbbing battle.

 Episode 10: A Cool Point 

270
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:10,480
 A new relationship can sometimes be a turning point in your life. 

271
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,250
 The day that will be remembered as your first kiss. 

272
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,450
What is this place?

273
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,670
It's so cool.

274
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:31,690
I really wanted to come with you here because I thought you'd like it.

275
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:38,000
 TN: Forest of Wisdom in Paju Book City. The city is the home of 250 book publishers and multiple book cafés and bookstores. 

276
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:43,120
I love it so much. Totally.

277
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,620
- It's nice here. 
 - Would you like a drink?

278
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,730
- Yes. 
 - This way.

279
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,720
So this is a book café that's run by a publishing company.

280
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,740
No wonder there were so many books.

281
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,300
Initially, I applied to this publishing company.

282
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,130
This publishing company?

283
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,470
Because I like books so much.

284
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:11,850
But I wasn't talented when it came to writing, so I thought I should be someone who was good at publishing them.

285
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,080
so I thought I should be someone who was good at publishing them.

286
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:20,190
The place I originally wanted to work for was here.

287
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,430
I thought I did well in the interview,

288
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,040
but I didn't make the cut. 
 - Why not?

289
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,040
I don't know. So I went to work for the second place I applied to.

290
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,120
Daehan Noodles.

291
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:38,890
 While we were talking at the book café where Ba Bi took us ... 

292
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,170
A contest?

293
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,850
- I prepared for one before. 
 - But ...?

294
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,460
I gave up after getting ready for it.

295
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,660
I had confidence in my writing, but once I started trying, I couldn't write a single word.

296
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:57,580
You should be brave. With your skills, I'm sure you would have won something.

297
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,230
That courage back then...

298
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,170
You're right.

299
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,970
If I had been brave,

300
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,240
I wouldn't have joined the accounting team that I wasn't cut out for.

301
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,380
You might have become Writer Yumi instead of Assistant Manager Yumi.

302
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,630
That's a bit ...

303
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:23,640
But back then I felt like if I didn't get a job immediately

304
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,290
it would be really bad.

305
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,140
If you think about it now, it's something that wouldn't have been bad.

306
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,280
I know.

307
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,830
 Suddenly I had a strange feeling. 

308
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,490
What is it?

309
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,350
Let's come here often.

310
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,020
I knew you'd like it.

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,380
♫  The raindrops that are knocking on your window  ♫

319
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:55,040
 A new relationship sometimes leads Yumi to a completely different path. 

320
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,540
 Yeonsan Station 

321
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,080
Yumi!

322
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,740
Dad!

323
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,390
- Get in, get in! 
 - Yes.

324
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,730
 Yumi Hardware 

325
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:18,140
Honey! Yumi is here, Yumi is here. Honey, Yumi is..

326
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,910
- Mom, I'm here. 
 - Hurry, sit.

327
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,800
Sit down, sit down.

328
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,380
Why did you make so much food?

329
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,280
- Honey, point the heater on Yumi. 
 - Yes, the heater, heater.

330
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,090
- I just started a diet!
- If you diet too much, you'll die.

331
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,890
Here.

332
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,020
Hurry, eat now. It's delicious.

333
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,080
- Mom, I really need to keep my diet... 
 - Start it tomorrow.

334
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,910
- Eat. 
 - Aigoo, she's your kid ...

335
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,880
It's hot.

336
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,550
- Is it good? 
 - It's good?

337
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,490
Are you eating properly?

338
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,570
Yumi!

339
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:04,400
Dad, what did you buy now? Don't tell me ...

340
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,230
Your favorite steamed buns.

341
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:13,870
Seriously. Mom, Dad, please. If you keep doing this, I seriously...

342
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,350
I will eat it all.

343
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,830
- How is it? 
 - It's good.

344
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,960
Isn't it good?

345
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,530
Steamed buns are the best in the winter.

346
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,720
Eat all of these.

347
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,850
- Is it good? 
 - Steamed buns are good.

348
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,270
 Award 

349
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,200
 Exemplary Award. 

350
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:57,340
  Warning! It seems like Mom is trying to start a conversation. 

351
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,210
You should have brought that guy here.

352
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,570
That guy? What guy?

353
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:09,540
The guy you're dating. That guy named Wu Gi or Buk.

354
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,320
Wu Gi?

355
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,060
Don't be surprised. She's not talking about Wu Gi from work but her ex-boyfriend Wu Gi.

356
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:20,370
It's because the dating data we gave Mom is too old.

357
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,370
Wu Gi is from so long ago.

358
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:27,850
I think it's been more than five years since we broke up.

359
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:31,290
You said you even went on a trip with him last year.

360
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,570
Trip?

361
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,930
 Wu Gi  / Wung i 

362
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,760
It's no wonder Mom's confused.

363
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,200
That was Wung.

364
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,720
Oh, right it was Wung.

365
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,410
Anyway, whether it's Wung or Goong, you should bring him over.

366
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,470
We broke up.

367
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,470
Earlier,

368
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:02,990
wasn't that him whom you were whispering to?

369
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,670
  I made it here. 

370
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,290
 No, my dad came to pick me up. 

371
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,350
 Yeah. 

372
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,810
That guy is a different guy.

373
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:24,790
A different guy? Again?

374
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,840
He's just a guy from work.

375
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,950
Wh-What's his name?

376
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,850
He's just a guy from work.

377
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,410
You're doing well, my daughter.

378
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,290
Don't go making assumptions.

379
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:47,030
Who's making assumptions?

380
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:51,800
So, what's the name of the guy just from work?

381
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,080
You– Why are you looking at this out of the blue?

382
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,260
Why are you looking at your awards?

383
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,230
Just because. I wanted to gain some confidence.

384
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,350
Confidence?

385
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,050
 Perfect Attendance Award 

386
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,630
 Now, look. 

387
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,720
 This award proves that Yumi was born with the potential to be a writer. 

388
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,220
 Participation Award 
 The student above has participated earnestly in the school writing contest and is given this award. 

389
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,360
Participation Award?

390
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,390
It wasn't an "Excellence Award?"

391
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,750
Why did I remember it as an "Excellence Award?"

392
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,560
What are you talking about?

393
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,910
Don't they give that to everyone if you just participate?

394
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,980
That's weird.

395
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,760
You said you had something to show me when we went back home.

396
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,580
- Ow, my stomach. 
 - Stop laughing!

397
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,250
 But since Yumi was young, her dream was to become a writer. 

398
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,020
 That is for certain. 

399
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,220
  Look it up, it's for real! 

400
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,520
 Specialty or Interests: Cooking 
 Future Aspirations: Chef 

401
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,630
A chef?

402
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,750
My dream was to be a chef?

403
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:08,510
It was me!

404
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:12,090
Yumi's original dream was me!

405
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,920
You weren't even part of her dream!

406
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,720
A writer wasn't even her dream job, and you couldn't even win an award.

407
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,060
Writer Cell, what the heck were you thinking?

408
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:27,530
And you said you wanted to quit our job and become a writer?

409
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,980
You can't.

410
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,770
Wait! Don't go making decisions just yet!

411
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,860
 There's a novel we wrote when we were younger.  

412
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,640
 If you read it, you won't be laughing. 

413
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,580
I found it, Bus Man.

414
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,910
  The first novel that Yumi wrote. 

415
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:09,000
This is it! The masterpiece from middle school that contains my infinite potential!

416
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,200
- Bus Man! 
 - Wow!

417
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,870
What the heck! It's so cheesy!

418
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:26,430
I wrote this?

419
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,410
Look at the story.

420
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:35,170
You wrote that novel to be funny, didn't you?

421
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,430
What is the title? Bus Man?

422
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:41,580
It's Bus Man. You don't even have the competence to make a title.

423
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,580
What are you going to do?

424
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,500
Stop teasing Writer Cell!

425
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,790
 Bus Man 

426
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:57,640
 Still, when Yumi was writing this, she was so happy. 

427
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,010
  Ali Baba's Rose, Pitter-Patter Witch's Desk 

428
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:07,020
  At least she was happy then. 

429
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,420
If I continued writing when I was younger,

430
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,020
I could have written a good novel by now.

431
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,620
It's too late.

432
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,200
Hello?

433
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,390
Hi, Ba Bi. Did you eat dinner?

434
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,940
My goodness ...

435
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,010
Hello? It's nothing.

436
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,200
Where are you?

437
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,010
I came out to exercise. What have you been doing?

438
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,220
  I ate lunch until I was really full, then ate dinner, 

439
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,520
and I also ate snacks. Tomorrow we're going to eat cold noodles.

440
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,130
  Impressive. 

441
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,410
Our family is pretty legendary.

442
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,600
I miss you.

443
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,400
I get to see you tomorrow night.

444
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,590
Are you going to keep being like this?

445
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,500
What?

446
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,030
You're making me get "Princess Syndrome."

447
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,430
I'm usually not like this,

448
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,480
but I'm in the late stages of Princess Syndrome because of you.

449
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,960
Isn't that a good thing? You should enjoy it instead of worrying.

450
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,000
Stop telling me I'm good at writing.

451
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,410
Since you keep encouraging me, I think I can become something and start having useless dreams.

452
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,800
You are also good at writing.

453
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,140
No, it's too late.

454
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,400
I should have started earlier.

455
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,190
  Now, it's too late to dream. 

456
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,140
Writer, my foot.

457
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,630
I don't have even the smallest chance, so stop complimenting me over and over.

458
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,630
All right?

459
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:58,440
 Daehan Noodles 

460
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,330
Has Assistant Manager Kim gone somewhere?

461
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,660
She's talking with the Department Manager in the conference room.

462
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,130
Hey, but I think Assistant Manager Kim is getting married.

463
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:16,230
- What? 
 - I think she's getting married.

464
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,320
With w-who?

465
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,820
I wouldn't know. Since she suddenly turned in her resignation–

466
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,980
You're so old-fashioned. A resignation doesn't always mean marriage.

467
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,410
  She must have her own personal reasons. 

468
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,030
She turned in her resignation? When?

469
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:30,470
A little earlier. That's probably why she's talking with the Department Manager.

470
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:34,070
Do you know why she did that so suddenly?

471
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,030
I'm not sure.

472
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,600
Is there something up?

473
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,340
I'm telling you she's getting married.

474
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,160
I don't think that's it.

475
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,900
Hey, how do you know it's not that?

476
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,530
I'll bet you ten thousand  ($8)  that I'm right.

477
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,410
You're really not.

478
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,730
He left again.

479
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,580
  Resignation 

480
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,390
Yumi.

481
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,580
What's going on?

482
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,680
Why are you suddenly quitting?

483
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,970
Were you recruited somewhere else?

484
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,770
No, it's not like that.

485
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,970
Then, do you have any complaints about me?

486
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:34,360
No, no, it's really nothing like that.

487
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:39,260
Then what is it? It hasn't even been a year since you came into the Marketing department.

488
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,040
Why? Is department work not to your liking?

489
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:47,800
That's not it.

490
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:59,210
I thought I should do what I really want to do before it's too late.

491
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,180
What is it that you want to do?

492
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,450
I want to write.

493
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,290
Write?

494
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:11,760
What you're doing right now is writing.

495
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,710
Not advertising writing.

496
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,430
Then what?

497
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:23,370
I want to write a novel.

498
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,010
What's going on?

499
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,680
Ba Bi ... I did it.

500
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,610
Even this morning, you said you weren't sure.

501
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,220
I know.

502
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,070
You said not to encourage you, so I didn't encourage you at all.

503
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:10,680
Who's the person who encouraged you besides me?

504
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,080
Me.

505
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,030
"Me?"

506
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,380
Myself.

507
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:28,210
 While I was thinking about it, I suddenly imagined this. 

508
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:32,140
 What would the 23-year-old me, who was preparing to find a job, 

509
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:35,990
 think of me looking at the present me? 

510
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,140
 At the age of 33, I quit my job to write novels 

511
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,550
  and became unemployed. 

512
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,850
 I must look very pathetic, right? 

513
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,390
 Really?  
 ♫  Today too because my day  ♫

514
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:58,020
 Did I really quit my job to be a novelist?  
 ♫  approaches slowly  ♫

515
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,520
 At 33? 
 ♫  I didn't even expect this   ♫

516
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,340
 Yeah. 

517
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:09,220
 However I'm sorry because you don't have a house  
 ♫  He is playing a joke  ♫

518
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,110
 and not much money saved too.  
 ♫  Why of all days this morning  ♫

519
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:15,830
 And there's a very slim chance for you to succeed as a writer. 

520
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:18,750
♫  without any preparation  ♫

521
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,090
 That's unexpected. 

522
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,180
 What is? 

523
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:27,080
 I can't believe that I had the courage to accept such a reckless challenge. 

524
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,520
♫  I thought about it for a long time.  ♫

525
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,550
 You're cool. 

526
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,590
 Cool? 

527
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:39,830
 Yeah. You're cool. 

528
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:45,310
 Just imagining it, I thought being thirty-three would be terrible and boring. 

529
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:48,860
 But still, there's a cool point. 

530
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,820
 That's a relief. 

531
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:55,240
♫   Love love love ♫ 

532
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:00,680
♫  Can't think of the word that I wanna say  ♫

533
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,640
 They say still having a turning point in life is cool. 

534
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:11,290
♫   Sing a song song song song    ♫

535
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:16,200
♫   so that I can feel your love love love love ♫ 

536
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:21,290
  Episode 11: Electric Rice Cooker 

537
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,510
I will put on the mic.

538
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:26,330
All right, we will start the interview.

539
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,860
Question: I heard Yumi is quitting her job.

540
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,170
Yes, that's right.

541
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,720
She is going to do what she's always dreamed of, writing.

542
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,390
What will she be writing?

543
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:43,480
Actually, I want to write a novel.

544
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,090
Novel? A real novel?

545
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:49,930
Are you talking about a novel that is sold at bookstores?

546
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:51,720
Then like Tolstoy?

547
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,940
You want to be a writer like Dostoevsky? Really?

548
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,810
No, if you give those great writers as an example, then that's too difficult to achieve.

549
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:06,060
Anyway, I also want to be a writer.

550
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:16,190
I see. Woah.

551
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:18,410
Eonni, fighting!

552
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:23,800
Starting from the new year, I am going to take writing classes and write rough drafts too.

553
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,310
I'll also prepare to enter contests.

554
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,660
What a joke, as if that will go well.

555
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:32,060
Then what will Yumi be living off now?

556
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,630
That's a difficult question.

557
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:36,610
That's the problem.

558
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:39,550
What? You didn't have a backup plan?

559
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,210
Stingy, what is your opinion regarding Yumi's resignation?

560
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,750
She's crazy!

561
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:47,090
I'm against this! Against this!

562
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:49,620
I saved Writer Cell to make money,

563
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:53,700
- not for him to spend it all! 
 - Really?

564
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,520
That! That traitor!

565
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,560
No way.  If she intends to nibble away her savings,

566
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,180
tell her to wake up immediately!

567
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,490
Savings?

568
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:08,640
-  Q: How will Yumi eat and live?  
 Ah! I'm thinking about spending my savings slowly.

569
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,320
What is something you expect from Yu Ba Bi?

570
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,690
If I would expect just one thing,

571
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:20,560
I wish he would be lacking in just one aspect.

572
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,690
Because he's so perfect I'm so anxious.

573
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:27,450
How can someone have everything?

574
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:30,200
That's strange!

575
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,080
What kind of plans do you have for this new relationship ...?

576
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,320
That's a very good question.

577
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,670
The tongue cells have become best friends these days.

578
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:45,010
In the future, it'll be more *Beep* Just *Beep* ...

579
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,490
He must be crazy! Stop! Stop!

580
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,840
Turn the camera off!

581
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,080
Stop!

582
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:57,320
Did you get it?

583
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,130
No. What about you?

584
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,610
No.

585
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:04,870
The Julie restaurant is still really popular.

586
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,800
How could it be fully booked in just ten minutes?

587
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,810
But just in case, let's still go on the waiting list. A table could open up.

588
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,980
Or do you just want to have dinner at my place?

589
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,690
What?

590
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,390
 Yumi, your mouth, your mouth. It 's about to rip open. 

591
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:25,990
At your place?

592
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,200
Yeah. What do you think about having dinner at my place?

593
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,900
Christmas at Ba Bi's place!

594
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,510
Do you guys remember?

595
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:51,970
What Ba Bi said last time?

596
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,400
 Next time, I'll take a short shower. 

597
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,980
You don't have to shower!

598
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,990
Look here, I have something to say. Reaction Number 1, listen carefully.

599
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:07,240
- From now on, your mission is important. 
 - Yes, ma'am!

600
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,950
No matter how much you like it, you can't show it outwardly.

601
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:15,570
Why? Isn't it good to be honest?

602
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,300
Being honest?

603
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,380
What do you think about having dinner at my place?

604
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:25,680
Yeah! Yeah! I want to go! I really want to! Yay!

605
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,190
I want to go!

606
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,890
I want to go!

607
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:34,850
If we're honest, it'll be something like this. You want to dance in front of Ba Bi like that?

608
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:37,250
It is embarrassing.

609
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,950
Right? So do well!

610
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,370
Okay!

611
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:44,250
At your place?

612
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,850
Yeah.

613
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,180
Well, we can do that.

614
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,200
If it'll make you uncomfortable, then we can look for another restaurant.

615
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,800
Should we find another restaurant nearby?

616
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,500
Huh?

617
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:05,450
You can't even do that one thing?

618
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,760
I'm sorry.

619
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,660
I must have said it too primly.

620
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,610
This won't do.

621
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:14,220
Reason, come here.

622
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,820
Me?

623
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,750
Try fixing this. You are smart.

624
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:26,840
No. If it's not the restaurant Julie, then honestly it's meaningless.

625
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,070
- Why? 
 - The reason we were going to Julie is

626
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:33,560
because of the special menu that only comes out on Christmas Eve, right?

627
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,480
But looking for another restaurant just because that one it is fully booked

628
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,750
does not suit our current goal.

629
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,300
Isn't that so?

630
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,250
Is that so?

631
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,250
A table opened up at Julie.

632
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:53,640
It might get taken, so I will reserve it right away.

633
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,470
 No! 

634
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,210
What?

635
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,840
You don't need to make the reservation.

636
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,390
Why?

637
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:17,900
Let's ... just have dinner at your place.

638
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,650
I like that more.

639
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,440
Okay then.

640
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,130
I need to use the restroom.

641
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,000
 Ba Bi, your mouth! What are you doing? 

642
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,610
 Your mouth is going to rip open. 

643
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,610
This one is nice.

644
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,600
This one too.

645
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:27,160
Ba Bi looks good in any color.

646
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,590
Reason, run a budget for me.

647
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:36,700
I have chosen some neckties as Ba Bi's present.

648
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,370
Stingy is taking care of Yumi's budget for the time being.

649
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:40,850
Go to her.

650
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,480
Stingy?

651
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,850
She doesn't have a salary anymore so she has to spend sparingly from now on.

652
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,460
I don't like her though.

653
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,560
What the heck!

654
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:56,840
The line is so long.

655
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,140
Why are there so many things she wants to buy?

656
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:06,700
What are you here to get permission for?

657
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:11,620
I just want to buy some soup ingredients for dinner. Like vegetables and anchovy stock.

658
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,710
How simple.

659
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:19,330
Move.

660
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,620
Hey! Who are you to cut the line?!

661
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,880
Get in line!

662
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,250
In emergency situations you don't have to line up, you dummy!

663
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,480
Emergency situation?

664
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,590
What is he going to buy?

665
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,750
Say that again. What did you say?

666
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:43,810
You are going to increase my rent?

667
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:46,130
By how much?

668
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:55,690
Yes. I will keep that in mind.

669
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:57,660
Goodbye.

670
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:08,150
I'm screwed. What do I do?

671
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,290
I already made a budget for the next year.

672
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:15,410
What a variable.

673
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:18,580
Get lost! Everyone get lost!

674
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:24,120
Starting now we are on emergency situation! Know that there is no money to spend!

675
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,920
As expected, do I need to find another job?

676
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,380
Or at least a part-time job?

677
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,250
She should at least do a part time job.

678
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,350
I'm so anxious just being unemployed.

679
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:40,050
Then when would she write?

680
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:42,060
She quit to concentrate on her writing.

681
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:46,020
How about sending Writer back to the grave for writing the useless resignation letter?

682
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,670
Should we?

683
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:52,510
Yes, let's do that. If we get rid of Writer, Yumi will come to her senses.

684
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:56,810
What writing? He can't even contribute a single penny to her living costs.

685
00:55:56,810 --> 00:56:00,740
Wait! I also contributed before!

686
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:01,990
When?

687
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:06,000
 I sent a story to the radio station and won that rice cooker! 

688
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,370
 I won a rice cooker by writing! 

689
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:16,520
I also contribute to living costs.

690
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,150
That's right! That rice cooker!

691
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:21,510
I totally forgot about that.

692
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:24,150
All right!

693
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:25,800
 Let's sell that.  
  Fragile Electronics 

694
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:30,970
 We'll get Ba Bi's Christmas present by selling the rice cooker. 

695
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:40,610
 Carrot Market 

696
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:46,370
 Unopened electric rice cooker for sale. 

697
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:49,130
 It's new and never been used. 

698
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:54,010
 Price is 120,000 won ( ≈ $ 93). Please inquire within by text.  

699
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:58,230
A new product is 140,000 won.

700
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:01,230
So this should be a fair price.

701
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:05,600
 Unopened Rice cooker for sale. 

702
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:12,470
Ba Bi's present that I picked out is 120,000.

703
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,840
So this should work out perfectly

704
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,390
as long as it sells quickly.

705
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,070
 Is the rice cooker sold? 

706
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,870
See? It sells quick.

707
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:35,970
 No, not yet. It's new, never been opened. 

708
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,710
 It's the model I've been looking for, so I'd like to buy it. 

709
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:39,990
Awesome.

710
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:45,570
 But I'm a poor student. Could I get it for 100,000? 

711
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,390
What the heck?

712
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:51,400
 I'm unemployed so I can't negotiate. 

713
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,790
 Then I'll come pick it up myself, so let's make it 110,000. 

714
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:57,000
Are you kidding?

715
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:59,970
 No thanks. 

716
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,310
Actually... Maybe I should just sell it quickly.

717
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:11,650
 If you come pick it up, I'll give you 5,000 won discount. 

718
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:14,990
There. I'm being generous.

719
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:19,900
 I live pretty far. You should at least give me 10,000 off. Please take off 10,000. 

720
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,870
Come one, is he really kidding me?

721
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:25,570
 I know this ad only shows to people living in my neighborhood. No way. 

722
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,440
This is only for neighbors.

723
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,230
 Please just cut it by 10,000. 

724
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:33,490
 No. Sorry. 

725
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:35,850
Hey, Patdol*, forget it. 
 (his username) 

726
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,890
So petty with only 10,000. Seriously!

727
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:40,000
I'm not selling it to you.

728
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:35,630
Here you go.

729
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,730
You can gift wrap it, right?

730
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:38,910
Of course. It's a Christmas gift, right?

731
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:40,130
Yes.

732
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,740
It's 123,000 won ( ≈ $ 95 ).

733
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:44,350
All right.

734
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:57,260
I should've just given him 10,000 discount and sold it to him.

735
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,010
There's no interest after him.

736
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:20,060
 Ba Bi, I just got off the bus. Where should I go? 

737
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:23,190
 If you let me know the location, I'll come to you. 

738
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,610
 I'll come get you. 

739
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:30,610
 There's no need. If you just let me know where— 

740
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:31,490
Yumi.

741
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,770
Goodness!

742
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:36,010
What the ... ! When did you get here?

743
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:39,140
I was out here to match the time when you'd arrive.

744
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:42,870
 No, I don't like this! 

745
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:47,640
Our Yumi doesn't like things like waiting for her and stuff.

746
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,840
She doesn't like stuff like that because it's too much!

747
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,410
What the heck.

748
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,090
What?

749
01:00:55,090 --> 01:01:00,750
Why does that make me so happy?

750
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,130
She says she's happy. Even the sky is pink.

751
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:14,800
That's weird. Yumi used to not like things like this. 
  Dislike #1. Waiting for her thoughtlessly 

752
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,910
Aren't you cold? Your neck looks bare.

753
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:19,910
I'm not cold. I'm really okay.

754
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:23,340
I'm fine...

755
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:26,040
We have to walk a bit to the bakery.

756
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,410
Taking off their coat for her in the winter! Putting their scarf on her!

757
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:34,740
Yumi hates things like this because it makes her cringe!

758
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:37,940
Things like this ...

759
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,510
Hmm?

760
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:43,290
I love it.

761
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:47,390
She says she likes it. She loves it!

762
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:49,290
You don't know anything!

763
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:52,160
Yumi's become weird.

764
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:58,060
- Give that to me. 
 - But that's mine.

765
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,590
Hates strong scents of men's toner?

766
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:02,480
I'm 100% sure of that!

767
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,310
She really hates that.

768
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,570
It smells good.

769
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:10,140
Hmm?

770
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:14,390
I can smell the toner from your scarf. I love it.

771
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:16,150
Really?

772
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:20,130
Yumi's changed a bit...

773
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,640
What the hell, you cell!

774
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:29,320
This one's pretty. Looks yummy.

775
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,480
But it's mocha.

776
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,750
Exactly. You like mocha.

777
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,270
But you don't like mocha.

778
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:39,050
I think it'll be fine. I want to try it.

779
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:42,500
 Yumi likes everything about Ba Bi these days. 

780
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,020
 Can't you tell? 

781
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,190
I was going to get strawberry.

782
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:49,860
I want to try mocha. Let's eat mocha.

783
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:52,270
Mocha!

784
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:53,940
All right.

785
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:57,510
- I'll take a mocha. 
 - Sure.

786
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:59,780
 Is the rice cooker sold? 

787
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:03,190
So he was sorry.

788
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:04,450
What?

789
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:06,250
Let's see...

790
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,460
 Not yet. 

791
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:13,380
 Can I come get it today? 

792
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,980
Today?

793
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:19,170
 Today doesn't work. How about tomorrow? 

794
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,090
 Tomorrow doesn't work. Has to be today. 

795
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:26,580
What is this? He's being unreasonable. Forget it.

796
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:30,980
 Just sell it today. Think of the money you'll get. 

797
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:40,250
 It's possible if it's before 7. 

798
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:43,100
 I'll be there by 6:30. 

799
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,340
Okay.

800
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:48,790
 120,000. If you come get it yourself, 5,000 discount. 

801
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:50,950
 Where should we meet? 

802
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:53,640
 In front of Julie Mall in Baekseok-dong. 

803
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,410
Do you need any candles?

804
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:58,900
Yumi, do we need candles?

805
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,060
No. But Ba Bi...

806
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:05,820
- You go ahead. I'm going to stop by home. 
 - Now?

807
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:09,190
Yes, I need to take care of something. It won't take long.

808
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:17,510
Yumi, let's go together, then. I'll give you a ride.

809
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:22,270
 No. Let's not be pathetic in front of him, Yumi. 

810
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:26,410
No, no. I'll be right back. It'll take less than 30 minutes.

811
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:28,220
I'll be back.

812
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,090
Patdol... Patdol...

813
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:40,620
You really had to do this on a Christmas eve,

814
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:44,450
to pick up a rice cooker.

815
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:47,950
Still this is nice. It's sold.

816
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:02,350
 I'm wearing a gray hoodie. 

817
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:07,370
There he is, a gray hoodie.

818
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:25,250
Excuse me.

819
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,160
Aren't you here for the rice cooker?

820
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:36,870
Aren't you Patdol?

821
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:46,040


822
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:51,420
Excuse me.

823
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:16,550
♫  I'm right here  ♫

824
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:23,170
♫  I haven't changed  ♫

825
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:29,110
♫  I know what my heart   ♫

826
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:34,920
♫  wants me to say  ♫

827
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,550
♫  I will answer  ♫

828
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,970
♫  I like a quiet night  ♫

829
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:51,150
♫  Like I'm running away  ♫

830
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:59,510
♫  While walking at  dawn stop  ♫

831
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:04,870
♫  wherever my toes touch  ♫

832
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:13,190
♫  With a dream , waves and sand  ♫

833
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:20,400
♫  I am  breaking and scattering everyday  ♫

834
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,510

835
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:25,470
 How have you been? 

836
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:26,630
 Yumi! 

837
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:29,080
 How about you? 

838
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,170
 I... 

839
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,790
 Should we grab a coffee and chat? 

840
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,830
 Hello. 

841
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:41,330
 Is Yumi doing well? 

842
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:42,920
 Yes. 

843
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,620
 I regretted not being able to give up my pride. Can you spare me some time? 

844
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:50,170
 I'll wait for you until you come. 

845
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:53,310
♫  I'll get used to  ♫

846
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:56,670
♫  even being alone  ♫
