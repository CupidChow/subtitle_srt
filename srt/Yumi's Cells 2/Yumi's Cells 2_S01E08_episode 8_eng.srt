 Episode 21 Ba Bi's Secret 

4
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,850
Nice to meet you. I'm Team Leader Yu Ba Bi.

5
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,650
- Hello. 
 - Nice to meet you.

6
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,040
- Hello. 
 - Nice to meet you.

7
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,360
- Nice to meet you. Let's all work well together. 
 - Hello.

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,010
All right, let's have some welcome applause.

9
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,510
It would be nice to eat lunch together.

10
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,040
Yes, Team Leader. I've made a reservation at a restaurant.

11
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,420
- Should we take off in five minutes? 
 - Sounds good.

12
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,540
- Then I'll see you all in five minutes. 
 - All right.

13
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,080
 I didn't realize during the interview, 

14
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,920
 but Team Leader is super handsome. HGW*. 
 (Handsomest Guy in the World) 

15
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,620
 There is something you've got to do when you see a HGW.  

16
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,730
 My team leader is a HGW. 

17
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,520
 - A HGW?  
 - The first one looks good. But…

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,450
 But he's got more charming features, too many to just confine him to the term HGW. 

19
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,510
This, this, and this.

20
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,620
 He's so passionate. 

21
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,840
It would be nice if we lowered the colors.

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,600
 He looks sexy when he's concentrating 

23
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,890
 on something 

24
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,180
 Daehan Noodles 
Jeju Branch 

25
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,910
 I admit. It's not enough to just describe this guy as HGW. 

26
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,430
Gosh! I'm sorry. Sorry.

27
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,560
 No. HGW plus sexy. 

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,070
 Team Leader's unexpected charm 

29
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,000
 doesn't end there.  

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,730
Who sent the fax to Good Food? I told an intern to do it earlier.

31
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,430
That was me.

32
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,480
- Do you know that you sent the headquarters' contract to a different company? 
 - Really?

33
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,050
Even the competitor's contract price has been passed on.

34
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,610
Do you think you're still in school? Get it together.

35
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,770
- I'm sorry. 
 - We'll talk about it later.

36
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,400
 This is crazy! He's so charismatic. 

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,350
 HGW. Sexy. Charisma. 

38
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,770
 He's been pouring out three charming features in just a few days. 

39
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,030
 He's hit the grand slam in the shortest time. 

40
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,520
 Yu Ba Bi 

41
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,840
 Suddenly my heart started pounding like crazy and my blood circulation got faster. 

42
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,780
 I ultimately without doubt started liking Team Leader. 

43
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,760
I'll be back.

44
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,750
 Furthermore, we even 

45
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,630
 live in the same neighborhood. 

46
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,740
Hello.

47
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,910
Wow. Do you live here? I live here, too.

48
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,900
I'm sorry but who…?

49
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,670
Oh, I'm… I'm the newly hired student intern.

50
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,340
Ah, that's right. It was Yu …

51
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,920
I'm Yu Da Eun. Hello.

52
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,440
That's right. Miss Yu Da Eun. You live in this neighborhood?

53
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes. That tangerine orchard is my house.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,960
I see.

55
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,790
- Are you on your way to work? 
 - Yes, you too?

56
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,890
Yes. I'm still so nervous.

57
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,370
No need. You should relax.

58
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,510
I will. Thank you.

59
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,240
Then I'll see you at work.

60
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,840
All right.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,560
  I think this must be fate. 

62
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,700
 What to do? My heart feels as if it's going to explode. 

63
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,950
 Person who falls in love easily! Good morning! It's about time you tell the Team Leader you like him. 

64
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,880
 If you've held it in while you found three charming qualities, then you've held it in well. 

65
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,380
 Acknowledge it. 

66
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,320
 Acknowledged. Acknowledged no matter what. 

67
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,340
- Excuse me. 
  - I acknowledge– 

68
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,350
How do you get to work from here?

69
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,720
I transfer the bus twice.

70
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,220
- Get in. 
 - Sorry?

71
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,090
It's cold. Get in. Let's go together.

72
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:05,170
 OMG. Was 'get in' always this sweet? 

73
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,050
 That was the sweetest ever. 

74
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,040
So how's work? Is it doable?

75
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,360
Yes.

76
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,530
We just make you make copies and send faxes. There's less than you thought, right?

77
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,080
No, it's fun.

78
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,400
I'm glad it's fun.

79
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,980
 But when I found his fourth charm, 

80
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,520
 weirdly my heart just settled down. 

81
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,430
 No, I didn't tell him. Team Leader was that. 

82
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,120
 What is that? 

83
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,570
 Do you know what people like Team Leader is called? 

84
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,250
 Neomsabyeok*.  
  (someone so perfect that he's unattainable) 

85
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,190
 Yumi: Ba Bi, good morning! 

86
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,070
 You meet them maybe once if you're lucky.  

87
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,000
 And anyway they already have girlfriends. 

88
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,280
Thank you for the ride.

89
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,250
You go ahead. I need to make a call.

90
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,660
Yes, sure.

91
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,790
Have a good day.

92
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,570
Yumi, did you sleep well?

93
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,240
I had a beer before going to bed.

94
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,010
 He's someone who'd not be with me even if he didn't have a girlfriend. 

95
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,620
 That's what a neomsabyeok is. 

96
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,390
 Marketing Department Team 1 Yu Ba Bi 

97
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,520
 Still, it's okay because I'm someone who falls in love easily. 

98
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,320
 I'll find someone else in a few days anyway. 

99
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,440
It's so nice out.

100
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,760
Hello.

101
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,020
- We meet again. 
 - Hello.

102
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,670
I'm here to get a coffee too.

103
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,870
I'm here to study.

104
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,630
- Do you want something else to drink? 
 - No, I'm all right.

105
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,360
- Then how about a cookie? 
 - It's all right.

106
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,040
Good, then.

107
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,730
Could I have one cappuccino,

108
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,360
Yes.

109
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,480
and one of everything here, please.

110
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,400
- Eat some while you study. 
 - Thank you.

111
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,250
By the way, you're so cool.

112
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,760
- I am? 
 - Yes. I heard you're a writer.

113
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,990
Not yet.

114
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,480
I just got a proposal. Where did you hear that rumor from?

115
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,810
Team Leader bragged about you a lot.

116
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,490
- Really? 
 - Yes.

117
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,020
So I was always curious what kind of a person you might be.

118
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,160
I didn't know that Ba Bi would brag about me that much.

119
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,890
Everyone at work knows that the Team Leader met his girlfriend

120
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,970
at the headquarters.

121
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,370
I see.

122
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,480
Don't you have a boyfriend?

123
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,670
Not yet.

124
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,060
Actually I've never dated anyone yet.

125
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,190
Really? You're so pretty though.

126
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,550
You two look good together.

127
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:57,650
I want to have an office romance like that when I get a job later.

128
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,240
She's still so young. She's a kid.

129
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,410
She's so cute.

130
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,090
Why were we so nervous about going against a kid like that?

131
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,260
I told you, right? That we don't have to worry.

132
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,420
I think we said something unnecessary yesterday. It was unnecessary.

133
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,970
I have a question.

134
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,980
 When did you start liking me? 

135
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,110
 I asked when did you start liking me? 

136
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,480
 Why are you suddenly asking that? It's out of the blue. 

137
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,880
 Because I was curious, all of a sudden. 

138
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,030
 That was probably ... 

139
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,110
 Hold on, I keep all the memories 

140
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,680
 related to love. 

141
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,200
 If you ask when he first started to like Yumi ... 

142
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,940
 Oh, yes! That's right! 

143
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,690
 He first started to like Yumi when— 

144
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,100
 Unconscious Zone 
 Danger! No entry 

145
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,670
 Did you bring it? 

146
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,980
 Here. Love's trying to tell her everything, like an idiot. 

147
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,510
 I took it right before he did. 

148
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:13,230
 Good job. He's way too naive. 

149
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,010
 Why would Yumi be asking that question now? 

150
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,960
 Right after he said that he'd given his jacket for Da Eun to use. 

151
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,300
 You get where I'm going, right? 

152
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,460
 Yes, I've got an idea. 

153
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,880
 It's better 

154
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,350
 to get rid of unnecessary memories. 

155
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,170
 That was probably ... 

156
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,280
 I'm not sure. 

157
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,710
 You're not sure? 

158
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,050
 I don't really remember. 

159
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,090
 How can you not remember that? 

160
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,700
 I don't know exactly when it was. 

161
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:07,460
 At some point, I just started to care about a woman named Kim Yumi. 

162
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,990
 I probably was ... 

163
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,250
 P.Y. 

164
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,760
 I was permeated by Yumi. 

165
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,920
 I'm being serious right now. 

166
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,760
 I really don't remember. 

167
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,890
 I was permeated by you. 

168
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,170
What's going on?

169
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,230
What happened?

170
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,060
Why did I faint?

171
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,430
I was definitely about to answer the question about when I first started liking Yumi ...

172
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,390
Huh? Ah, that's right.

173
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,990
I remember.

174
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,440
That's right. It was then.

175
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,710
 Really? 

176
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,780
 I was dancing? 

177
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,490
Yeah, a little.

178
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,210
Your shoulder dance was cute.

179
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,600
Oh, my. I don't remember that at all.

180
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,970
I really did that?

181
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,200
My heart fluttered for the first time back then.

182
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,750
That was the first time my heart fluttered when I saw Yumi, and&nbsp;—

183
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,000
Is this right?

184
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,440
 Episode 22 Editor-in-Chief Ahn Dae Yong 

185
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,960
 14 years ago 

186
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
I'm hungry.

187
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,880
- I'm hungry.
 - Me too.

188
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,840
 There was a freshman in the same liberal arts class as me. 

189
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,320
I want a giant pork cutlet.

190
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,520
What a surprise.

191
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,840
 I wanted to get close to her. 

192
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,930
 No. 

193
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,850
 I just wanted to be able to exchange greetings with her. 

194
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,130
 So I gathered up my courage, but... 

195
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,750
That's what I'm saying. That's—

196
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,470
Do you ... 
  Hi! You know me, right? 

197
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,110
 That's what I was going to say. 

198
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,630
 But...  Do you ...

199
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,300
know me?

200
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,400
 Love Error: 

201
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,000
 A type of language error that only occurs 

202
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,770
 in front of the person that you like. 

203
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,270
Were you talking to me just now?

204
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:40,030
Well... Do you know him?

205
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,930
Aren't you crazy?!

206
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,810
It's not like you were trying to pick a fight with her! What was that?

207
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,630
Man, that was so embarrassing.

208
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,060
  However, 

209
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,260
 they say that a crisis is an opportunity. 
 The Magic Mountain, by Thomas Man 

210
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,110
How much is this?

211
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,680
-  That day,  
 - It's 35,000 won   (≈ $27) .

212
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,950
 I bought a book that wasn't related to my major, for the first time since I entered graduate school. 

213
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:36,580
 The problem was that the book was extremely boring. 

214
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,970
 I couldn't get through it no matter how hard I tried. 

215
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,780
 I needed to quickly read this, so I could talk to her at least once. 

216
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,200
 She was already halfway through her copy of The Magic Mountain, 

217
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,600
 but I was still on page 23. 

218
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,190
Let's go.

219
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,500
 Will I at least be able to introduce myself to her? 

220
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,790
When I think of someone that I've met in my life who bewildered me, I can only think of one person.

221
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,380
Who is it?

222
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,960
When I was in my freshman year of college,

223
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,840
there was some man who looked as if he was my seonbae by several years.

224
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,260
He suddenly came up and asked me something like, "Have you finished reading The Magic Mountain?"

225
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,590
- Was he in the same major? 
 - No, I didn't even know his name.

226
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,220
- He was probably in a different major, right?
 - Yeah.

227
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,920
I was so bewildered that I asked him why.

228
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,100
He just smirked and said, "I finished it."

229
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,690
Then he left.

230
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,970
- That was it? 
 - That was it.

231
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,350
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

232
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,340
He must have liked you.

233
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,710
Why do you think that?

234
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,320
Men know how other men think.

235
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,940
Didn't he just want to talk to you about anything because he liked you?

236
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,860
I thought that too, but he went to the army right after that.

237
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,380
I have a feeling that that seonbae hadn't ever dated then.

238
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,550
No way! I told you, he was way older than me!

239
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,710
My heart hurts for some reason.

240
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,680
I wonder what he's doing now.

241
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,310
I'll head straight in. I feel like I'll be late.

242
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,150
- You said your meeting at the publishing company is at three, right? 
 - Yes.

243
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,580
Call me afterward and tell me how it went.

244
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,130
All right. Bye!

245
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,370
Be careful on your way back!

246
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,730
Rice with fish roe, cold buckwheat noodles, or the menu set.

247
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,590
Rice with fish roe, cold buckwheat noodles, or the m-menu set.

248
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,960
So he's stuck here again.

249
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,050
This is always difficult even though I try to solve it every day.

250
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:41,210
On top of that, I always get stuck at the very end.

251
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,630
Man, seriously!
   Today's lunch menu: Army stew, Big Pork Cutlet, Stir-Fried Pork Rice... 

252
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,490
It's between rice with fish roe and cold buckwheat noodles.

253
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,130
No matter how much I look at it, both of these look like the right answer.

254
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,320
Man, I'm going to go crazy!

255
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,770
Rice with fish roe, cold buckwheat noodles, or the menu set.

256
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,900
Rice with fish roe, or cold buckwheat noodles?

257
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,800
Yes?

258
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,150
Editor-in-Chief, let's go.

259
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,950
Hold on, hold on.

260
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,980
- I still haven't decided yet. 
 - Pardon?

261
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,800
- We're late, though. We have to leave right— 
 - Wait a second.

262
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,330
I think that rice with fish roe sounds good.

263
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,040
What do you think, Mi Yeon? Do you like cold buckwheat noodles more?

264
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,550
Editor-in-Chief. Your lunch today is going to be a sandwich or pasta anyway.

265
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,980
- What are you pondering about? 
 - What? According to whom?

266
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,410
You made a lunch appointment to meet with the new writer at the book café today.

267
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,260
 The cheesecake here is always delicious. 

268
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,770
 It's somewhat of a small consolation. 

269
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,860
The writer said that she arrived.

270
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,910
The taxi driver must have gotten a little lost because he couldn't find the café. I'll go bring her in.

271
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,630
- Are you Writer Kim? 
- Yes.

272
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,990
Hello.

273
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,690
Editor-in-Chief, Writer Kim is here.

274
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,050
Hello.

275
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,640
I'm Kim Yumi.

276
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:34,170
 Do you believe in fate? 

277
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:38,250
 - No, not at all. 
 - I didn't believe in it either. 

278
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,800
 At least not until I ended up meeting her again. 

279
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,260
Can you believe this situation?

280
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,740
The last new writer that I picked

281
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,840
is none other than her!

282
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,940
It's possible that this was fate from the beginning.

283
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,540
It's kind of salty but it tastes pretty good.

284
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,340
Stuff your face quietly!

285
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,310
Can you stuff cake down your throat at such a historic moment?

286
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,420
- Go and bring BGM*  (background music)   cell here right now! 
 - All right, all right!

287
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,820
He should have done it himself. Why is he making me do it? I'm only going today.

288
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,500
This is the most, most important moment in Dae Yong's life!

289
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:28,200
Huh?

290
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:35,370
Play some background music that suits this destined situation.

291
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,800
- Right now!
- Yes, sir!

292
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,000
    

293
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,550
- ♪ I knew it.

294
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,710
That's it!

295
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:48,640
- That's it! Good! 
   ♪ Even if you can't remember me
 

296
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,570
  ♪ I remember you. 

297
00:24:53,570 --> 00:25:00,930
 ♪ The fated destiny  

298
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,310
  ♪ connecting you and me. 

299
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,140
Bravo!

300
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,330
That was perfect background music. Bravo!

301
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,190
It's nice to meet you.

302
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,610
 Editor-in-Chief Ahn Dae Yong* 
 (dae = great/large, yong = dragon) 

303
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,300
I'm Editor-in-Chief Ahn Dae Yong.

304
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,850
Yes, hello, Mr. Editor-in-Chief. I'm Kim Yumi.

305
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,200
Thank you so much for getting in contact with me.

306
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,640
- I really never even imagined this, but—
 - Have a seat.

307
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,310
You said that you first thought of quitting your job and becoming a writer here?

308
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,860
Yes.

309
00:25:53,860 --> 00:26:00,130
I did, so it feels a bit strange since you said that we should meet here.

310
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:04,160
You and our publishing company have a great connection.

311
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,370
- One moment. 
 - Sure.

312
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,200
Yes?

313
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,710
Are you not going to eat? It's delicious.

314
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,500
Please enjoy. I'm not really hungry.

315
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,480
I'm thankful to the Editor-in-Chief, but he seems to be really cold.

316
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,370
- He doesn't talk much either. 
- Man, I'm not good with that kind of person.

317
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,610
 Yumi. Kim Yumi. 

318
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,010
So her name was Kim Yumi.

319
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,960
I was only able to find it out today.

320
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,900
Your name is beautiful, Miss Yu Mi.

321
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,800
 Kim Yu M— 

322
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,480
I'll engrave it so that we'll never forget it.

323
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,100
Hey, Love!

324
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,910
Don't you see that I'm busy?

325
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,190
You idiot! Yumi is calling us right now!

326
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,160
What?

327
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,980
Excuse me, Editor-in-Chief.

328
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,620
Editor-in-Chief?

329
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,260
Yes?

330
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,990
If there's anything you want to know, please ask.

331
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:38,870
Then are you the one

332
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,910
who will be in charge of my writing?

333
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,720
No, I'm going to be the one in charge of you because he's busy.

334
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,940
Oh, I see.

335
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,750
 What a relief! We're not going to be stuck with the Editor-in-Chief! 

336
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,820
 Our good luck just keeps flowing in! 

337
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,240
You've got a lot of work on your plate right now, Miss Mi Yeon.

338
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,580
I'll take over this one, since it's one that I picked out anyway.

339
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,850
But you have a very full schedule.

340
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,050
I'll just have to put up with it,

341
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:14,640
since Writer Kim Yumi's success is also my responsibility.

342
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,570
Yes...

343
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,010
Thank you.

344
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,860
Thank you for the ride.

345
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,230
Excuse me, Mr. Editor-in-Chief? When should I have the editing done by?

346
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,820
Send it to me by Monday and come to see me at the publishing company on Tuesday.

347
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,110
- Pardon? 
 - What?! Monday? But today's Friday!

348
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,670
Then we're going to have to work on it over the weekend.

349
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,130
What's our weekend schedule?

350
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,920
We planned to meet with Yi Da and Ruby to watch a movie and have a hot pot restaurant tour on Saturday.

351
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,770
Sunday is Seong Mi's wedding. We're booked for the weekend.

352
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,700
Ask him to adjust the time!

353
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,400
We already have previous engagements, so what can we do?!

354
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:22,750
- I ...
 - Won't that be too tough for her?

355
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:28,950
Yes. I think the work schedule is a little tight...

356
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,630
We have to match the publishing schedule, so there's nothing we can do about it.

357
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,730
I understand.

358
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,250
He said he can't.

359
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,610
Why are you agreeing so quickly?

360
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,100
I'm scared of the Editor-in-Chief.

361
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,540
- All right, I understand. 
 - Good.

362
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:51,030
You can send it to the email address on my business card.

363
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,370
- All right. 
 - Let's go.

364
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:13,110
Will she be able to finish it in a few days? She's a total rookie.

365
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,690
Whether she's a rookie or not, she's a writer now.

366
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,770
It's something a writer has to do.

367
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:25,220
 You said she's your fated woman, so why are you being so cold toward her? 

368
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,830
 Hey, can't you talk to her in a kind way? 

369
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,460
  What have you been accumulating since earlier? 

370
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,020
I'm accumulating all the kindness together.

371
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,620
Wait, you should have used some of it on Yumi since you have so much.

372
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,630
I don't want to. I'm going to save it and then use it all at once.

373
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,870
If you save it too much, it'll go to waste, you jerk!

374
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,980
Have you guys already forgotten what happened in the past?

375
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:04,940
 After 364 days of being so sweet, that he was dripping with honey, 

376
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,940
 he got angry just once ... 

377
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,120
 - Wait, I— 
 - I'm disappointed in you, seriously! 

378
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,800
 J-Ji Hye! Ji-Ji Hye! 

379
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,090
That's what happened. I felt so wronged!

380
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:21,790
But if I do the opposite and treat her harshly for 364 days

381
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,920
and then show her affection just once, what do you think will happen?

382
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,560
She'll think, "Oh, so he had this kind of side to him too."

383
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,990
Don't you think?

384
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,350
I'm not sure.

385
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,530
That's why I'm accumulating it.

386
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:39,510
I'll gather a ton of kindness together and use it all at once!

387
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:46,080
Love is being strategic!

388
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,990
I have to stay up all night from now on. There's a ton of stuff I have to edit.

389
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:03,040
- How is the Editor-in-Chief? 
 - The Editor-in-Chief?

390
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,950
If I put it nicely, he's a professional.

391
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,640
If I put it badly, he's totally cold–

392
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,520
Cold? Cold-blooded? Poisonous snake?

393
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,820
Never mind. I don't want to badmouth him.

394
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:18,080
Either way, he's the person who picked my story. So I don't want to talk badly about him.

395
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,330
Although it looks like I'll be pulling all-nighters for the next three days,

396
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,580
I'm not going to badmouth him.

397
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,760
Aigoo. My Kim Yumi's good times have all ended.

398
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,400
I'm serious. I'll have to cancel all my weekend plans.

399
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,090
Even if I do go to my friend's wedding, I think I'll have to just take pictures with her and then come back.

400
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:41,510
By the way, the Editor-in-Chief seems familiar.

401
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:45,960
- Is he famous?
- I looked him up, but he's not.

402
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,190
But I feel like I've seen him somewhere.

403
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,610
Where did I see him?

404
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,440
To put it in one word, chapter five is a mess.

405
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,330
Chapter six is so boring that I dozed off while I was reading it.

406
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,780
Rewrite chapter seven as well. 
  A love triangle 

407
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:12,250
The male lead's mindset is so childish that it made me wonder if there was a man like him in the entire world.

408
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,760
It's unrealistic.

409
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,880
As for chapter eight... just get rid of it and rewrite the whole thing.

410
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,920
On the contrary, the emotions are getting cut off more than the first draft.

411
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,610
In short, it got worse. You changed the angle of the story.

412
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,830
I didn't tell you to edit it for it to turn out like this.

413
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,430
Do it all over again.

414
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,140
All of it? Again?

415
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,930
Yes.

416
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,840
All of it.

417
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,750
Uh...

418
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:56,790
He's so mean! Because you made the timeline so tight,

419
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:01,860
I can't even turn this well-functioning millstone properly because I'm in such a hurry!

420
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,340
- Hey. 
 - Let go!

421
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,150
Rampage, what's wrong with you?

422
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,000
Let me go!

423
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,230
I've got to say what needs to be said! Hey, Editor-in-Chief!

424
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:18,290
Starting now, listen to me carefully!

425
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,630
Yes, sir.

426
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:26,050
I understand. I'll edit it again.

427
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:30,030
Please hurry. There's not a lot of time.

428
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,900
Yes, sir.

429
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,680
Are you going to stay here and work on it today?

430
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,650
No. I'm going to get my things together and work on it when I get home.

431
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:46,390
 I'm going to go home and eat. I also have to eat to live! 

432
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,310
It's really late. Would you like to eat before you go?

433
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,150
I had a late lunch, so I'm not really hungry.

434
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,990
 That's a lie. 

435
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:58,300
Ah, I see.

436
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,950
Even if she had a late lunch, wouldn't she be hungry at nine o'clock?

437
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,800
You fool, she's saying that she's not comfortable eating with you. Don't you even know that?

438
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,200
What? There's no way!

439
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,300
She could have eaten lunch around six o'clock!

440
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,910
If she ate at that time, then isn't that dinner?

441
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,700
- It seems you ate a very late lunch. 
 - Yes.

442
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:33,090
You said that you were saving up your kindness. What the hell is this situation?

443
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:38,150
- Stop it! 
 - This is all your fault!

444
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,250
I understand.

445
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:46,570
Don't forget your manuscript and finish up.

446
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,860
Goodbye.

447
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,010
 I seriously almost died of hunger. 

448
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,750
This is crazy. How am I supposed to write all of this by Friday?

449
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,680
Today is Tuesday, if I write it by Friday,

450
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,600
I bet they're going to tell me to edit it over the weekend. It's so obvious.

451
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,830
I see how he works now. I think he's trying to screw with me, that bast—

452
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,900
That bastard?

453
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,510
No, I don't want to go that far.

454
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,560
Still, he is the savior who picked me.

455
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,850
- Should I not come up this weekend? 
  - What are you saying? 

456
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:43,240
Even if I go, I think I'll just get in your way.

457
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,530
All I have to do is edit it perfectly by Friday.

458
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,470
As you said, you don't know if you'll have to edit it again.

459
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:51,790
No, no, I said no.  I'll be fine.

460
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,390
 What's this again? 

461
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,400
What?

462
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,700
 Editor-in-Chief Ahn Dae Yong 

463
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,990
Ba Bi, I'll call you back.

464
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,840
O-okay.

465
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,140
 Editor-in-Chief Ahn Dae Yong 

466
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,290
 Hello? 

467
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,810
Writer, it's me, Ahn Dae Yong.

468
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,050
 Yes? 

469
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,400
I'm calling because I changed my mind about some things.

470
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:34,600
 I thought I should let you know before you start editing. 

471
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,350
I see. What else is it ...

472
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:40,060
Do you have something to write this down?

473
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,250
One second.

474
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,560
Yes, go ahead please.

475
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:52,490
Yes. Chapter 3 ...

476
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:58,220
The background? Yes, yes.

477
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:02,120
I think it'd be better to change the order of the chapters in the second half.

478
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:09,390
Then I need to change more than what you said before.

479
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,040
That's right.

480
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,400
I called you because I thought you might have started working already

481
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,700
and didn't want you to do it twice.

482
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,310
Yes.

483
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,320
Then good luck, Writer.

484
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,330
 What? Are you ending the call like this? 

485
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,120
 Writer Kim Yumi 

486
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,350
 Did you get home safely earlier? 

487
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:35,290
Have you eaten dinner? There's so many things you could say!

488
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,550
We had to gather so much courage to make this call.

489
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,290
You could have asked a personal question.

490
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:45,810
I was wondering what you are doing now? Or what dramas you are watching?!

491
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:50,800
It doesn't really work to be sweet when you're supposed to be sweet.

492
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,950
It's only kind if it's done at the right time.

493
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,100
It only makes the other person feel uncomfortable if you do it too much.

494
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,350
So, when is his timing?

495
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,470
The time to use his kindness

496
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,500
is right now.

497
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,330
 CEO Big dragon Ahn  
 ("Big dragon" is just a translation of his first name) 

498
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,070
Did you call for me?

499
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:18,480
Miss Mi Yeon, could you run an errand for me, please?

500
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,190
I hate him. I hate the Editor-in-Chief!

501
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,140
You said you weren't going to badmouth him because he's your savior.

502
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,020
I'm not badmouthing him.

503
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,920
I'm saying I hate him! Hate isn't a swear word.

504
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:37,010
Who could that be? Who is it?

505
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,840
Delivery!

506
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,450
I didn't order delivery though?

507
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:50,070
 Yai Doughnuts 

508
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,120
 Who is it? 

509
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,640
It seems someone sent me donuts.

510
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,700
I think they've sent it to the right house, but who could it be from? 
  1344-4 Baeseok-dong, Ilsan-dong-gu, Apt 403 Kim Yumi 

511
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,680
Huh?

512
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:17,160
 Writer, the Editor-in-Chief told me to send you some snacks because you are working so hard. 

513
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,400
 I sent doughnuts to your house. 

514
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,180
 I'm delivering a message from the Editor-in-Chief too. Hang in there! 

515
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:29,640
 It may be difficult because of the impractical schedule, but hang in there for the rest of the manuscript. 

516
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,650
 Ba Bi, look at this. 

517
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,390
- Who sent it? 
 - The Editor-in-Chief.

518
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:00,420
 Episode 23: Earthquake 

519
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:08,280
 The day when the aurora appeared in the sky, 

520
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:17,340
An aurora. Wow.

521
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:22,070
 Hunch received a message from the future. 

522
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,220
Is this for real?

523
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,890
Hello? Who...?

524
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,120
- Hunch! 
 - Reason!

525
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,190
Is it true? That you received a message from the future?

526
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:50,150
Yes, I definitely received it.

527
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,290
 You're saying that Yumi's going to succeed? 

528
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:02,380
 She's going to become someone special? You're serious, right? 

529
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,000
 And? What else? 

530
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,060
Huh? Why?

531
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,050
Yumi succeeding as a writer is a good thing.

532
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,280
Yeah, that's true.

533
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,050
But if it's good news why didn't you call the village, but called me in the middle of the night?

534
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,550
There's another problem.

535
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,560
Soon, a disruptor is going to show up

536
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,040
and distance us from Ba Bi.  Why? 

537
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,520
What? Who is the disruptor?

538
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,240
My hunch says it's Da Eun!

539
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:57,260
 I have a question. 

540
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:02,080
 When did you start liking me? 

541
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,770
 Hunch cell's ominous hunch 

542
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,040
 eventually led to Yumi's question, but ... 

543
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,570
Huh?

544
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,720
 - You're so cool.  
 - I don't think it's her.

545
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,350
It's not?

546
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:18,670
Look at her! What are you seeing that's making you suspicious?

547
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,900
She just ended up saying something unnecessary to Ba Bi for no reason.

548
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,930
Is it not Da Eun?

549
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,820
- I'm going! 
 - Oh, okay. I'm ...

550
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,390
I'm sorry, Reason.

551
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:46,020
Hello?

552
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,130
- Are you sure this time? 
 - Yes.

553
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,760
I'm sure! The disruptor is the Editor-in-Chief!

554
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,880
The Editor-in-Chief makes Ba Bi misunderstand.

555
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,360
You saw earlier too, right? When Ba Bi reacted to the doughnuts.

556
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,200
- Could it be? 
 - My hunch is definitely right!

557
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,400
It's Ahn Dae Yong. You have to be wary of Ahn Dae Yong.

558
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,540
But he's the Editor-in-Chief, what can we do?

559
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,940
 My Love Muse 

560
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,630
It's better.

561
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,240
Yes, it got a lot better.

562
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,350
Right? I also really enjoyed it, Writer.

563
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,690
- Thank you. 
 - You did great.

564
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:53,260
Oh no, not at all. That's such a relief, really.

565
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:58,510
Did you eat lunch late again today?

566
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,170
Sorry?

567
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,640
No.

568
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,410
Then, let's eat dinner together. You've worked hard.

569
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:12,340
Yes, ask the Editor-in-Chief to buy us something delicious!

570
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,920
Oh, uh, sure.

571
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,220
Let's meet on the first floor in ten minutes. Miss Mi Yeon, please bring her with you.

572
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,950
Yes, sir.

573
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:23,700
Oh right! Editor-in-Chief.

574
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:29,190
I was really thankful for the doughnuts the other night. I enjoyed them.

575
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,130
 Conference Room 

576
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:44,370
This is it, this is it! This is the strategy of love!

577
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:48,950
 I'll make another step towards her today! 

578
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,450
Do you like it?

579
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:07,430
It's so good.

580
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:09,850
 Current time 7:55. 

581
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:14,130
 As we're finishing eating, I use a skill. 

582
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:20,410
Could I get another bottle of the same wine?

583
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,430
Yes, sir.

584
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,480
 Nice wine time. 

585
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,580
 A dating technique that extends the meal time by ordering wine at the end of the meal. 

586
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,280
You're ordering another one?

587
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,720
Aren't you overdoing it?

588
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,670
Since the writer is enjoying it so much.

589
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,190
It's all right.

590
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:46,090
But it is good.

591
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:47,960
Please enjoy.

592
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,730
 If my calculations are correct, Mi Yeon will leave at 8:10 pm. 

593
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:14,250
But, what should I do ...

594
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,870
I think I have to get going.

595
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,080
 Nice! 

596
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,880
Really? Why?

597
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,510
 It's because Mi Yeon's been married for three months 

598
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,890
 and her husband leaves work at 8 pm. 

599
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,400
You can't. We just ordered another wine. Who's going to finish it?

600
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,050
Let's just finish this and all leave together.

601
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:35,540
I'm sorry. My husband and I are going to see a late-night movie tonight.

602
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,060
Then we can't make you stay.

603
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,240
Then let's all leave together now.

604
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,740
 N-no! Shut her mouth! 

605
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,780
How about we two finish this then leave?

606
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,450
Since it's getting late.

607
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:55,980
Oh… Sure.

608
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,070
Someone's coming over there.

609
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:09,780
- Who are you? 
 - Yeah, who are you?

610
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,830
Yo, hi.

611
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,730
Stop, stop.

612
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:19,100
Do you know the password?

613
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,800
- I don't. 
 - Y-you don't?

614
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,680
Then you can't get through.

615
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,650
If you're cute, you can, but you're not cute.

616
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:27,050
That's right.

617
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:33,460
I'm here to open the gate of heart myself. So don't mind me and do your thing.

618
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:36,060
You're going to open the gate of heart yourself?

619
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,090
What's he doing?

620
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:41,610
You must not know that if you relate to a person more than three times,

621
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:45,020
the gate of heart opens up.

622
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,520
You said that you like Writer Lee Dong Geon, right?

623
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,310
Yes, I'm a big fan.

624
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,780
Then have you read his new release? It's really good. It's called—

625
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,870
- '100% Sweetness'! 
 - 100%

626
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:08,030
 You have related once. 

627
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,290
You enjoyed it too.

628
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,310
I really enjoyed it as well.

629
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:15,430
Writer Lee Dong Geon must be a genius.

630
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:17,020
It gets better every time.

631
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:22,470
I've met him and he really is a genius.

632
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:24,420
Really?

633
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,320
Are you close to him?

634
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:34,280
I'm close enough to meet and call him once in a while.

635
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,650
That must be great.

636
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:40,470
My wish is to meet him in person one day.

637
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:45,970
Let's meet him together if an opportunity comes up next time.

638
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,800
Really? Wow. I'm so excited.

639
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,830
- What's going on? 
 - One of the latches disappeared!

640
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,980
All right, shall I loosen the rest of the latches?

641
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:04,230
This won't do! It must really be Ahn Dae Yong!

642
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,600
I need to alert the village.

643
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,800
Wait for me!

644
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,300
Should I recommend a few books similar to '100% Sweetness'?

645
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,220
That would be great!

646
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,560
I always upload my recommendations on my social media.

647
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,000
Are you on social media?

648
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,130
I don't use it very often, but I am on social media.

649
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:25,030
Just a minute.

650
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:29,940
 Social media is the best master key to relating with one another. 

651
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,330
That's my social media account.

652
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:35,040
I see.

653
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:35,990
 Relating 34% 

654
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:39,740
 Now, let's find things we can relate to. 

655
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,410
 Relating in progress. 

656
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:47,570
 Hehe. So excited. I love Hawaiian burgers. 

657
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:52,980
We really have a similar tastes.

658
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,230
I only eat Hawaiian burgers too.

659
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:57,780
Really?

660
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,480
What are you saying? We prefer bulgogi burgers.

661
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,800
Shut up.

662
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,220
That's not important!

663
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:10,220
 My favorite churros. 

664
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,340
Oh my, you like churros, too?

665
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,740
My favorite snack is churros.

666
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,690
I know the best churros place in Seoul. Should I tell you?

667
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:21,100
Yes!

668
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:25,410
 You've related twice. 

669
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:35,010
Shall I loosen the last latch?

670
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,720
Where is that churros place?

671
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,590
I'll send you the link for that later.

672
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:45,020
Ah, all right.

673
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,660
 Related with books and food. 

674
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,750
 Let's find the last topic. 

675
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:58,220
 If I didn't close my eyes and open my mouth, this would've been the pic of my life. 

676
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:00,910
 My boyfriend. 

677
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:13,550
This must be your boyfriend.

678
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,320
Yes.

679
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:19,630
That's not really a good picture.

680
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:26,380
Since your ring was on your right hand, I thought…

681
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:31,150
It was too loose on my left finger, so it kept falling off.

682
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:33,690
So I had to wear it here.

683
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:35,600
I see.

684
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:40,160
It was indeed a couple ring.

685
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:49,440
Your boyfriend looks like a celebrity.

686
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,920
You look good together.

687
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,980
Thank you.

688
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:27,410
Let's stop it now. She even has a boyfriend.

689
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:30,560
In any case, It wasn't meant to be.

690
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:34,770
I don't believe in fate anymore.

691
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:37,180
Right, let's not believe in fate anymore.

692
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,730
Let's not believe in it

693
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:42,430
and let's return to being the competent editor-in-chief, Ahn Dae Yong.

694
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,450
There is no fate.

695
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:52,020
There is only choice.

696
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,180
Choice?

697
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:59,600
Let's initiate plan B starting now.

698
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:07,880
I really enjoyed dinner, Chief Editor.

699
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,350
You've worked so hard. This was nothing.

700
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:15,100
Still, it was really tasty.

701
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,070
- Writer Kim. 
 - Yes?

702
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:22,940
Do you know how I became editor-in-chief of a publishing company when I majored in business?

703
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,980
No.

704
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:30,330
Do you know what was the first literary work I read?

705
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,740
What are you doing right now?

706
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:49,370
Was your plan B telling her that she was your crush?

707
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:52,750
You can never!

708
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:57,180
She has someone that she loves.

709
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:01,740
Are you going to be the disrupter? Are you going to make them break up?

710
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,650
What's Dae Yong's full name?

711
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:09,680
What are you saying?

712
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,280
Tell me! What's Dae Yong's full name?

713
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,980
Ahn Dae Yong.

714
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:24,510
Yes, you punk. Do you get it? 
 ("Ahn Dae Yong" sounds like "andwae - yo" = "you mustn't, it can't be" in polite form) 

715
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:27,610
You can't do this!

716
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,530
I can't do this. (Ahn Dae Yong)

717
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:50,380
 Ahn Dae Yong who loves literature and romance 

718
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,560
 can't act like this. 

719
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,060
 He can't. 

720
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,540
Editor?

721
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:07,020
What was the first literary book that you read?

722
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,380
Oh.

723
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,630
I'm not sure.

724
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:22,190
Sorry?

725
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,540
What was it?

726
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:32,120
I suddenly can't remember.

727
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,910
Wait!

728
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:49,210
I don't think it's Ahn Dae Yong.

729
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:55,030
Please get home safely, Writer Kim.

730
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:57,890
Goodbye.

731
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:17,050
 Adiós, Kim Yumi. 

732
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:21,070
 Adiós, my first love. 

733
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:27,120
 You are just my precious Writer Kim now. 

734
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:31,410
 Kim Yumi 

735
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,710
It's not him.

736
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:59,020
He's not a disruptor.

737
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,930
So it wasn't Ahn Dae Yong?

738
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,690
Then who could it be?

739
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:06,670
Don't you think you misunderstood the message?

740
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:08,630
No way.

741
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:12,640
From now on, don't wake me up unless you are sure.

742
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,260
Reason, I'm sorry.

743
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:22,360
Is it really possible I misunderstood the message?

744
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:39,710
Ba Bi!

745
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:43,300
 Yumi. I'm sorry I couldn't call you yesterday. 

746
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,270
I guess you got home really late.

747
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:49,400
My coworkers wanted to go for a second round so I couldn't be the first to leave.

748
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,570
I see. Did you drink a lot?

749
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,370
No. I didn't drink a lot.

750
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:56,790
- I drank a lot yesterday. 
 - Da Eun suddenly quit.

751
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:58,370
What?

752
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:02,020
Da Eun quit?

753
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:06,760
Yes, she quit yesterday so we had a team dinner.

754
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,350
Why?

755
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:13,690
 She said she got a job at a company in Busan. I think her professor recommended her. 

756
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:16,430
Then she's moving to Busan?

757
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:21,860
Yes. Her sister lives in Busan, so she's going to stay there.

758
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:26,910
Really?

759
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:30,350
That's good that she even got a job before she graduated.

760
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:32,640
 Yes, it's a good thing. 

761
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,790
 I see. 

762
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:39,100
But who did you get wine from?

763
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,950
 From the editor-in-chief and Mi Yeon. 

764
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:47,740
 This time it's wine? That editor-in-chief must be rich. 

765
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,760
He said it was for working hard all night.

766
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,070
I'm sure he doesn't just have one or two contracted writers.

767
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:59,220
But giving snacks or wine every time ... He must be a really competent man.

768
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:03,220
What? Is Yu Ba Bi jealous?

769
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:04,330
I'm not jealous.

770
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:07,500
I think you are being jealous.

771
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,880
 You were jealous of the doughnuts and wine. 

772
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,550
 I'm right. 

773
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:15,290
 If I say you're right, are you going to stop eating them? 

774
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:17,430
 If you admit it, I will. 

775
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:19,560
 I'm jealous. 

776
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,370
 - Are you happy? 
 - I'm so happy. 

777
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,970
 Always be jealous, it's thrilling. 

778
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:27,980
 My pervert. 

779
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,630
 What about your hangover? 

780
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,190
Team Leader!

781
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:04,550
Where are you going?

782
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:07,990
To work. I left my car there yesterday.

783
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,650
Oh, that's right.

784
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:10,850
What about you?

785
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:15,930
- I'm going to meet up with my friend. She wanted to see me before I left. 
 - I see.

786
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:17,190
When are you going to Busan?

787
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:19,690
I'm going to have lunch, so sometime in the afternoon.

788
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:22,250
You're leaving right away. Are you flying?

789
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:25,070
- Yes. 
 - I see.

790
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:27,310
Take care of yourself.

791
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:29,090
I will.

792
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:34,780
Team Leader, thank you for everything.

793
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:39,160
There's nothing to be thankful for. You worked hard.

794
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:46,090
No, I really learned a lot and it was really fun.

795
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:48,850
I'm really thankful.

796
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:50,510
All right.

797
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,350
- Well ... 
 - Huh?

798
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:19,950
Actually, I'm someone who falls in love easily.

799
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:23,060
People like that don't usually confess their feelings.

800
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:28,130
Because after a few days, the person they like changes.

801
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:34,820
But recently I started to like someone.

802
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,670
He was a little different.

803
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:54,630
 Every day I would only think of him and wanted to know more about him. 

804
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:57,940
 I thought I was someone who falls in love easily. 

805
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:03,100
So it worked out for the better since I got a job first.

806
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,240
- So that's why you are going to Busan?

807
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,080
Well, partially.

808
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,580
Why? It's not wrong to like someone.

809
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,210
That's true.

810
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:18,650
There's nothing wrong with liking someone

811
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:24,340
but he has a girlfriend.

812
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,080
 "He won't know what I'm talking about." 

813
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,950
 That's what the kid, Da Eun, thought. 

814
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,960
It's better not to say anything in this situation, right?

815
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,870
 This is something you can't pretend you don't understand. 

816
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:46,160
Yes, if you don't have to, then it's best not to.

817
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,540
I think what Da Eun is saying right now is dangerous.

818
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:53,230
You're right. What she just said ...

819
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:59,410
This is an earthquake, right?

820
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:02,950
It's an earthquake. Everything is shaking.

821
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:07,850
It stopped.

822
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:10,470
Love!

823
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:12,730
Reason.

824
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:14,210
What happened?

825
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:16,890
What was that earthquake about?

826
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:19,680
If you ask me about natural phenomena it's difficult for me to say.

827
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,570
Then whom should I ask?

828
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:23,850
It's an earthquake caused by what Da Eun said.

829
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:27,070
Why is there an earthquake from something that kid said?

830
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:30,230
It's because anyone who heard that would be surprised.

831
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:32,340
Right?

832
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,250
You know that kid is bold.

833
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,790
The bus is coming.

834
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,220
Then have a safe trip.

835
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,030
Thank you.

836
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:52,330
Take care.

837
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:54,610
Goodbye.

838
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:59,400
 To Hanlim 

839
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:16,900
 Don't give it too much meaning, it was nothing. 

840
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,820
 It was just a little tremor, wasn't it? 

841
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,760
 It really was nothing. 

842
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:47,360
 Sudden Cold Wave Warning 

843
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:08,640
- I probably packed everything, right? 
 - Yes.

844
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,690
If not, call me if you need anything.

845
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:28,820
I'm leaving.

This is a real earthquake!

852
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:23,680
What do we do?

853
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:30,220
This isn't a small tremor!

 Yumi's Cells 2

 This is illustrator, Control Ji. 

874
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,620
 Not Control Ji, it's Control Z. Z! 

875
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,100
 What did you think of the manuscript? 

876
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:48,260
 I think the couple that comes out here is too honest with each other. 

877
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,010
 Should I say it's not realistic at all? 

878
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:52,510
 You put your place up for sale? Why? 

879
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:54,250
 I think I should move closer to work. 

880
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,810
 That's a shame. 

881

 Miss Da Eun? 

882
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:59,170
 He put his place up for sale. 

883
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:03,480
 Why? Because of me? 

884
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:07,520
