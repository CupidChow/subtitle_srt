 Yumi's Cells 2

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,980
 Episode 18 
 The Turning Point 

4
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,700
 The final results of the Seojin Literature New Writer Contest 

5
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,400
 My name isn't there. 

6
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,010
 When I first failed the writing contest... 

7
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,100
 "Victory belongs to the most persevering." 

8
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,510
 Napoleon Bonaparte. 

9
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,270
 "Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things." 

10
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,220
 Denis Diderot. 

11
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,500
 It's just the beginning. 

12
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,800
 I was able to cheer myself up just by recalling famous quotes. 

13
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,240
 May 

14
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,950
Wow! Eonni Min Jeong's name is there.

15
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,070
She must be so happy.

16
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,050
  When will my name be up there? 

17
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,890
 Even when I failed the second one... 

18
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,180
 "Just because something doesn't do what you planned it to do ... 
 June 

19
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,280
 doesn't mean it's useless." 

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,970
 Thomas Edison. 

21
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,140
 August 

22
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,750
 Prize-winning Works 

23
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,990
 Even the third time... 

24
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:14,260
 "Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat." - F. Scott Fitzgerald 

25
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,160
 Even the sixth time... 

26
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,020
 Although I didn't lose my fighting spirit ... 

27
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,400
I wrote such an interesting story. Why didn't I make it?

28
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,770
I can't accept this.

29
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,610
I can aim for the second half of the year.

30
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,900
 We're almost out of money. Can we keep holding on? 

31
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,770
Last month, she celebrated Dad's birthday and Grandfather's eightieth birthday. Her expenses gradually increased.

32
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,740
Next month, she's got to attend three of her friends' weddings!

33
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,920
What are we going to do now?!

34
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,170
Don't worry! We can just use our budgeted living expenses from the month after next month.

35
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,000
Then what will we live on the month after next?!

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,880
Ah! We can just use the money from the month after that!

37
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,290
Wait, what the heck are you—

38
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,580
  "Those who only live on hope, 

39
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,190
"will starve to death!"

40
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,870
- Benjamin Franklin.

41
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,240
It's Stingy!

42
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,630
Do you think you're the only one with wise sayings?

43
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,090
You parasite-like punk!

44
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,340
 One thousand wise sayings that cheer me up. 

45
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,100
"Strong convictions are more dangerous

46
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,530
enemies of truth than lies."

47
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,450
- Frederich Nietzsche!

48
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,950
Stop it!

49
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,690
 "Know thyself." 

50
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,890
 Socrates. 

51
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,220
 "Do not suppose opportunity will knock twice at your door." 

52
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,450
 Nicholas Chamfort. 

53
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,650
 They say that everyone has a turning point in their life. 

54
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,130
 On the day that she failed for the seventh time, 

55
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,550
 Yum's life started going downward. 

56
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,400
The puppy goes around sniffing like this.

57
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,630
It goes around like this and sometimes a clue appears.

58
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,680
And if you find those clues ...

59
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,970
He found a snack.

60
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,720
Wow, so it was right there!

61
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,330
The dog finds them like this, and you get more bonuses the faster you find them.

62
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,210
I see. That isn't hard!

63
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,240
What are you guys having such fun with?

64
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,140
Section Chief!

65
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,460
Are you playing a game?

66
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,730
I was learning about it because I heard it's popular these days.

67
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,000
It's called Bow-Wow Time.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,120
Oh, is this really popular these days?

69
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,390
It's totally popular!

70
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,120
There probably isn't anyone who isn't playing this game.

71
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,290
You install it too, Section Chief!

72
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,980
That's right! You're raising a dog called Bomi.

73
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,680
You will probably like this a lot then!

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,070
There are all kinds of dogs here.

75
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,300
Look at this. They're so cute.

76
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,050
What's the name of the game?

77
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,360
Bow-Wow Time. Bow Wow.

78
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,280
That's cute— Ah, no, what?

79
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,700
Bow Wow and Time.

80
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,260
 She's the oppposite of someone, whose life took an upward curve after hitting rock bottom. 

81
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,930
But are you two still seeing Kim Yumi?

82
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,180
- Yes. 
 - Of course. Why?

83
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,570
Well, I was just wondering how she's been doing these days.

84
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,980
It's been a while since she quit working last year.

85
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,850
She's writing these days.

86
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,200
Is it going well? Did she make a debut?

87
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,440
No.

88
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,400
Then?

89
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,930
Section Chief, anyone could be a writer if it was that easy to  debut.

90
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,850
She's just working hard, even though there are no guarantees.

91
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,650
There it is, there! Right?

92
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,690
It's already been a year, so how is she making a living?

93
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,600
 Sundol Books 

94
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,200
 It's been a few months since she started working part-time at her favorite bookstore 

95
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,000
 because she was short on living expenses. 

96
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,580
Welcome!

97
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,990
Boss.

98
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,230
You're eating lunch now?

99
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,720
Yes.

100
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,050
- How did it go? 
 - What?

101
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,040
The contest. Don't they announce the results today?

102
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,250
Yes.

103
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,070
But they'll do it late in the afternoon.

104
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,630
It's that story that you showed me the last time, right?

105
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,750
It was so interesting! I think it'll go well.

106
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,580
No, I'm not expecting it to.

107
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,780
No, it was really interesting.

108
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,510
I think you can expect it to.

109
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,950
Really, please don't expect anything.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,100
I really don't have a feeling it will. I won't win.

111
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,970
Why are you so sure that you'll lose, when the results haven't even come out yet?

112
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,280
Because I've lost so many times already.

113
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,790
I'll see you tomorrow!

114
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,550
Bye, Yumi!

115
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,450
 The eleventh contest. 

116
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,320
 She said that, but she was actually internally looking forward to it this time. 

117
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,800
 Because... 

118
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,460
 My Love Muse  
 - Miss Kim Yumi!

119
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,420
Yes?

120
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,650
Miss Yumi, your story is really great this time!

121
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,830
Oh, really?

122
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,910
Thank you.

123
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,960
You should enter it into a contest.

124
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,040
The teacher said it's interesting!

125
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,210
We finally got acknowledged!

126
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,530
Hey, you fools!

127
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,100
Is this the first time she's gotten a compliment?

128
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,500
This is the first time she's been complimented this much!

129
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,020
She told her to enter it into a contest!

130
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,730
That's right! I've got a good feeling about this!

131
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,390
Are we finally going to win?

132
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,290
I also feel confident this time, you guys!

133
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,570
I think we can look forward to it a little.

134
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,080
Ba Bi!

135
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,230
 Where are you? 

136
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,240
I'm on my way home from work. Where are you?

137
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,030
I was on my way back from eating lunch, and the weather was so nice, so...

138
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:26,770
♫  Let's build a little house in front of the river  ♫

139
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,000
I stopped by the coast for a second. Isn't the ocean really pretty?

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,050
Yes.

141
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,950
It looks completely unreal.

142
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,150
 This path is so nice. Let's walk it together when you come. 

143
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,450
♫  My dear  ♫

144
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,950
 Ba Bi's life also took an upward curve. 

145
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,010
 Ba Bi got promoted to Team Leader last summer 

146
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,620
 and was transferred to the Jeju branch. 

147
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,170
 I miss you, Ba Bi. 

148
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,770
 You'll see me tomorrow. 

149
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,840
I wish tomorrow would come quickly.

150
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,120
You said you're taking the one o'clock flight, right? I'll go and wait for you.

151
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,000
 We are currently in a long-distance relationship. 

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,670
Team Leader! Let's go! The meeting is starting soon!

153
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,320
 Okay! 

154
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,880
 I've got to go. 

155
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,820
 You must be busy. Hurry and go. 

156
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,000
 All right. I'll call you again when I get off work. 

157
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:23,280
Sure.

158
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,350
♫  Love grows deep  ♫

159
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,510
 If I could give Ba Bi some good news tomorrow, 

160
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,440
 how great would that ... 

161
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,300
♫  so they won't leave any marks  ♫

162
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,850
 The eleventh contest was the largest-scale contest 

163
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,380
 and the one I looked forward to the most. 

164
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,860
 27th Julie Literary Contest 

165
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,900
 Grand Prize - Kim Min 
 First Place - No Seung Yeon, Park Eun Ha 

166
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,780
 Second Place Mid-Length Novel: Kim Su Ho 
 Second Place - Short Story: Choi Su Bin 

167
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,590
She failed again?

168
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,500
You said that she would make it this time.

169
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,790
The teacher said that it was good, too!

170
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,790
Everyone said that she could expect it to happen.

171
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,030
I failed again.

172
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:16,080
"The ideal man bears the accidents of life with dignity and grace

173
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,010
"making the best of circumstances-"

174
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:18,940
Excuse me.

175
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,750
Huh?

176
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:26,000
We came because you said we'd have a party to celebrate Yumi becoming a writer.

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,430
That...

178
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,930
We rented a bus and all the cells are coming in right now,

179
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,090
so aren't we having a party?!

180
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,050
Endorphin won't perform today?

181
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,460
I cancelled all my plans to come here. What are you going to do about it?

182
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,530
- Hey! 
 - Endorphin is really not coming?

183
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,660
About th-that...

184
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,370
You said that Yumi was going to become a writer!

185
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,550
You told us to really look forward to it!

186
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,050
How many times has it been already, you scammer?

187
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,660
How many times?

188
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,880
I'm sorry!

189
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,810
That cell is really ...!

190
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,580
 I really thought ... 

191
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,050
 I really thought that she'd at least make runner-up this time. 

192
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,120
 I'm sorry. 

193
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,400
 Writer Cell 

194
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,040
Dig it deep. Deeply.

195
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,170
Stingy.

196
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,270
Let's just let her off easy.

197
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,520
Writer Cell worked really hard, too.

198
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,170
She can't help that she doesn't have any luck.

199
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,930
What's this?

200
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,140
Yumi's remaining bank balance.

201
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,760
If you don't want me to make Writer go back to the grave,

202
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,110
you need to take cruel measures and talk to her.

203
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,810
Cruel measures?

204
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,560
 That's the only way she'll give up. 

205
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,260
 I'm telling you to talk to her so cruelly that she won't  be able to endure it without quitting! 

206
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,350
 Very cruelly! 

207
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,700
You...

208
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,840
have no talent!

209
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,630
 Very untalented 

210
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,130
 Very untalented 

211
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,400
 Is there anything as cruel as acknowledging reality? 

212
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,420
 Do you acknowledge that you have no talent? Hm? 

213
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,990
Yeah. I acknowledge it.

214
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,370
♫  The moment I think about you  ♫

215
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,960
Ba Bi!

216
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,510
- Yumi, did you have dinner? 
 - Yes.

217
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,680
Did you have dinner?

218
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,920
I came to eat dinner with my team members.

219
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,070
Galchi jorim*, can you see it? 
  (Braised beltfish)  

220
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,940
Wow, that looks delicious.

221
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,370
Is something wrong?

222
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,920
Why?

223
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,600
You look listless.

224
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,520
No.

225
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,390
It's because I got sleepy after I ate dinner.

226
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,100
I want to eat galchi jorim too.

227
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,170
Let's come here together tomorrow.

228
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,640
I'm totally looking forward to it.

229
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,910
Oh, right. Did you say the results of the Julie Literature Writer Contest would be released tomorrow?

230
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:39,660
Oh... The results came out today. I failed again.

231
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,450
Oh, really?

232
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,710
I think my stories are ahead of their time.

233
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,910
They say that time doesn't recognize geniuses.

234
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,000
This company is lacking.

235
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,060
That's right.

236
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,070
Goodness, writing really isn't going the way I want it to.

237
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,320
It's okay. This is just the start. Take it easy.

238
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,870
Of course.

239
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:09,010
Ba Bi! I'm really looking forward to the Jeju food tour tomorrow!

240
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,790
You have to plan a really good course, okay?

241
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,720
 Of course, just trust me. 

242
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,590
Let's go around the south side of Jeju tomorrow, then the eastern part the next day.

243
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,410
And on the last day we should go to the western side on the way to the airport.

244
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,110
 So you've already planned everything, Yumi. 

245
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,190
 She purposely cheered herself up 

246
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,580
 because she was worried that depression would overtake her. 

247
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,130
 Because tomorrow is their first reunion in a long time. 

248
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,040
Hello?

249
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,250
Hello, Section Chief.

250
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,760
Have you been well?

251
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,370
Yes, and you?

252
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,970
Why are you calling?

253
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,070
Well, I heard about you from Yi Da. She said that you have some free time,

254
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,120
so I was just wondering.

255
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,600
What?

256
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,440
Yes.

257
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,660
I'm here to meet with Nam Ju Hyeok, section chief of the accounting team.

258
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,330
May I have your ID, please?

259
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,930
 Two employees from the accounting team suddenly quit, 

260
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,660
 so I was wondering if you were thinking of working part-time. 

261
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,530
- Hello, Miss Yumi.
- Hello!

262
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,960
Wow, it's been so long since I've been here.

263
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,810
Miss Yumi!

264
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,000
Oh, Section Chief!

265
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,520
You can do it for a month to start off with, right?

266
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,970
I'm having a hard time since I'm suddenly having to look for employees.

267
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,100
Yes, of course.

268
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,870
Thank you, seriously.

269
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,390
I feel like my anxiety is all flying away since you said that you'd do it!

270
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,830
I'm the one who's thankful.

271
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,070
I also needed the money.

272
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,200
Is your work going well?

273
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,890
No.

274
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,880
It's not easy.

275
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,360
Writing seems to be really hard.

276
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,720
You're cool. That's not something that just anyone can do.

277
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,340
You're right. It's not something that just anyone can do.

278
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,190
How could they dare?

279
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,680
I just rushed into it without knowing anything.

280
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,180
I think I was more at ease and happier when I was getting a monthly salary.

281
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,570
Then do you want to come back to work?

282
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,050
- What? 
- The position is empty, so I'll have to look for someone with experience anyway.

283
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,070
If you had any thoughts on considering it, then...

284
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,190
Did I just hear that correctly? Did he say return to work?

285
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,660
Wow!

286
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,180
Of course, of course!

287
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,470
Right now, immediately.

288
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,700
- I swear my loyalty! 
 - Hey, hey!

289
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,510
But it's embarrassing to come crawling back with our own two feet.

290
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:58,960
Shut up. Pride, are you going to feed Yumi? Huh?

291
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,190
It's so sudden.

292
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,360
I know that you don't have any intentions of returning.

293
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,550
That's not it.

294
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,340
But still, you can consider it.

295
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,530
We'll post the additional job opening for experienced personnel soon, so just think on it until then.

296
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,120
It's planned for next week

297
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,750
but if you say that you'll do it,

298
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,060
we'll only hire one person.

299
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,280
All right.

300
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,720
I'll think about it.

301
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,580
Thank you for thinking of me, Section Chief.

302
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,200
 Yumi went back to work! 

303
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,560
 - She's earning money! 
- She went back to work! 

304
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,690
I'm so proud of you, Yumi!

305
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,320
Aigoo, I'm so happy!

306
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,740
- Woo-hoo!
- Yay!

307
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,290
 There's nothing going on, right? When do you go to Jeju Island? 

308
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,220
 Today. 

309
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,750
 By the way, Mom. I think I'm going to go back to work. 

310
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,090
 Aigoo! My daughter, you've finally come to your senses! 

311
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,530
 That's right. It's enough that you tried what you wanted to do at least once. 

312
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,150
 You don't have any regrets now, right? 

313
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,130
 I'm so happy! 

314
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,080
 You made such a good choice. 

315
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,910
 You're so wise, my daughter! You're the best! 

316
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,440
Hello?

317
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,910
Ba Bi, I'm heading to the airport now.

318
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,000
 All right, I'm waiting for you. Hurry up and come. 

319
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,190
I have something to tell you.

320
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,580
 What is it? 

321
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,120
I'll tell you when I get there.

322
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,090
Is it good news?

323
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,170
 - It's not bad news.  
 - Really?

324
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,350
- All right. 
 - Bye.

325
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,420
 In the end, she's come full circle back to her original position. 

326
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,990
That's right.

327
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,570
I must be meant to be here.

328
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,940
Give me some money!

329
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,160
I heard Yumi's going back to work. She needs to buy some clothes.

330
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,090
She hasn't gone back yet, though.

331
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,210
She's going to anyway.

332
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,390
That's true. I need to buy some clothes if I'm going to go back to work.

333
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,200
I haven't bought any at all since I quit work.

334
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,620
I guess it is nice to have a salary.

335
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,040
I feel dry.

336
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,710
Hey, Ba Bi. I just arrived.

337
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,890
Yeah, I'll be out soon.

338
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,100
Yes, Section Chief?

339
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,420
Well, here's the thing.

340
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,110
About hiring someone experienced for the position that I mentioned earlier...

341
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,870
Yes, yes.

342
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,970
Oh, ju-just a second.

343
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,250
Yes, please continue. What about the position?

344
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,210
Don't worry about

345
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,620
what I said. Forget about it.

346
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,220
- What?
- The Department Head already has someone in mind.

347
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,570
Man, he didn't even tell me about it.

348
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,240
I'm sorry for pointlessly bringing it up, Miss Yumi.

349
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,230
Oh... I see.

350
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,990
But you weren't thinking of coming back to work anyway, right?

351
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,610
Yes, that's right.

352
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,740
Yes, of course. It's perfectly all right.

353
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,590
I see.

354
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,630
Yumi!

355
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,270
Ba Bi!

356
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,220
 This is an announcement. 

357
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,730
Give it here.

358
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,110
I brought coffee from your favorite place.

359
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,950
Wow, that's great! Thank you.

360
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:56,600
By the way, what's the good news that you were talking about earlier?

361
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,040
Is it something about the writing contest?

362
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,330
Did the ranking change?

363
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,430
What do you mean? Why would the ranking change?

364
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,940
I told you I failed.

365
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh, really?

366
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,010
What's with that expression? Were you looking forward to it?

367
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,010
Well, you said that you had good news.

368
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,510
I'm totally fine.

369
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,010
I've already lost so many times.

370
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,660
It's okay.

371
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,720
It's okay, Yumi.

372
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,280
Thank you.

373
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,370
Also... I'm okay.

374
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,500
Yumi.

375
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,230
I'm not crying because I failed the writing contest.

376
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,180
This is driving me crazy. Why am I acting like this?

377
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,280
Wait, it's really not like that. It's that ...

378
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:27,330
I'm not upset because of the contest.

379
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,040
I teared up because you were talking to me so sweetly.

380
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,120
This seriously isn't it. What's wrong with me?

381
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,880
Then what is the good news that you mentioned earlier?

382
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,410
Oh, that? Forget it.

383
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,740
Actually, I received an offer earlier, so I got excited and called you.

384
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,300
- Offer? 
 - Yes. That offer was...

385
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,860
Yumi.

386
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,460
What is it?

387
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:32,470
 Yumi finally experienced a turning point in her life. 

388
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,260
 Episode 19 
 Cell Village's Aurora 

389
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,400
What is it? What?

390
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,410
Is something wrong?

391
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,240
 Hello Writer Kim Yumi. 

392
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,300
 I'm Julie Literature's Editor-in-Chief Ahn Dae Yong. 

393
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,820
 Though the story "My Love Muse" that you submitted to the last contest 

394
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,350
 was excluded from the winner's list, it left a deep impression on me. 

395
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,900
 So I am contacting you because I want to propose publishing it. 

396
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,640
 I would like to meet you in person and let you know the details. 

397
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,080
Ah, that's great!

398
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,920
Yumi, that's really great.

399
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,300
Why are you crying? It's a good thing.

400
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,070
 In moments where one experiences a special turning point in life, 

401
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,990
 an aurora appears in their cell village sky. 

402
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,880
It's an aurora.

403
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,680
Aurora! Wow!

404
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,020
 If an aurora appears, 

405
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,210
 it briefly opens up a frequency for telepathic communication 

406
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,510
 with the future. 

407
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,370
Really?

408
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,310
That really happens? To Yumi?

409
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:21,920
 Hunch, who lives alone in the desert, got the message.  

410
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,560
Reason, wake up.

411
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,070
What's going on? Why is the village so dark?

412
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,680
Yumi is blacked out now.

413
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,450
Blacked out? Then did she get drunk and fall asleep?

414
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,390
No. Yumi is still awake.

415
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,930
Even though we can't see anything.

416
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:55,550
Ah, hold on. So you're saying...

417
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:02,990
Miss Ruby, Assistant Manager Yi Da. When will you be meeting with Miss Yumi?

418
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,640
Oh!

419
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,760
Something came up that I need to apologize to Miss Yumi for.

420
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,040
- So if you meet Miss Yumi— 
 - Yumi made it!

421
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,830
Oh my god! She made it!

422
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,750
- Miss Yumi became something? 
 - Yumi became a writer, Section Chief!

423
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,530
- Wow! 
 - Eonni's publishing a book!

424
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,240
- Thank goodness! 
 - That's so cool.

425
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,030
Thank goodness! Miss Yumi became a writer!

426
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,660
 Congratulations. Really, congratulations Yumi! 

427
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,750
 I mean, Writer Kim. 

428
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,570
 Eonni, where are you? We have to have a party to celebrate this! 

429
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,430
That's so cool!

430
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,220
I'm going crazy. Oh, dear!

431
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,360
Jeju Island!

432
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,030
Yi Da! Ruby!

433
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,900
- Hey, Writer! 
 - Writer Kim!

434
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,480
- I missed you so much. 
 - It's been so long!

435
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,170
- Hello. 
 - BB! Ah, seriously, what the heck!

436
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,180
- What the heck! 
 - Do I have to call you Brother-in-law now?

437
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,240
Hurry up and get in! Get in, quickly!

438
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,400
Get in for now.

439
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,400
 Though I don't know if they came to congratulate her or if they came to have fun, using her as an excuse. 

440
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,650
Everything is on me today!

441
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,950
Of course, it should be. You became a writer on your own.

442
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,720
You also got a boyfriend on your own. You traitor.

443
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,600
Yes, today should be on you.

444
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,390
 Anyhow, I do remember her saying she would be treating these two who came all the way to Jeju Island. 

445
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,340
- Let's go to a famous restaurant. Famous restaurant. 
- An expensive place?

446
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,690
Sounds good!

447
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,880
Cheers!

448
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,780
Congratulations!

449
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,430
- Thank you for coming today! Hurry and eat! Eat, eat! 
 - Thank you for the meal.

450
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,390
I'm treating you all!

451
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,290
- Is it good? 
- Yes!

452
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,860
- It's really delicious! 
  - I also remember that we ate a lot after that. 

453
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,110
 And then suddenly, 

454
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,940
the village became dark and we lost our senses.

455
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:21,230
Listen to the sound. I think she's still eating.

456
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,430
Then who is controlling Yumi now?

457
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,590
Yes! It's going down smoothly today.

458
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,940
 Deep inside oneself  
 Yahoo!

459
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:40,380
True Intentions is.

460
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,460
No! True intentions is dangerous.

461
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,380
We don't know what she might thoughtlessly say. We need to get out of this blackout quickly.

462
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,790
Yumi! Get your senses together!

463
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,840
There's no use.

464
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,940
- Love! 
 - The wine and beer that she drank earlier,

465
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,440
created a chemical reaction that caused this blackout.

466
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,020
No matter what the magic is, it won't work.

467
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,560
- The bill. 
 - Give it to me, please. I'm paying.

468
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,130
Today is the day Yumi pays.

469
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:15,100
I will pay because I became a writer.

470
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,190
You're really cool Kim Yumi! Writer Kim!

471
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,690
Let's see. How much is this?

472
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:25,240
1, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000

473
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,500
425,000 won  (≈ $ 330). 

474
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,160
Did you just hear that?

475
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,750
Four hundred what?

476
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,930
They must have really eaten a lot.

477
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,100
How much did they eat?

478
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,110
Four hundred what?

479
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:58,440
How much fried food did they stuff their faces with that they spend over four hundred thousand?

480
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,830
 All the alcohol in her body dissipated. 

481
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:08,100
 She was so shocked after seeing the bill that she became sober. 

482
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,820
- Try this.
 - Okay.

483
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,700
No way! How is this possible?

484
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,040
We only ate fried food and beer.

485
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,430
Excuse me, can I have another beer here?

486
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,260
Ruby's going all out today!

487
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,160
 Lee Ruby: Because she has an alcohol disposal facility in her body, she can drink an infinite amount. 

488
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,740
 Her alcohol disintegration power is 9900. 

489
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,170
Wow, look how fresh this shrimp is!

490
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,810
This thing is basically alive!

491
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,300
 Kang Yi Da: A hyper glutton with an eating power of 6200, 

492
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,150
 who is currently on her sixth plate of fried food. 

493
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,990
Yumi, are you all right?

494
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:54,980
  Yu Ba Bi: His eating power is low, but when you combine beer and fried foods, 

495
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,460
 his eating power and alcohol disintegration powers increase by 200% .

496
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,220
You eat so well. One for me, too!

497
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,060
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

498
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:12,220
You guys are really chowing down.

499
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:19,810
Guys! We're in trouble.

500
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,890
Anxiety, you're a step late. Just give up.

501
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,610
We treated them because she debuted as a writer, so we're happy to do it.

502
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:33,480
- 400,000 won is okay—
 - It's not that. Because she sobered up,

503
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:39,930
Hunger is now awake.

504
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,920
I am hungry!

505
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:50,030
His eating power is 5,700. If he's in good condition, it shoots up to 9,000!

506
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,090
Of all times, he's in a good condition now.

507
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:56,030
My stomach has become much bigger now that I woke up from sleep.

508
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,400
I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

509
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,100
I'm hungry!

510
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,420
Huh? Hunger?

511
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,770
Oh my, oh my.  What's happening?

512
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,600
What's going on?

513
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,090
We're doomed.

514
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,300
- Shall we order more fried food? 
 - Yes!

515
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,240
Give us more menus! I mean, give us a menu, please!

516
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,780
I really spent all I've got today.

517
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,800
One month's living expenses are all gone.

518
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,640
It's okay. I'm in a good mood.

519
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,460
I'm not unemployed anymore. I'm a writer.

00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,880
What do you mean, assistant writer? I'm a complete rookie myself.

525
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,370
I want to be an assistant writer! Make me one!

Ruby also wants to live freely. Freely.

You just sleep here. It can't be helped.

Forget it, I don't care! Forget everything!

Wow, Jumbo Shrimp!

00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,190
You're not going to wash up?

What an absurd thing to say! One cannot go to bed without washing their face!

537
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,500
You can't put her to sleep before she washes up!

Bring it on, Lullaby cell!

539
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,940
 Face Wash Up has never beaten Lullaby in a fight. 

540
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,060
 She was cruelly defeated today as well. 

541
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,090
 But Lullaby also can't make a single move in front of Love.

- Ba Bi!
- Are you in bed?

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,720
No. I was about to wash up before I went to bed.

545
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,470
Ruby and Yi Da fell asleep.

546
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,700
Is the accommodation decent? You had to book it in a hurry.

547
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:02,450
It's nice. But everyone is so drunk that they won't know which way is up.

548
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,230
Where are you?

549
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:09,380
I'm out in the yard. I can see the stars clearly today.

550
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,210
Today was really tiring, wasn't it?

551
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,900
 You had to go to the airport twice. 

552
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,190
No.

553
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,680
Yeah, right.

554
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,660
Ba Bi.

555
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,040
Thank you.

556
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,210
For what?

557
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,610
What I'm thankful for is...

558
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,000
 Can you write something for me? Our marketing team 

559
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,700
 is trying to renew our company's social media account. 

560
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,490
 - I thought it would be nice if you could take charge of it. 
 - Pardon? 

561
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,530
 You were the first one to see my future. 

562
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,630
 The book was interesting up until chapter seven. 

563
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,770
 But it seems to have slowed down after that. 

564
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,660
 Right? I thought it was a little disappointing from there too. 

565
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,200
 I thought about it. What if you look at it like this? 

566
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,450
 Since the part about the male lead's past comes out so late in the story, 

567
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,530
 maybe try moving it to the previous chapter... 

568
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:10,110
 You gladly made time for me. 

569
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,160
 It's okay. 

570
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,690
 It's okay, Yumi. 

571
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,420
 You supported me when I was feeling down. 

572
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,700
Even though I left you alone a lot because I was busy during that time,

573
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:32,520
you always waited for me without getting angry. You have eyes for me only.

574
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,910
You're always considerate of me and always encouraging me.

575
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,400
You always inspire me to head towards my dream.

576
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,000
On the other hand, you also become an unbiased critic for me.

577
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,730
- Hey, hey! It's too long.
- It is?

578
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,810
It's not touching if it's too long-winded.

579
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,560
Then come up with a single sentence

580
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,400
that can express everything on here! Hurry up, there's no time!

581
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,380
I want to convey my feelings to Ba Bi right this instant!

582
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,910
What I'm thankful for is

583
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,160
everything.

584
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,210
Everything?

585
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,420
I'm thankful for everything.

586
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:21,120
 It's too short! Would Ba Bi understand something that has so much meaning through that? 

587
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,890
 Ba Bi will know because he's Ba Bi. 

588
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,490
Do you want to go for a walk?

589
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,830
Right now?

590
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:36,910
Let's go look at the stars. I'll come get you.

591
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:45,090
Look at the stars! It looks like they'll fall right out of the sky.

592
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:49,090
A good thing about coming to Jeju Island is that I can see a lot of stars.

593
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:53,320
Yumi!

594
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,210
Yumi!

595
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,740
What's with him? Is he calling me?

596
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,720
I don't know.

597
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,310
Seo Yumi, I love you!

598
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:09,930
Seo Yumi, I said that I love you!

599
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,490
- I love you, Seo Yumi! 
 - Oppa, stop it!

600
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,230
- Let's head back. 
 - Let go.

601
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,820
What's wrong with him?

602
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,730
He's really drunk.

603
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:27,380
I think I'd hate it if my boyfriend acted like that.

604
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,580
Getting drunk in a public place and yelling my name.

605
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,550
- You don't like it? 
 - Of course, I don't. I think that kind of guy

606
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,020
would really piss me off.

607
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,230
 Did she really just say it pissed her off? 

608
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,100
 She did! 

609
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,420
 Deep inside oneself   
 Doesn't it piss you off?

610
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,190
Hey, you crazy jerk. Why are you crawling out of there and talking nonsense again? Go back in!

611
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:59,170
 Before I knew it my true inner feelings came out because I wasn't fully sober. 

612
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,970
Yumi.

613
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:09,120
You saying the words pissed off is... How should I put it? It's really ...

614
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,310
 Really turned you off? 

615
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,500
It's really sexy.

616
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,820
 Yumi became so happy when she heard Ba Bi's unexpected words that, without realizing it, she ... 

617
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,170
 This is also because she's not fully sober yet. 

618
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:29,340
Sorry. I was really giddy just now, wasn't I?

619
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,760
- No. 
 - Yeah, right.

620
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,300
I sounded silly to my own self just now.

621
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,200
It was cute.

622
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,870
 At times like this, she can feel that she is being loved. 

623
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,260
 It's the feeling that the love that Ba Bi sends her 

624
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,820
 is being delivered to each and every one of the cells in her body. 

625

♫  I will become the moon just for you  ♫

626
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:59,100
I suddenly want to kiss him.

627
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,190
Hey! We can't do that out here in the open!

628
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,610
You can't do that right now!

629
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:09,200
At least go indoors before you do it!

630
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,460
- No, you can't! 
 - Hey!

631
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,660
Let's go kiss him!

632
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,710
Yumi.

633
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:21,040
♫  so that you can fall asleep in the warmth of the moonlight   ♫

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,380

637
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:29,430
 This is also because she's still not sober.

00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,080
Today is our one-year anniversary.

641
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:12,530
I was planning to give it to you tomorrow because it seemed like you forgot about it.

642
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,140
I already put mine on.

643
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,830
Ba Bi...

644
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,780
It looks good on you.

645
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,930
 It was such a perfect moment that she wondered if it was okay. 

646
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,640
 A perfect first-year anniversary with the perfect boyfriend 

647
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,580
 at a perfect location. 

648
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,180
 Who knew that a day like this would also come to Yumi? 

649
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,550
 It was such a beautiful day that it wasn't odd for an aurora to appear in the sky. 

650
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,910
 You're saying that Yumi's going to succeed? 

651
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:17,800
 She's going to become someone special? You're serious, right? 

652
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,870
 And? What else? 

653
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,350
 Why? 

654
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,550
I had a lot of fun and ate really well.

655
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:51,880
Eonni, when are you coming back up?

656
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,690
I'll stay a bit longer and then go back.

657
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,870
Since I plan to meet with the publisher next week.

658
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:58,690
Are you finally signing a contract?

659
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,540
Writer Kim.

660
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:04,890
If you make it big, you really have to make me your assistant writer. All right?

661
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:07,240
Hurry in, you're late.

662
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,070
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

663
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,800
- Take care of your hangover. 
 - Bye.

664
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,590
Have a safe flight.

665
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,120
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

666
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,210
Hi, Ba Bi.

667
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:24,330
 Yi Da and Ruby just left. 

668
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,660
Yumi, I'm sorry.

669
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:31,290
I should have driven you, but the director suddenly came out here.

670
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:33,640
It's fine. If I take a taxi, it'll be quick.

671
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,670
Don't worry about me and work. I'll head back.

672
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,970
Bye.

673
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:55,240
♫  A room without space to take a step  ♫

674
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,420
♫  An opening in the window is where I can take a breath  ♫

675
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:05,410
♫  With only dust flying under the light bulb  ♫

♫  it's very cozy.  ♫

♫  When it pours rain  ♫

678
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:24,420
♫  without respite. Once more  ♫

679
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:30,560
♫  I'm in suspense. While I'm on my way to collect the heart I left behind  ♫

680
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:36,440
I bought him this.

681
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,960
Wow, it grew a lot.

682
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,800
So cute.

683
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,270

687
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:14,410
♫  It feels a bit different from my footsteps. Time to call it a day.  ♫

688

692
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,790
 I'm leaving work now. I'll be there soon. 

693
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,950
 I'm out walking. Take your time. 

694
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,260
 I'll head back too. 

695
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,160
He's here.

696
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,960
Goodbye.

697
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,110
 Who is she? 

698
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:37,510
 What's going on? Why is she getting out of Ba Bi's car? 

699
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:47,040
 Episode 20: Déjà Vu 

700
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,400
 Oh right. We got new interns. One of them lives in the same neighborhood. 

701
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,330
 Really? 

702
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:58,510
 So I've been giving this person a ride when we commute since they have to transfer buses a couple of times. 

703
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:02,380
 I found out they live in the neighborhood so I can't pretend to not see them. 

704
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,740
 I see. 

705
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:09,800
 I also found out that intern's dad has the biggest tangerine orchard in the neighborhood. 

706
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,860
 I'll buy some tangerines and send them to you later. 

707
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,160
 I'd love tangerines. 

708
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,170
 Reason: That's right. She's that intern. 

709
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,200
 But was that intern a woman?
 (in Korean, there are no personal pronouns that define gender)  

710
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,350
 Sensitivity: She's really cute. 

711
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,960
 Face Wash Up: She looks adorable. 

712
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,310
 Sensitivity: She looks really young. How old do you think she is? 

713
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:30,680
 Reason: He said she was a college student. 

714
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,770
 If she's a senior, she's probably twenty-three? 

715
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:39,150
 Anxiety: You're telling me he commutes every day with her? 

716
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:44,410
She's young. She's cute!

717
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,800
I suddenly just got anxious.

718
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,780
Calm down. No one else but you

719
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,690
- is thinking that. 
 - I'm also anxious.

720
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:56,650
Objectively speaking, she's cute.

721
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,040
Goodness gracious!

722
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,850
I thought about it ...

723
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,890
No. Please, don't!

724
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:04,450
Love, don't let your guard down.

725
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:06,680
Shut up!

726
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,750
Sorry for doing that when we were talking.

727
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,670
Where was I?

728
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:18,000
You are anxious?

729
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,560
So ... I was saying ...

730
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:26,150
What kind of woman do you think Yumi is to Ba Bi?

731
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,820
He thinks she's sexy even when she curses

732
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:32,010
and says that she's cute even when she's giggling in a weird way!

733
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,760
She's that Kim Yumi!

734
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,360
Yes, yes, you're right.

735
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,330
What did she get from Ba Bi yesterday?

736
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:41,470
A couple ring for their one-year anniversary!

737
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,670
And you're still anxious? Huh?

738
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:48,690
No, I don't think I'm anxious anymore.

739
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:51,600
Seriously, what was I thinking?

740
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,900
Ba Bi!

741
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,830
Yumi, did you go somewhere?

742
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:10,440
I went around the neighborhood. What are you doing?

743
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,610
Let's have a barbeque for dinner. I'll grill.

744
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,550
Really? Won't it be cold?

745
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:18,680
If it's cold we can grill it and then eat inside.

746
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,160
I bought all the meat for a barbeque.

747
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,640
That's why there's a bunch of meat in the refrigerator–

748
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,370
I'm happy.

749
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,960
That works out. I was worried because I didn't have enough charcoal.

750
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,160
She said she's bringing it.

751
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,730
- Who? 
 - Da Eun.

752
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:44,650
- Da Eun? 
 - Oh ...

753
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:48,350
She's the intern who lives in this neighborhood. Her name is Da Eun.

754
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,420
Da Eun-yi.

755
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,190
That was really affectionate!

756
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,890
When did they get this close?

757
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:58,740
He just said her name.

758
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,570
So why is he saying her name so affectionately?

759
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:06,960
When you say a name that ends in a consonant it naturally sounds cute.

760
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,130
For example, Wu Bin-i, Ji Min-i, and Dong Geun-i.

761
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:12,790
Even looking just these names it's cute.

762
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:14,290
Wu Bin-i.

763
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:15,550
Ji Min-i.

764
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,210
Dong Geon-i.

765
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:20,110
That's true. It's cute.

766
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,950
Right?

767
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:29,210
 You're saying it sounded affectionate because of the name? 

768
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:32,460
 Yeah. It's because of the name. 

769
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:36,920
 Why doesn't Yumi end in a consonant? So annoying. 

770
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,960
Yumi. The meat?

771
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,630
Oh, yes.

772
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,450
But there's no ssamjang*. 
  (mix of red pepper paste and fermented soy bean paste) 

773
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:50,280
Oh right. I forgot the ssamjang.

774
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,990
I will go buy it. The convenience store should have it.

775
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:56,350
- It's cold, so wear my jacket. 
 - Okay.

776
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,680
Team Leader.

777
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,480
Thanks, Da Eun.

778
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,340
No problem.

779
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,510
Is your girlfriend here?

780
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:19,540
Yes. She went to the convenience store for a bit. She'll be back soon.

781
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,690
Oh really?

782
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,430
Then I should say hello before I leave.

783
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:24,840
Sure.

784
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,510
 There is a cell that is found more often in women than in men. 

785
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:31,700
 It's name is Popping Cell. 

786
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,610
 It's a cell that pops a laughing balloon and makes you laugh. 

787
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,920
 Popping Cell 

788
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,310
 Unfortunately, it's hard to live past the mid-20s because of its short lifespan. 

789
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:56,220
 Yumi's Popping cell also died ten years ago. 

790
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:03,890
Did it work?

791
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,440
What?

792
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,760
You have charcoal soot on your face.

793
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,300
Did I get it on my face?

794
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,480
- On your left cheek. 
 - Oh, here?

795
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,210
No, a little higher.

796
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:21,100
It's not there.

797
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:24,810
I will take a photo with my phone and show you. Hold on.

798
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:26,780
You're even taking a picture.

799
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:37,400
See, you smeared some right here too.

800
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,120
Is it that funny?

801
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,660
But you've also got some soot on your face.

802
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,030
I do too?

803
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:46,880
On the right side of your chin.

804
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,190
Where? On the right side?

805
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:52,370
No, that's your left side. It's this side.

806
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:58,390
 The Popping Cell has a short lifespan, but it is highly infectious. 

807
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,220
Team Leader, I thought you were like a mirror

808
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:06,400
so I thought it was here, but it's my right side.

809
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:08,450
It was my right side.

810
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,830
That's hilarious!

811
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:16,080
It's here. Here.

812
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,720
But there is such a thing as the Law of Laughter

813
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,160
so someone's laughter ends up disappearing just as much as someone's laughter occurs.

814
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,620
Open the door!!!

815
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,460
Help me! Rampage cell is trying to get out!

816
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,050
Okay!

817
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:36,320
You guys are going to get it!

818
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,700
I said open the door!

819
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:44,990
Oh no, True Intentions is trying to come out too!

820
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,410
No, he can't!

821
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:49,140
Come out, Reaction #1!

822
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,600
Ba Bi!

823
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,070
You're back.

824
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,580
- Did they have ssamjang? 
 - Yes, they had some.

825
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,500
Hello.

826
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:10,190
She was waiting to say hello to you. She's our company's intern, Yu Da Eun.

827
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:13,820
Hello. Nice to meet you. I heard about you.

828
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,710
Hello.

829
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:17,990
I brought some coffee, since he said you were coming.

830
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,450
It's cold. You should have just come straight back.

831
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:22,000
The coffee smelled too good.

832
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,570
It does smell really good.

833
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:28,320
 She didn't let it show, but she was a little bothered. 

834
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:30,870
Is it going well?

835
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:35,780
Yeah. I started the fire, but it's going to take some time for it to get stronger.

836
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,970
It's not easy.

837
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:40,440
And you claimed that you would become the Barbeque Guru once you moved here.

838
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,730
It's because the wind is blowing.

839
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:47,330
Oh, Da Eun's father gave me a ton of charcoal. Look.

840
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:49,480
Wow, thank you so much!

841
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,680
Have some meat before you  go.

842
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,440
No, I have to go.

843
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,570
Just taste it before you leave.

844
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:01,540
Then, I'll just have a taste before I go.

845
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,420
Yumi, watch the fire for me.

846
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,960
Sure.

847
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:13,220
How is work? Is it difficult?

848
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:17,620
No, I like it. Team Leader is really funny.

849
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,010
Ba Bi is?

850
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:24,150
Yes. He's really funny, you know.

851
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:28,030
 Honestly, our Ba Bi is handsome, kind, 

852
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:31,590
 and perfect, but he's not that funny. 

853
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,100
That's true.

854
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,360
Ba Bi is funny.

855
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,130
But in what way do you...?

856
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:42,300
Well, he was starting the fire earlier

857
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,840
and suddenly got charcoal soot all over his face.

858
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,620
He didn't know that he'd done it and—

859
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,840
What is she talking about?

860
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,930
Wait! Don't laugh by yourself, let me know too!

861
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:55,570
This won't do. Come out, Translation Cell!

862
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,160
 Translation Cell 

863
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:02,230
 The cell that calmly listens and understands a person who's laughing or crying while they talk. 

864
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:06,350
If I were to interpret this, she let Ba Bi know that he had soot smeared on his face

865
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:10,650
and he kept wiping everywhere but the place that it was smeared on.

866
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:14,940
What part of that are we supposed to laugh at?

867
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,460
I don't know either.

868
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:20,370
What's funny about that? I don't get it at all.

869
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:24,380
I see, so that's what Ba Bi did!

870
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,970
Let's understand it this way.

871
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:30,100
We're old and she's young.

872
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,430
So our sense of humor is different!

873
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,450
That's an interesting interpretation.

874
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:39,260
You're saying that Yumi can't understand because she's old?!

875
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:43,180
 That's right. Everything's funny at that age. 

876
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:46,900
 You're bright, cute, and overflowing with energy. 

877
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,790
 Must be nice. 

878
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:52,620
So it's still smeared on him!

879
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,660
- Yumi. 
 - Yes?

880
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:58,740
- It'll be better for us to go inside. It's too cold. I'll come in after I finish grilling. 
 - Okay.

881
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,980
Then I'll take my leave first.

882
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,190
You should eat before you go.

883
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:04,570
I have plans in the area with friends.

884
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:07,660
All right, then. Tell your father thank you for me.

885
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,860
I will. Enjoy your food.

886
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,130
It was nice to meet you.

887
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,280
- Goodbye! 
 - It was nice to meet you!

888
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,220
Thank you!

889
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,020
Yumi, it's cold. Go inside.

890
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,780
Yes.

891
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:35,750
But Da Eun is really cute.

892
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,430
When you're in a relationship, there's a question that's always asked.

893
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,850
"Da Eun is really cute"

894
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:48,490
Choose the nicest reply.

895
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:49,930
That's an easy question.

896
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:53,050
Number one. You are cute too.

897
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:56,600
The "too" will be noticed. This is a bomb.

898
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,640
Number two. Da Eun is cute?

899
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,460
No way.

900
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,870
Number two is a strong denial so it sounds like you're strongly affirming it. Cross it out.

901
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:10,820
Number three. "You're right, Da Eun is cute."

902
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,890
Number three is definitely wrong.

903
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:16,620
Number four. "You are cuter."

904
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:19,310
Number four is too obvious that it sounds fake.

905
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:21,560
All right. The answer isn't here.

906
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,910
Ba Bi will answer subjectively.

907
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:25,520
The answer is ...

908
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,400
Da Eun is cute.

909
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,060
What?

910
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:34,260
Yeah, she's cute.

911
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,740
And Yumi is adorable.

912
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:45,180
You're a real pro.

913
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,110
Go inside, you'll catch a cold.

914
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:48,970
Okay.

915
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,500
I'm done cleaning.

916
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:12,700
That's hard to clean, right?

917
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,640
Yumi, let's not cook again.

918
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,110
Let's just go out to eat.

919
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:18,930
I knew you'd say that.

920
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:20,400
Oh right, I'm going to go stop by the market.

921
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,050
Why? You should relax a bit.

922
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:25,030
There's nothing to eat tomorrow. I'm also out of milk.

923
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:27,100
I'll be back.

924
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,000
- Hurry back. 
 - Yes.

925
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,200
- Relax. 
 - Okay.

926
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,380
Don't do that. I'll do it when I get back.

927
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:44,010
I don't want you to.

928
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,820
Da Eun?

929
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:03,100
Team Leader.

930
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:06,910
Aren't you cold, dressed like that?

931
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:09,570
I left my jacket in my friend's car.

932
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:13,140
I didn't want to ask them to come back, so I'm just going.

933
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,820
The wind is definitely strong.

934
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:23,190
All of it fell over.

935
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:32,350
It's Da Eun.

936
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:35,710
Hello.

937
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:36,920
I'm seeing you often.

938
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,800
The coffee earlier was really good.

939
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,820
Really? I'll have to buy it from that place again.

940
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:42,980
Have a good night.

941
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,420
Goodbye.

942
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,970
 Hold on! You can't fool my eyes. 

943
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:55,270
No matter how dark and brief it was, do you think I wouldn't have noticed?

944
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:59,980
That's the jacket Ba Bi always leaves in his car!

945
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,870
 They met on the street by chance. 

946
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:09,700
 He could lend a jacket to Da Eun, who is cold and isn't wearing one. 

947
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,960
 That could happen. 

948
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,410
 I'm sure it means nothing. 

949
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:21,840
 But I got a weird feeling. 

950
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,200
 Déjà vu. 

951
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,720
 Is this what déjà vu is? 

952
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,330
 Put this on. 

953
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:42,340
 I'm fine. 

954
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,730
 Put it on. It's still chilly at night. 

955
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:10,380
Yumi.

956
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:14,120
Why are you out here? It's cold.

957
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:17,290
The laundry rack fell over.

958
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:21,670
I see. It falls over easily because it's often windy here.

959
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:25,080
They were out of abalone. Let's go out to eat tomorrow morning.

960
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,000
- There's a restaurant that makes a good abalone porridge. 
 - Just a bit ago

961
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,920
I saw Da Eun.

962
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:38,520
Was that your jacket that Da Eun was wearing?

963
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:43,230
Uh ... yes. I ran into her in front of the market. She wasn't wearing one and was shivering.

964
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:46,180
So I lent her the jacket in my car.

965
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:50,610
Right? No wonder, I thought it looked like yours.

966
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:52,480
Let's go in.

967
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:55,360
Ba Bi.

968
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,960
Yes?

969
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:01,210
I have a question.

970
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:09,380
When did you start liking me?

971
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:16,100


972
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:19,600
♫  Today too because my day  ♫

973
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:25,540
♫  approaches slowly,  ♫

974
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:31,560
♫  I didn't even expect this  ♫

975
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:37,380
♫  he is playing a joke  ♫

976
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:42,320
♫  Why of all days this morning  ♫

977
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:48,320
♫  without any preparation  ♫

978
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:53,940
♫  did you leave my room?  ♫

979
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,560
♫  I thought about it for a long time  ♫

980
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:07,060
♫  It's not about something I can understand  ♫

981
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:09,020
♫  To me who am spending an unexpected day  ♫

982
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:13,740
 Yumi's Cells 2 Preview 

983
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:17,490
 It's nice to meet you. I'm Team Leader, Yu Ba Bi. I look forward to working with you. 

984
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:20,660
 Excuse me. 

985
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:21,980
♫  So that I can feel your love love love love  ♫

986
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:23,390
 Why are you asking out of the blue? 

987
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:26,010
 Because I was curious all of the sudden. 

988
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:29,680
 That was probably– 

989
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,230
♫  To me who is about to cry  ♫

990
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:32,610
 Drive safe! 

991
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:36,540
 It said a disrupter is going to show up and distance us from Ba Bi. 

992
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:40,110
 You are really cool. 

993
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:43,810
♫  So that I can feel your love love love love  ♫
