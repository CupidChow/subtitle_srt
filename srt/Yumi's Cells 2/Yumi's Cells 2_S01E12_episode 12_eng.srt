00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:09,990


2
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,020
 Yumi's Cells 2 

3
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,570
 Hola! 

4
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,010
 Episode 33 
 The Three-Way Encounter 

5
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,510
Where did she go?

6
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,380
Emergency! Emergency! Yu Ba Bi has appeared!

7
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,080
There's no time to relax. Yu Ba Bi showed up here?!

8
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,420
Hello.

9
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,240
Do you remember me?

10
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,200
Yes, of course.

11
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,760
Of course, he does, you jerk! Do you think I wouldn't be able to remember you?

12
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,100
That was the last time we saw him.

13
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,500
 It was good to see you. 

14
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,900
 What did that jerk say when we ran into each other? 

15
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,900
 But ... 

16
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,090
 Is she doing well? 

17
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,520
 That jerk was already dating Yumi then! 

18
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,320
 Yumi. 

19
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,490
 Yes. 

20
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,090
 So she's doing well. 

21
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,660
 She is. 

22
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,520
Seeing this again is making me angry.

23
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,720
He was pretending to be innocent then. Pretending he didn't know.

24
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,740
- Look at that! 
  - Put this on. 

25
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,210
He may have already had feelings for her then!

26
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,740
 - I'm fine.  
 - There's no doubt about it! He was pretending to be just a colleague and a good person.

27
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,180
 - Put it on. It's still chilly at night.  
- He dared to do that in front of Wung!

28
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,740
But what did we do then?!

29
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,030
 Look at this jerk. 

30
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,740
 Wung. What's wrong? 

31
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,950
 Mr. Wung, calm down. Mr. Wung, calm ... 

32
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,480
 Why are you taking your jacket off? You'll catch a cold. 

33
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,420
Wung took his jacket off for him, like a fool!

34
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,990
He was so clueless!

35
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,160
- Can we forgive that jerk? 
 - We can't!

36
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,780
I mean I was going to just forget about it, but he's dating Yumi again?

37
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,490
 I can never forgive him for that! 

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,910
But where did Yumi go? She isn't answering her phone.

39
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,090
She left her phone and went somewhere.

40
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,250
She will probably be here soon. She said she'd be right back.

41
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,850
I see.

42
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,940
Don't worry.

43
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,270
Because Yumi isn't that kind of person.

44
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,670
Sorry?

45
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:55,760
She doesn't get swayed easily, unlike someone else.

46
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,790
- Huh? 
 - What's this?

47
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,010
He sent fish bones* with his comment. 
  (Also means a thorn, refers to speaking harshly.) 

48
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,530
Unlike someone else?

49
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,920
Yes. Unlike someone else.

50
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,330
What's going on? Everything he's saying is full of fish bones.

51
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,610
Is he saying he's going to provoke us right now?

52
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,640
Wait a second. Let's think about it calmly.

53
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,590
- Does Gu Wung have any right to speak to Ba Bi harshly like that right now? 
 - He doesn't.

54
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,880
- It's been years since he broke up with Yumi. 
 - Exactly!

55
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,650
On top of that, this isn't the first time he's done this!

56
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,260
 - That's what I'm saying! 
 - Patdol? 

57
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,040
 Back then, he even asked to see Yumi on Christmas. 

58
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,530
 It's from someone named Patdol. 

59
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,800
 I wasn't able to tell you earlier ... The truth is, the person named Patdol is ... 

60
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,560
 Okay. 

61
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,660
 - Hurry back.
 - Ba Bi didn't say anything and waited for her. 

62
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,180
That's right! We really treated Gu Wung very politely!

63
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,090
So what's with him right now?

64
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,130
Why is he suddenly showing up again after all these years?

65
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,960
Why does he keep showing up in front of Yumi like a leech?

66
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,110
Does he own Yumi or something?

67
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,450
Of course, he doesn't!

68
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,300
 Do we still have to keep treating him politely, even though he's acting like this? 

69
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,740
 No. Give him a warning. 

70
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,660
You said Yumi doesn't get swayed easily, unlike someone else?

71
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,230
Yes. So I'm saying that you shouldn't worry.

72
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,270
Are you telling me what kind of woman Yumi is right now?

73
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,910
I would know more about Yumi than you.

74
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,260
I've probably dated Yumi longer than you.

75
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,610
And I'm currently Yumi's boyfriend, too.

76
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,950
What you just said sounds like advice that someone who was at least Yumi's boyfriend,

77
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,990
family, or best friend would have the right to give.

78
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,860
But what are you to Yumi right now, Mr. Gu Wung?

79
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,290
You're nothing to her, right?

80
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,340
W-w-what was that just now?

81
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,100
That jerk shot an arrow!

82
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,900
If you're saying this because you have some sort of relationship with Yumi,

83
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,230
then you're disproving what you just said about Yumi not being that kind of person.

84
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,650
But there's no way that would be because she's not that kind of person.

85
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,340
After all, you don't have any kind of relationship with Yumi.

86
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,050
So if a man who has no relation to Yumi is trying to show that he knows about her in front of her boyfriend,

87
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,750
the conclusion must be

88
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,110
that you're meddling where it isn't your place to meddle, Mr. Gu Wung.

89
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,140
What's wrong with him? He's so good with his words!

90
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,530
There's no question he works in marketing! He's so eloquent!

91
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,470
Love!

92
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,230
I got hit.

93
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,980
Love!

94
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,510
So heavy.

95
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,310
That jerk. He's all talk.

96
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,330
I don't think we can beat him with words. Let's retreat!

97
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,450
Maybe you're offended by what I said? Then I'll apologize.

98
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:41,290
I was just confirming your relationship with her. I didn't mean anything bad by it.

99
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,360
 This won't do. Let's wrap things up and part ways for now. 

100
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,050
You're saying we should retreat right now?

101
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,960
That jerk is playing us for a fool right now. But we're just going to retreat?

102
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,260
Pride. Are you okay?

103
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,470
What are you going to do about Wung's pride being shattered again today?

104
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,030
Why did Wung spend all those sleepless nights to become successful? All for what?

105
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,250
Just to hear something like this from that jerk Ba Bi?

106
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:12,390
Pride. An engineer can't beat a marketing expert.

107
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,460
Wung's speaking skills are at an elementary school level.

108
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,270
What's so important about speaking skills?

109
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,860
Wung is already successful!

110
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,790
Then take good care of yourself.

111
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,320
I need to go find Yumi now.

112
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,520
Wait a moment.

113
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,830
It's been a while since we last met, but we didn't exchange business cards.

114
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,750
I changed companies during that time.

115
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,930
I see.

116
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,870
 (TN:  Wung gives Ba Bi the card with just one hand.  This is how a superior hands an item to an inferior.) 

117
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,790
I started my own company during that time.

118
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,520
 Ku Woong Games 
 CEO Gu Wung 

119
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,130
- I see. 
 - Stop by sometime.

120
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,530
The office building is located at the intersection of Gangnam Station*. 
  (Location of many prominent corporate offices.) 

121
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:19,350
If you're looking for CEO Gu Wung, you can come up to the 25th floor at any time.

122
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,870
Oh, yeah. I take a lot of overseas business trips, so be sure you contact me in advance.

123
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,030
Yes, I will.

124
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:32,700
But I see you're still there.

125
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,300
At Daehan Noodles.

126
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,760
I am.

127
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,020
So you're a team leader.

128
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,790
- What's that? 
 -What is...

129
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,660
It's a bomb!

130
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,160
Team Leader Yu Ba Bi.

131
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,820
I got it.

132
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,330
Why ... are you laughing?

133
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,520
No, I'm not. I'm not.

134
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,390
In the future if you want to,

135
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,890
you can send your resumé to the email on my business card. 
 - What?

136
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,710
My company also has a marketing team, you see. Make sure you send me your resume.

137
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,800
I'll tell the person in charge in advance.

138
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,420
Why would I send my resume to your company?

139
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,450
Our company probably offers a much better salary than Daehan Noodles.

140
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,270
- I'm satisfied with my company, though. 
 - Of course you are.

141
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:41,480
But you should think of your girlfriend, too.

142
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,180
He's such a totally childish jerk!

143
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,330
Hey Gu Wung, you jerk! I can't hold back anymore!

144
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,760
This won't do.

145
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,190
Guys!

146
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,180
- This is war! 
 - This is war!

147
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,110
The enemy's walls are down! The time is now, charge!

148
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,020
Charge!

149
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,260
- You're very— 
 - Are you thankful?

150
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,870
You don't have to thank me.

151
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,010
This is a piece of cake for me.

152
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,160
- You are very childish, Mr. Gu Wung. 
 - Me?

153
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,030
- Do you want to be like that? 
 - What did I do?

154
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,050
You should be upfront if you have something to say.

155
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,940
Being childish and beating around the bush as you're doing now, isn't right.

156
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,350
- Childish? 
 - Yes.

157
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,180
Childish.

158
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,270
You won't get away with this!

159
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,250
You're all dead!

160
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,510
Ba Bi.

161
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,320
Why is Ba Bi here?

162
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,400
Look, they both have a serious look on their faces.

163
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,290
What do we do?

164
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,490
What? What? What?

165
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,890
What are they talking about?

166
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,860
The mood feels as if they were about to get into a fight.

167
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,820
I'm scared.

168
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,000
Calm down. Calm down guys!

169
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,240
We can't get flustered at times like this.

170
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,520
We just need to be calm

171
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,630
and act according to our priority list.

172
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,670
It's simple.

173
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,990
The rule is to protect what's in the highest rank.

174
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,290
Yumi, writing ... 
  Yumi's Priority List 

175
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,880
He's not the same ranking as before,

176
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,640
but Ba Bi is third on our priority list.

177
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,530
So Wung who isn't even in the priority list...

178
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,050
Wung is on the priority list.

179
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,570
What's this?!

180
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,200
 20th Gu Wung (🔺) 

181
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,410
When did Wung come up in the list like this?

182
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,590
Because we always feel bad every time we see Wung.

183
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,700
Wung is genuinely kind.

184
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,070
They must have raised him to a higher rank.

185
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,210
This won't do. First, intervene!

186
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,070
Oh.

187
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,170
Why did you come all the way here?

188
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,690
You didn't pick up my calls, so I was worried.

189
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,180
I forgot my phone and went out.

190
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,590
Here it is.

191
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,780
I gave it to him.

192
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,290
- But where did you go? 
 - About that ...

193
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,400
Your shirt ripped when you fell earlier.

194
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,660
So I was going to buy you something to wear immediately but I left my phone here.

195
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,360
But I was afraid you'd be waiting.

196
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,780
So are you going to go back out to get something?

197
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,470
Just let him wear this.

198
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,100
- Wear mine. 
 - Why would I?

199
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,770
The skin on your side is showing.

200
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,560
You're bothered by such small things.

201
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,570
It's not because I'm concerned about you,

202
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,900
but because Yumi is concerned.

203
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,450
You are very nosy.

204
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,950
Isn't being nosy your specialty?

205
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,120
Yumi, he says he doesn't mind, let's just go.

206
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,990
I didn't say that.

207
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,180
I said I don't need your coat.

208
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,920
It will make people uncomfortable seeing that, so just wear it. You don't have to return it to me.

209
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,030
- What are you doing? 
 - What? Is the quality not good enough for you?

210
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,150
This coat is also quite expensive.

211
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:21,160
Look here. Is it your hobby to take off your clothes for others, Mr. Yu Ba Bi?

212
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,750
Even in the past, although I was drunk, I remember clearly...

213
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,310
- You took off your jacket for Yumi— 
 - Wung.

214
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,760
 I know that you are a good person. 

215
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,240
 Put yourself in my shoes and think about it. 

216
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,150
 - Think about how the other person would feel. 
 - Yumi. 

217
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,950
 Would you be happy if you were in my shoes? 

218
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,540
 Yumi! 

219
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,240
 I was disappointed back then, but now I understand how you felt. 

220
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,110
 That's enough. 

221
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,240
Gu Wung.

222
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,560
That's enough.

223
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,100
 But for me, the top of my priority list comes first. 

224
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,620
 That is my rule. 

225
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,330
Sir.

226
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,130
Oh, your employee is here. That's good.

227
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,840
Then we'll get going now. Ba Bi, let's go.

228
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,490
Take good care of yourself. Bye.

229
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,890
Sir, are you all right?

230
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,470
I was surprised when I got the call.

231
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,800
Does it hurt a lot?

232
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,920
 Emergency Medical Center 

233
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,400
Put your coat on, it's cold.

234
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,480
Okay.

235
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,270
I'm sorry.

236
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,960
I shouldn't have come. I should have just waited.

237
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,500
It's all right. You weren't able to contact me. Of course, you would have wondered what was going on.

238
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,460
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,900
- Stay here. I'll bring my car. 
 - Okay.

240
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:38,160
Sir, since the director is on his way, how about we wait for him and go together?

241
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,690
And I changed the meeting with the management team to tomorrow morning.

242
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,020
What time is the meeting?

243
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,320
The meeting is at ...

244
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,190
Seoul*. 
  (*T/N: Seoul the city sounds the same as Seoul time.) 

245
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,210
Man, that was funny.

246
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,020
 What time is it? It's Seoul. 

247
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,820
Sir, I'm sorry. I wanted to make you laugh because you seem to be in pain.

248
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,670
Does it hurt a lot, sir?

249
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,230
It doesn't hurt.

250
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,550
You look as if you're in pain. Shall we go back to the emergency room?

251
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,670
Did I say it hurts?

252
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,770
It doesn't hurt at all. This is nothing.

253
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,450
 Emergency Medical Center 

254
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,100
You're hungry, right?

255
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,190
What should we eat?

256
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,990
I'm good with anything.

257
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,630
Shall we eat pasta in Samcheon-dong?

258
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,640
Let's do that.

259
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,030
Sure.

260
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,800
Don't feel pressured.

261
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,610
You can wear it whenever you want to. It's okay.

262
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,900
 When you get back together after breaking up, 

263
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,680
 there are more things you become conscious of each other. 

264
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,300
 Is this what a relationship of the highest level of difficulty is? 

265
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:03,730
 Episode 34 
 An expert's guide to dating. 

266
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,830
 There are two self-proclaimed dating experts in Yumi's life. 

267
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,290
Good morning!

268
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,170
Hello.

269
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,480
 Lee Ruby and Control Z. 

270
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,440
Eonni Yumi?

271
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,010
Hi Ruby!

272
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,250
Eonni, why are you here?

273
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,050
I came here today—

274
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,430
Writer.

275
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,260
Hello.

276
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,720
 One day, the two self-proclaimed dating experts ended up meeting. 

277
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,530
Say hello. They are my ex co-workers.

278
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,710
This is Assistant Manager Yi Da, Assistant Manager Ruby of the accounting team, and Assistant Manager Bon Hui from the marketing team.

279
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,770
And this is the illustrator I'm working with.

280
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,370
Hello, I am Control Z.

281
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,490
Control Rat? Rat?   
  ("jwi"="rat" is very close to the pronunciation of "Z") 

282
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,950
Z. Z. Z.

283
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,510
I'm Control Z.

284
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,190
He means the letter Zed. 
  (Pronounced in British English.) 

285
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,260
Control Zed.

286
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,530
- The letter Zed. 
 - Ah.

287
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,240
Not that pronunciation. Z*. 
  (Pronounced in American English.) 

288
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,730
 All right, first new face in a while. 

289
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,720
 Start scan. 

290
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,940
 Age: Around the early thirties. 

291
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,370
 Height: Above average. 

292
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,270
 But not as good as Oppa Wu Gi. 

293
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,660
 Appearance: Handsome. 

294
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,090
 But not as good as Oppa Wu Gi. 

295
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,330
 Style - sensible. 

296
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,310
 But not as good as Oppa Wu Gi. 

297
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,990
 He's not Ruby's type. Situation clear. Just be casual with him. 

298
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,000
Hello, call me Lee Ruby.

299
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,950
But, Eonni, why did you come here today?

300
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:07,540
The marketing team is working on an advertisement and asked me to introduce him to them.

301
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,880
I just dropped by to make the introduction.

302
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,020
So you came here at the request of Team Manager Ba Bi?

303
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,290
You're the one who did the illustrations for "My Love Muse", aren't you?

304
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,040
You draw really well.

305
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,920
Really?

306
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,280
He's no joke! He's almost a god at illustrating.

307
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,780
- Wow! Draw Ruby's face too. 
 - Excuse me?

308
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,020
Draw Ruby too.

309
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,010
 "Ruby too"? 

310
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,800
 Is she calling herself by her name? 

311
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,790
Draw it. Draw it.

312
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,510
Yeah, sure.

313
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,470
 What's wrong with you? 

314
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,260
 Why are you acting cutesy to someone you just met? 

315
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,330
Wow, he's really good at drawing. He's fast!

316
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,750
He's really good at drawing.

317
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,910
I can't draw very well, so this is really fascinating.

318
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,550
Wow! How fascinating!

319
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,520
 Why do you keep doing this? Are you trying to flirt with me? 

320
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,580
Let me see. I want to see how it turned out.

321
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,400
 Look here. Stop it!  
 Here. Here it is.

322
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,820
 I'm sorry, but you're not my type. 

323
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,000
What's this? You're saying this is Ruby?

324
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,920
Your drawing is so funny!

325
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,580
 A spike serve on your shoulder: A dark aegyo technique. 

326
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:36,190
Excuse me ...
   Hey! Why are you acting like this from the moment we first met? 

327
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,680
Wow, look at this.

328
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,820
- It looks just like her.
 - Wow, he even beautified her.

329
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,890
What do you mean, beautified? I'm prettier than this.

330
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,650
Still, it's cute. Please sign it for me, Mr. Illustrator.

331
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,070
Okay.

332
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,670
My name is Ruby. Lee Ruby.

333
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,440
 That woman is dangerous. Let's escape right away. 

334
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,860
Here. Well, I'm going to get going, because I have to go to the marketing department.

335
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,460
Wait, let's go together! You don't know where it is.

336
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,370
It's okay. I'll go by myself.

337
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,570
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye!

338
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,780
If you're going to the marketing department, I'll go with you.

339
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,510
I'll guide you there.

340
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,960
You'll guide me there?

341
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,640
 Look at her. I'm 100% sure. You're trying to flirt with me. 

342
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,050
Oh, it's okay. I know where it is.

343
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,740
 Sorry, Oppa doesn't really have any intentions of doing that. 

344
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,540
Huh? You have to go that way, though.

345
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,270
It's an old building, so it's confusing at first.

346
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,180
 Oh, my. Look at her. That is ... 

347
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,410
 5:55: An aegyo technique where you use your head and feet to point to 5:55 pm. 

348
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:09,380
 It makes one's opponent incapacitated, so they can't refuse you. 

349
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,190
 What in the world is up with her? Why are you hitting on me like this? 

350
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,510
Let's go together.

351
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,540
Sure, then, you can come with me.

352
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,640
 Ms. Ruby 
 Control Z 

353
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,710
This is funny no matter how many times I look at it.

354
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,100
It looks as if you drew it hastily, but it still looks a lot like Ruby.

355
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,260
 But when you really look at her, she's friendly and sociable. 

356
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,390
 Now that I look at her again, her overflowing bright energy makes her look prett— 

357
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,380
Let's get on.

358
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,290
 No, no. She's not my type. Let's draw the line here. 

359
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,980
 All right, here I go. The Great Butter Method. There's no woman who likes this. 

360
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,770
I have a question.

361
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:13,180
- What is it? 
 - Is Ruby your real name?

362
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,830
Ruby? It's my real name. Why?

363
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,920
It's pretty, your name.

364
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:30,470
 The Great Butter Method: When you say the verb before the subject, it increases your greasy* level by 120%. 
 (Refers to being cheesy.) 

365
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,500
It's really pretty, your name.

366
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:38,610
 I've never seen a woman who likes this. It's really cheesy. 

367
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:44,810
 Wow, how cheesy. I can't believe someone would say something so cheesy. 

368
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:49,220
 But ... he's smooth. 

369
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,680
Thank you.

370
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,610
Excuse me?

371
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:03,820
Illustrator, you're very straightforward.

372
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,900
 As expected, when two experts meet, 

373
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,180
 all techniques work. 

374
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:31,830
 Miss Writer, about that woman named Ruby at Daehan Noodles from earlier ... 

375
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,970
 Yes. What about Ruby? 

376
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,540
 Does she have a boyfriend? 

377
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,950
Why are you curious about that?

378
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:46,040
 No. But why are you asking? 

379
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,280
 I knew it. Miss Writer, if you don't mind, can I politely reject her? 

380
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,600
 I thought it might bother you, since you seemed to be close to her. 

381
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,830
Reject her? What's going on?

382
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,530
What happened between those two so quickly?

383
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:10,410
 Eonni, about that Illustrator Z from earlier... Does he have a girlfriend? 

384
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,640
Look at them!

385
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,730
 I don't think he has a girlfriend. 

386
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,650
 He doesn't? It seemed he didn't. 

387
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,460
 Why are you curious about that? 

388
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:27,990
 I'm thinking about what I should do. He came onto me so directly. 

389
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,420
 I'm thinking about what I should do. He came onto me so directly. 

390
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:35,080
 I knew it. Miss Writer, if you don't mind, can I politely reject her? I thought it might bother you since you seemed to be close to her. 

391
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,970
What's with these two?

392
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,790
Why is each of them saying that the other likes them?

393
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,120
Why isn't the bus coming?

394
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,780
- Eonni, should I just accept him?
 - What?

395
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,370
Well, it's not that I really like him.

396
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:09,190
But Eonni, Ruby is lonely these days. She's really bored too.

397
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,020
Goodness. I knew he liked me.

398
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,470
He's not that bad-looking, either.

399
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,940
What are you talking about?

400
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,490
Okay. Ruby will accept a lonely soul today.

401
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,680
Yumiiii_010

402
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,250
 Yahoo! Cake. Surprise gift. 

403
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,070
 Control_Z: Ha ha ha ha ha 
 - Yumi: -_- 

404
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,880
Hey, Oppa Z, you're in luck today.

405
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,350
Oh! You were talking about that Illustrator from earlier? Awesome!

406
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,880
I'm telling you, he really likes me. I'm planning to give him a chance.

407
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,450
He said he likes you? When did he say that? Was there even time for him to like you?

408
00:28:54,450 --> 00:29:00,490
Eonni, they say thirty seconds is enough for a person to fall for someone.

409
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:09,250
Hey, you're going to leave a comment? That's bold.

410
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,170
Follow him first, then press "like". After that—

411
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,660
No. Dragging things on isn't Ruby's style.

412
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,230
- Ruby is fast-paced. 
 - Then are you ...

413
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,200
I'm going straight for the DMs.

414
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,420
 Wow! 

415
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,610
Lee Ruby. You're saying you like me and fell for me at first sight, huh?

416
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,830
What's this? Did she just send me a DM?

417
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,990
 She's crazy. She really fell head over heels for me. 

418
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,920
 Did you make it home safely? 

419
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,770
 I happened to find you on Eonni Yumi's social media. I was glad to see you, so I'm sending you a DM. 

420
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:55,690
But he read the message, so why isn't he replying?

421
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,030
It's been three minutes.

422
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:04,660
Ruby. I think you got rejected.

423
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:11,510
See? I told you you were too bold.

424
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,830
Eonni, aren't you getting on? It's the bus that goes to your place.

425
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,800
I can get on the next one.

426
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,360
- You should get on that one. 
 - All right. I'm going.

427
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,240
 Suanmaeul Underground, Front of Daehan Noodles, Bombi Elementary School 

428
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,100
What the heck? Why isn't he texting back?

429
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,950
Are you playing hard-to-get?

430
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,000
He texted back!

431
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,100
What am I doing? Why am I getting excited when this is nothing special?

432
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,040
 I really had to think hard to remember who you are. 

433
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,430
 It was nice to meet you today. 

434
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,070
What's with him? He's being coy.

435
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,780
All right, now I'll offer you the chance to date me.

436
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,290
 Run the dating protocol. 

437
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:13,000
 Dating protocol: A technique where you stimulate your target's curiosity by acting as if you have something amazing that you are doing 

438
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,090
 and draw them to say, "I don't have anything special going on this weekend." 

439
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:19,120
 Then make plans with them for the weekend. 
   

440
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,460
All right.

441
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,010
Now you should reply, "I don't have anything special going on." That's the correct reply.

442
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,720
- Why? 
 - "Why?"

443
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,410
What's with him? You're going to keep playing hard-to-get?

444
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,550
But since I've already caught on that you like me,

445
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,840
playing hard-to-get doesn't work on me.

446
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,650
 I got tickets to an exhibition, so I was planning to go over the weekend. 

447
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,910
 Do you want to go with me? 

448
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,040
 I have a deadline on that weekend, so that would be a bit difficult for me. 

449
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,570
This doesn't make sense.

450
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,010
 Is this a rejection? 

451
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:09,180
 Wait, this is strange. What's going on? 

452
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,260
 There's no way I misunderstood, right? Was I the only one making a fool of myself? 

453
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:23,400
 No, there's no way. Let's sort this out first. 

454
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,610
 I see. 

455
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:32,300
 I just asked because I thought you'd like it, since you're an artist. 

456
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,250
If you weren't going to start something with me,

457
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,000
then why the f*ck did you say my name was pretty? You a**hole.

458
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,110
 Instead of the weekend, do you have any time tomorrow evening? 

459
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,370
It's okay, right?

460
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,740
Yes.

461
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,380
Oh, right! I heard you're meeting Ruby today.

462
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,970
Illustrator?

463
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,470
Yes, we are meeting up today.

464
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,410
Yesterday, she suddenly contacted me

465
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,910
and asked me to go see an exhibition with her.

466
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:25,810
 Act normal. Act normal! Why are you so nervous? 

467
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,680
She really wanted to go.

468
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,330
And I don't have any plans today, so...

469
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,280
 What's going on? Why is my heart pounding just from hearing the name Ruby? 

470
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,510
 I'm just humoring her since she likes me. What's wrong with me? 

471
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,670
 Ruby's timing technique makes her target 

472
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,500
 lovesick without fail. 

473
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,110
 When you send Ruby a message, 
   

474
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:53,430
 she never answers right away. Three minutes at the earliest. 
   

475
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:57,400
 Ruby takes the bus, so how about we meet in front of the exhibit hall? 

476
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,070
 Oh, sure. 

477
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:03,790
 At the longest, she replies 20 minutes later. 

478
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:10,200
 She makes the man begin to feel anxious while he waits for her answer. 

479
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,870
 Is she busy? Why isn't she answering? 

480
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,290
 Did I do something wrong? 

481
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,860
 When she replies, while his anxiety is relieved 

482
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,680
 his heart is struck. 

483
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,310
 As that repeats, her target 

484
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:39,510
 ends up flinching just from hearing the name Ruby. 

485
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,150
Oh, right. If you meet Ruby—

486
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,850
 This is the technique of the expert, Ruby. 

487
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,520
 However, the expert, Control Z, cannot lose either. 

488
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,210
What is it?

489
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:04,780
If you're not uncomfortable with it, I'll talk to you informally, Ruby-ya.

490
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:09,080
 Her heart raced a little at Control Z's preemptive strike. 

491
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,640
That's fine.

492
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,630
 However, he went straight for the fatal blow. 

493
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,710
Then, Ruby...

494
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,170
Shall we date?

495
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:25,770
♫  Let's build a little house in front of the river  ♫

496
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,500
 Wait. You have to wait. 

497
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,240
 One second, two seconds, three seconds, 
 ♫ Let's raise our dreams over the mountain peak there ♫ 

498
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:38,000
 four seconds, five seconds, six seconds 
 ♫ My dear, ♫  

499
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,420
I mean, I ... Don't feel pressured. I just ...

500
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,110
 Ten seconds!   
 - Okay!

501
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:56,200
♫  Let's fill that boat full with luggage  ♫

502
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,850
 It's now the second time they've met. 

503
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:04,230
 This is the experts' dating method. 

504
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,580
♫  So that our love deepens   ♫

505
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:14,580
 Episode 35 
 The Business Trip 

506
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,260
 Ruby 

507
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,610
Hey, Ruby.

508
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,270
  Eonni, you have a meeting with Oppa Z today, right? 

509
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:35,190
 Can you meet him at the studio today? 

510
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,620
It's not that I can't, but why?

511
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,200
Knock, knock, knock! Ruby's here!

512
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,580
I brought you a lunchbox!

513
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,860
Wow, you really packed it!

514
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:53,500
Ta-da! This is Ruby's homemade low-calorie, low-salt lunchbox for your well-being.

515
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,750
Low-calorie? Low-salt? Well-being?

516
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:03,400
The three things you shouldn't say together with any food.

517
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,660
It's just mixed greens.

518
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,050
That's why it's healthy. I put in everything that's good for you.

519
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,800
Hurry up and eat it.

520
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,890
Ruby, I can't eat this.

521
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:18,170
No, I won't eat it.

522
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,780
Why? Because it's too plain?

523
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,230
How can I eat this?

524
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,650
The lunchbox is too pretty!

525
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,580
It feels a shame to eat it.

526
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,900
Oppa Z!

527
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,780
- The lunchbox is really pretty.
 - Thank you! Hurry up and eat it.

528
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,860
- Take a bite.
 - When did you make all this?

529
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,730
Looks delicious, right?

530
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:42,710
 But the lunchbox is really pretty. 

531
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:47,680
 This is a lunchbox that can only be made when you passionately love someone. 

532
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,650
 There was a time when Yumi did that, too. 

533
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,310
Thanks for the lunchbox.

534
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,620
It's good for you, so make sure you eat it all.

535
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,750
I'll pack another one for you next time.

536
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,280
 No, no! No, she can't! 

537
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,520
No, it's okay. Don't do that, Ruby.

538
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,660
- I can just go buy lunch. Why would you do that? 
 - It's no problem at all.

539
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,100
I'll make one for you once a week.

540
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,600
 We're screwed! 

541
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,140
- Bye, Eonni.
 - Bye, Ruby.

542
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,290
Bye bye!

543
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,750
Let's go.

544
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,390
Oh, that's right.

545
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,580
My family sent me too much corn.

546
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,770
- Corn? 
 - Do you want to come by later and take some?

547
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:56,070
 What's going on? He's asking me to come over to get some corn, so why is my heart racing? 

548
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,810
 Eonni, I have something to ask you. 

549
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:24,290
 You'll know since you've been dating for a long time. 

550
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:30,680
 Oppa Z said that he has a lot of corn at his house and told me to take some. What does this mean? 

551
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,870
What is she saying?

552
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,510
He's probably saying they should share the corn.

553
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,270
 Wait!!! 

554
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,800
 Once she received Ruby's text message... 

555
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,140
Move over, you amateurs!

556
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,850
 A cell that had been forgotten for a while 

557
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,280
 made an appearance. 

558
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,090
For example,

559
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,500
"Do you want to come in for a cup of tea?"

560
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,380
"Do you want to come over and eat ramen?"

561
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,180
Do you want to come over and eat ramen?

562
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,270
All right, this is a language exchanged between naughty cells.

563
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:07,200
It's known as a signal.

564
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,310
- Oh, signal.
 - Signal.

565
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,320
 For example... 

566
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,680
Do you want to come over to my place today?

567
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,410
Yes, baby. Oooh.

568
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:22,540
 It can sound strange if you say it this way. 

569
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,290
Do you want to come over to my place to see my cute pet mole?

570
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:32,110
- Oh, I'd love to! 
  - But if you use a signal, 

571
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,550
 it's not strange anymore! 

572
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,720
What Ruby got was a  farm product signal that is popular these days.

573
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,740
That's what it means!

574
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,480
That's right. That's what it is.

575
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,220
 Ruby, isn't this possibly 

576
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,180
 a signal? 

577
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,310
 What kind of signal? 

578
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,090
  A signal asking, "Do you want to come over to my place today?" 

579
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,590
Ruby, here's your coffee.

580
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,170
Thank you.

581
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,870
- It's hot. 
 - Yeah, it is. Be careful.

582
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,570
Those are the good times.

583
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,010
Ba Bi.

584
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,580
Where are you?

585
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,990
 I came home. I finished the meeting. 

586
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,900
- What time should we meet later? 
 - It doesn't matter.

587
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,740
- Seven o'clock? Eight o'clock?
 - Then...

588
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,650
Shall we meet around six o'clock?

589
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,160
 - Sure.   
 - I'll call you when I get there.

590
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,260
 - Okay.  
 - Oh, by the way, Yumi. 
 - Yeah?

591
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,510
My oldest sister sent me a ton of potatoes.

592
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,560
Do you want to take some?

593
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,210
- Potatoes? 
 - Yeah.

594
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:03,790
She sent me too many, so I think it would be good if you took some.

595
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,920
 Is it because of the conversation she just had with Ruby? 

596
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,590
All right. I'll just take them when I come by later.

597
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:16,510
 For the first time in a while, she started to sense the signal. 

598
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,980
Yeah. Okay.

599
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,170
Call me.

600
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,400
Here, here. For a change, I'm looking forward to tonight.

601
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,800
So make sure you prepare yourselves well.

602
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,490
 Once Naughty returned, the village started to revitalize. 

603
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,970
It's been so long since we had pink sky.

604
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,860
My heart is fluttering again for the first time in a while.

605
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,380
I have a good idea, Sensitivity.

606
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,640
Next Thursday is Ba Bi's birthday.

607
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,980
 How about we make a lunchbox and send it to him on his birthday? 

608
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,970
 Since it's his work day, we'll send him lunch to his office. 

609
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,430
And meet him for dinner. Don't you think he would like it?

610
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,160
That's a good idea!

611
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,010
We needed something like this to get back to how we used to be with Ba Bi.

612
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,010
The small pleasures of dating.

613
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:06,070
That's right!

614
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,990
 All right, she has the couple ring on 

615
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:23,610
 and with a mindset to have a fresh start from today. 

616
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:45,860
 What? Where is his ring? 

617
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,570
 Come in. 

618
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,980
You're here.

619
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,150
Do you want something to drink?

620
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,400
I'll have a cappuccino.

621
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,430
I'll go buy it.

622
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,760
Yumi.

623
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,160
I thought you were feeling pressured.

624
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,190
What?

625
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:51,560
I thought that you were feeling pressured because I was the only one wearing the couple ring.

626
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,760
I'm not.

627
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:57,680
I wasn't.

628
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,760
That's why I took it off.

629
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,440
I wasn't but I'll take it off, too.

630
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,180
No, why?

631
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,890
It's kind of silly.

632
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:10,640
I can just put it back on.

633
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,870
No need.

634
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,700
That's not important. Right?

635
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:19,020
Let's not worry about things like this.

636
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:25,760
Thank you.

637
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:41,590
Right. It's your birthday next week. How about we go there?

638
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:43,790
That place you mentioned last time, in Namsan Park.

639
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:47,880
Right, I was going to tell you this.

640
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,440
I'm going on a business trip next week.

641
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,880
- A business trip? 
 - It was originally supposed to be in April.

642
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,740
But it was moved pushed forward, so I'm leaving on Sunday.

643
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,010
The business trip to US that you mentioned before?

644
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:04,200
Yes. I told you that it's for three weeks, right?

645
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,520
Then your birthday—

646
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,110
I'll already be in US by then.

647
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:13,860
I was making plans for it.

648
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,270
Don't worry about it. You're busy because of your deadlines, too.

649
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:22,040
If you're departing on Sunday, then that's in just a few days.

650
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,170
I know.

651
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:26,630
It was decided today.

652
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,750
Yumi, wait here.

653
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:39,880
I'll get the car.

654
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,160
- You brought your car? 
 - Yes.

655
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,140
I parked in a public parking lot over there.

656
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:48,170
Why did you bring your car when we're so close to home? Weren't we going to your house?

657
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,480
You told me to take some potatoes.

658
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,030
Yes, on the way home from work I stopped by home and got some.

659
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,340
Oh.

660
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,350
I'll be right back.

661
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,980
Let's go in. I'll bring it in.

662
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,520
Signal my butt! It didn't mean to go over to Ba Bi's place.

663
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,370
You said it was a 'farm product signal'!

664
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:54,140
Well, there's still Yumi's place.

665
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,790
Is Ba Bi's place the only place we can go?

666
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,790
- Housework Cell! 
 - Huh?

667
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,720
Is the house clean? How about the dishes?

668
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,730
Of course not.

669
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:07,820
Damn it!

670
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,710
Ba Bi, put it down there.

671
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:15,050
What? I'll bring it into your kitchen.

672
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,680
No need. Put it down here.

673
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,340
Why?

674
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:22,800
My place is kind of messy.

675
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:30,080
Then…

676
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:35,730
It'd be nice if you came in for a cup of tea, but it's too messy.

677
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:38,090
Then I'll get going. Rest up.

678
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,780
Okay.

679
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,890
Wait for me.

680
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:47,740
I'll get going.

681
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,760
Bye.

682
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,360
Oh, by the way, is he all better?

683
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,340
Who?

684
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,050
Mr. Gu Wung.

685
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,690
I'm not sure. He's probably fine.

686
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:06,020
I don't know because I haven't heard from him since then.

687
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,110
Is that so?

688
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,740
Of course I don't know.

689
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,180
We just met by coincidence because of Illustrator Z.

690
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,490
I'll call you tomorrow.

691
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,210
Thanks for the potatoes.

692
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:20,410
Sure. Hurry in. It's cold.

693
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,640
 Something keeps going wrong little by little. 

694
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,040
 It wasn't like this in the past. 

695
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:59,590
 Is this how we slowly grow apart? 

696
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:06,620
 It's true that restarting a relationship after breaking up is the highest level of difficulty. 

697
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:15,380
 Sunday 

698
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,560
 Wake up! 

699
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,810
 Wake up! 

700
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,000
 Wake up! 

701
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:37,510
 Yumi, I'm leaving for the airport early. 

702
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:41,590
 I didn't want to wake you, so I didn't call. I'll be back.  

703
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,310
 The phone is turned off. You will be connected to voice mail… 

704
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,140
 Ba Bi 

705
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,780
 You must be tired. Have a safe trip. 

706
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,390
 Let me know when you get there. 

707
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,220
Hasn't he arrived there yet?

708
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:32,810
♫  Today too because my day  ♫

709
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,610
♫  snuck up on me  ♫

710
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:44,310
♫  I didn't even expect this  ♫

711
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:49,550
 Yumi, I just arrived at the hotel. 
 ♫ it is playing a joke♫  

712
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,800
 Just now? 

713
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,520
 You must be tired. 
 ♫ Why of all days, this morning ♫  

714
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,560
 The flight was delayed, so I arrived late. 

715
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,720
 I'm tired, so I should take a quick nap. 

716
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,220
 There is a meeting starting in the evening. 

717
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:07,040
 Sure, get some sleep. 

718
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,410
♫  I thought about it for a long time  ♫

719
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:18,240
♫  It's not about something I can understand  ♫

720
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,220
 Monday 

721
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,550
♫  To me who is spending an unexpected day  ♫

722
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:28,870
 Done with my meeting and on my way to the factory. The night scenery is nice here. 

723
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:32,900
 Wow, send me some pics from time to time. 

724
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,880
 I will. 
 ♫ so I can feel your love love love love ♫  

725
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,240
 Tuesday 

726
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,960
Writer, I think that's a good idea.

727
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,770
- Right? 
 - Yes.

728
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:47,430
♫  To me who is about to cry  ♫

729
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:51,170
♫  sing a song song song song song  ♫

730
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:53,520
I'm sorry. This is an international call. Excuse me.

731
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,660
Sure.

732
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:58,290
♫  so that I can feel your love love love love  ♫

733
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:00,060
Hello?

734
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,150
Yes, Ba Bi.

735
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:04,090
 Yumi, are you doing well? 

736
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:09,110
Yes, I'm doing fine. You must be very busy. You did send any photos.

737
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:13,340
 I've just been going to factories and meetings, so there wasn't any nice sceneries worth sending. 

738
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:17,160
Still, at least send me a photo of the factory. I'm curious.

739
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,850
 Okay. 

740
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:21,290
 I just got out for a little bit. I need to get back. 

741
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:24,190
All right. I was in the middle of a meeting, too.

742
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:25,960
 Okay, have a good day. 

743
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,200
Oh! And—

744
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:39,600
He must be really busy.

745
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,050
 Wednesday 

746
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,870
 Yumi, you're doing well, right? 

747
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,900
 I've been working more than I thought, so it's hard to have any free time. 

748
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,230
Wasn't Ba Bi's text really short?

749
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:11,110
He didn't even send a single photo.

750
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:12,900
He changed.

751
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,700
Ba Bi definitely changed.

752
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,350
Do you think Ba Bi is possibly regretting it?

753
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:21,860
Getting back together?

754
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,660
 I think so. 

755
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:32,040
 He really must be regretting it. 

756
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:39,670
 Thursday 

757
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,310
- Give me this one, please. 
 - Sure.

758
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:46,560
How many candles do you need?

759
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,630
Three long ones and five short ones.

760
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,720
Since it's not his birthday over there yet,

761
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,940
I can call him right at midnight.

762
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:04,570
 Happy Birthday Ba Bi! 

763
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,000
It's all set.

764
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,410
It's past midnight, right? 
  New York 00:08 

765
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:25,330
He should be in his hotel room right now.

766
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,150
I'll be like this

767
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,970
then "Surprise!"

768
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,990
Okay!

769
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,200
 Video Calling Ba Bi 

770
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:53,270
 The call cannot be answered right now. 

771
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:56,200
 Please call again. 

772
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,340
Why isn't he answering?

773
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,080
 Yumi, the internet doesn't work that well here. 

774
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,570
 I can't answer. 

775
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:11,840
 You're not at your hotel? 

776
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,680
 I'm out having a drink with the section chief. The internet isn't working well. 

777
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:19,530
 I wanted to tell you happy birthday. 

778
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,090
 Thank you. 

779
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:23,940
 Still, I'm glad you are with someone. 

780
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,910
 Eat a lot 

781
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:29,820
 and happy birthday, Ba Bi. 

782
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,900
 Thank you. 

783
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:53,080
 Happy Birthday Ba Bi! 

784
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,950
 When Ba Bi comes back, I think she needs to talk with him or something. 

785
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,770
 They can't keep going on like this. 

786
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:19,630
 Isn't that Ba Bi in that taxi over there? 

787
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:22,660
Oh my god! It's Ba Bi!

788
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:26,220
Does that make sense? Ba Bi is in the US.

789
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:29,020
But that is Ba Bi!

790
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:49,870
He didn't go on a business trip?! He lied?! Why?

791
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,770
Is it because he doesn't want to be with her?

792
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:55,840
Because his feelings changed and he wants to break up again, but it's hard to say it.

793
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:00,090
Don't tell me it's because he doesn't want to spend his birthday with Yumi.

794
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:03,220
That makes no sense. It doesn't!

795
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,410
Let's check. Go after him!

796
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,810
Taxi!

797
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:13,060
Hello.

798
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:15,700
Sir, can you please follow that taxi up there.

799
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,840
That taxi over there?

800
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,450
Yes, the one up front. Hurry, please.

801
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,180
Yes, ma'am.

802
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:23,540
 Was it just a show, all week long? 

803
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,010
 Was it all a lie from the beginning? 

804
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:32,250
It's his birthday today. Why would he lie even on his birthday?

805
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:38,250
Guys, is he possibly meeting Da Eun?

806
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,610
There's no way!

807
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:44,630
Maybe to spend his birthday with Da Eun.

808
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,500
Sir, pull over up here, please.

809
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,460
Sure.

810
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,350
Thank you.

811
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:14,800
 Guys, what do we do if Da Eun is at his place? 

812
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,990
 Are you crazy? That's a completely ridiculous drama plot. 

813
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:21,420
 Still, it's possible. 

814
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:32,920
 Let's press the doorbell. 

815
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,440
 No, just go in. 

816
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,750
 You can't give him time to lie again. 

817
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:42,940
 What if Da Eun is at his place? 

818
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,610
 Let's be prepared, Yumi. 

819
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:48,430
 It's time to face reality! 

820
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:21,590
Yumi.

821
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:27,440
Yumi, why are you ...

822
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:31,990
Is this the US?

823
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:36,980
You said you're going on a business trip.

824
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:40,570
You said you couldn't video chat because the internet wasn't working well.

825
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:44,190
You said you didn't have any photos to send because you were only at the factory.

826
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:50,480
You were in Seoul this whole time?

827
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,190
Why?

828
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:01,010
Why did you lie?

829
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:06,910
How could you shamelessly lie like that all week long?

830
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:11,160
But I still trusted you again

831
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,730
and forgave you.

832
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,880
I'm sorry I lied.

833
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,670
I thought you'd worry.

834
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:57,590
The truth is I got into an accident on the way to the airport that day.

835
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:04,160
 Yumi, I'm leaving for the airport early. 

836
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:08,030
 I didn't want to wake you, so I didn't call. I'll be back. 

837
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:12,570
 What are they doing? 

838
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,510
I was in the hospital all this time.

839
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:52,630
I was just discharged and came home.

840
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:59,000
Your ... your leg.

841
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,180
Don't worry. They said there wouldn't be any long-term effects.

842
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:07,390
It's a small break.

843
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:15,270
You were in a car accident

844
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:19,250
and you didn't tell me?

845
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,280
I didn't want you to worry.

846
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,610
Does that make sense?

847
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:28,250
I thought you'd be busy because of your deadline.

848
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,990
Does that make sense?

849
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:34,400
Because I wasn't hurt that badly.

850
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,780
Do you seriously think

851
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:39,820
that makes any sense?

852
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:47,920
The truth is

853
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,420
I don't really know why either.

854
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:10,000
 Yumi 

855
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:23,160
I just couldn't tell you.

856
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,000
Why?

857
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,030
I'm not sure.

858
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:40,050
Is it because you regret getting back together with me?

859
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:43,530
Because now that we're back together,

860
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:48,040
you don't feel the way you used to?

861
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:03,640
It's because I thought you regretted getting back together with me.

862
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:19,250
Did I say I regretted it?

863
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:22,840
That's how it seemed.

864
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:27,350
Not because you regretted it?

 Hurry up and come clean, something good happened, right? 

903
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,790
 I'm looking forward to it. 

904
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:25,220
 Writer Yumi is lonely right now. Although they're back together, it's awkward. A relationship like this can't last long. 

905
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:27,100
 Yumi, are you busy? 

906
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:30,510
 Do you know what I regret the most in my life? 

907
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:35,490
 It's when I couldn't answer you when you said let's get married. 

908
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:37,810
 Are you sick? 

909
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:42,310
 I think we're going to be happy.
