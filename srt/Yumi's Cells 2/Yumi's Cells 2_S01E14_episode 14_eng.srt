1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,990

00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,410
 Yumi's Cells 2 

3
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,070
 Episode 39: Laptop 

4
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,540
First place* is mine! Mine! 
  (First to leave a comment.) 

5
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh yeah! First place! First place!

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,580
Its unique sweetness disappeared. It's boring!

7
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,810
Writer Kim Yumi, are you going through a hard time? This is like a funeral march dragging on.

8
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,410
Why did you make a sequel? Just end it if you don't have anything to say.

9
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,950
 I can't read this anymore. I'm leaving now. 

10
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,440
What?

11
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,650
 Oh yeah! First place! 
 Its unique sweetness has disappeared. 

12
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,960
The top comments are all malicious comments.

13
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,160
It's because it's so popular. There are no malicious comments if it's not popular.

14
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,640
But still, there are too many malicious comments these days.

15
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,850
It's because the ending is almost near. They must be worried that it won't be a happy ending.

16
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,720
Don't worry too much about it, Writer. You're going to give them a great ending.

17
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,540
A great ending?

18
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,510
Our company's employees are all looking forward to it, too.

19
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,990
Since you're not giving them any hints, they're all in suspense wondering what the ending will be.

20
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,830
What will the ending be? I'm curious about that, too! Can't you let me know what the ending will be?!

21
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,050
Cook cell told me to bring this to you so you can gain some strength.

22
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,780
Bye!

23
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,620
A great ending! 
  Goddess Yumi! Let's make the best ending!! 

24
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,720
 Although you get the full support of everyone once you become the top priority, it's not necessarily a good thing. 

25
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,900
Oh, no. What should she do?

26
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,350
She has to end it well.

27
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,240
What should she do if it doesn't go well?

28
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,900
- What if she gets cursed at more? 
 - Stop it!

29
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,850
They said they're looking forward to a great ending.

30
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:13,070
If it's not a great ending, won't Yumi be ostracized?

31
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,420
I said stop it, please!

32
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,850
 The cell that is always attached to the top priority is Anxiety. 

33
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,330
If this doesn't go well, it's over! We used all of the down payment to buy the house.

34
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,130
We took out a huge loan!

35
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,930
If things go badly, how will we pay back the loan?

36
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,080
What will we do? What will we do? What will we do? What will we do?!

37
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,890
I said stop it!

38
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,620
I'm so anxious that I can't write!

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,130
You will send the manuscript tomorrow morning before coming to the wedding, right?

40
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,990
I will have to.

41
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,540
Miss Writer, fighting! I'll see you at the ceremonial hall.

42
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes, fighting!

43
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,650
 Although Yumi was under a lot of stress ahead of the release of the sequel, 

44
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,900
 the real incident occurred the night before Yi Da's wedding. 

45
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,590
Reason! Emergency, emergency!

46
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,990
- What is it?
 - I don't see the laptop!

47
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,180
Carefully look for it. It must be somewhere.

48
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,430
It's not there!

49
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,090
 It's not in the place where she usually charges it? 

50
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,980
 It's not there! 

51
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,700
 Then what about the dining table? 

52
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,330
 What about under the bed? 

53
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,590
 It's not there! 

54
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,310
 Did she use a different bag? 

55
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,020
 No! 

56
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,630
 Did it get mixed in with the recyclables? 

57
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,920
 I'm telling you it didn't! 

58
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,220
It's not here. It's gone.

59
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,700
How much of the manuscript is in the laptop?

60
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,060
Including the episode that I'm going to upload tomorrow, there are sixty pages for six chapters.

61
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,650
That much? You didn't make a backup?

62
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,160
I'm sure she left it somewhere when she went out.

63
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,470
What places did she visit today?

64
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:52,420
 It's because the ending is almost near. They must be worried that it won't be a happy ending. 

65
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,260
 There! She had the laptop up until then. 

66
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,360
Yes, Miss Writer?

67
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,270
- Your laptop?
 - Yes.

68
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,750
We were looking at my laptop together this morning and talking about the comments.

69
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,660
That was my laptop, though.

70
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,250
You didn't take your laptop out.

71
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,290
Did you lose it?  What are you going to do? 

72
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,490
Yes, well...

73
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,510
I have to find it. I'll probably find it.

74
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,520
 You backed it up, right? As long as the manuscript is all right ... 

75
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,960
Oh, of course!

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,820
Goodbye.

77
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,400
She must have really lost it.

78
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,340
Let's not despair!

79
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,770
For now, she can just go buy a new laptop tomorrow and rewrite it all!

80
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,580
Rewrite it all? 60 pages?!

81
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,300
Don't you have the outline all in your head?

82
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,890
 In the end, Yumi couldn't find the laptop up to the morning of the wedding. 

83
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:30,280
What will she do now? Everyone from the publishing company is going to the wedding.

84
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,220
What will she do? Come up with an excuse somehow!

85
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,210
There's no manuscript to upload today,

86
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,060
and there's no manuscript to upload next week either. Even if she writes, there are malicious comments.

87
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,690
What do we do? They won't leave—

88
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,760
I don't want to be the prime cell.

89
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,210
Take care.

90
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,420
Don't look for me ever again!

91
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,850
Bye!

92
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,890
Writer!

93
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,830
 Writer abandoned her prime cell position and ran away. 

94
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,620
 Thank you. Thank you. 

95
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,490
Thank you.

96
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,050
Aigoo, Writer Yumi! You made it.

97
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,060
Editor-in-Chief. Congratulations.

98
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,950
Thank you.

99
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:39,020
- Where's Yi Da? 
- She's in the waiting room right now.

100
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,990
You finished by the deadline before you came, right?

101
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,730
- Yes. 
- I'll read it after the ceremony.

102
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,450
I'm looking forward to the last chapter.

103
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,540
Yes.

104
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, yes. Excuse me.

105
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,490
- Congratulations. 
- Oh, thank you.

106
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,260
 The groom's side 

107
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,670
 Kim Yumi 

108
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,700
Wow, Miss Yumi!

109
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,930
Oh, Bon Hui! Hello!

110
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,820
- It's been a long time. It's been so long! 
 - I know!

111
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,890
It's good to see you.

112
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,530
Wait, I heard that you're the one who set up the bride and groom.

113
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,200
They said that the groom is your editor-in-chief.

114
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,210
I didn't set them up.

115
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,740
Your order is ready.

116
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,360
 Really? He was a loser this time, too? 

117
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,450
 Yeah. He was the worst of the worst. 

118
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,250
 I'm not trying to find who is the worst! 

119
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,790
 - I was really angry and— 
 - Miss Writer. 

120
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,490
 Oh, Editor-in-Chief? 

121
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,450
 I saw you on my way to the publishing company. 

122
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,720
 Oh, I had plans with my friend here. 

123
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,670
 I was actually going to leave soon. 

124
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,350
 Yi Da, say hello. This is my Editor-in-Chief. I've talked about him a lot, right? 

125
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,360
 This is my former co-worker, Yi Da. 

126
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,210
 Hello, I'm Kang Yi Da. 

127
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,580
 Hello. I'm Ahn Dae Yong. 

128
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,590
 - You're the best! 
 - Pardon? 

129
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,460
 You're the one who chose Yumi's story. 

130
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,100
 I always told Yumi that you've got a great eye.. 

131
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,320
 You've really got a great eye for writers. 

132
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,080
 Well, that's because her writing is— 

133
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,420
 You're the best! Really the best! 

134
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,420
 What is this? Who is that cute creature? 

135
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,000
 She said she's Kang Yi Da. 

136
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,660
 Let's save that. Kang Yi Da.
  

137
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,820
 Her name is Kang Yi Da. 

138
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,380
 Cute Best (Jjang) Yi Da. 

139
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,040
 The rhyme is perfect, too! 

140
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,060
 - Hello!
 - Hello. 

141
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:15,580
 Hello, I'm Ahn Dae Yong who greeted you last time. You remember me, right? 

142
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,150
 Oh, this ajeossi? 

143
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,200
 Yes, of course. Hello, how have you been? 

144
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,010
 I have a meeting nearby today. 

145
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,460
 If it's all right with you, would you like to have lunch together? 

146
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,510
 Julie Literature Editor-in-Chief Ahn Dae Yong 

147
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,280
 Yes, that sounds good. 

148
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,670
 What's with this ajeossi? It doesn't suit him to leave an emoticon. 

149
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,420
 He's cute. 

150
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,870
I only introduced them to each other. I found out later that they were dating without me knowing.

151
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,530
What's with that? Oh, you also set Ruby up with her boyfriend.

152
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,630
I also only introduced Ruby to him, and they started dating on their own.

153
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,190
Then I should stick by you from now on if I want to get married.

154
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,310
Oh right! We're catching up and forgot we haven't even given our congratulatory money yet. Just a moment!

155
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,540
I'm in charge of giving them the envelopes from the marketing team.

156
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,490
 Yu Ba Bi 

157
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,860
Team Leader Yu couldn't come, so he put me in charge of it.

158
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,090
I see.

159
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,550
Do you know that he's going to an overseas branch?

160
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:46,140
- An overseas branch?
 - Yes, he was assigned to Singapore.

161
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:51,100
He said he couldn't come because he's leaving today. So he asked me to bring the envelopes.

162
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,610
 What's this? This is ridiculous. 

163
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,150
Writer cell ran away, and Love isn't here.

164
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,330
Are there cell villages that don't have a prime cell?

165
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,150
- Reason. 
 - Huh?

166
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:13,080
Is our Yumi really doing well right now?

167
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:19,090
She broke off the wedding, and she failed to meet the deadline.

168
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:24,920
Hey, you can't be like that. Today is Yi Da's wedding. Let's not ruin the mood.

169
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,890
I'm saying that I'm sad. Everyone else gets married so easily.

170
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,520
- Is there anything else? 
 - No, that's everything.

171
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,600
I just left. I'll call you when I get to the airport.

172
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,190
All right.

173
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,960
Hello?

174
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,340
 - Hello, this is the café at the Baekseok-dong intersection. 
  - Oh, yes.

175
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,390
Hello.

176
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,480
I'm calling the number that was left on the coupon.

177
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,080
I see. What is this about?

178
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,690
She's a writer. I thought she would be looking for it.

179
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,900
Yes, that's right. She would be looking for it.

180
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,730
I'm glad that I had your phone number.

181
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,410
Yes, thank you.

182
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,680
She's probably at the wedding right now.

183
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,010
Should we head to the airport now?

184
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,780
Oh, yes.

185
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,660
No! One moment. I've got to stop somewhere.

186
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,990
 This is my first request. 

187
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,320
 More than anything else, please be considerate of each other. 

188
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,920
Passionately taking in each other's charms and strengths

189
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,360
will make you happy ...

190
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,140
Are they going to give us steak?

191
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,850
- Or galbitang? 
 - Be quiet.

192
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,230
I want to eat steak.

193
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,790
- Oppa. 
 - Hm?

194
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:45,120
By the way, isn't that woman in the pink dress pretty? The one on the bride's side?

195
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,070
- You're way prettier, Ruby. 
 - What are you saying? That's obvious.

196
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,880
Did I say something too obvious?

197
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,100
Next, ...

198
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,340
a married couple always ...

199
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,280
Let's listen attentively to the good message.

200
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,360
- Yes, sir. 
   - When the husband loves his wife 

201
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,140
 and when the wife loves her husband, only then can a true family be established. 

202
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,080
 All right, everyone. Listen up! 

203
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,150
Writer has run away.

204
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,480
We are in a bind. There is no place to retreat to.

205
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,650
Yumi couldn't meet the deadline today, and she lost the manuscript for the next three weeks.

206
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,970
As far as the ending goes, she doesn't even have any ideas.

207
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,580
- Oh, no. 
 - What should she do?

208
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,290
All that she has left is a missed deadline, malicious comments,

209
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,840
and the interest on her loan.

210
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,150
So today's strategy...

211
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,130
is the 36th strategy! 
  (From The Thirty-Six Strategems: "If all else fails, retreat.") 

212
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,220
- Is that a strategy? 
 - Thirty-sixth?

213
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,210
As soon as the ceremony ends, Yumi will leave the ceremony hall,

214
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,620
turn her phone off, and go to Mom's house.
 - What?

215
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,730
And then she'll disappear!

216
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,820
Until when? Until Writer comes back and she comes up with a plan!

217
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:14,050
That's the only way that Writer Kim Yumi will survive today!

218
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:21,000
 What makes love complete isn't passion ... 

219
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,340
 Oh, wait! It's Ba Bi. It's Ba Bi! 
   

220
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,040
Happiness is ...

221
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,950
 Yumi. How are you? 

222
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,870
 You're probably at the wedding right now. 

223
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,850
 I got a call saying that you left your laptop at the café. 

224
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,440
 I went to get it so I could bring it to you at the wedding, 

225
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,850
 but I don't think I can make it because there is traffic. 

226
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,130
What time did you say your flight was?

227
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,850
 I'm actually leaving for Singapore today. 

228

 So, I'm sorry, Yumi, 

234
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,410
 but I left your laptop in the airport locker. 

235
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,690
 I was trying to help you, but I'm afraid I ended up inconveniencing you. I'm sorry.

00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,860
 Even if we've broken up, that won't change.

Yumi!

00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,860
- Oh, Wung!
 - My meeting ended late. The ceremony isn't over, right?

261
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,500
The ceremony is over. Everyone's eating. Go on and head inside.

262
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,980
Where are you going?

263
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,580
I need to go find something.

264
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,720
- What? 
 - My laptop. I lost my laptop. Today's my deadline.

265
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,990
- See you later. 
 - Yumi. Yumi!

272
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,160
 Will you end your locker usage and remove your items?
 Yes. No.

 Too much time has gone by. I'm sure he's on the plane.

 Let's at least leave him a text message so he can see it when he gets there.

 thinking about it a lot all this time.

 I think I know what you're going to say.

 I'm sorry.

 By the time you see this, you'll be in Singapore, right?

 I wish you all the best while you are there.

Oh.

I thought you'd be on the plane.

298
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,490
It was delayed. There's heavy rain over there.

299
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,210
I think it happened so I can see you before I go.

300
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,760
Really?

301
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,440
I'm glad that I got to see you and say goodbye before I left.

You saved me.

303
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,980

When will you finish the novel?

305
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,570
The end of the year? If it goes well, around Christmas.

Oh, I see.

307

Finish it well.

Did you get a boyfriend?

312
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,340
- No. I don't have time to. 
 - Really?

313
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,860
 Whats this? 

314
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,620
 Why is he smiling? What does that mean? 

315
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,040
Oh my goodness!

316
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,440
My heart is fluttering!

317
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,520
Hey, hey! Are you guys starting up again?

318
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,550
Is this the first or second time? Knock it off!

319
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,360
Ba Bi always speaks in a sweet manner.

320
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,060
We know, we know.

321
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,910
What about you?

322
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:03,850
- Me? 
 - Do you have a girlfriend?

323
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,490
I am seeing someone.

324
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,050
- What's this? 
 - See. You heard him, right?

325
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,780
- Get a hold of yourself.
- I know. I said I know!

326
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,920
Did I say anything?

327
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,850
I see. I hope it goes well.

328
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,440
Team Leader Ba Bi.

329
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,480
We have to go in now.

330
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,430
Oh, really?

331
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,970
I'll head in.

332
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,210
Okay. Have a good trip.

333
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,560
Take care.

334
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,870
By the way, was that woman from earlier your girlfriend?

335
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,780
Oh, she's not.

336
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,690
For some reason, I thought the vibe was ...

337
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,640
She's my ex-girlfriend.

338
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,160
What about now?

339
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,720
It's been a while since we broke up.

340
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,060
Then why was she at the airport?

341
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,570
Things ended up that way coincidentally.

342
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:49,550
- It looked as if she was a girlfriend coming to see me off, right? 
 - Yes.

343
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,040
But, Team Leader,  why won't you go on any blind dates?

344
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,660
I've recommended several women, but you said you didn't want to meet any of them.

345
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:59,280
- Because I don't want to. 
 - Why?

346
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,450
Why are you smiling?

347
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,770
Why aren't you going on any dates?

348
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,550
I'm not sure.

349
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,810
I don't really know why, either.

350
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:31,030
 Episode 40 
 The Return 

351
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,290
 Love disappeared one year ago on Christmas Eve. 

352
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,550
♫  I didn't hear anything   ♫

353
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:52,220
♫   The small light went out  ♫

354
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,370
 Dating, damn you! This damned love affair! 

355
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:02,530
 I'm telling you it's exasperating! 

356
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,540
 The day that Love turned into the incarnation of rage 

357
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:10,090
 Love. 
 ♫ Ling Ling don't make a sad face ♫ 

358
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,760
♫ Without my being vigilant in my heart there is no suspicious intent ♫

359
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,590
 Give the prime cell position to Writer. 

360
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:22,330
♫  Ling Ling don't try to be understanding  ♫

361
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:27,760
♫  Aside from minor quirks I am usually such a person  ♫

362
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,110
 and got kicked out of her position as the prime cell. 

363
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,220
 Love, who was banished to another dimension, 

364
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:46,180
 didn't return even when Yumi ran into Wung as if it were fate, 

365
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,400
 or even when she got back together with Ba Bi. 

366
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,830
 Yumi, should we... 
 ♫ I'll keep remembering the past. We're going to fall. ♫ 

367
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,410
 get married? 
 ♫ Even so it's better than being dizzy ♫ 

368
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:10,140
 Let's get married. 
 ♫ Ling Ling you're such a fool ♫  

369
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,610
 Even when she was proposed to... 
 ♫ There isn't anyone who loves you ♫ 

370
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,570
 I have been 
 ♫ as much as I do ♫ 

371
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:22,440
 thinking about it a lot all this time. 
 ♫ Ling Ling you'll know eventually ♫ 

372
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,610
 I think I know what you're going to say. 
 ♫ Ordinary things ♫  

373
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:32,780
 and even when they were breaking up, Love didn't come back. 
 ♫ don't suit you at all ♫ 

374
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,290
- I'm better at that.
 - Wait, why?

375
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,670
 Of course, it's not like there was never a time when her heart fluttered after that. 

376
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,800
Writer Yumi!

377
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,880
Oppa!

378
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,420
Mr. Yeon In*? 
  (Also means one's love) 

379
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,460
Oh, my friend said he wanted to greet you before he left. Say hello, Yeon In. This is Writer Yumi.

380
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,150
Hello.

381
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,760
Hello.

382
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,720
I'm really enjoying My Love Muse.

383
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,700
Thank you. 
 ♫  Error! Error!  ♫

384
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,360
- It's Love! Love is here!
- She said Love is here!

385
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,300
So she's finally back!

386
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,200
 She sometimes wonders, "Is this possibly a romantic feeling?" But... 

387
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,370
Me? I'm not Love, I'm Curiosity.

388
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:29,540
 There are a lot of cases where it's not. 

389
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,970
It's Curiosity. It's Curiousity!

390
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,140
What's going on? Why is he acting like that?

391
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,260
- You guys were all fooled. 
 - So annoying.

392
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,060
 Romance 

393
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,940
Ma'am,

394
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,170
here is the book you were looking for.

395
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,970
- Thank you. 
  - Wow, he's handsome. 

396
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,580
It must be real this time!

397
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,480
Love has really come back!

398
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,260
Handsome men are innocent.

399
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,390
Where's Love?

400
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,030
It's not her.

401
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,640
It's not her!

402
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,930
It was Sensitivity.

403
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,080
- What the heck? 
 - I'm so annoyed.

404
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,040
Excuse me.

405
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,310
I think you dropped this.

406
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,180
Thank you.

407
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,290
Really, really, my heart just dropped.

408
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,600
It is real this time. This time it's really Love!

409
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:09,170
Guys, isn't that guy so sexy?

410
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,370
I want to touch his arms just once.

411
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,170
Get rid of him.

412
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,070
 At first, there were times we were fooled by her feelings, 

413
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,290
 but now Yumi doesn't fall for it either. 

414
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:27,820
Eonni. You were piercing a hole with your eyes at Oppa Z's friend.

415
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,860
Are you falling in love?

416
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,990
It's not like that. Go away.

417
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:37,600
- That's suspicious. 
 - I told you it wasn't like that.

418
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,780
Okay.

419
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,410
 Will Love return this Christmas? 

420
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,160
 No. 

421
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:21,730
 This Christmas, these guys returned. 

422
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,190
 Fat 

423
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,990
Fat cells.

424
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,200
We have finally arrived on a new land.

425
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,010
This is where we will be living from now on.

426
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,150
Leader!

427
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,440
Then where do we settle down at?

428
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,950
Let's go to Gaseum*! 
  (Refers to the chest or heart.) 

429
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,070
Gaseum! Gaseum! Gaseum! 
  Gaseum 2 Yumi miles 

430
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,220
No, let's go to Yeopguri*! 
 (Refers to the waist) 

431
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,240
Huh? 
  Yeopguri 55 Yumi miles 

432
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,190
- Yeopguri? 
 - Yeopguri is safe.

433
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,210
Once we settled on the waist, we are less likely to be kicked out.

434
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:00,600
On top of that, a lot of our Fat siblings already live there.

435
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,790
Let's go! Let's go!

436
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,900
Let's go!

437
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,230
To the paradise of happiness, Yeopguri!

438
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,190
Yeopguri!

439
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,420
- Yeopguri! 
 - Woo!

440
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,550
No, it's not that way. Come here.

441
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,400
It's not?

442
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,330
Seriously, why can't I figure this out?

443
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:38,550
 Yumi is currently suffering a deadline syndrome, pressured to finish her manuscript before the deadline. 

444
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,710
♫  I also wouldn't know  ♫

445
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,270
♫  my heart  ♫

446
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,190
I just have to write five chapters.

447
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,280
Just five chapters.

448
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,690
♫  There's a me  ♫

449
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,610
Why does it have to be five chapters?

450
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:02,770
♫  I don't know  ♫

♫  Even if I walk slowly  ♫

452
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,490
♫  My heart is running far away there  ♫

453
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,810
Why is it so messy?

454
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:14,120
Reason, how about we clean the room before we write?

455
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,510
Wait, are you crazy?!

456
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,190
Why are you doing things you don't normally do, on the day of her deadline?!

457
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,630
Reason, I suddenly really want to find out where the best vacation spots are

458
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,000
that Hollywood celebs go.

459
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,820
Let's try looking it up, huh?

460
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,870
Curiosity, why are you acting like this too? 
 ♫  Even if I walk carefully  ♫

461
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,590
♫  my heart is far away there  ♫

462
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,950
♫  Even at night when everyone is asleep  ♫

00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:41,530
♫  It's racing wide awake  ♫

464
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,400
 - When you get deadline syndrome,  
 - It's nice.

465
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,870
 everything except the deadline becomes interesting. 

466
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,280
Where is this?

467
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,350
♫  There is a world I don't know  ♫

468
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,680
♫  Even if I spend a day when nothing happens  ♫

469
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,900
These hairs. 
 ♫  My heart is heading somewhere  ♫

470
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,960
♫  Even I still don't know  ♫

471
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,440
♫  It's running there far away  ♫

472
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,940
♫  It shouldn't run so fast  ♫

473
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,650
♫  Even if I knew I can't do anything with my heart  ♫

474
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,150
This is so fun!

475
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,310
It's been a while, should I wash the blankets, too?

476
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,620
That's enough!

477
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,550
I'm going crazy.

478
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:35,180
Why are the last five chapters so hard?

479
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,370
I'm even sleepy.

480
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,590
Hello?

481
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,140
 Eonni, when are you done? 

482
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,070
I don't know. I don't have a plan.

483
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,140
I don't think I'm going to meet the deadline.

484
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,880
 What do you mean? 

485
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,720
 We are all preparing a party and waiting for you! 

486
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,100
A party?

487
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,530
Everyone is waiting to congratulate you when you finish your manuscript.

488
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,570
 In the middle of the day? 

489
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,920
We're going to start now and go on all night.

490
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,270
Hurry up and come.

491
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,680
Miss Writer, it's not a lie. The microbrew here is amazing. Hurry over!

492
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,350
Eonni Yi Da said she's coming too. Straight from her honeymoon trip.

493
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,710
Are you going to sit alone in your room and write all night on Christmas Eve?

494
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,560
Eonni, do you really want to live like that?

495
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,680
No.

496
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,910
 So quickly finish and come here! 

497
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,970
A party?

498
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,480
That sounds good.

499
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,040
What?

500
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,600
I just thought of something.

501
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,880
If I make the ending happen at a year-end party...

502
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,900
Eonni, I can't hear you very well.

503
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,150
Ah, that's right! That's it!

504
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,190
That's where they meet for the first time.

505
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,130
Coincidentally, at the year-end party.

506
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,770
The music is so loud that they can't even exchange names.

507
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,320
What? What did you just say?

508
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,370
Okay, I'm hanging up!

509
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:13,160
That's right. 
 ♫  Are you paying attention to me?  ♫

510
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,740
This is how it can go. 
 ♫   Or is it meaningless?  ♫

511
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,110
♫  Do our eyes keep meeting?  ♫

512
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,460
♫  Or were you just looking at something behind me?  ♫

513
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,490
That day was Christmas Eve.

514
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,780
Yeon Jae, who is going to the year-end party thrown by her company,

515
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,640
ends up meeting him as if it's fated. 
 ♫  I'm going to continue to hide it  ♫

516
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,520
♫  so you won't know how I feel  ♫

517
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,550
But because the music is too loud,

518
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,780
she can't hear him when he tells her his name.

519
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,110
♫  Am I the only one you're nice to?  ♫

520
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:46,280
But he remembered Yeon Jae's name. ♫  Am I the only one who thinks so?  ♫

521
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,450
Like a miracle.

522
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,490
 When a writer's block suddenly clears, 
 ♫ I really want to know how you feel ♫ 

523
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,720
 it's extremely thrilling. 
 ♫ What is obvious ♫  

524
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,950
 Then it's immediately time for Endorphin. 
 Endorphin 

525
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:01,920
Everyone, we're here! 
 ♫  Although there aren't enough clues ♫ 

526
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,120
♫  I have my hunch that I care about you  ♫

527
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,960
Everybody shout together!

528
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,350
Who are we?

529
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:12,460
En-dor-phin!

530
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,450
 "I remember." 
 "What?" 

531
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:29,350
♫  Oh, I want to hear your heart  ♫

532
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:45,040
 The End 

533
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,800
 Enter 

534
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,380
The end.

535
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,500
 Send 

536
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,770
 Your email has been sent successfully. 

537
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:16,810
 I sent you the manuscript ^^ 

538
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,810
I'm done!

539
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,960
It's done!!!

540
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,810
 It's been a year since she became a writer. During that time, Yumi wrote two novels, My Love Muse 

541
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,420
 and its sequel. 

542
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,770
It's so refreshing.

543
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:15,420
Kim Yumi, you worked hard.

544
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,130
 - Good job, Yumi. 
 - Good job, Yumi. 

545
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,170
 You worked hard, Yumi! 

546
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,890
 Good job, Yumi. 

547
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,910
 The cell village is also busy at the end of the year. 

548
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,640
 After the Endorphin concert, there's a year-end awards ceremony. 

549
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,380
It's a beautiful night.

550
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,840
 Yumi Awards 

551
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,250
All right, then. I'll announce this year's award winners.

552
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,110
End of the year closing.

553
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:48,340
This year's Best Cell Award selected by Yumi's cells goes to ...

554
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:56,360
It can't be any other cell but me. It's embarrassing to pretend not to know.

555
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,410
The Best Cell Award!

556
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:02,020
The winner is... The winner is...

557
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,590
We'll be back after the commercials.

558
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,900
What ...

559
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,790
 My Love Muse 2! Currently a best-seller! 
   

560
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:11,510
 Yumi Awards 
 Best Cell Award 

561
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:15,590
 Sensitivity - Writer - Flowy 

562
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,810
The winner is ...

563
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,500
Ba Bi's cells!

564
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,790
 Yumi Awards- The Best Cell Award 
 Ba Bi's cells 

565
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,340
♫  Welcome to Ba Bi's world! Hola!  ♫

566
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,170
I can't believe this, seriously!

567
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:31,050
As Ba Bi's cells are currently living overseas,

568
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,720
they are unable to attend the award ceremony.

569
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,580
- I will accept in their— 
 - Hey!

570
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,270
I'm the one who made Yumi a writer!

571
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,090
And I made the first and second books a success!

572
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,600
Naturally, you should be giving that award to me!

573
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,930
What kind of bulls**t is this award ceremony!

574
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,090
Let me go!

575
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,890
Writer, calm down.

576
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:51,660
You are the one who wrote the books, but Ba Bi was the one who saved you.

577
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,640
What? Ba Bi saved me?

578
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,250
 So I'm wondering, can you write something for me? 
 ♫ Let's build a little house ♫ 

579
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,000
 I think you would do well, Assistant Manager Yumi. 
 ♫ in front of the river ♫ 

580
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,710
The first one to recognize our talent was Ba Bi. 
 ♫  Let's raise our dreams  ♫

581
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,330
The one who always supported us was also Ba Bi. 
 ♫  over the mountain peak there  ♫

582
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:11,250
♫  My dear,  ♫

583
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:17,090
The one who even found our laptop in the end was Ba Bi, too.

584
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:20,050
 Writer Cell 

585
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:26,990
If Ba Bi hadn't believed in you, you probably would have already been buried here. 
 ♫  Let's hide in our little house and kiss  ♫

586
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:29,560
 Do you admit it? 
 ♫ I will build a fortress in your heart ♫ 

587
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,610
 I admit it. 
 ♫ when you have nowhere to go ♫ 

588
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:37,990
♫  I will take it to you  ♫

589
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:42,050
♫  and open your door  ♫

590
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,430
 Thanks to you, I was able to finish my manuscript smoothly. 

591
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,790
 Thank you. 
 ♫ If time were to move backwards ♫ 

592
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,350
 Merry Christmas. 

593
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,560
♫  I won't let you go  ♫

594
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:01,810
♫  Both the next time and   ♫

595
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:06,770
♫  the day after tomorrow, we  ♫

 Notebook 
 Recipient: Kim Yumi 

597
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,040
Oh, right.

598
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,640
 Once she finished the book, there was something she had to do first. 

599
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,540
 What is this? 

600
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,980
   

601
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,240
 Hello. 

602
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,870
 Wung. Why did you send a laptop? 

603
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:31,080
 Oh! It arrived? 

604
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,950
 You said you lost yours. I thought you would need one right away. 

605
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,200
 You're not tech savvy. 

606
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:41,100
 Wait ... Wung, I'm grateful, but I found my laptop. 

607
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,620
 Oh, really? That's great. 

608
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,840
 So I will send this back to you. 

609
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,800
 That's okay. Just use it. 

610
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,640
 It has the best performance because it's the latest model. 

611
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,040
 No, I can't. Why would you buy me a laptop? 

612
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,130
 Why? It could just be a gift from a fan. 

613
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,760
 So you can write good stories. 

614
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,840
 No, this is really not right. I will send it back to you. 

615
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,730
 If you send it back then I will send it back to you again. 

616
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:04,500
 What? 

617
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,860
 And if you send it again then I will it back to you again and again. 

618
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,980
 Come on, what kind of stubbornness is that? 

619
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,680
 I have a call coming in. 

620
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,810
 Talk to you later. 

621
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:20,400
 Hello? Wung? 

622
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,540
 So she went to return it personally. 

623
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,490
Oh! Miss Yumi!

624
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:45,600
Aren't you Miss Yumi?

625
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,680
Mr. Louis, it's been a long time.

626
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,990
It's certainly been a long time.

627
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,510
What brings you here?

628
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,150
Come in.

629
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,150
I can wait in the lobby, though.

630
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:08,040
What are you saying?

631
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,040
If ever I let you wait in the lobby

632
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,310
then Wung, that punk

633
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:18,170
no, I mean CEO Gu would kill me.

634
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:22,650
It's about time for the meeting to be over, so wait for a moment.

635
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,250
Sure.

636
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,000
Please be comfortable.

637
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,350
Sorry ... can I ask for your autograph later?

638
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,170
Autograph?

639
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:41,130
Yes. My girlfriend is a fan of "My Love Muse."

640
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,040
Yes.

641
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,960
Then I will be back for your autograph later.

642
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,970
- Please be comfortable. 
 - All right.

643
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,570
I'm impressed.

644
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:06,570
Gu Wung has really succeeded.

645
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,770
 KU WOONG GAMES CEO Gu Wung. 

646
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,780
 Wait. I think I have seen this name a lot somewhere. 

647
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,800
Storm Man. UlaUla.

648
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,400
My Ssarang Muse.

649
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,290
Walwal* 
  (To be quick.) 

650
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:36,640
 It's so interesting! The most interesting in the world! 

651
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,200
 I can't wait for Monday! 

652
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,090
 The writer is a genius at the very least. 

653
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,540
 She's messing with the readers! Amazing! 

654
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:47,790
 - Kim Yumi is the best! 
 - Julie Publishing, give the writer a big payment for the manuscript! 

655
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,600
 My Love Muse is the best! 

656
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,200
 Writer Kim Yumi is the best! 

657
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,590
 That's right. 

658
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:58,130
 The usernames that kept on posting compliments every morning. 

659
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:01,940
 All this time, Wung was the one who posted those? 

660
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,810
♫  Even if I don't extend my hand the feeling of warmth  ♫

661
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,800
Every day for a year, without missing one day?

662
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,930
How could this be? I got so much strength from all those comments.

663
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:17,040
This is really so like Gu Wung. 
 ♫  comes and comforts me  ♫

664
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,730

I have an emergent suggestion. 
 ♫  Like a star shining in the dark night  ♫

668
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,700
Let's make one more cell award for this year. 
 ♫  always shine brightly by my side  ♫

669
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,680
Wung's cells as a co-winner.

670
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,050
♫  Like a star  ♫

671
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:42,300

673
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,640

676
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:56,200
Yumi!

677
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,180
Sir!

678
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,740
Are you okay?

679
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,230
I'm fine. I'm fine.

680
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,650
Are you really okay?

681
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:07,840
I'm perfectly fine, so you can leave, Gye Rim.

682
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,870
Your slippers.

683
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:13,830
Thank you!

684
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,240
Are you really okay?
- I am totally fine.

685
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,230
Even if you have become the CEO, you haven't changed.

686
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:25,350
But ... what brings you here? I was so surprised to hear that you were here.

687
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:28,160
I came to bring the laptop.

688
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,750
What is this? I told you I won't take it back.

689
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,560
I also earn money well these days.

690
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:35,400
Also, I'm already very thankful,

691
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,210
so I can't accept this as well. I also have a conscience.

692
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,540
What are you so thankful for?

693
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,160
I have my reasons.

694
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,550
I'm really touched, Wung.

695
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,520
Let's eat dinner together. I will be done in thirty minutes.

696
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,010
I need to go.

697
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:52,460
- Where?
 - I have to go to a year-end party, so I just stopped by on the way there.

698
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,170
I will get going.

699
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:55,910
Can't I go with you?

700
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,560
It's a year-end party at the publishing company.

701
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,520
I know Control Z too.

702
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,520
Let's grab a meal together some other time.

703
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,460
It's my treat.

704
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,880
- Why?
 - Because I'm thankful.

705
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,460
Merry Christmas, Wung.

706
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:17,550

 That's great news. 

710
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,390
 I'm having a tropical Christmas. Merry Christmas. 

711
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:44,520
 Even though a breakup is the end for love 

712
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:49,870
 I'm starting to realize these days that a breakup does not mean it's the end of a connection with them. 

713
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:11,150
Yumi!

714

 Strangely it's a sleepless night.

I don't exactly know whether it was a few days or today?

778

 Where am I?

I'm late because I had to walk back from the desert.

00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:24,040
I couldn't fly because I'm not the prime cell.

783
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,240
Anyway, it's good to see you, even though I don't know how you got back.

784
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,890
I missed you.

785
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,530
Love!

786
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:33,550
I missed you guys too!

787
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:39,980
 Love came back on Christmas Eve. 

788
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,950
 She came back after a year. 

789
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:04,110
 I'm not sure how she was able to come back. 

790
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,170
 Was it because of Ba Bi? 

791
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:08,130
 Merry Christmas! 

792
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,510
 Or was it because of Wung? 

793
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,350
 Let's go! 

794
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:16,160
 Merry is celebrating Christmas! 

795
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,290
Hurry, come in.

796
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:21,590
Come in. It's fine, it's fine.

797
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:23,740
Come here.

798
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:28,150
Writer, these people are the next generation of our publishing company.

799
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:31,790
I brought them here to introduce you.

800
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:33,530
Hello!

801
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,820
Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you!

802
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,740
Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you!

803
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,880
When Miss Mi Yeon goes on maternity leave,

804
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,070
you will be working with this guy right here starting next year.

805
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,510
Sorry?

806
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:51,780
- I said he is the one who will be responsible for you starting next year. 
 - Uh huh. Oh!

807
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,770
Hello!

808
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,400
Let's do our best, fighting!

809
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,130
Let's do it!

810
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:03,010
 Or was it because of another reason? 
 ♫ The day starts ♫ 

811
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:04,270
Is it Love?

Love?

You guys! 
 ♫  I spend the day constantly  ♫

817
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:13,080
 Whatever the reason, it's good. 
 ♫  acting fearless ♫ 

818
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,170
 Because Love returned 

819
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:19,800
 and Yumi was ready to be happier. 

820

♫  The dark night  ♫

- Wow. 
 - Yes!

824
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,420
Here, grab my hand.

825
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,720
Love, sit here. 
 ♫  I hide in the middle of nowhere  ♫

826
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,520
Thanks. 
 ♫  Pathetically with a thud landing on the floor  ♫

827
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,490
It's nice. 
 ♫  I am crying  ♫

828
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:51,050
Wow, it looks like cotton candy.

829
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:53,890
Would that taste good, too? ♫  Today, too  ♫

830
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:58,100
- We can't miss 
 - a moment like this.

831
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:01,720
Yumi! Aren't you happy?

832
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:11,540
♫  Dark feelings will be passed tonight  ♫

833

- It's pretty. 
 - It's really pretty.

834
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,300
I want to have a snowball fight.

835
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,560
It's even better looking at it from up high.

836
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,670
Look at that!

837
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,760
It's really nice.

838
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:41,430
♫  I'm going tonight to the shining place  ♫

♫  We are going to the shining place  ♫

840
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,820
My stomach hurts.

841
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,270
Did I drink too much?

842
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:14,180
 Unknown: Writer, did you get home safely yesterday? 

843
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,990
Unknown?

844
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,290
Who could it be?

845
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:22,720
 Unknown: Writer, did you get home safely yesterday? 

846
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,590
Who could it be?

847
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:28,500
Oh, it must the publishing house employee.

848
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,130
I don't have his number.

849
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:34,980
 Yes, I got home all right. 

850
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:38,580
 But I'm sorry because I drank a lot yesterday,  

851
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:42,820
 I don't really remember who you are. 

852
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:50,370
 Oh, I introduced myself to you yesterday. 

853
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:55,250
 I will be working with you starting next year when Team Leader Mi Yeon takes her maternity leave. 

854
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:58,400
Oh, that's right.

855
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,740
He did introduce himself.

856
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,360
What was his name?

857
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,960
 My name is Sin Sun Rok.
