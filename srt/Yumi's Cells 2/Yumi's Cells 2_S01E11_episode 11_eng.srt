 Episode 30: Areas Ba Bi frequents.

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,530
First place* is mine! 
  (First to leave a comment.) 

5
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,640
Oh yeah! First place! I'm in first place!

6
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,380
It's so interesting! The most interesting in the world! I can't wait for Monday!

7
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,390
What's going on?

8
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,150
The writer is a genius at the very least.

9
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,970
She's messing with the readers.

10
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:18,920
Amazing!

11
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,760
Kim Yumi is the best!

12
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,690
Julie Publishing, give the writer a big payment for the manuscript!

13
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,160
"My Love Muse is the best."

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,970
Writer Kim Yumi is the best! 
 1: Oh yeah! First place!/ 2: It's so interesting! The most interesting in the world!

15
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:35,050
Oh my, why are they like this?

16
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,440
♫  There's a me I don't know  ♫

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,490
Hello? 
  Julie Publishing 

18
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,030
Writer, did you see today's comments?

19
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,070
The reaction is no joke.

20
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,720
As it happens, I was taken aback because there are only compliments.

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,800
Are you sure they weren't paid by the publisher?

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,110
What are you talking about? We don't do that sort of thing.

23
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,430
The reaction is good because it's interesting.

24
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,470
As I see it, your writing skill has improved a lot recently!

25
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,220
That's a relief, then.

26
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,770
Writer, fighting! Soon you'll be number 1 on the charts.

27
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,150
Oh, anticipating that kind of thing...

28
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,340
Have a good day.

29
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,320
I will, have a good day.

30
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,860
♫  There is a world  ♫

31
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,940
What the heck ...

32
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,130
It must really be interesting. 
 ♫   I don't know  ♫

00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,010
The files for this morning's meeting...

42
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,550
 CEO Gu Wung 

43
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,260
I'll leave them here.

44
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,700
♫  In the place love is  ♫

45
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,000

 Webzine Club Login  
 ♫  In the place  ♫

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,700
♫  In the place love is  ♫

48
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,970
 These days, Wung's morning routine has changed. 

49
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,820
I can't believe that we're using Chief Concentration on something like this.

50
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,730
Wung is enjoying it. How long has it been since he was this happily focused on something?

51
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,150
 I got a feeling Writer Kim Yumi is probably pretty, too. Hehehe. - "WushaWusha"* 
 (A cheering sound) 

52
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,500
You think Writer Kim Yumi's face would be pretty, too?

53
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,080
This person has a good instinct.

54
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,500
How did they know that?

55
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,210
 Yi Da 

56
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,570
Hey, Yi Da. What's up, so early in the morning?

57
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,920
Hey, hey, hey!

58
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,220
Do you know whom I just ran into?

59
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,950
-  Who?  
 - Yu Ba Bi.

60
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,200
- Huh? 
 -  I just ran into Team Leader Ba Bi in front of the office. 

61
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,370
 He was coming to work. 

62
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,060
He's returned to the head office?

63
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,400
That's what I'm saying!

64
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,940
He said today is his first day back. Apparently, he's the marketing team leader.

65
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:57,010
- Is that so? 
 - I was really shocked because I met him on my way to work.

66
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,700
He said he would be at the Jeju branch for two years.

67
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,390
 Exactly. 

68
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,880
 In any case, I asked where he was staying... 

69
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,840
I went back to where I was living before.

70
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,810
Ah, really?

71
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,160
I rented it to my hubae for a year.

72
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,950
But I came back sooner than I thought,

73
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,090
so I said I was sorry and moved back in.

74
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,150
But Team Leader Ba Bi's house is in your neighbourhood.

75
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,090
 That's why I thought I needed to tell you. 

76
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,330
In case you'd be surprised suddenly running into him in the neighborhood.

77
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,990
Why would I be surprised? If we meet, we meet.

78
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,610
In any case, I'm just saying.

79
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,800
That's why I...

80
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,360
You're very cool, Yi Da.

81
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,200
Even the section chief is running like this, but you're so relaxed on your way to work.

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,380
Very good!

83
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,530
Good, good, good, good!

84
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,110
I'm going, I'm going.

85
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,760
Hey Yumi, I'll call you back.

86
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,130
He said he was moving. Why did he come to Seoul instead of moving?

87
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,410
Stop worrying about it, what does it matter?

88
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,360
 Hello? 

89
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,040
Eonni, it's Team Leader Ba Bi!

90
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,750
Team Leader Ba Bi came back to the head office! I just saw him!

91
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,200
I already know.

92
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,100
Oh really?

93
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,500
- You became the team leader so rapidly. 
 - Oh, no.

94
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,170
Has he lost some weight?

95
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,360
I think he's become more handsome.

96
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,670
Oh, that's great!

97
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,810
I just made eye contact, I need to greet him. I'm hanging up!

98
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,690
BiBi, Hi!

99
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,010
 But Team Leader Ba Bi's house is in your neighbourhood. 

100
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,150
If we meet, we meet.

101
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,520
 You shouldn't say, "If we meet, we meet." 

102
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,730
What would be good about running into him?

103
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,230
Nothing good would come from running into him.

104
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,740
 This is how restricted areas were created in the neighborhood. 

105
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,390
Yes, I just left.

106
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,280
I'll see you in 30 minutes. Bye.

107
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,760
♫  Will you tell me again?  ♫

108
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,810
Should I buy some scones? Everyone likes them.

109
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,760
This shop that sells really yummy scones was a restricted area.

110
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,590
Oh, right.

111
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,790
 Because Ba Bi was a regular there. 

112
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,170
I'll just buy some near the publisher's.  
 ♫  the time had come to be tired of it  ♫

113
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,970
I'm hungry.

114
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,170
♫  Ling Ling, don't make a sad face  ♫

115
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,350
Shall I make curry?

116
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,030
 Get out of the area immediately. 

117
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,760
 It's dangerous. Ba Bi comes here regularly. 

118
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,950
 We're going to a different market. 

119
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,720
♫  Ling Ling, don't try to be understanding  ♫

120
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,600
 Curry 
 ♫ Aside from minor quirks ♫ 

121
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,610
 I want to make curry and eat it! Curry that I made myself! 
 ♫ I am usually such a person ♫  

122
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,840
Why can't we eat scones and curry?

123
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,450
I said I want to eat it!

124
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,660
Tough it out! Do we have to run into him and spoil our mood?

125
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,500
But the thing is

126
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,160
I have a reasonable doubt.

127
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,260
If it's a location that Yumi is avoiding, wouldn't Ba Bi also be avoiding it?

128
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,910
♫  I didn't hear anything  ♫

129
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:47,320
 Ba Bi could have designated this area as a place Yumi frequents. 

130
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,440
♫  We're going to fall  ♫

131
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,900
♫  (This is nothing)  ♫

132
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,990
♫  Even so it's better than being dizzy  ♫

133
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,630
♫  Ling Ling, you're such a fool  ♫

134
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:09,940
♫  There isn't anyone who loves you as much as I do  ♫

135
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,640
♫  Ling Ling, you'll know eventually  ♫

136
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,930
 That was a good point. 

137
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,900
 Since then, she went to the market frequently, 
 ♫  Ordinary things  ♫ 

138
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,380
 but never ran into Ba Bi. 

139
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,840
♫  don't suit you at all  ♫

140
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,760
 We were getting bolder going in and out of the areas that Ba Bi frequented. 

141
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,710
♫  Error! Error! Error!  ♫

142
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,020
 But there is still a ranking system of the places that Ba Bi frequents. 

143
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,760
 The café that Ba Bi frequently visits belongs to the high-risk group. 

144
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,920
This place is a bit dangerous.

145
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,910
Why? We don't care, right?

146
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,960
Who cares if we run into Ba Bi? We didn't do anything wrong.

147
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,360
It doesn't matter if we run into him.

148
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,220
But what's with our clothes today?

149
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,770
 It would be bad to run into Ba Bi or anyone we know in this condition. 

150
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,320
While we're on the subject, let's be honest.

151
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,380
Why are you dressing Yumi so carelessly these days?

152
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,410
You should at least make her wear something suitable for going out.

153
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,610
That is an outfit suitable for going out.

154
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,530
What? Doesn't she wear that hoodie to sleep?

155
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,830
I was in a good mood, so I elevated its status.

156
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,230
Call it her going out outfit from now on.

157
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,000
- And those pants— 
 - Don't attack her pants!

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,390
It's the ace of our wardrobe.

159
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,850
No.

160
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,890
It's dangerous to go out dressed like that.

161
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,250
Don't you guys know that urban legend?

162
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,180
What? Urban legend?

163
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,290
If you go out dressed like a bum,

164
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,970
you will run into your ex-boyfriend, or the guy you like,

165
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,760
or your first love, no matter what.

166
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,490
Bum? She's saying things rashly!

167
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,320
 There's a terrible curse that you will attract all the men 

168
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,070
  you know when you're dressed like a bum. 

169
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,780
 No. You don't need to worry. 

170
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,220
 Theoretically, there's no way we will run into each other. 

171
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,740
 Yumi's weekly active hours are from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. 

172
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,950
 Ba Bi gets off of work after 6 p.m. 
  

173
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:08,350
 So if she's careful on the weekends, there's likely a zero percent chance that they will run into each other. 

174
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,530
 Today is Thursday. 

175
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,210
No way.

176
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,920
I won't run into him at this hour, will I?

177
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,580
 The inside of the café is clear. Ba Bi isn't there. 

178
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,010
 Okay, we're going inside. 

179
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,270
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

180
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,780
- Can I get a hot Americano? 
 - Sure.

181
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,690
Thank you.

182
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,100
- Please, wait. I'll bring it to you right away. 
 - Sure.

183
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,850
- Hello? 
  - It's me, Nose. 

184
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,950
Oh, Nose. What's up?

185
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,430
I'm smelling Ba Bi coming from somewhere.

186
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,860
What? The smell of Ba Bi?!

187
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,600
The smell of Ba Bi's toner is definitely somewhere ...

188
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,260
Excuse me.

189
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,580
I'd like to order, please.

190
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,780
Oh, hello.  Long time no see.

191
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,960
Yes, it's been a long time.

192
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:51,040
♫  Did you doze off last night again?  ♫

193
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,250
♫  Are you standing at the end of your path?  ♫

194
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,760
Yumi. 
 ♫  Close your eyes and come into my arms  ♫

♫  Everything is all right  ♫

Here you go!

197
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,450
It feels as if it's been a long time since you came in together. 
 ♫  I can't even express it in words  ♫

198
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,470
Yes, it does, right? 
 ♫  After a rainy day  ♫

199
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,230
Yes. You said you were working on Jeju Island? 
 ♫  like a ray of light  ♫

200
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,060
Yes, I came back not too long ago. 
 ♫  I think you  ♫

201
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,860
Oh, I see. Then I guess I'll see you often again. 
 ♫  who only convey happy memories  ♫

202
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,750
Yes. 
 🎵 are an angel. I do. 🎵

203
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,900
Would you like to order?

204
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,680
One moment, please.

205
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,380
Sure, take your time.

206
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,960
It's been a long time.

207
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,090
It has. It's been a long time.

208
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,830
Damn it! Why did he have to show up when she's dressed like a bum?

209
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,030
Our Yumi usually goes around better dressed than this.

210
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:13,940
Won't he misunderstand? "Yumi must be having a hard time after breaking up with me."

211
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,580
She's not! I'll have you know she's doing just fine!

212
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,250
Ugh, this is unfair!

213
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,170
Sensitivity, don't despair! There's no reason to be intimidated!

214
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,320
 Confidence comes from a relaxed expression. 

215
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,180
Have you been well?

216
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,200
Yes. Are you doing well?

217
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,510
You look good too.

218
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,790
 He's more relaxed, though? 

219
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,610
How are you doing?

220
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,270
Well.

221
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,330
But I didn't expect to run into you here.

222
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,170
I was assigned back to the head office.

223
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,020
Oh, really?

224
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,700
I thought you would have heard about it from Yi Da or Ruby.

225
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,080
That's how it worked out.

226
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,990
But didn't you go to work? Today is a weekday.

227
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,560
Oh, today is the company's founding anniversary.

228
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,370
Oh, it's been a while since I quit.

229
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,810
Your story is getting better and better.

230
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,480
I'm enjoying reading it.

231
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,980
He's been reading Yumi's novel?

232
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,370
I thought he wouldn't be reading it.

233
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,730
What's this?

234
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,600
It's honey! It's so sweet!

235
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,500
Sensitivity, don't be deceived!

236
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,310
- This is Ba Bi's usual personality! 
 - Let go of me.

237
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,080
 His words usually drip with honey. It doesn't have any special meaning! 

238
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,610
 I know, but it's sweet. 

239
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,640
It seems the book is selling well, too. Congratulations.

240
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,690
 Let's quickly wrap things up and leave! 

241
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,660
Thanks. I'll get going now.

242
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,230
Oh, yeah, bye.

243
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,590
 Okay. That was fine. 

244
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,850
 It would be ridiculous to pretend we don't know each other. And it would be weird to be cold towards each other. 

245
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,660
 Ba Bi probably wasn't sure how to act either. He must have been flustered too. 

246
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,970

00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,530
Excuse me.

310
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:52,490
- I think I made a mistake— 
 - Goodbye.

311
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:04,760
 How ridiculous. Why was he so worried that another earthquake would happen? 

312
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,540
 He didn't even realize that the entire village would disappear if it did. Fool. 

313
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,850
 Daehan Noodles Jeju Branch 

314
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,780
 I'm just asking to see what you think about this. 

315
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:26,980
 I'm completely against it, but I should ask what you want to do. 

316
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,800
 They would like you back at the home office, Team Leader Yu. 

317
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,440
 I told her that I would go back to Seoul. 

318
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,430
 If I had stayed in Seoul, I probably wouldn't have broken up with Yumi. 

319
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,230
 Even the beautiful coastal road and the scenery 

320
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,600
 are meaningless. I'm sick of it. 

321
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,420
 - Love! 
 - You guys are alive! 
 - You guys! 

322
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,520
 When he returned to Seoul, his heart calmed down a little bit. 

323
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,780
 So much so that he looked for Yumi's novel again. 

324
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,160
♫  My heart would be like this  ♫

325
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,790
 Woah, it became even more interesting! 

326
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,070
 The story flow is so great, Kim Yumi. 

327
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,080
 This is commendable, Kim Yumi! You're doing great. 

328
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,320
 If we ever run into Yumi again, let's tell her that we're enjoying the novel. 

329
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,370
 Have you not come to your senses yet?! 

330
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,760
 What? Those words have nothing to do with romantic feelings. 

331
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,650
 It makes it sound as if he still has feelings for her! 

332
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:54,030
 Guys! Don't worry about what we'll say if he runs into Yumi. 

333
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,000
 Instead, let's think of a way not to run into her. 

334
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,790
 That's right. It's best not to run into her. 

335
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,610
 Since it will just make both of us uncomfortable. 

336
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:10,220
♫  When the wind blows, it sounds like you walking up to me  ♫

337
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,520
 I remember every place that we went on a date with Yumi at, so it's no problem. 

338
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,990
 These are the places Yumi frequents. 

339
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,350
 Since then, I didn't go to Yumi's favorite places. 

340
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,020
 It's been two months since I broke up with Yumi. 

341
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,820
 As time passed on, it gradually became clear. 

342
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,260
 "If he were to run into Yumi, what does he want to say?" 

343
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,420
 Ba Bi's heart answered that question like this. 

344
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,780
 Mirror of Justice 

345
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,830
 You fools. He already has an answer for the situation you're worrying about 

346
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,910
 in which he accidentally runs into Yumi! 

347
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:07,970
♫  How do you feel?  ♫

348
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,470
 I realized it in that moment. 

349
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:15,280
 What I would want to say if I coincidentally ran into Yumi. 

350
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,890
Yumi!

351
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,070
What is it?

352
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,360
I missed you ... terribly.

353
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,440
What's this again? Why is she like this?

354
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,010
Does it make sense to waver just from those few words?

355
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,200
- What are you sayi— 
 - I missed you so much.

356
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,090
She's seriously wavering.

357
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,120
I can't stand up.

358
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,500
What are you guys doing?

359
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:13,200
What? Why are you completely fine?

360
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:20,670
I'm Reason. I have to be centered. You guys are shaken by a comment like that?

361
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:24,700
All right, all right. We treat past lovers coldly.

362
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,780
- "Ba Bi." 
 - Ba Bi.

363
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,430
"You saying those kinds of words all of a sudden is absu—"

364
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:35,200
Is Yumi yours? Why are you doing whatever you want?

365
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,280
"Ba Bi, are you listening? Actually, I'm so happy to hear that."

366
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,110
"Honestly, sometimes you even appear in my dreams. There's never been a day when I didn't think about you!"

367
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,480
Huh? Yumi, say it.

368
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,770
What's going on? Why aren't the words coming out of her mouth?

369
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:02,470
Who says she can? Do you want her to kick her blankets out of embarrassment tonight?!

370
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,380
Hey, plug the cord back in.

Hurt Recording cell.

372
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,730
It seems like Sensitivity has already forgotten why we broke up with Ba Bi.

373
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,120
Remind her again.

374
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,180
Here it is!

00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,160
Don't tell me you already forgot about Da Eun?

378
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,070
That's right. That's right, he did do that.

379
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:36,660
That jerk! You hurt her like that and now you come and say you missed her?!

380
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,400
Ba Bi, I'm taken aback since you suddenly said that.

381
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,500
I don't really want to talk about that. I'm busy, so I'll get going.

382
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,860
Yumi! Can you spare just a moment of your time?

383
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,950
What's happening? What are her feet doing? They should keep walking. Why are they stopping?

384
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,280
This is so interesting.

385
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,580
Eat quietly. I can't hear!

390

 Leave. I said leave! 

391
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,640
 Yumi, attack. You have to overcome Ba Bi. 

392
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,730
Why...

393
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,080
Why should I?

394
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,590
 Say it more sharply! 

395
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:46,990
Why should I give you any of my time?

396
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,030
- It'll only take a moment. 
 - I'm not sure.

397
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,840
I don't have anything to say. I...

398
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,360
never missed you.

399
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,530
That's a lie.

400
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,370
- It's not a lie. 
 - That's a lie.

401
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:27,020
As expected, Yu Ba Bi is a strong guy. Yumi is seriously wavering!

402
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,410
No, this can't happen. Yumi's life is finally coming together.

403
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,820
Help me, please!

404
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,930
W-w-what are you doing?!

405
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,070
Hey, what are you doing?!

406
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,200
That hurts!

407
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,830
I just want to date Ba Bi again.

408
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,100
Hey! Are you crazy?!

409
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,990
You can't!

410
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,010
I think it'll work if you just get out of here!

411
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,490
Sensitivity, you can't! Don't act of your own volition!

412
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,700
She can't date him again!

413
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,370
Where did he go?

414
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,270
Either way, it's not my problem.

415
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:15,260
Guys! Ba Bi is being so earnest. There's no reason for us not to take him back.

416
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,450
If you have a reason, try convincing me!

417
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,140
You guys missed Ba Bi, too!

418
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,480
- Well, that's, um... 
 - It's true.

419

Who are we? We're the original Yu Ba Bi fan club members!

And what is our motto? "Once an oppa, always an oppa!"

00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,030
- Th-that's right, an oppa. 
 - Oppa!

422
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,210
Who are you to say

that it's a lie?

424
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,490
How would you know how I feel?

425
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,540
I can't believe it, seriously.

426
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:05,430
Honestly, it's what I hope it is.

427
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,080
I hope it was a lie.

428
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,950
That you didn't miss me...

429
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,090
it's a lie, right?

430
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:33,780
I ...   I missed you, too. 

431
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,980
 You're right. It's a lie.

Yeah. I wasn't dead. I was just banished here.

That's a relief. Then if she starts dating, you can return to the village again, right?

Probably.

to get back together again.

448
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,370
What? She's getting back together with Ba Bi?

449
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:15,010
Why? So you're not too keen on it either.

450

That's...

451
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,300
It's just that Yumi has never gotten back together

with someone she's broken up with.

Yumi...

454
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,170
 It says that it will be a different situation than you are hoping it to be 

455
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:53,320
 because it's a relationship that has the highest level of difficulty. 

456
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,200
Is it difficult to get back together after breaking up?

457
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,550
It says it's really easy to get back together,

458
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,090
but it's really hard to go back to how it was in the past.

00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,950
Really?

460

Reason! Go and try to stop them! Yumi might go through a hard time again!

00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,330
Okay!

00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,190
Detective! How far have things gone with Ba Bi?

465
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,030
So far, they made up while crying and said they would try again.

466
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:40,260
What? Then the situation is already over!

467
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,450
 I just arrived. Take your time. 

468
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,540
 I'm leaving right now. 

469
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,950
♫  when you melt in a teacup  ♫

470
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:21,040
♫  A lovely smile can't contain everything  ♫

471
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,760
Ba Bi.

472
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,970
Hi.

473
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,330
- Did you wait long? 
- No.

474
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,750
Let's go.

475
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,870
 Am I under a spell? 

476
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,980
I guess I was really hungry.

477
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,570
- Yumi, shall we do a toast?
 - Yeah.

478
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,690
Cheers!

479
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,720
 Or has the spell been broken? 

480
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,060
 I don't know which it is, 

481
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,500
Yumi, the wine tastes pretty good, doesn't it?

482
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,230
- Yumi.
 - Huh?

483
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:29,170
- I asked if the wine tastes alright. 
 - Yes.

484
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:35,600
- Yes. It's good. 
 - It is, isn't it?

485
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,290
 but maybe that's because it's awkward since it's been such a long time, right? 

486
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,930
Let's get another bottle after this.

487
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,990
 Episode 32 
 Ex-Boyfriend VS. Ex-Boyfriend 

488
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,190
 Oh, excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me! 

489
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,470
 Excuse me, ma'am. 

490
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,260
 Yumi is being chased by a zombie right now. 

491
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,080
Today's dream is so intense!

492
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,700
What will our Yumi do?

493
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,620
Run quickly, Yumi!

494
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,790
Yumi, this is all a dream!

495
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:43,450
Don't be afraid! You just have to wake up!

496
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,740
Stop talking!

497
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,620
 It's a dream, a dream! 

498
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,850
 Yumi, this is a dream! 

499
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,770
Yumi woke up. Hurry up and make her snap out of it.

500
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,690
Please remember.

501
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:08,620
Your name is Kim Yumi. And that was a dream just now.

502
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,170
 You are in reality now. Please feel at ease. 

503
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,950
So it was a dream.

504
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,330
What a relief.

505
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,430
Why would I dream of a ghost?

506
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,090
 Also, please note that you didn't do the dishes from breakfast or lunch 

507
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,940
 before you fell asleep yesterday. 

508
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:50,140
 Also, you decided to date your ex-boyfriend again. 

509
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,930
What?

510
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,870
 I'm sorry. I missed you. 

511
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,540
 I missed you so much. 

512
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,310
 Date Ba Bi again? 

513
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,210
That wasn't a dream?

514
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,520
 Did you sleep well? 

515
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,070
 I just left for work. 

516
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,710
So it wasn't a dream.

517
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,830
That's right. Yesterday...

518
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,370
 I just woke up. 

519
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,990
 You went to work early. 

520
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,610
 I couldn't sleep very well, so I just left early. 

521
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:51,200
 I'll call you when my meeting is over. 

522
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,540
 But why am I feeling so strangely calm? 

523
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:01,000
 Is it because it still doesn't feel real? 

524
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,460
It's because she hasn't fully woken up yet!

525
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,620
Let's quickly drink some coffee and take a shower!

526
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,140
We're dating Ba Bi again!

527
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,950
Huh? Look at that.

528
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,080
Someone's coming.

529
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,420
Oh my god. Love must be coming!

530
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,340
Love came  back!

531
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,070
 It wasn't her. It was Fashion Terrorist. 

532
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,850
Where are you coming back from?

533
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,010
Jail.

534
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,680
I was dragged there because I dressed Yumi in sweat pants yesterday.

535
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,170
 I wrote a letter of reflection and was released. 

536
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:44,600
Well, you should have done your job correctly.

537
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,150
 Put some care into what she wears today. 

538
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:52,940
 She was embarrassed to death yesterday. 

539
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,130
 Yumi! Aren't you wearing the ring? 

540
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,570
She's meeting Ba Bi this evening, so she should wear the couple ring!

541
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,310
Isn't it a little weird to start wearing it already?

542
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,540
Why? Ba Bi will probably wear his too.

543
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,360
Still, that isn't urgent right now.

544
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,430
 Then let's take a selfie. 

545
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,180
 Why? Because she likes her outfit? 

546
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,680
That's not it.

547
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,650
We should announce that we're dating Ba Bi again on social media!

548
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,110
This will show it.

549
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:53,140
Please don't do things like that!

550
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:57,540
Then how about changing our profile status to a heart?

551
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:09,770
 Please enter a status message. 

552
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,910
 Heart 

553
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,580
 Let's not get ahead of ourselves. 

554
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:21,500
Why?! Why aren't you letting me do anything?

555
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,510
Are you ashamed of dating Ba Bi?

556
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,390
Are you still feeling uncertain?

557
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,050
Do you regret it? Is that it?

558
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:30,750
It's not that. There's no reason to let everyone in Yumi's life know.

559
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,620
They've just started dating again.

560
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:45,220
 Welcome. 

561
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,270
Did you wait long?

562
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,190
Oh?

563
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,960
- What is it?
 - Wait.

564
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,650
- What's with you?
 - What do you mean?

565
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:01,490
Miss Writer, are you possibly dating?

566
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:06,860
Well, you wouldn't be dressed like that today because of meeting me.

567
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,820
Well... I've always been like this.

568
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:15,780
No, you haven't. Are you kidding me?

569
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,560
Why won't she answer him? He's asking if she's dating!

570
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,300
She should answer that she is!

571
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,850
Wait just a second.

572
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:23,780
Why the heck do you keep stopping me?!

573
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,420
Do you not remember what we said to Control Z before?

574
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,030
 He said he was swayed when an intern confessed to him. 

575
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,150
 That's why we broke up. 

576
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:34,810
 Really? 

577
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:39,140
We told him all that, so what would he say if we told him we were dating him again?

578
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,500
So you're saying we should keep it a secret?

579
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,940
Are you embarrased of our Ba Bi?! Is that it?!

580
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:53,000
Don't tell me you were expecting to run into someone today, so you came out dressed like that?

581
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,690
What? Run into whom?

582
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,710
It's nothing.

583
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:02,600
Anyway, your outfit is nice today. Good job.

584
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,630
Do you review my outfits, too?

585
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:10,150
For now, it's a relief that you seem willing to date.

586
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,170
Then finish the edits by next Wednesday.

587
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:19,760
Give me some more time and make it Thursday.

588
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,620
All right. Thursday, then.

589
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,740
Here he comes.

590
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:35,860
Hyeong Wung!

591
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,980
Oh! Yumi is here too.

592
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,520
Wung.

593
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,710
I had a meeting with Writer Yumi today. You didn't know?

594
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:51,140
I had no idea.

595
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:55,250
Hyeong Wung said he had a meeting at his company and that he would give me a ride on his way there.

596
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,750
You ended up meeting like this again somehow.

597
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:00,200
Is this a coincidence or fate?

598
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:05,380
This can't be. I can see right through him!

599
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,680
Yumi, where are you going?

600
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,280
I'm going to Jongno—

601
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,090
Then get in. I'll drop you off on my way.

602
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:15,330
There's no need. Isn't your company in the opposite direction?

603
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:19,810
Hyeong Wung said his hobby is driving around the busy city and showing off his car.

604
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,350
His hobby is to show off, right?

605
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,590
Get in.

606
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,250
Hyeong, thank you. I'll get off here.

607
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,690
- Miss Writer, I'll see you next week. 
 - Okay.

608
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,580
Fighting!

609
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,730
I'll also get out here. You don't have to take me all the way there.

610
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:57,020
I'll take you.

611
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,970
You said you have a meeting.

612
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:02,350
It's a meeting between the departments. They'll probably all be nervous if the CEO showed up.

613
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:18,300
 There's no need to let everyone in my life know that I'm dating Ba Bi again, 

614
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,940
 but I felt like I should let Wung know. 

615
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,040
Wung, are you busy right now?

616
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,750
Hm?

617
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:33,260
If you have some time, shall we go somewhere and have a cup of coffee?

618
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,950
Coffee? Right now?

619
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,330
If you're busy, we can go another time.

620
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:39,050
I'm not that busy.

621
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,690
All right.

622
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:51,640
Your novel has been getting a good response these days.

623
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,020
No, well. It's not that good.

624
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:57,580
I just happened to come across it the other day.

625
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,460
All the comments were complimentary.

626
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,080
You looked at it? That's embarrassing.

627
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,810
Why? Everyone was praising you.

628
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:07,430
That was just a coincidence. There's a lot of malicious comments, too.

629
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,680
How is writing?

630
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,220
It's fun.

631
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,790
I've got more time for myself compared to when I was working full time.

632
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:16,850
Writers usually write at night, right?

633
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:21,010
No. I usually work in the morning and afternoon,

634
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:22,690
and then relax at night.

635
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,000
We caught you, Kim Yumi!

636
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,050
She is free in the evenings!

637
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:30,620
 We will make dinner plans starting now. 

638
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,990
So you don't work in the evenings.

639
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,100
That's right.

640
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,890
Then you will probably be free this evening, too.

641
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,460
This evening,

642
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:47,820
I made plans to meet with my boyfriend.

643
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,250
You don't have a boyfriend.

644
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,810
- I do. 
 - No, you don't have one.

645
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:58,340
I decided to get back together with my ex.

646
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,500
 WARNING 

647
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,240
What's the alarm for now?

648
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,260
 Emergency! Emergency! 

649
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,630
 Yumi is dating Yu Ba Bi again. 

650
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,530
Emergency situation because of that guy!

651
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:14,610
I'm really sick and tired of him!

652
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,640
Really?

653
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,540
Yes.

654
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,970
Don't joke around.

655
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:23,750
I really am.

656
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,460
Kim Yumi! Are you stupid?

657
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,360
There is plenty of fish in the sea!

658
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,880
Why are you dating someone you already broke up with?

659
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,240
Hey, Love, calm down.

660
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,920
I guarantee that

661
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,350
they will fight and break up for the same reason in less than a month!

662
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:45,350
Isn't it hard to date again after breaking up?

663
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,340
- Why? 
 - That's what everyone says.

664
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,830
That's what happened to all the couples I knew, they broke up in the end.

665
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:53,510
♫  while we talk quietly?​  ♫

666
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,660
 Emergency Situation! Emergency Situation! 

667
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,540
 Wung is talking a lot of nonsense. 

668
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:01,170
What's nonsense about that? Everything he said was right!

669
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:03,770
You idiot! Wung is also an ex-boyfriend.

670
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:09,200
If you speak ill of her ex-boyfriend Yu Ba Bi, then Wung gets affected too!

671
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,930
 Wung has now fallen into the ex-boyfriend paradox. 

672
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,980
I don't care if he gets affected by it!

673
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:23,530
If she's not going to date me, then I'm going to make it fair and not let her date that jerk either!

674
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:27,950
 Hey. Just say congratulations and end it. 

675
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:32,150
 Are you crazy? I can never say that! 

676
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,470
That's good.

677
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:42,650
Good for you.

678
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:47,590
Thanks for saying that.

679
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:53,330
 1 - Boyfriend, 2 - Friend, 3 - A guy she knows 

680
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,800
If he's not going to date her, then I don't want to do this.

681
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,620
Don't be greedy. We have to at least keep the friend title.

682
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:06,010
I'm also not giving up yet.

683
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,400
Let's think of the future, huh?

684
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,900
 3rd - A guy she knows 

685
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,890
 2nd - A friend 

686
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:20,490
All right then, we will now complete the ceremony for the friend title.

687
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,230
You're not uncomfortable around me, right?

688
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:27,460
Why would I be? I'm not uncomfortable.

689
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,910
Then let's occasionally see each other like this.

690
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,330
I like talking with you.

691
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:39,470
I'm sorry, I think my boyfriend may be uncomfortable with that.

692
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:41,680
What? They can't even be friends?

693
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,760
He even said things that he didn't mean! I want to take it all back!

694
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,590
Calm down, calm down, Love.

695
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,350
Yumi, you got a bit old-fashioned.

696
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:56,770
You know, I'm a little old-fashioned.

697
00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:01,570
♫  I was looking forward to your heart  ♫

698
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,990
Shall we get going?

699
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,410
What about Control Z?

700
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,910
Control Z is also a man, but you see him all the time.

701
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:11,910
Why can't I see you when you're seeing other men like him?

702
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:17,320
Illustrator Z is someone I work with.

703
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,480
- I suppose. 
 - Yes.

704
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,780
How can they get back together so easily?

705
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,470
What's so special about that jerk?!

706
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:26,840
How can she forgive him so easily when you broke up with him because he cheated?!

707
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,880
Hey! I'm begging you, that's enough!

708
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:34,190
 Let's sort it out and leave quickly! We've been embarrassing enough. 

709
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:38,210
All right, let's go.

710
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:40,110
I have a meeting too.

711
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,520
Okay, let's go.

712
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,770
Wung, I'm going to take a taxi.

713
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:56,040
I'll give you a ride.

714
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,460
No need.

715
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,480
I said I would, you don't like that either?

716
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,810
It's not that I don't like it. It's because I feel bad.

717
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:06,570
I said I would give you a ride. Can't I even do that?

718
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:14,300
Hey, if you refuse like that, you're going to make me really disapp—

719
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,620
- Are you okay? 
 - Wung!

720
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,020
I'll see you tomorrow.

721
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,730
- See you tomorrow. 
 - See you tomorrow.

722
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:23,670
Have a good night.

723
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:34,540
 Ba Bi, can you talk? 

724
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,980
 Marketing Department 

725
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,860
 Hello? 

726
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,040
- Yumi. 
  - Did you leave work? 

727
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,770
I just left. Are you already here?

728
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:48,010
No. I'm sorry, but I think I'm going to be late.

729
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,670
 Why? 

730
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,870
I'm at the hospital right now.

731
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:54,250
There was a bit of an accident.

732
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,760
An ac-accident? Are you hurt?!

733
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,910
No, not me but the person I was with.

734
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:01,960
 He isn't hurt that badly. 

735
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,510
 He hit his hand on the car door. 

736
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:09,660
It's fractured and he's getting treated right now. I think I need to stay here for a bit longer.

737
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,340
Who was it?

738
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,710
Oh ... about that ...

739
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,070
It's Gu Wung.

740
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,610
 He's close with the illustrator I'm working with. 

741
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:27,650
 So we coincidentally met today. 

742
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,730
Oh, really?

743
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:31,730
I see.

744
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:34,270
All right.

745
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,660
What hospital is it?

746
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,090
Okay, don't worry.

747
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:42,720
Call me when you're done.

748
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,630
Bye.

749
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,020
Did you get a shot?

750
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:13,820
They said to wait a bit.

751
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:16,730
You said your employee is coming to pick you up, right?

752
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:17,900
When is he coming?

753
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,970
He's on the way but said there is traffic.

754
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:25,480
Thanks for coming with me.

755
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,970
You can go now. You said you had a date.

756
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:30,430
I'll go when your employee gets here.

757
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:34,920
I'm fine. Go ahead. That guy is probably going to misunderstand.

758
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,370
Why would he? You had an accident.

759
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:42,080
You can go. I'm fine.

760
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,590
I'm really fine.

761
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:50,390
Then ... I feel bad making him wait too long,

762
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:53,680
so I'll get going now.

763
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:56,800
Take care of yourself.

764
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,350
Sure.

765
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,150
That keeps bothering me.

766
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:10,520
Oh no! It must have ripped earlier when he fell.

767
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,480
How can Wung be the same as ever?

768
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,030
Whenever I see Wung, I feel kind of bad.

769
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,980
Being next to Wung for even one minute

770
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,620
makes me want to take care of him.

771
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,370
When I think of him going home alone like that,

772
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,550
it's sad.

773
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:37,870
 I'm suddenly remembering something. 

774
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:43,330
 Excuse me! Wait! 

775
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:46,100
 Over here, over here! Wait! 

776
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,010
 Please take a look at her. She's an emergency patient! 

777
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,650
 Yumi was a patient in this hospital before, too. 

778
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,640
 Back then, Wung bought her clothes to change into. 

779
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,620
 Ribbit 

780
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,540
I'll be right back.

781
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,990
- I said to go. 
 - I'll be quick.

782
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:13,050
Where are you going?

783
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,980
Yumi!

784
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:24,180
I should call Ba Bi to tell him I'm going to be even later.

785
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,610
Did I leave it there?

786
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:37,590
What should I do?

787
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,880
Where did she go?

788
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:26,220
Hello.

789
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,700
Do you remember me?

790
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,040
Yes, of course.

791
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,690
I'm Yu Ba Bi.

792
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,260
It's been a while.

793
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,740
It has.

794
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:44,840
Are you all right? I heard you were hurt.

795
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,960
Yes, as you can see.

796
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,460
It's nothing serious but I interrupted your date.

797
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,380
It's all right.

798
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:56,000
Well, it's good to see that you are all right.

799
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,850
But where did Yumi go?

800
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:04,140
She isn't answering her phone.

801
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,080
She left her phone and went somewhere.

802
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:29,540
She probably will be here soon. She said she'd be right back.

803
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:31,170
I see.

804
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:35,360
Don't worry.

805
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,620
Because Yumi isn't that kind of person.

806
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,070
Sorry?

807
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:46,590
She doesn't get swayed easily, unlike someone else.

808
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:50,870
Just in case you were worried.

809
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:55,800
Unlike someone else?

810
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,940
Yes. Unlike someone else.

811
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:16,010


812
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:20,900
♫  In so many thoughts we  ♫

813
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,940
♫   meet again on another day  ♫

814
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:29,280
♫  Let's put behind us our weary hearts   ♫

815
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,930
♫   and think about someone  ♫

816
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:37,090
♫  Because in matters which had nothing to do with me  ♫

817
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:40,960
♫  I uselessly took an interest  ♫

818
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,350
♫  In the times  ♫

819
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,580
 Yumi's Cells 2 
 Preview 

820
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:48,900
 Guys, this is war! 

821
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:54,650
 Because Yumi isn't the kind of person who gets swayed easily. 

822
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:57,110
 Sir, the management team meeting has been rescheduled for tomorrow morning. 

823
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,940
 What time is the meeting? 

824
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:00,280
 Seoul.* 
 (* Seoul the city sounds the same as Seoul time.) 

825
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,560
♫  Although my fading image may seem miserable  ♫

826
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,220
 Don't feel pressured. 

827
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:08,520
 Let's not care too much about things like this. 

828
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,710
 Something keeps going wrong little by little. 

829
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:13,900
 It wasn't like this in the past. 

830
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:18,760
♫  When this time passes  ♫
