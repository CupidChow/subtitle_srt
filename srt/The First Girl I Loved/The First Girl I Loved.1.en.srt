1
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:01,750
Wing, I am sorry.

2
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,250
Do you recognise me?

3
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:29,292
Of course.

4
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:37,417
I'm getting married on 15 November.

5
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,500
Will you be my maid of honour?

6
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:46,082
Ms Lee is here.

7
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:46,708
Thank you.

8
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,250
I dislike wearing dresses.

9
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,542
That's why I never agree to
be anyone's maid of honour.

10
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,500
But this time, I cannot refuse.

11
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,750
Because the bride is
the first person I ever loved.

12
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:33,708
It was the year Eason Chan's "The King of Karaoke"
won the Ultimate Song award.

13
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:36,792
Leslie Cheung just held "Passion Tour" concert
in the Hong Kong Coliseum.

14
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,082
Nicholas Tse were on the cover of Yes!

15
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,667
Magazine with his signature guitar.

16
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,791
My teacher said we're lucky.

17
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:46,583
To be living in an era of freedom.

18
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:48,291
My name is Wing Lee.

19
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:50,541
Thanks to Hong Kong's
Through-train mode school system,

20
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:52,917
I have been in all-girls schools for 12 years.

21
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:56,542
12 years as monitress and 3 years as prefect.

22
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,624
I don't befriend people easily.

23
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,624
These people are my classmates only.

24
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,499
She's made a mistake. That's no denial.

25
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,582
Rules are rules.

26
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,541
Do you understand?

27
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:08,667
Dismiss.

28
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,917
She is my best and
only friend throughout the years.

29
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,666
Her name is Sylvia Lee.

30
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,625
I am the most comfortable around her.

31
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,958
Sometimes it could be exciting, sometimes boring.

32
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,541
We can chat endlessly every night.

33
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:27,583
One time, we chatted for 6 hour straight.

34
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,750
We spoke about dreams once.

35
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,708
She said her dream is to become a film director.

36
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,333
And mine?

37
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:10,333
Every girl has written a love letter that
they dare not to send.

38
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,917
I am no exception.

39
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:16,625
Only my best friend knew I have a crush on him.

40
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,291
To my surprise, she's the one

41
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,375
who send out my love letter.

42
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,292
Wing?

43
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:44,792
Hold on.

44
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,625
I need to talk to you.

45
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:54,875
I'm giving you your letter.

46
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,958
This isn't my letter.

47
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,417
This isn't mine too.

48
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,750
This is the one.

49
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:39,250
It's normal to have romantic feelings

50
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:42,292
but it's too early for you.

51
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:45,792
And

52
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,625
I'm about to get married.

53
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,666
I'll also immigrate

54
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,083
with my wife after the wedding.

55
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,375
Is that so?

56
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,625
Congratulations.

57
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,042
Sorry.

58
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,666
Why did you do this to me?

59
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,958
What?

60
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:41,999
I said,

61
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,750
Why did you do this to me?

62
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:46,000
What do you mean?

63
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,875
Are you done?

64
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,500
Why are you yelling at me?

65
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,458
Why?

66
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,750
I'd rather he never finds out.

67
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:08,125
Why did you do that?

68
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,042
Because.

69
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:35,875
I'm in love with you, dummy.

70
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,583
Hi, it's me, wasabi.

71
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,499
What shall we talk about tonight?

72
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,833
How about our usual topic?

73
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,792
Love.

74
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,208
Let's discuss about having a crush.

75
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,707
I'm not talking about you having a crush.

76
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,083
I'm talking about somebody else
having a crush on you.

77
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:10,833
There's no such thing as a secret crush.

78
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,792
People wish their feelings to be reciprocated.

79
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:20,333
That's why they will
leave clues for you to pick up.

80
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:26,958
For example, they will find
excuses to get close to you.

81
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,792
To a point where they try to
get physically intimate.

82
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,041
For the braver ones,

83
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,999
They will even say it out loud,

84
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,624
just to see your response.

85
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:44,292
Why don't you try to like something
that you're forbidden to?

86
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:48,667
Like what?

87
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,125
Like me.

88
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,749
If you act surprised,

89
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,958
They will pretend they're just joking.

90
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,167
Isn't it good?

91
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,750
Let me write it down.

92
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:11,333
They will be curious about your everything.

93
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,458
They can't help smiling looking at you.

94
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,125
So?

95
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,583
Does that remind you of anyone?

96
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:21,333
If it does,

97
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:23,167
I would like to dedicate this song to you,

98
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,625
and to those of you who yearn for,
yet to scared to love.

99
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,250
Monitress, distribute these please.

100
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,708
You have 40 minutes.

101
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,707
Is everyone ready?

102
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,208
You may now begin.

103
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,917
Mr Cheung, I am not feeling well.

104
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:21,625
May I go to the clinic?

105
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,124
We are having a test.

106
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,875
Are you really sick, or are you trying to bail?

107
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,792
I'm having period cramps.

108
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,000
Is it really that bad?

109
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,167
Yes.

110
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,417
Monitress, be quick.

111
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,000
Here you go.

112
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,167
What about water?

113
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:52,625
Here's your water.

114
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,583
It's cold.

115
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,375
Your hand is so cold.

116
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:17,000
Your hand is warm.

117
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:29,958
Wing Lee,

118
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:35,417
I was kidding yesterday.

119
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,750
Can we pretend nothing happened?

120
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:48,375
I thought she was joking at first.

121
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:52,375
But for some reason, hearing her say that

122
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:58,125
makes me think she could have been serious.

123
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:04,250
I have to clear the air with her soon.

124
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,916
Class, empty your desk.

125
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,333
And please take out all of your belongings.

126
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:25,750
Hurry up.

127
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,583
What's that?

128
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,874
School rules are clear.

129
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,583
Students aren't allowed to
bring their phones to school.

130
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,583
Whose phone is this?

131
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,750
It's...

132
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:53,292
It's mine.

133
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:59,666
I like your honesty. Starting from today.

134
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,667
Clean the chapel after school for a week.

135
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,042
My pleasure.

136
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,791
Daddy knows, Daddy understands.

137
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,707
It's your Mom's fault.

138
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:13,042
It's getting late. Go to sleep.
Don't overthink this.

139
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,833
Is she still angry?

140
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,750
I would be angry if I were her.

141
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,583
She is a prefect.

142
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,333
Why did you put a phone in her bag?
What were you thinking?

143
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:27,874
I didn't know it's forbidden.

144
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,250
I was worried about the crimes
in our neighbourhood.

145
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,833
You're welcome.

146
00:14:58,167 --> 00:14:59,208
Let me help you.

147
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,333
I should do it.

148
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,083
It was not your responsibility.

149
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,917
I'm the one being punished.

150
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,583
You are the monitress.

151
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,042
Thank you.

152
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,417
Your bra is buttoned wrong.

153
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,375
Girls, attention.

154
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,082
Today we will learn social dancing.

155
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,667
Pair up among yourselves.

156
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,000
Sit down with your partner.

157
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,167
80? Are you all paired up?

158
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,458
I'll pair up with you.

159
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:22,792
One, two, three.

160
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:24,958
Who's the boy and who's the girl?

161
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,292
Boy.

162
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:27,875
Put your arm around her waist then.

163
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,125
Stand up straight.

164
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,667
One, relax.

165
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:36,374
Okay, time to switch.

166
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,791
Understand? Switch your role.

167
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:39,625
Begin.

168
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:44,625
One, two, three.

169
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:50,333
Get closer.

170
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:55,958
One, two, three.

171
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,957
Don't get me wrong.

172
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,208
I didn't accept her,

173
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:12,833
but I also didn't reject her.

174
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:17,583
We kept our relationship the way it was
for around a semester.

175
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,458
We just decided not to mention it again

176
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:25,208
and went back to being good friends.

177
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,417
Well...

178
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:28,833
I think so.

179
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,875
Prefect, close the door.

180
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:53,458
Okay.

181
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,292
It's stuck.

182
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,208
Let's go.

183
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,249
What's wrong?

184
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,332
Is it boring?

185
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,208
No it's awesome.

186
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,333
That's why I don't want to watch it.

187
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:31,458
Why?

188
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,832
It's too good

189
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,707
I don't want to watch till the end.

190
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,332
I want to go home and imagine

191
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,958
what the ending will be like.

192
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,500
Hey, it's my name.

193
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,667
Must be expensive.

194
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,542
Let's go.

195
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:45,958
Do you like it?

196
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:47,792
No.

197
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,458
"Let's speak on the phone,
I'm running out of messaging quotas."

198
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,333
Hello?

199
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,375
For me?

200
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,250
80? Are you all paired up?

201
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,833
Remember to forward your call.

202
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,292
Really? Can you get knee cramps?

203
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:29,583
Yes! It's painful.

204
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:31,083
It hurts.

205
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,250
I'm trying.

206
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:32,792
Try harder.

207
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:33,917
I don't know what to say.

208
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,500
I thought I just taught you.

209
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,332
Hello, I'm the guardian of Sylvia Lee
from class 7A.

210
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,541
I am calling in sick for her.

211
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,041
What's wrong with her?

212
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:44,583
<i>Fever.</i>

213
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,958
Food poisoning.

214
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,500
I'm tired.

215
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,167
It's almost I am.

216
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,083
Let's go to sleep.

217
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:41,542
Okay. Let's hang up. Goodbye.

218
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:47,042
Goodbye and see you tomorrow.

219
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,750
Bye.

220
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:51,333
Bye.

221
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,583
I thought you said we should go to sleep.

222
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:58,833
Why don't you hang up then?

223
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:03,333
You hang up the phone.

224
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,667
If you don't then I won't.

225
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,292
Is there something you want to tell me?

226
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,375
Not really, we've been chatting for so long.

227
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:26,249
How about we count to one and hang up?

228
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,291
Okay.

229
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:30,375
Three, two, one.

230
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:33,166
Liar.

231
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:35,042
No I am not.

232
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:42,250
Where are your parents?

233
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,166
They are not home yet.

234
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,167
Okay.

235
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,708
What are we watching today?

236
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:57,417
We are not watching today, we are filming.

237
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,583
What are we filming?

238
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,125
Top 50 classic scenes in movies.

239
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,416
Where's your DV camera?

240
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:05,417
Wait a moment.

241
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:13,583
Wow, it's the newest model!

242
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:16,500
Yeah, my Dad bought it from Japan.

243
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,875
What are we waiting for?

244
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:22,250
Action!

245
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,375
There's a bad guy on your left. On your left!

246
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,625
Pull him back!

247
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:30,042
80? Are you all paired up?

248
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,417
Push him down!

249
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:33,875
Now you almost do a split.

250
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:36,708
I said almost.

251
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,082
Look cool.

252
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,375
The bomb is coming!

253
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,083
Roll away.

254
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,292
Good take!

255
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,333
What do you want?

256
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,542
To be your friend.

257
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,583
Why would I do that?

258
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,625
Look at my... clock.

259
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:16,792
Why?

260
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:20,958
Just for a minute.

261
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:31,208
It doesn't have a second hand.

262
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,207
You are an actress.

263
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:36,625
There's nothing to imagine.

264
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,417
There's nothing to imagine.

265
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,374
What happened to your lips?

266
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,082
It's swollen.

267
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,125
What happened?

268
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:25,917
Yours too.

269
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:27,999
Were you two

270
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,707
stung by bees?

271
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:32,083
They're so red.

272
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:38,124
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to Sylvia.

273
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,000
Happy birthday to you.

274
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,292
What did you wish for?

275
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:48,042
I wish I could major in film next year,

276
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:52,250
And direct my own movie in the future.

277
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:56,208
That sounds cool.

278
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,333
Are you making fun of me?

279
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:00,667
I'm serious.

280
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:03,832
Have you ever thought that

281
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:06,375
our lives are like two separate movies.

282
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:10,917
You're the leading lady in my movie.

283
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:13,542
Yet, in your movie,

284
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,208
I'm just a supporting role.

285
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:21,625
You'll forget me once you enter university.

286
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:24,667
No I won't.

287
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:27,125
I will not.

288
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,124
How could you know?

289
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,583
Sometimes it's not up to you.

290
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:40,000
Sylvia, let's make a pact.

291
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:43,125
About what?

292
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:46,750
Getting into the same university.

293
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,375
Let's celebrate your birthday
right here every year.

294
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:54,917
Deal.

295
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:03,417
Stop trying to look cool as a prefect.

296
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:08,250
What?

297
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:14,958
Go back to your desk.

298
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:18,999
I told you there's something
going on between them.

299
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,166
Now there isn't,

300
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:21,750
not with the headmaster interfering.

301
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,833
I am scared.

302
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:35,292
Why?

303
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:47,208
I can't stop thinking about you.

304
00:29:52,875 --> 00:30:06,833
No matter what I am doing,

305
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,583
you are always on my mind.

306
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,167
Wing Lee,

307
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,917
You are the silliest person

308
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,083
in this world.

309
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,375
No one would value me this much.

310
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:46,999
No one else,

311
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
besides you.

312
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:53,833
Sylvia Lee,

313
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:00,542
Whatever happens in the future,

314
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:05,167
You'll always have a place in my heart.

315
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,958
I don't want to think about the future.

316
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,292
What we have right now is already perfect.

317
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,667
I think so too.

318
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,167
I do.

319
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:33,333
I do.

320
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:56,250
Thank you Ms Mak.

321
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:02,457
History taught us that.

322
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:05,291
Life is about making mistakes.

323
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:07,666
What's important is we must learn
and grow from them.

324
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:09,000
Sorry to disturb you.

325
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:15,624
Sylvia Lee. Wing Lee.

326
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,458
You two follow Ms. Chan.

327
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,416
The headmaster is meeting your parents now.

328
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,458
Wait here.

329
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,582
I'm dizzy and urgent. I don't feel well.

330
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,707
Dizzy or urgent?

331
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:00,708
I'm not sure.

332
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:03,000
I'll take mum to the bathroom.

333
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:07,125
Hold her. Careful.

334
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,417
Dad.

335
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:12,958
Let's go home.

336
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,500
I'll go get my things first.

337
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:20,417
Is that your daughter?

338
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,208
And your daughter?

339
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,083
Yes.

340
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:24,333
Thanks.

341
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:25,250
It's alright.

342
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:27,583
Thanks.

343
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:31,624
What do you do?

344
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,792
I'm a tour guide, taking customers to Japan.

345
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,833
Good. I heard it pays well.

346
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:38,583
It makes end meet.

347
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:39,917
You?

348
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:42,916
I had my own factory before.

349
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:44,791
Now I'm freelancing as a taxi driver.

350
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,208
Just for fun.

351
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,458
I am negotiating a huge contract recently.

352
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:51,167
Cool.

353
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:54,999
I don't think it's that serious.

354
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,417
They're making a big deal out of nothing.

355
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:58,542
If she weren't the headmaster,
I would have fought back.

356
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:02,250
Yeah. She's a bitch.

357
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,458
Nothing bad could happen between two girls.

358
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:07,708
I'd be worried sick if they were with boys.

359
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:10,708
It'll be so screwed by then.

360
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:15,000
Like you said,
nothing bad could happen between girls.

361
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:16,957
They just haven't met any guys yet.

362
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:19,832
When they do there's no turning back.

363
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,707
You're right. No turning back.

364
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:23,457
Are you done?

365
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:24,707
I'm coming.

366
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:25,625
Goodbye.

367
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:41,833
I've thought about it.

368
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:43,542
It's all because of you.

369
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:45,000
Because of me?

370
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,500
You like women.

371
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,375
Yes.

372
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,917
Our daughter inherits your gene.

373
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:52,833
You got a point.

374
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:58,207
This little brat needs a proper schooling.

375
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:00,250
You're right. I'll do the tough work.

376
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:01,333
You?

377
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:03,542
Beat her up.

378
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:21,083
Are you scared yet?

379
00:36:21,084 --> 00:36:22,333
I dare you to do it again.

380
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:23,708
Do you regret it now?

381
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:25,167
Well it's too late.

382
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:28,000
Why do you have to do this?

383
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:39,708
Your mum...

384
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:40,458
Sit.

385
00:37:57,917 --> 00:37:59,542
Sit down and have a piece of cake.

386
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,542
Do you remember after your mum ran away.

387
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,667
I made you a promise.

388
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,958
I will get rich.

389
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,625
I'm sure you can tell I've been working hard.

390
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,458
I even work double shift driving taxi.

391
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:27,458
I saved 200 thousands,

392
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:30,083
Because I wanted to go back to

393
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:32,500
making child clothing to earn more.

394
00:38:33,292 --> 00:38:35,208
I made some loans.

395
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,958
But an old friend of mine scammed me.

396
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:45,208
Turns out he was doing worse than me.

397
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:47,125
Who could have known?

398
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:54,792
I am useless.

399
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,583
Your mom was right to leave.

400
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,375
You're all grew up.

401
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:06,542
You should be aware of our situation.

402
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,208
Money is tight.

403
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:13,125
You cannot lose the scholarship.

404
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:16,917
The most important thing is to study hard.

405
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:22,374
I don't mind you hanging out with girls.

406
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:24,416
I like hanging out with girls.

407
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:26,250
It's just they don't want to hang out with me.

408
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,125
Here, have some cake.

409
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,167
Let's eat together.

410
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,750
I'm sorry dad.

411
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:53,083
Good Girl.

412
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:02,792
It's delicious.

413
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:04,958
Have some more.

414
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:06,042
Come on.

415
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:11,542
It's good.

416
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,583
She's sleeping over too often.

417
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,999
Is she homeless?

418
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,042
Shhh... Mom be quiet.

419
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,417
She could hear you.

420
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:28,292
You know what?

421
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,417
I'm never going to sit here and
wait for you anymore.

422
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:36,458
I figured.

423
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,000
Damn it.

424
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,125
You may not believe it.

425
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:46,125
You may not believe it.

426
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,583
I really like you.

427
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,542
Don't make me cry.

428
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,500
You may not believe it too.

429
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:03,167
I really like you.

430
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:06,500
What will happen to us next year?

431
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:08,542
A-Levels I presume.

432
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:10,917
I mean to "us".

433
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:13,917
We will go to university together.

434
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,000
I will study whatever you study.

435
00:41:16,917 --> 00:41:18,917
If you ever thought about our future?

436
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,167
Isn't this the one you want?

437
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:29,417
I never said I want it.

438
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,042
Fine. I take it back.

439
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:39,583
I'll throw it away.

440
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,833
I am throwing it away.

441
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:47,250
I meant it.

442
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,208
Wing Lee.

443
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,750
What?

444
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,958
Sister was right.

445
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,375
Growing up in an All-Girls school,

446
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,083
It's normal to be confused.

447
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:15,625
It's just an illusion.

448
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:19,208
Once we outgrow these feelings,

449
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:23,083
we will realise how childish we are being now.

450
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:27,875
If it's childish to love you,

451
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:30,125
I'd rather never grow up.

452
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,667
You don't understand.

453
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:38,375
You're the one who don't understand.

454
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:41,958
Do you realise the effort
I went through to buy you this ring?

455
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:45,083
I walked to school every day.

456
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,250
I had hot dogs for lunch for months.

457
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:49,917
I even spent my red packet money.

458
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:53,833
Knowing how happy you'll be

459
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:56,333
when you receive this ring,

460
00:42:58,333 --> 00:42:59,542
makes me think

461
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:03,208
it'll be worth it.

462
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:04,500
I didn't ask you to buy it.

463
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:19,958
Exactly.

464
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:22,833
Nobody told me to buy it.

465
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:27,042
No one asked me to be nice to you.

466
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:30,958
Nobody forced me to love you.

467
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:35,333
I did it all by myself, is that alright?

468
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:40,458
Please don't be like this.

469
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,125
I don't understand.

470
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,082
As long as we love each other,

471
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:55,292
there is nothing in this world we can't handle.

472
00:44:04,917 --> 00:44:07,042
What are we?

473
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:13,792
Good friends.

474
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,708
What do you mean good friends?

475
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,750
Do good friends hold hands, hug and kiss?

476
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:32,625
Why not?

477
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:41,542
Please don't.

478
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:44,917
Know this,

479
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:52,625
you will always be my best friend,

480
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:55,375
that's a fact no one can change.

481
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,000
If you...

482
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:53,083
If you're unhappy with me,

483
00:45:59,792 --> 00:46:01,042
maybe it's time...

484
00:46:45,417 --> 00:46:46,750
Sylvia.

485
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,708
Sylvia Lee!

486
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,667
Now the whole school knows about us.

487
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:23,875
Yes. What about it?

488
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:32,792
I am disappointed in you,
especially that you're a prefect.

489
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:36,458
Sylvia has already written her letter of apology.

490
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,750
You need to reflect on yourself.

491
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,249
Wing Lee has finished hers.

492
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,125
Stop wasting time.

493
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:48,042
My parents won't be informed if I agree
to write the letter, will they?

494
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:15,249
I am...

495
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,708
Speak up.

496
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:19,583
I'm Wing Lee,

497
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,375
number 22 from Class 7A.

498
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:29,000
Keep going!

499
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:35,458
Regarding the incident today

500
00:49:38,917 --> 00:49:40,667
involving Sylvia Lee from class 7A,

501
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:45,582
Upon reflection,

502
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:47,875
I am sincerely sorry

503
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:54,874
for violating the school conduct.

504
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:59,833
Our behaviour was shameful and unacceptable.

505
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:13,042
What are you doing?

506
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,541
I don't have an intimate relationship with Sylvia.
It was a stupid act.

507
00:50:21,542 --> 00:50:26,292
- I'm Sylvia Lee, number 21 from Class 7A.
- "From now on..."

508
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:29,792
I am willing to take full responsibility.

509
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,833
For what happened on the playground today.

510
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:36,917
It has nothing to do with Wing Lee.

511
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:02,667
Did you think that would kill me?

512
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,167
Don't be silly.

513
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:06,167
I have absolutely nothing

514
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:08,500
under control.

515
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,708
Her departure;

516
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:12,958
My emotions;

517
00:52:13,292 --> 00:52:15,417
How the world sees us.

518
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:20,708
You see, I can't even control a dream.

519
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:23,458
I feel so insignificant

520
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,583
out of the blue.

521
00:52:28,417 --> 00:52:31,667
It seems like a lot had happened,

522
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:35,083
Yet nothing really happened.

523
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:38,792
I reached out for her a couple times.

524
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:42,291
Hong Kong is such a tiny place,

525
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:46,458
I can't imagine she could just vanish like that.

526
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,333
I do wonder sometimes,

527
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,417
is everything between me and her

528
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:55,667
just a dream,

529
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:58,167
Or am I still in denial?

530
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:03,708
I wish I could write another letter of apology.

531
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:07,333
To repent myself of writing such a letter.

532
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:16,083
So this is how it feels

533
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:18,375
to feel nothing.

534
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:21,708
I thought it was the end of the world to me.

535
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:24,792
Until one day,

536
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:27,500
I realise I'm not

537
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:29,917
the only one hurt by this.

538
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:42,916
Today is 3 February,
the third day of the Chinese Lunar New Year.

539
00:54:42,917 --> 00:54:46,749
Mr Patrick Ho, Secretary for Home Affairs,
has arrived Che Kung Temple to pray for blessings.

540
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:47,625
Earlier this evening,

541
00:54:47,626 --> 00:54:49,499
Cheung, a Chinese male.

542
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,499
Has fallen from a hotel in Central,

543
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,999
He was pronounced dead...

544
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,207
Prince of Wales Hospital confirmed

545
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:57,125
that two medical staff has shown symptoms of SARS.

546
00:54:57,708 --> 00:54:58,957
To many Hong Kong people,

547
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:00,832
That was a memorable year.

548
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:02,500
A lot of unforgettable things happened.

549
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:04,500
But for me,

550
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:07,167
All I could remember are a bunch of words,

551
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:09,292
letters,

552
00:55:10,042 --> 00:55:12,208
this supposedly relaxing music,

553
00:55:13,917 --> 00:55:14,875
and this date.

554
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:20,000
Everyone has their own way to move on.

555
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:21,792
My way?

556
00:55:22,292 --> 00:55:25,083
I decided to countdown to one.

557
00:55:25,417 --> 00:55:28,042
If she doesn't show up, it's time to move on.

558
00:55:29,042 --> 00:55:30,042
Three.

559
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Two.

560
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:33,917
One

561
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:35,750
Sylvia.

562
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:37,333
Happy birthday.

563
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:40,832
We are...

564
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:44,457
We are the twelve members from social science...

565
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:47,124
Thanks to the rise of social media,

566
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:48,750
I finally found her.

567
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:51,792
I'll admit I didn't keep my promise.

568
00:55:52,792 --> 00:55:55,167
But I was really happy for her,

569
00:55:55,542 --> 00:55:56,958
When I found out she was majoring in film.

570
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:02,292
What are you doing?

571
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:04,166
Sorry I couldn't help it,

572
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:05,208
the framing was too beautiful.

573
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:09,708
Hey.

574
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:13,333
I'll let you know once it's developed.

575
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,166
What a sicko, he stole two pairs of my pantyhose.

576
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:26,124
I lost two bras.

577
00:56:26,125 --> 00:56:28,125
There must be a pervert in our dormitory.

578
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:47,457
Steal my underpants?

579
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:48,582
You creep.

580
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:50,417
Pervert!

581
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:52,875
Lunatic!

582
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:56,958
What are you doing?

583
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:58,374
Why are you stealing my underpants?

584
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,041
No I am not.

585
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,291
Liar!

586
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,000
Then why are you creeping around?

587
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:06,707
See! You can't talk your way out of it.

588
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:07,957
I'll tell the warden now.

589
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:08,958
Please don't!

590
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:10,749
My underpants is inside.

591
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:11,458
Nonsense!

592
00:57:12,917 --> 00:57:14,042
See for yourself.

593
00:57:21,917 --> 00:57:23,708
The blue one is my underpants.

594
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:29,667
Damn it. Now I have to wash it again.

595
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:33,374
That's it.

596
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:34,791
That's how I met my first ever male friend.

597
00:57:34,792 --> 00:57:36,791
A silly boy

598
00:57:36,792 --> 00:57:37,999
who lost a game of truth or dare

599
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,958
during the orientation camp.

600
00:57:45,208 --> 00:57:46,500
Are you scared?

601
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,082
Nope.

602
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:52,292
Do you need to borrow this?

603
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:55,708
You're tearing the chair apart.

604
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:57,958
No, I won't...

605
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:12,542
So... what are we?

606
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:17,458
We are good bros.

607
00:58:19,542 --> 00:58:21,000
Just bros?

608
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:23,542
Why'd you ask?

609
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,500
What if.

610
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,250
I want us to be more than bros?

611
00:58:44,917 --> 00:58:45,958
Are you scared?

612
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:50,792
Your question is scarier.

613
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:54,000
I was joking.

614
00:58:54,417 --> 00:58:55,708
Were you really scared?

615
00:58:56,208 --> 00:58:57,458
Did I fool you?

616
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:59,249
How stupid.

617
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,208
Joking again?

618
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:04,917
Sorry.

619
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:06,332
You have to be quiet.

620
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:07,457
You too.

621
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:08,250
You're so noisy.

622
00:59:08,251 --> 00:59:09,875
You're so gullible.

623
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:29,333
I only realise it now,

624
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:33,458
I cannot treat my male friend the way
I treated my female friends.

625
00:59:33,792 --> 00:59:35,500
It's misleading.

626
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:38,999
That's why even though
I have huge gap between classes,

627
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,833
I try not to hang around on campus.

628
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:43,083
You know, to spare us the embarrassment.

629
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:46,042
The last thing I would anticipate,

630
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:52,208
Is to run into the last person I should meet.

631
01:00:00,917 --> 01:00:02,000
Hey.

632
01:00:14,458 --> 01:00:16,875
We chatted for so long that night,

633
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:20,083
as if we tried to make up for the lost time.

634
01:00:21,042 --> 01:00:22,541
I was glad that.

635
01:00:22,542 --> 01:00:25,083
We were finally able to talk like before,

636
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:28,333
Until she told me.

637
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,458
I'm in love.

638
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:34,958
With a guy.

639
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:40,958
Hold hands?

640
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:44,833
Kiss?

641
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:47,917
Yup.

642
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:55,000
What about...

643
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:58,667
We did it.

644
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,750
What does it feel like?

645
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:25,750
It's about time.

646
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,250
My boyfriend is waiting outside.

647
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:38,417
Give me something.

648
01:01:42,292 --> 01:01:43,583
Give me your earrings.

649
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:45,250
You don't have your ears pierced.

650
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:46,625
What for?

651
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:48,500
I just want them.

652
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,500
I have to go. Bye.

653
01:02:53,792 --> 01:02:55,000
What are you doing?

654
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,792
Do you like me?

655
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:06,250
Get down first. It's not safe.

656
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:15,208
Hey.

657
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:20,458
Ever since that night,

658
01:04:20,542 --> 01:04:22,375
I have never worn a dress ever again.

659
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:31,457
Here are the CDs you said you want.

660
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:33,666
Wow, are you not coming back?

661
01:04:33,667 --> 01:04:36,750
I have to go, bye.

662
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:50,791
Go meet some foreign girls.

663
01:04:50,792 --> 01:04:52,208
Take the chance to learn English.

664
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:55,667
If you're looking for a boyfriend

665
01:04:56,708 --> 01:04:58,167
let me know.

666
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:09,500
I have to go. Bye.

667
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:13,332
I have to go. Bye.

668
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:14,625
Don't miss me too much.

669
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:51,125
Hey, don't sneak a bite!

670
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:54,292
Cook it yourself ok?

671
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:56,917
Hello?

672
01:06:00,292 --> 01:06:01,375
Where are you? I'm on my way.

673
01:06:19,792 --> 01:06:22,249
The patient had a sudden heart attack

674
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,499
and he was found unconscious in the car.

675
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,917
He barely made it to the hospital.

676
01:06:25,417 --> 01:06:26,833
We did everything we could.

677
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Take care.

678
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,083
This watch didn't work anymore.

679
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:32,708
It costs a lot for maintenance so he didn't.

680
01:07:36,042 --> 01:07:38,583
He said it's not about knowing the time.

681
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:41,750
It's about showing off.

682
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:48,542
I know he loved me very much.

683
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:51,583
He just never said it.

684
01:07:56,625 --> 01:07:59,208
The cheesecake that I like is very expensive.

685
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,375
He bought it on two occasions.

686
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:06,958
The first time is after my mum left us.

687
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:12,582
He held the cake telling me that

688
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:14,625
my mum would never come back.

689
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:19,875
The second time is after we
met with the Headmaster.

690
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:22,750
He didn't blame me at all.

691
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:29,375
I don't understand why.

692
01:08:30,583 --> 01:08:34,292
I can only taste my favourite food
when I am the most upset.

693
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:42,333
Right now.

694
01:08:45,958 --> 01:08:47,917
I can taste it again.

695
01:09:02,875 --> 01:09:05,292
The moment I know something happened to my dad.

696
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,542
I don't know why I called you right away.

697
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,250
Don't worry. I'm fine.

698
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,874
Where's your boyfriend?

699
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:19,333
Is anyone walking you home?

700
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:25,458
We broke up.

701
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:49,417
Who is the family representative?

702
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:32,041
Sylvia.

703
01:10:32,042 --> 01:10:33,999
Come to the U.S. with me.

704
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,208
I'll take care of you all.

705
01:10:36,042 --> 01:10:37,542
I promised my dad

706
01:10:38,542 --> 01:10:40,083
that I'll take care of them.

707
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,457
You're just a student.

708
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:44,208
How are you supposed to take care of them?

709
01:10:46,292 --> 01:10:49,000
We didn't need your care before.

710
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:51,792
We certainly don't need it now.

711
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:00,958
Sylvia.

712
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:03,958
I'm your mother.

713
01:11:05,542 --> 01:11:08,292
Stop treating me like a stranger.

714
01:11:11,583 --> 01:11:13,375
If you are my family

715
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:15,833
you could be joining us just then.

716
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:34,042
I'll make you two some food.

717
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:38,292
It's fine. We'll go grab a bite.

718
01:11:41,292 --> 01:11:43,208
I'm not hungry. You two go ahead.

719
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,416
Be careful.

720
01:11:47,417 --> 01:11:48,375
Got it.

721
01:11:50,583 --> 01:11:51,833
Let me help.

722
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:01,042
I'll take a shower first.

723
01:12:31,417 --> 01:12:32,833
You don't need to pretend to be strong.

724
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:48,292
I'm scared.

725
01:12:48,958 --> 01:12:51,417
Don't be. I'm here.

726
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:54,457
I know you need me.

727
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:56,125
Can we start again?

728
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,042
As long as we're together,
everything will be fine.

729
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:56,125
By the time we reach 30

730
01:13:58,417 --> 01:14:00,708
if we are both still single.

731
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:05,958
We will get married.

732
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:09,750
During this time

733
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:13,333
let's not see each other anymore.

734
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:18,583
Okay.

735
01:14:20,417 --> 01:14:22,000
It's a deal.

736
01:14:58,292 --> 01:14:59,750
After that night,

737
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:01,958
I didn't contact her.

738
01:15:03,042 --> 01:15:07,208
When I finally had the guts to open her ICQ,

739
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:09,625
I found out she quitted school.

740
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:11,625
She found a job.

741
01:15:13,667 --> 01:15:17,167
Wing, why did you change your Major to Film?

742
01:15:17,292 --> 01:15:19,292
I know a girl.

743
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:21,375
Movie was everything she dreamt of.

744
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:24,250
But she has to give it up for some reasons.

745
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:26,458
I am hoping to make her dream come true.

746
01:15:30,542 --> 01:15:33,667
If it is good, I'd only watch it halfway.

747
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:37,042
I'd thought of an ending
before I go watch it again.

748
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:40,500
To compare my ideas with the director's.

749
01:15:42,167 --> 01:15:43,374
Five seconds.

750
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:44,333
Three.

751
01:15:56,417 --> 01:15:58,250
I was desperate to truly grow up.

752
01:15:59,042 --> 01:16:02,083
That's why I moved out soon after graduation.

753
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,500
I want to live on my own.

754
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:09,457
I remember when I was a student,

755
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:11,833
I dreamt of getting a job and being an adult.

756
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:14,375
But when you're out wandering in the real world,

757
01:16:16,417 --> 01:16:18,250
You always wish to go back to being a student.

758
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:22,457
Some may say,

759
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:24,833
Hard work is a form of laziness.

760
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:27,832
When I reached 24,

761
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:30,000
Life is nothing but a blur.

762
01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:33,416
The most powerful side effect of working

763
01:16:33,417 --> 01:16:36,000
in the film industry is it wipes out
your concept of time.

764
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:40,332
I cannot recall the number.

765
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:41,707
Of movies I've participated in;

766
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:43,583
Or the places I've flew to.

767
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:46,750
Until one day, I walked pass her home

768
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:49,250
while location scouting.

769
01:16:51,542 --> 01:16:53,124
All of a sudden,

770
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:55,124
I was afraid, that I will be too numb

771
01:16:55,125 --> 01:16:56,750
to feel anything anymore.

772
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:07,125
Hello?

773
01:17:08,542 --> 01:17:09,583
Hello?

774
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:11,750
Who's this?

775
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:36,458
Do you recognise me?

776
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:41,500
I'm getting married on 15 November.

777
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:45,666
Ms Lee is here.

778
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:46,667
Thank you.

779
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,708
I've been waiting for you.

780
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:27,583
I forgot to say it on the phone.

781
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:29,875
Congratulations.

782
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,667
You are the one that should be congratulated.

783
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:34,000
You're a film director now.

784
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:39,375
How's life as an accountant?

785
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:41,208
It's tough.

786
01:18:41,667 --> 01:18:43,708
I just help my client to get listed.

787
01:18:44,917 --> 01:18:46,333
While preparing my wedding.

788
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:50,333
Put the dress on.

789
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:54,667
Thanks.

790
01:19:13,542 --> 01:19:14,542
Are you shy?

791
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,875
Not when I'm with you.

792
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:25,458
It's as if you never grew up.

793
01:19:25,917 --> 01:19:26,875
You are almost 30.

794
01:19:26,876 --> 01:19:28,583
Why are you still wearing a bra like that?

795
01:19:29,542 --> 01:19:30,292
Yeah.

796
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:32,625
Look at me.

797
01:19:33,667 --> 01:19:35,000
I can tell.

798
01:19:49,708 --> 01:19:51,917
Is that your Dad's watch?

799
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,707
I've been wearing it

800
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:57,083
since he passed away. I never take it off.

801
01:20:03,375 --> 01:20:04,458
Ah.

802
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:06,375
Did you do it on purpose?

803
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:08,500
Asking you to be my maid of honour?

804
01:20:10,917 --> 01:20:12,833
Getting married before 30.

805
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:20,167
If I say yes,

806
01:20:20,708 --> 01:20:21,958
would you believe me?

807
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,041
This is your acting zone.

808
01:20:30,042 --> 01:20:32,041
Your ending position is here.

809
01:20:32,042 --> 01:20:34,167
Keep spinning... That's right.

810
01:20:34,542 --> 01:20:35,625
Hi, Ms Lee.

811
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:37,749
Can you share with us.

812
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,333
What kind of story your film tells?

813
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:47,042
The same event, from two perspectives,

814
01:20:47,792 --> 01:20:50,375
Could generate completely different memories.

815
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,792
My film is about a girl

816
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:56,667
searching for another girl,

817
01:20:57,917 --> 01:21:00,750
To see if what they have gone through

818
01:21:01,542 --> 01:21:03,125
during their high school years

819
01:21:04,917 --> 01:21:07,458
has turned into the same memory.

820
01:22:40,042 --> 01:22:41,208
Why are you laughing?

821
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,458
You got it wrong again.

822
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:03,958
Remember this ring?

823
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:09,375
Turns out it's in the
school locker all these time.

824
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:15,667
I used to like this ring before.

825
01:23:18,708 --> 01:23:20,042
Sylvia,

826
01:23:22,583 --> 01:23:26,083
You will belong to someone else
the moment you walk out.

827
01:23:28,917 --> 01:23:30,625
Can I ask you a question?

828
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:32,416
Fine.

829
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:33,625
Go ahead.

830
01:23:40,917 --> 01:23:43,374
What happened to us in high school.

831
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:45,208
Is that love?

832
01:23:48,792 --> 01:23:51,332
The ceremony will begin in <i>5</i> minutes,
please be ready.

833
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:52,917
It's time to go.

834
01:24:57,042 --> 01:24:58,333
Sylvia,

835
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:00,042
promise me,

836
01:25:00,043 --> 01:25:01,250
Please be happy.

837
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:10,250
Why did you ask me to be your maid of honour?

838
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:14,875
Why did you say yes?

839
01:25:18,583 --> 01:25:20,833
Because I don't want to lose a friend.

840
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:24,875
Because”.

841
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:27,417
You are my only friend.

842
01:25:37,917 --> 01:25:42,666
<i>Looking back to our days on campus.</i>

843
01:25:42,667 --> 01:25:49,332
<i>Your every smile messes up my mind.</i>

844
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:56,667
<i>Dancing in the hall together,
we never felt tired.</i>

845
01:25:57,167 --> 01:26:01,916
<i>The smell of our classroom,
mixed with summer rain.</i>

846
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:04,332
<i>How reckless were we.</i>

847
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:11,624
<i>To cut through all the red tapes.</i>

848
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:16,500
<i>Who chose to stay put?</i>

849
01:26:17,542 --> 01:26:23,249
<i>Started out as confidantes</i>

850
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:27,041
<i>even though we were both curious.</i>

851
01:26:27,042 --> 01:26:29,250
<i>Do you still remember?</i>

852
01:26:29,542 --> 01:26:35,208
<i>How we long for, yet to afraid to touch.</i>

853
01:26:36,542 --> 01:26:42,624
<i>The spark was so bright.</i>

854
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:46,249
<i>Concealing the bittersweet goodbye</i>

855
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:55,958
<i>I was all alone to carry on the last act.</i>

856
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:14,958
They're waiting for you.

857
01:27:20,875 --> 01:27:22,792
Don't cry. It messes up your makeup.

858
01:27:31,625 --> 01:27:32,874
Mr. Chung-wai Yau.

859
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:36,833
Do you take Ms. Sylvia Lee
as your lawful wife?

860
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:38,292
I do.

861
01:27:39,042 --> 01:27:40,374
Ms. Sylvia Lee,

862
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:44,791
Do you take Mr. Chung-wai Yau
as your lawful husband?

863
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:49,000
In sickness and in health, to love and cherish...

864
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:55,166
<i>Started out as confidantes.</i>

865
01:27:55,167 --> 01:27:59,708
It's totally normal to be confused.

866
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:02,542
It's just an illusion.

867
01:28:03,292 --> 01:28:04,832
Once we grow up,

868
01:28:04,833 --> 01:28:10,000
we will realise how childish we are being now.

869
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:13,749
<i>The spark was so bright.</i>

870
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:17,249
<i>Only to prepare for our goodbye.</i>

871
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:24,249
<i>I'm left alone, with no regrets.</i>

872
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:25,917
I do.

873
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:32,208
<i>Standing by your side as a confidante,</i>

874
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:35,458
I love you.

875
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:39,667
I do.

876
01:28:44,542 --> 01:28:50,082
<i>The day has finally come,
I cannot turn back time,</i>

877
01:28:50,083 --> 01:28:53,374
<i>Cannot run from my feelings.</i>

878
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:56,666
<i>All I could do, is to be with you.</i>

879
01:28:56,667 --> 01:29:02,375
<i>My Dear, My Best friend.</i>

880
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:27,125
Everything has to come to an end someday.

881
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:31,958
Just like there's an ending to every movie.

882
01:29:32,917 --> 01:29:36,250
We don't always get to bid farewell.

883
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:40,832
We spend our six years of primary school,

884
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:42,667
To long for the seven years of secondary school.

885
01:29:43,708 --> 01:29:45,958
Then we spend our seven years of secondary school,

886
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:48,292
To long for the three years of university.

887
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:51,541
At the end we spend the rest of our lives,

888
01:29:51,542 --> 01:29:53,792
to reminisce about our youth.

889
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,750
I wonder how many people are like us,

890
01:29:58,458 --> 01:30:01,583
dare to like yet too frightened to love?

891
01:30:04,708 --> 01:30:08,583
Hey, it's our last scene together.

892
01:30:10,125 --> 01:30:12,457
I just realise.

893
01:30:12,458 --> 01:30:14,958
That I'm the supporting role in your life movie.

894
01:30:17,167 --> 01:30:18,667
For some reasons

895
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:23,541
all I could recall at this very moment

896
01:30:23,542 --> 01:30:25,792
is what you said to me on that fateful day.

897
01:30:28,167 --> 01:30:29,792
You were right.

898
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:33,832
Whatever happens in the future.

899
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:36,917
Perhaps I'll leave Hong Kong for good;

900
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:39,458
Perhaps you'll become a mother;

901
01:30:40,958 --> 01:30:44,042
Or perhaps I'll find another Sylvia Lee.

902
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,083
We

903
01:30:50,667 --> 01:30:52,000
Will always

904
01:30:52,917 --> 01:30:56,417
always be best friends

905
01:31:00,125 --> 01:31:02,208
forever.

906
01:31:15,083 --> 01:31:17,958
I never regretted liking that girl.

907
01:31:18,542 --> 01:31:20,374
It must have been love.

908
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:25,458
Your significant other doesn't have to be male,

909
01:31:25,542 --> 01:31:29,416
We should look for spiritual connection.

910
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:32,624
A lot of girls study in single-sex schools

911
01:31:32,625 --> 01:31:37,041
I believe some have developed

912
01:31:37,042 --> 01:31:38,624
profound relationships in school.

913
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:41,624
Which is hard to come by.

914
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:44,749
Even though you didn't end up with that person,

915
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:48,291
It doesn't mean the memories
you shared aren't real

916
01:31:48,292 --> 01:31:50,457
I know we aren't meant to be together forever,

917
01:31:50,458 --> 01:31:53,999
I hope you can find your passion

918
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,624
and live happily ever after.

919
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:59,417
Never stop pursuing happiness.

920
01:31:59,958 --> 01:32:03,124
No matter what happens in life,

921
01:32:03,125 --> 01:32:09,041
The intimacy we share won't fade,

922
01:32:09,042 --> 01:32:11,875
you will always hold a special place in my heart.

923
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:13,083
Although there's regret,

924
01:32:13,084 --> 01:32:17,583
I still wish her all the happiness in life.
