1
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:03,379
This whole thing in this messed-up world

2
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:06,219
where’s it gonna end?

3
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:09,339
How much longer do we

4
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:10,859
have to suffer through this?

5
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:16,899
Fate again?

6
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:21,699
Fate, my ass!

7
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:25,859
Don’t you think there’s something beyond fate?

8
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:27,779
No one

9
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:29,339
or nothing

10
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:31,938
is ever beyond fate’s control.

11
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:32,779
Humans are.

12
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:35,619
Haven’t you ever wondered or noticed?

13
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:39,139
Humans are the cruelest creatures.

14
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:41,059
They do whatever it takes

15
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,539
to put themselves above fate

16
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:45,379
above nature.

17
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,419
That’s what makes everything abnormal.

18
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,219
Abnormal

19
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,819
until it becomes normal.

20
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:57,579
Nature is out of place.

21
00:01:58,339 --> 00:01:59,659
Fate is already determined.

22
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:02,979
This whole thing is made up.

23
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:05,939
Like experimental animals.

24
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,499
Experimental animals that fail the test

25
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:11,939
get thrown away like trash.

26
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,219
As long as the experiment isn’t over

27
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,619
we’ll keep being controlled like this

28
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:22,419
until they get their perfect being

29
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:24,699
or

30
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,299
until there’s nothing.

31
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:33,299
Do you guys remember what Astar said?

32
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:35,899
Only one winner

33
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,579
will survive this game in this fucked-up world.

34
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:41,659
If this world is a game

35
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,699
then all of us are players.

36
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:47,219
If we don’t play, we die.

37
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:49,259
If we lose, we die.

38
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:51,699
The strongest

39
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:53,419
and the most perfect one

40
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:55,739
is the winner.

41
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,699
And there’s only one winner.

42
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,219
The four of us

43
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:06,459
who will be the winner?

44
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:11,139
The fact that we ended up back at the same spot

45
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,059
means

46
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:16,059
Everything that happened

47
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:19,459
was just a setup

48
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,699
a way to toy with our lives.

49
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:29,259
Perfection is imperfection.

50
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:31,779
When the time comes

51
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,339
the four of us might all die.

52
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:37,739
There’s no way all four of us will survive together.

53
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,299
Survive or not, I don’t know

54
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,299
but if you die right now, that’d be good.

55
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:47,779
One less competitor to worry about.

56
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:52,099
There’s no such thing as a game

57
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:53,579
or competitors.

58
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:57,659
The four of us will make it out of here alive.

59
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,259
Wait.

60
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:04,099
If they can kill us

61
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,299
and bring us back to life

62
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,739
then the ones we saw die

63
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:12,739
might still be alive somewhere.

64
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:16,899
So, that means

65
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,779
Eve might still be alive somewhere

66
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:22,699
in this world.

67
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:35,939
Eve!

68
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:40,899
Eve!

69
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:44,219
Iron!

70
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:47,099
Iron!

71
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:51,859
What are you doing sitting here all by yourself?

72
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:55,339
Are you thinking about Eve?

73
00:06:58,899 --> 00:06:59,739
I don’t know.

74
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:03,899
I just feel like

75
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,659
like I was the one who killed Eve.

76
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:12,739
Does that even count as thinking about her?

77
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:17,099
No one killed anyone.

78
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:19,499
Everything happened

79
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:21,979
and then it just disappeared.

80
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:27,219
Disappeared, as if it had never even happened.

81
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:29,939
All that’s left are memories.

82
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,259
It hurts

83
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:37,299
when we don’t even get to say goodbye.

84
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:40,019
I understand.

85
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:52,339
I understand you, Marduk.

86
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:55,459
What I feel for you

87
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:58,619
it’s not like I feel nothing.

88
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:04,419
That night was amazing for me.

89
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:08,539
I’m serious.

90
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:11,579
No matter what happens from now on

91
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:15,939
you’ll always be my best memory.

92
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:20,259
I told you before

93
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:22,859
what love

94
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,739
means to me.

95
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,419
Right now, I’m happy

96
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,899
because I have you by my side

97
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:39,539
always cheering me on.

98
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:46,179
No matter where you are

99
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:49,659
No matter who you’re with

100
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,739
I’ll be here

101
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:56,739
right next to you.

102
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,299
You made me realize

103
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:04,419
when it comes to love

104
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:06,499
it doesn’t matter

105
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,859
what kind of relationship it is

106
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,099
or what it depends on.

107
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:14,739
As long as the two of us understand each other

108
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,499
see each other’s worth

109
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:21,219
that’s enough.

110
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:26,939
Can I

111
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:30,859
hug you?

112
00:09:58,419 --> 00:09:59,099
Marduk!

113
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:00,179
Marduk!

114
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:01,579
Help!
Marduk!

115
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:03,339
Marduk!

116
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:05,299
Help!

117
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:07,499
Marduk!

118
00:10:30,219 --> 00:10:31,499
How did I get here?

119
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:34,419
Where did everyone go?

120
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:37,539
Iron!

121
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:40,019
Bite me.

122
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,659
Swallow me.

123
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,259
Come closer to me.

124
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,859
Your life is yours.

125
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:56,539
Ask your heart

126
00:10:57,219 --> 00:11:00,259
if you want to taste me.

127
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:07,219
You killed me!

128
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:07,939
Eve!

129
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,299
I didn’t.

130
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:12,819
Think.

131
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:14,579
Think hard.

132
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:16,939
You made me die.

133
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:19,659
You took the air

134
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:21,898
and the breath that was supposed to mine.

135
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,139
You took them away.

136
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:24,899
I didn’t do it.

137
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:26,939
I didn’t kill you.

138
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:29,419
If I did, I should remember something.

139
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:32,539
Don’t you remember?

140
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,019
Don’t you remember?

141
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:48,979
No.
That’s not true.

142
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:50,539
Not true.
Impossible.

143
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:56,579
Go away.

144
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,099
I said go away!

145
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:01,899
Why did you kill me?

146
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:02,579
Ti…
Tina.

147
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:09,939
Tina!

148
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:12,739
I didn’t do it.

149
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:14,699
I didn’t kill you.

150
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:16,699
You did.

151
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:19,379
Why did you kill me?

152
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:21,539
I didn’t kill you.

153
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:23,019
I didn’t kill anyone.

154
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:35,939
Astar!

155
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:37,619
Astar!

156
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,219
Astar!

157
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:41,579
I didn’t kill anyone!

158
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:44,899
Copper!

159
00:12:46,219 --> 00:12:46,939
Help me.

160
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:49,139
I didn’t do anything to them, I swear.

161
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:50,619
You did.

162
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:52,939
Everything that happened

163
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:55,379
it was all because of you.

164
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:57,979
You’re the murderer.

165
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:00,899
The evidence shows that everything that happened

166
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:02,579
is on you.

167
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:04,659
You murderer.

168
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,219
You killed me!

169
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:08,859
We died because of you!

170
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:10,219
You’re sinister!

171
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:11,899
Evil!

172
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:13,779
Hell must’ve sent you to be born!

173
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:15,739
You murderer!

174
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:17,019
Don’t come near me.
Don’t come.

175
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:18,219
Don’t come.

176
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:19,779
Go away.

177
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,779
Go away!

178
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:42,059
Iron.

179
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:44,579
Help me.

180
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,139
I didn’t do anything to them, seriously.

181
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:50,979
Are you really sure, Marduk

182
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:53,939
that you didn’t kill them?

183
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:57,219
If you didn’t, then who did?

184
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:00,819
Think hard.

185
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:05,219
Think about what?

186
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:07,699
I didn’t do it.

187
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:10,539
If I did

188
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,299
I should remember something.

189
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:19,779
Is it because you blocked out those memories on purpose?

190
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:22,539
How could you not know

191
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:24,179
what you did?

192
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:29,779
Think carefully about this.

193
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:31,779
How can someone

194
00:14:33,099 --> 00:14:34,699
just die out of nowhere?

195
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:37,859
If you didn’t do it

196
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:40,139
then who did?

197
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:21,699
I didn’t do it.

198
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:24,419
I don’t know.

199
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:27,939
Someone must have framed me, for sure.

200
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:30,539
That’s right. Someone must have framed me.

201
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:38,819
You’re so scared

202
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:42,459
you don’t even know what the truth is anymore.

203
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:01,339
You can’t even see your own evil.

204
00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:05,099
The evil

205
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,019
buried deep in your subconscious

206
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:17,139
Marduk.

207
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:20,459
Marduk.

208
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:23,819
Marduk!

209
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:26,059
Marduk.
Marduk.

210
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:28,219
Marduk!

211
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:36,299
turns you into someone without compassion

212
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:38,659
cold

213
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:41,579
ready to destroy everything

214
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,179
and then act like it never even happened.

215
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:49,339
You use goodness

216
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:50,819
to hide your true face

217
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:54,899
to hide the cruelty you created.

218
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,419
You killed everyone.

219
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:50,499
No.
Not true.

220
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,659
You killed everyone.

221
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:53,859
Not true.

222
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:56,499
Not true.

223
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,699
Death

224
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:03,139
is that easy.

225
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:06,699
Why

226
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:08,219
did I have to die?

227
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:13,579
Beasts like you

228
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:18,779
just sleep

229
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:24,099
forever and ever.

230
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:34,939
Not true.
Not true.

231
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:36,619
Not true!

232
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:38,379
I didn’t do it.

233
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:39,419
I didn’t kill anyone.

234
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:41,419
I didn’t kill anyone!

235
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:43,019
I didn’t kill anyone.

236
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:45,019
I didn’t kill anyone.

237
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:46,579
I didn’t kill anyone.

238
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:08,459
Marduk!

239
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:10,419
Marduk!

240
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:16,259
What happened?

241
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:21,939
Eve is dead.

242
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:26,299
What the hell are you talking about?

243
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:29,419
She’s dead.

244
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:33,779
I was the one who killed her.

245
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:36,659
I killed Eve.

246
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:38,739
I killed all of us.

247
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:41,699
In that dark world

248
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:44,939
it was full of blood

249
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:48,619
rage

250
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:51,739
pain.

251
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:53,859
It was empty

252
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:55,579
invisible

253
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:58,139
leading nowhere.

254
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:02,859
I’m the one who made everyone die.

255
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:07,579
Get a hold of yourself.

256
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:09,739
What happened?

257
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:12,219
I’m a murderer.

258
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:14,939
Do you see

259
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:17,019
the blood on my hands?

260
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:25,939
I’m the one who made everyone die.

261
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:28,619
I know the truth.

262
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:31,099
Tina

263
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:33,859
Astar

264
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:36,259
Eve

265
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:40,499
you

266
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:42,099
and you

267
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:45,819
you all are putting your deaths on me.

268
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:47,819
I told you I didn’t kill anyone.

269
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:50,379
What the hell are you talking about?

270
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:51,299
You did it

271
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:52,419
or you didn’t.

272
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:55,459
I don’t know

273
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:57,899
what’s making you think like this

274
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:01,219
but I believe you.

275
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:04,299
I believe you didn’t do it.

276
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:07,619
You’re definitely not the kind of person who would do something like that.

277
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:10,819
You’re acting this way

278
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:13,339
because someone is controlling you

279
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:16,699
making you see those insane illusions.

280
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:22,659
Illusions

281
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:25,979
do you really think they’re real?

282
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:29,219
Don’t you think

283
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,139
everything that’s happening

284
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:32,379
could actually be true?

285
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:43,899
Marduk.

286
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:46,419
Marduk.

287
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:47,699
Marduk!

288
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:49,099
Marduk!

289
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:51,139
Marduk!

290
00:21:56,419 --> 00:21:56,899
Marduk!

291
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:02,379
Marduk.

292
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:03,339
No.

293
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:05,419
Marduk.

294
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:07,699
Breathe!

295
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:13,139
Breathe.

296
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,619
You can’t just leave me this easily, Marduk.

297
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:22,459
Open your eyes.

298
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:26,139
Wake up right now.

299
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:29,219
Then who am I supposed to live for?

300
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:32,699
You are my happiness

301
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:35,779
my warmth

302
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:40,379
my peace.

303
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:47,419
You are my everything.

304
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:53,859
I haven’t even said goodbye to you yet, Marduk.

305
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:57,379
Open your eyes.

306
00:22:58,819 --> 00:22:59,259
Wake up!

307
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:18,659
If miracles are real

308
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:22,339
even if this is my last chance

309
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:27,459
even if there’s no chance at all

310
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:32,019
I won’t let you go.

311
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:38,179
Even if I have to die instead of you

312
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:44,459
I’d do it.

313
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:49,939
At least

314
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:53,499
give me the chance to tell you

315
00:23:55,819 --> 00:23:57,979
that I

316
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,539
I love you.

317
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:05,859
Did you hear that, Marduk?

318
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,379
I love you.

319
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:42,619
I’m not dead yet.

320
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:54,259
Marduk

321
00:24:55,219 --> 00:24:56,059
you’re not dead yet.

322
00:24:59,419 --> 00:24:59,939
Huh?

323
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:04,619
But

324
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:07,619
why does it feel like I was dead?

325
00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:10,699
What was that memory just now?

326
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:16,139
I feel like I was just sleeping.

327
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:19,139
It was a long sleep

328
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:21,899
like

329
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:25,539
time itself just disappeared.

330
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,459
You were dead.

331
00:25:29,739 --> 00:25:31,499
We saw you die.

332
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:33,699
This is so weird.

333
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:37,579
I remember everything that happened.

334
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:41,099
Every single thing.

335
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:49,539
No.

336
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:51,379
Marduk!

337
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:53,699
Breathe.

338
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:56,619
You can’t just leave me this easily, Marduk.

339
00:25:57,979 --> 00:25:58,739
Open your eyes.

340
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,459
Wake up right now.

341
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:04,139
If miracles are real

342
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:08,059
even if this is my last chance

343
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:10,859
I won’t let you go.

344
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,499
Even if I have to die instead of you

345
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:15,899
I’d do it.

346
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:18,379
At least

347
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:20,419
give me the chance to tell you

348
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:22,699
I love you.

349
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:30,059
I love you.

350
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:04,059
Why was he willing to die for me?

351
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:08,339
Copper!

352
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:11,459
Copper!

353
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:30,939
Copper is dead.

354
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:42,339
He sacrificed his life

355
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:45,419
so that I could live.

356
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:49,899
What do you mean by that?

357
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:55,739
I don’t know.

358
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:06,419
The last person we saw die was Marduk.

359
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:11,299
He died and then came back to life.

360
00:28:12,699 --> 00:28:14,379
And now Copper is dead.

361
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:16,899
Or

362
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:19,859
is Copper the replacement of Marduk?

363
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,779
Everything that happened back then

364
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:53,739
seems to be punishing us now for the sins we committed.

365
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:57,179
The consequences of past karma

366
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,459
will affect the present we live in

367
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:03,939
sooner

368
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:05,739
or later.

369
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:07,899
In the end

370
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:09,779
we can’t escape it.

371
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:14,699
Death is toying with us

372
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:19,939
treating our lives as if they’re worthless.

373
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:23,219
No matter where we turn

374
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:25,019
no matter what we do

375
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,659
it clings to us like a shadow.

376
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:33,019
We’ll suffer

377
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,579
until death finally separates us.

378
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:41,059
Why does it have to be us?

379
00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:42,859
I don’t understand.

380
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:45,179
It’s not just us.

381
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:47,659
Anyone who does something

382
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:50,099
must face the consequences.

383
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:51,899
What did I do?

384
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:54,099
I can’t remember what I did.

385
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:56,339
At least

386
00:29:56,779 --> 00:29:58,219
if I knew what I did

387
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,579
it’d be better than knowing nothing at all.

388
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:03,099
No idea.

389
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:05,979
Didn’t do it.

390
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:08,739
Never existed.

391
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:10,579
But something must have happened.

392
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:14,739
We just can’t remember yet.

393
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:15,739
That’s all.

394
00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:17,739
Right.

395
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:20,899
Everything that happens

396
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:23,739
always has a reason.

397
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:29,539
Just wear it.

398
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:31,299
If it’s not yours, then whose?

399
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:32,419
In this world

400
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:33,779
anything can happen.

401
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:41,059
Marduk!

402
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,099
I won’t let you go.

403
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:47,299
Even if I have to die instead of you

404
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:52,059
I’d do it.

405
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:54,179
Or was it because of me

406
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:57,299
that Copper had to die?

407
00:30:58,779 --> 00:30:59,939
Don’t blame yourself, Marduk.

408
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:03,179
No one died because of anyone.

409
00:31:03,939 --> 00:31:05,259
We all saw what happened.

410
00:31:05,939 --> 00:31:07,659
We all perceived it the same way.

411
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:09,819
That’s not true.

412
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:13,179
Nothing is ever the same.

413
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:15,259
The visions I saw

414
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:18,339
the voices I heard in that darkness

415
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:21,259
they reflected so many things.

416
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:23,219
If I didn’t do it

417
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:25,739
then someone else

418
00:31:25,939 --> 00:31:26,619
must have.

419
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:30,939
Thinking about it over and over, searching for an answer

420
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:33,459
won’t make it any better.

421
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:35,619
He’s dead.

422
00:31:36,579 --> 00:31:38,219
Do you understand? He’s already dead.

423
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:40,059
You can say that

424
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:43,259
because he never mattered to someone like you.

425
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:43,939
Yeah.

426
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:45,819
My life

427
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:46,899
that’s what matters most.

428
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:48,299
In a moment like this

429
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:50,539
what the hell are you whining about?

430
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:51,299
Huh?

431
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,059
At least

432
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:57,019
it made me realize

433
00:31:58,139 --> 00:31:59,379
our worth

434
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:01,859
isn’t about who dies.

435
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:04,219
It’s about

436
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:06,499
the good we do

437
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:08,939
while we’re still alive.

438
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,779
Even if others don’t see it as good

439
00:32:12,939 --> 00:32:14,419
as long as it matters

440
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:17,259
to the one who value us, that’s enough.

441
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:21,099
People like you might not understand

442
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:24,179
but one day, you will.

443
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,379
If Copper could hear you right now

444
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:31,819
he’d probably be happy.

445
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:34,099
Happy that at least

446
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:36,619
we will remember him

447
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:39,819
even though he’s no longer in this world.

448
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:43,059
Not just letting him fade away

449
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:45,539
as if he never existed.

450
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:47,339
Someday

451
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:49,459
all of us

452
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,139
will disappear from each other’s memories.

453
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:56,299
Sooner or later.

454
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:07,139
Copper!

455
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:13,259
Where did Copper go?

456
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,699
He was just right here.

457
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:23,539
It’s all the same.

458
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:27,299
Die and disappear.

459
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:30,059
Or everything that happened

460
00:33:30,699 --> 00:33:31,859
was just an illusion.

461
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:34,539
The bodies of Astar and Tina are gone.

462
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:39,339
Where did they go?

463
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:43,499
Disappeared

464
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:45,499
like nothing ever happened.

465
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,459
What if no one is actually dead?

466
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:52,579
It’s all just an illusion.

467
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:54,059
And how do we know?

468
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:55,779
Where do we even find the answer?

469
00:33:56,939 --> 00:33:58,299
Look around.

470
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:01,019
It’s endless.

471
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:03,379
Empty.

472
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:06,979
Or maybe it’s that dark world.

473
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:08,939
When I was supposedly dead

474
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:10,779
I ended up there.

475
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:13,099
Or do we have to die in this world

476
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:17,939
just to reach that dark world?

477
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:19,779
And how can we be sure

478
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:21,739
that when we die

479
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:23,619
that’s where we’ll go?

480
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:27,339
I’m not sure.

481
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:32,819
But we have to try.

482
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:35,779
If it works

483
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:39,099
we’ll finally understand

484
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:41,979
what’s really happening.

485
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:05,819
Wait

486
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:07,859
am I already dead?

487
00:35:08,979 --> 00:35:10,099
Where did the others go?

488
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:14,339
Why am I the only one who died?

489
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:31,179
Marduk?

490
00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:36,779
What about others?

491
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:38,339
Iron?

492
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:39,539
Taiyo?

493
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:42,179
Didn’t they come with you?

494
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:43,059
Iron?

495
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:44,299
Taiyo?

496
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,019
Who are you talking about?

497
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:48,299
Are there other people besides us two?

498
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:49,739
Yes, there are.

499
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:51,899
But not here.

500
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:55,139
I don’t know

501
00:35:56,139 --> 00:35:57,579
how we ended up here either.

502
00:35:59,059 --> 00:35:59,659
At first

503
00:36:00,379 --> 00:36:01,658
I thought I was already dead.

504
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,219
Dead?

505
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:04,659
How could we be dead?

506
00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:06,459
We’ve never even gone anywhere.

507
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:08,139
No way out.

508
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:09,499
Nothing

509
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:11,339
but darkness.

510
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:12,379
That’s not true.

511
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:15,619
We’d never been here.

512
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,459
This place doesn’t exist.

513
00:36:23,939 --> 00:36:25,059
Who the hell are you?

514
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,299
What do you want from me?

515
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:29,659
What are you talking about?

516
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:30,339
Well

517
00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:33,179
I’m just speaking normally like I always do.

518
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:36,539
It’s you

519
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:38,459
who’s acting strange.

520
00:36:38,939 --> 00:36:40,259
Or are you messing with me?

521
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:44,099
I’m not playing along.

522
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:46,699
Why would I mess with you?

523
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:49,579
What would I even gain from messing with you?

524
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,379
As you can clearly see

525
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:53,299
it’s just you and me here.

526
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:55,579
Look.

527
00:36:56,859 --> 00:36:58,499
Do you see anyone else besides us two?

528
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:07,939
There is.

529
00:37:09,419 --> 00:37:10,779
But they’re somewhere else.

530
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:12,579
Not here.

531
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:15,659
There’s only this place.

532
00:37:16,419 --> 00:37:17,259
There’s nowhere else.

533
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,179
Or maybe because you died and then came back to life

534
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:24,739
your memories disappeared?

535
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:26,579
Died and came back, my ass!

536
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:28,939
No one dies and just comes back to life.

537
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:31,179
Dead is dead.

538
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:33,019
That’s not true.

539
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:36,259
I saw it with my own eyes.

540
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:38,419
It’s like

541
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:40,859
the same things keep happening

542
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:42,859
over

543
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,739
and over again.

544
00:37:46,419 --> 00:37:47,619
Like someone

545
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:50,219
planned it this way.

546
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:51,619
And why would anyone

547
00:37:51,779 --> 00:37:52,939
even do this?

548
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:54,339
For what?

549
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:00,739
To torture people like you.

550
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:05,459
What are you laughing about?

551
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:08,659
How are people like us

552
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:10,099
any different from people like you?

553
00:38:10,299 --> 00:38:10,939
It’s different.

554
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,259
What did you do?

555
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:16,339
Don’t you remember?

556
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:17,619
Think.

557
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,139
Think harder.

558
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:24,259
You killed all of us.

559
00:38:36,419 --> 00:38:37,659
Can’t you get just a little turned on for me?

560
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:41,899
When you’re turned on

561
00:38:43,899 --> 00:38:44,539
it arouses me.

562
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:49,059
Makes me want to kill you all.

563
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:54,579
Just kill me.

564
00:38:56,619 --> 00:38:57,339
Kill me.

565
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:00,859
Like you did to them.

566
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:31,339
Beasts like you

567
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:34,659
just sleep

568
00:39:35,299 --> 00:39:39,699
forever and ever.

569
00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:50,379
I didn’t kill anyone.

570
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:52,539
I was framed.

571
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:54,099
Go away!
Don’t come near me.

572
00:39:56,499 --> 00:39:57,259
What happened?

573
00:39:58,619 --> 00:39:59,539
I didn’t kill anyone.

574
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:03,539
Why is everyone pointing fingers at me alone?

575
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:05,139
That day, I was drunk.

576
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:06,419
I don’t remember anything.

577
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,059
When I woke up, that woman was just lying there, dead.

578
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:10,019
What are you talking about?
That woman?

579
00:40:11,419 --> 00:40:11,979
Which one?

580
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:15,859
You.

581
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:17,979
You’re the one who killed us all.

582
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,739
I’ve been waiting for this day for so long.

583
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:25,739
So freaking long.

584
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:29,819
So long that I thought you’d give in.

585
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:30,819
Iron!

586
00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:32,779
Taiyo!

587
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,219
And you’ll know

588
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:37,099
exactly what hell is like.

589
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:43,579
Copper.
