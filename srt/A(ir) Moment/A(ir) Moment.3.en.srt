1
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
My dear.

2
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,600
My dear Iron.

3
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
Sweetheart.

4
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,080
This way.

5
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,720
This way, Iron.

6
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,600
Follow me.

7
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
Iron.

8
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Behind you.

9
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,880
This way.

10
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
You’re awake?

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What happened?

12
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
What?

13
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Don’t you remember?

14
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
I can’t remember.

15
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,480
Good thing you don’t remember.

16
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
When I saw you

17
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,640
there were a bunch of devil fruits lined up.

18
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Where did they all go?

19
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
I didn’t see any.

20
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,600
There was only one.

21
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Really?

22
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Mm.

23
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
Thanks

24
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
for taking care of me.

25
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
So

26
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,840
What are we gonna do now?

27
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
Nothing, really.

28
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,200
The future?

29
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,280
Let’s worry about that tomorrow.

30
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Right now

31
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,240
it’s just you and me.

32
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,360
What do you mean?

33
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I’m just thinking

34
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,560
when the four of us were together, things were good.

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Do you think

36
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,280
this whole thing that happened

37
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,840
was actually a good thing?

38
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,120
I understand

39
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,280
why Taiyo did what he did.

40
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Same goes for you.

41
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,040
Why did you do that?

42
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,880
We all have something we want to have.

43
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,200
No one is completely selfless.

44
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,000
But when we can’t get what we want

45
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,400
we’re willing to hurt each other’s feelings

46
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,640
willing to be the bad guy.

47
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Toxic air.

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Toxic rain.

49
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,120
Hunger.

50
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,320
A world we don’t even recognize.

51
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,440
I can understand all that

52
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,920
but people’s hearts

53
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,040
I don’t understand.

54
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,320
You’re right about that.

55
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,720
Even my own heart

56
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,800
I don’t understand it at all.

57
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,080
It’s not that I don’t feel anything for you.

58
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,120
It’s just that I don’t know

59
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,000
what this feeling is.

60
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
I know

61
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,400
you feel guilty about what I did

62
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,400
but I need you to understand.

63
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,080
I’ll try to understand you.

64
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,360
It’s not that I don’t get it.

65
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
But the fact that

66
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,560
we’re stuck in this condition

67
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,280
is bad enough as it is.

68
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,320
But I do have feelings for you.

69
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,360
I just don’t know

70
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,000
if what I feel

71
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,600
and what you feel

72
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,560
are the same.

73
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,480
Let’s go find the answer.

74
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,760
Let’s figure out what happened.

75
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
At least

76
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,200
if there’s a path

77
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,080
then there must be a destination.

78
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,360
The sun rises

79
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,760
and sets in the same places.

80
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
Nothing has changed.

81
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,840
The only things that have changed

82
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
are me

83
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
you

84
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Iron

85
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Taiyo.

86
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,240
The four of us should be on the same team.

87
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Yeah.

88
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Then

89
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,520
let’s go look for those two.

90
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Are you

91
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
not mad at me anymore?

92
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Mm.

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,640
Since you’re not mad at me anymore

94
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,400
I can stop being mad at you too.

95
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,360
Everything can change.

96
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,560
Didn’t you say that yourself?

97
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,200
I’ll try

98
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,120
to change for the better.

99
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,400
But I won’t promise

100
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,040
that things will stay this way forever

101
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,600
because if one day in the future

102
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,200
something happens

103
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,560
I’ll have to do whatever it takes

104
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,040
to protect myself

105
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,760
to protect someone I love first.

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,160
Someone you love?

107
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Yeah.

108
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
It’s

109
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,040
called love.

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,560
Um.

111
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Let’s go.

112
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,720
Let’s go look for those two.

113
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,280
Wait!

114
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
We can’t go yet.

115
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,480
What?

116
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Why not?

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,760
Before we go look for those two

118
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
can you help me

119
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,200
look for my clothes first?

120
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
I can’t remember

121
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,680
where I left them.

122
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Iron!

123
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Hey

124
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
don’t tell me

125
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
you guys

126
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
were mating.

127
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
You mean

128
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,760
we actually fucked?

129
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
No way!

130
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,600
We just made up.

131
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Made up?

132
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,880
I see.

133
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
It’s like

134
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,280
a new way of making up, huh?

135
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
A new way?

136
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
A new way, my foot!

137
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,520
Quit being so secretive.

138
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,776
If you guys had just admitted it in the first place

139
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,200
you guys wouldn’t have had to fight

140
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,920
and tear each other apart like this.

141
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
Knock it off with that thinking, Iron.

142
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
What about you?

143
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,840
How did you find us?

144
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
I don’t know.

145
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,960
I heard a voice

146
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,200
but it wasn’t either of yours.

147
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
My dear.

148
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,400
I don’t know whose voice it was.

149
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,600
My dear Iron.

150
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
Don’t tell me

151
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,240
Ananke came back.

152
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
No.

153
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,280
The voice sounded

154
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
soft and sweet

155
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
This way.

156
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
And friendly

157
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,640
This way, Iron.

158
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:48,680
Like trying to help.

159
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,320
Follow me.

160
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Because if I

161
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,040
hadn’t heard that voice

162
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,280
I wouldn’t have walked this way and run into you guys here.

163
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
And

164
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,520
where were you guys going?

165
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,720
We were going to look for you and Taiyo.

166
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
But turns out

167
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,800
I have to help this dumbass

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
look for his clothes first.

169
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
So intense that

170
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,520
his clothes got ripped apart?

171
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,680
Stop it, Iron!

172
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Let’s go.

173
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,960
You think we’ll actually find them?

174
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Just wear it.

175
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,520
If it’s not yours, then whose?

176
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,680
In this world

177
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
anything can happen.

178
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
No way.

179
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
What?

180
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Do I look pretty?

181
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Taiyo!

182
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,280
Quick, run!

183
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
What?

184
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,240
I don’t know.

185
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
Just run first!

186
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,640
What is all this?

187
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,840
What is this place?

188
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,320
And what are we doing here?

189
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Let’s go inside first

190
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,440
and then we’ll figure it out.

191
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,280
What’s with all this food?

192
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Why

193
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
is there so much?

194
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,440
It’s like it was prepared just for us.

195
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
Do you guys

196
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,040
think it’s edible?

197
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,200
Four chairs

198
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,400
just enough for the four of us.

199
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,240
I don’t think this is normal

200
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
or just a coincidence.

201
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Right.

202
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,520
It’s like someone knew we’d be here

203
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
right now

204
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
and at this exact moment.

205
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,000
And it’s gotta be someone who knows

206
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,960
us really well.

207
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
It’s safe to eat, right?

208
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
You try it first.

209
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,360
I’ll take one for the team.

210
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,800
I’d rather die from food

211
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,480
than starve to death.

212
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Wait!

213
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
What?

214
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
You

215
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,680
got anything to say before you die?

216
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,280
Die?

217
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
If I die,

218
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,160
don’t eat me.

219
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,240
I don’t want to be a demon.

220
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,920
I want to be an angel.

221
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,120
If this is our last meal

222
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
we should enjoy it to the fullest.

223
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Right?

224
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,680
The last supper.

225
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Wait!

226
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Let me.

227
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,360
Guys

228
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,960
I think if you guys are not eating

229
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,520
then it’s all mine.
No sharing.

230
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Bitter.

231
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
Eww.

232
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,120
Poison.

233
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,360
Straight-up poison.
Guys, don’t drink it.

234
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,680
You’ve never had it before

235
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,960
or you forgot

236
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,440
what wine tastes like?

237
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
Wine?

238
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
What is wine?

239
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:11,800
And

240
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,160
how do you know it’s wine?

241
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
I just know

242
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
it’s wine.

243
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
That’s all.

244
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,280
I know what it is too

245
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
but

246
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,560
I can’t really explain

247
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
why I know.

248
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
Just drink it.

249
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You’re not gonna die.

250
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,640
At worst, you’ll just

251
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
get drunk.

252
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:42,613
Drunk?

253
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:44,733
Oh.

254
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,120
Drunk.

255
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Now I remember.

256
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Then

257
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
let’s get drunk.

258
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,360
Living in this world

259
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,760
is no different from wine

260
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,880
or any of the hard stuff.

261
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,160
I want all of us to stay strong

262
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
stick together

263
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,320
have each other’s backs

264
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,640
and get through this time

265
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
as fast as possible.

266
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
Cheers.

267
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Cheers.

268
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
Cheers.

269
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
Cheers.

270
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Now

271
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
you guys

272
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,440
wanna see a fun show?

273
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
Iron.

274
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
Iron.

275
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Iron!

276
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
What’s wrong?

277
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
What happened?

278
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Nothing.

279
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
I’m just drunk.

280
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Drunk?

281
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,640
Are you drunk, or did you see something?

282
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
See what?

283
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
Don’t tell me

284
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,440
you had those weird visions again.

285
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I figured.

286
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,920
This whole thing

287
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,320
is just weird.

288
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
It’s nothing like that.

289
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,840
I’m just drunk.

290
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,440
You guys go have fun.

291
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,400
Come have fun with us.

292
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Happiness

293
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,240
is like the wind.

294
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,240
It blows past for a second

295
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,600
then disappears forever.

296
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,040
Such a sweet talker

297
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,160
Young Master Poet.

298
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,880
Master Poet, my ass.

299
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,160
I’m just rambling.

300
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,400
Rambling and feeling

301
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,920
are different.

302
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Right now

303
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
you’re feeling.

304
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,400
You’re missing someone.

305
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
You knew?

306
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
I didn’t.

307
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
I’m just drunk.

308
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,280
I’m missing someone.

309
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,360
It’s a complicated feeling.

310
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Hard to understand.

311
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Missing someone

312
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,760
is a kind of yearning.

313
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,080
Why don’t you

314
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,240
try looking at the happiness that’s right in front of you?

315
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,120
The happiness right in front of me?

316
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,160
Keep those thoughts

317
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,360
as your good memories.

318
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,320
The pain that happened

319
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,040
everything that has already happened

320
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,480
it’s all fate.

321
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,720
Fate?

322
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
Love.

323
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,280
Love?

324
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Well

325
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
it’s love.

326
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,080
Love

327
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,200
can happen again and again

328
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,440
in many forms.

329
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,120
Love yourself.

330
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,920
Love food.

331
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,240
Love

332
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,720
love others.

333
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,360
Love without expecting anything back.

334
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Love

335
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,080
is about seeing our loved ones

336
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,040
happy?

337
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Right now

338
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
what are you feeling?

339
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Happy.

340
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
So comfy, right?

341
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,920
Not as depressing as the world we just went through.

342
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,560
If this is a setup

343
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,520
it’s probably a setup that’s so surreal

344
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,000
and so grand.

345
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,960
What do you think

346
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
tomorrow

347
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,400
we’ll face?

348
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
No clue.

349
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,440
Whatever happens, happens.

350
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,640
We’re no different from

351
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,480
characters in some writer’s story.

352
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,840
Whatever they want us to do

353
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
or be

354
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,440
they just write it however they want.

355
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,960
They don’t care

356
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,000
about how the characters feel.

357
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,120
A writer?

358
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Shakespeare?

359
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
Whoa

360
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,000
even an idiot like you knows

361
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,080
Shakespeare?

362
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,200
And only smart people

363
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,720
would know him?

364
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,080
Have you read his work?

365
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Never.

366
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,840
I’ve never even thought about reading any.

367
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840
Even if I did

368
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,360
I wouldn’t understand it.

369
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,600
But someone said that

370
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Shakespeare

371
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,120
didn’t actually write his own work.

372
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
And do you believe that?

373
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,200
We weren’t there

374
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
so we wouldn’t know.

375
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,360
Same goes for us.

376
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,120
If this whole thing is a setup

377
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,720
do you think if you told anyone

378
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,800
they’d believe you?

379
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Good point.

380
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,160
At the dining table

381
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
what did you see?

382
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,000
Tell me about it.

383
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
What I saw?

384
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,680
I saw

385
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,000
saw death.

386
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,200
It was death I felt attached to

387
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,200
like I didn’t want that person to leave.

388
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
But

389
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,560
the person I saw

390
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
wasn’t like us at all.

391
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,880
Long hair.

392
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,680
Fragile.

393
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
And

394
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
touchable.

395
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,080
No matter how hard I think, I can’t figure out

396
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
what it’s called.

397
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
Like

398
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,880
it’s not time for us to know yet.

399
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,840
But I’d say

400
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,880
if your hair were just a little longer

401
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,480
you’re kinda look alike.

402
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
But just kinda.

403
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Not exactly the same.

404
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,640
BS!

405
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
And

406
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,480
did that person have that thing like us?

407
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,800
Huh? That thing?

408
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,000
Well

409
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
this thing right here.

410
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,840
A dick?

411
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Yeah.

412
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,680
I don’t know.

413
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,920
I didn’t get to see that much.

414
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,720
If I see that person again

415
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,840
I’ll ask if I can take a look for you.

416
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,840
I wanna know too.

417
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,640
Inside there, is it like

418
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,480
a stick

419
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
a long one

420
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,040
like ours?

421
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Or

422
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,240
Maybe it’s

423
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,600
flat?

424
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,600
Or

425
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Maybe it’s like

426
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,400
mysterious inside?

427
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,640
I don’t know.

428
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
But

429
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
if I find out

430
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,080
I’ll tell you first.

431
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,760
Deal?

432
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,240
Sure?

433
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Marduk.

434
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,520
I feel like

435
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,200
I’m drowning.

436
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,120
I’m not letting you drown that easy.

437
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,080
How did you know it was me?

438
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,920
I remember your scent.

439
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,880
A bunch of men.

440
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,800
Iron

441
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,640
just like you told me

442
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,456
that we couldn’t figure out what it was.

443
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,559
Who are you guys?

444
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
Ananke

445
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,960
is the final answer.

446
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,119
If we happen to die today

447
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,359
we still get to hope

448
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,600
to live.

449
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Women.

450
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:35,960
Right.

451
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Women.

452
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,520
If those three are like us

453
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,480
there must be symbols on their arms.
