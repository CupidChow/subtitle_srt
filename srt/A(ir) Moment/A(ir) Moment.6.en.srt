1
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you ready?

2
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,360
I’ve been waiting for this day for so long.

3
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
So freaking long.

4
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,640
So long that I thought you’d give in.

5
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,520
And you’ll know

6
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,880
exactly what hell is like.

7
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
I didn’t kill anyone.

8
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
I was framed.

9
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,760
Go away!

10
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:04,920
Don’t come near me.

11
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
What happened?

12
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,280
I didn’t kill anyone.

13
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,360
Why is everyone pointing fingers at me alone?

14
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,959
That day, I was drunk.

15
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,200
I don’t remember anything.

16
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,719
When I woke up, that woman was just lying there, dead.

17
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,800
What are you talking about?

18
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
That woman?

19
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Which one?

20
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
You.

21
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,160
You’re the one who killed us all.

22
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,440
That’s right.

23
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
I remember now.

24
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,320
Yeah.

25
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
You’re pure evil.

26
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Marduk!

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let me go.

28
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
I’ll kill him.

29
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,920
He’s the murderer.

30
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He’s the murderer.

31
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,479
He’s the murderer!

32
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,480
Stop!

33
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
If you don’t stop

34
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,240
you’ll be dead meat.

35
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
See?

36
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
He finally admitted that he’s the murderer.

37
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,120
You have to let me go.

38
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,880
Otherwise, we’re both going to die.

39
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,279
We have to kill him before he kills us.

40
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,560
What the hell is wrong with you?

41
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,320
No one is killing anyone.

42
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,720
Let me go!

43
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,600
I said, let me go.

44
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,880
Pull yourself together.

45
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,480
Calm down.

46
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,080
How am I supposed to calm down?

47
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Me and him

48
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,320
we can’t exist in the same world anymore.

49
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Marduk.

50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
It’s me, Iron.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The friend you love

52
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,400
and trust the most.

53
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,560
Don’t let anything control you, man.

54
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,880
Because of my stupid trust

55
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
you blame everything on me

56
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,880
and then you just go on living a happy life.

57
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,280
You could even kill…

58
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,600
I can’t stand this fucking world anymore.

59
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,720
All you do is hide.

60
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Where the hell are you?

61
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,040
Come out!

62
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Come out!

63
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Taiyo!

64
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Pull yourself together.

65
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Pull myself together?

66
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,960
If that changes nothing.

67
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,560
I don’t want to do it.

68
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,960
And what if something happens to you

69
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,960
who will stay with me?

70
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,120
Why should I stay with you?

71
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,400
You never thought I mattered to you.

72
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,280
And I’m not someone who can help you.

73
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Over there!

74
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,640
You can let this motherfucker help you.

75
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
You

76
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
me.

77
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
And him

78
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,200
we’ll make it out of here.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Make it?

80
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
You really think

81
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,800
we’re actually gonna make it out of here?

82
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,720
We all have to die.

83
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,000
Or is it true, like Marduk said?

84
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,920
You are the murderer.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,400
You tortured us.

86
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,360
When the time is right

87
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,480
you’re going to kill us, aren’t you?

88
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
Why would I kill you guys?

89
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
Think about it.

90
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
I don’t know.

91
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,800
I don’t remember anything.

92
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,520
You must know something

93
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,320
but you’re not telling me.

94
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,960
If I knew more than this

95
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,640
why the hell would I still be stuck in this stupid world?

96
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
A trap.

97
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,520
Right.

98
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,120
It’s a trap.

99
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,960
You set this trap to kill us

100
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
and avoid the blame.

101
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,280
Everyone will think you’re the good guy

102
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,960
that you didn’t kill anyone

103
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,760
that we killed each other.

104
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
It was you.

105
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,160
You’re the murderer.

106
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Copper.

107
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Finally.

108
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,160
Mr. Iron, you came to me.

109
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,040
My wait

110
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,320
was worth more than your life.

111
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Wait?

112
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,400
Why would you wait for me?

113
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,560
And how did you know I’d come here?

114
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,480
How could I not

115
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,840
when I was part of

116
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,240
everything that happened?

117
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,160
Think about it, Mr. Iron.

118
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,920
Think carefully.

119
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Why

120
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,520
are you here?

121
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,280
What the hell are you talking about?

122
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
That’s right.

123
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,000
What the hell am I talking about?

124
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,720
And why am I even saying it?

125
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,080
Because your time has come.

126
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Time.

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What time?

128
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,360
What are you trying to tell me?

129
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Please tell me.

130
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Mr. Iron.

131
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,400
You’re already dead.

132
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,840
Or you’re about to die.

133
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Who exactly

134
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,200
is about to die?

135
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,600
But you can’t die yet.

136
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,880
It’s not your time.

137
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,680
If I don’t let you die

138
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,000
then you won’t.

139
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,320
You don’t control my fate.

140
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,760
What the hell is wrong with you?

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,920
Why are you so different from the Copper I knew?

142
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
That’s right.

143
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
I wonder that too.

144
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,560
The Copper in your imagination

145
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
what was I like?

146
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,360
Imagination?

147
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,600
What is imagination?

148
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,600
At this point

149
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,920
you still haven’t figured it out?

150
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,400
You’ve been right all along, Mr. Iron.

151
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,040
Everything that happened

152
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,240
someone’s been controlling it.

153
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,440
And how am I supposed to know

154
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,280
if what you’re saying is true?

155
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,720
Nothing was ever true from the start.

156
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,080
The feeling of not being able to live your own life

157
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,720
what’s it like, Mr. Iron?

158
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,360
Forced to live in a dark world.

159
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
Empty.

160
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,200
No escape.

161
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Invisible.

162
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,880
The chances you stole from others.

163
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,720
You deserve

164
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,920
to keep living

165
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,720
to feel the pain

166
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,920
just like you deserve.

167
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,600
What the hell are you talking about?

168
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
Eve.

169
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
Eve!

170
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
Eve!

171
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,240
What the hell are you planning to do to Eve?

172
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
If anything happens to her.

173
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,040
I’ll kill you.

174
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
Think.

175
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,680
Think carefully.

176
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,880
Of everything that’s happened

177
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,560
who is really responsible for it?

178
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,360
Take me instead.

179
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,720
I’ll die in her place.

180
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,240
Just like you were willing to die for Marduk.

181
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,080
Was the Copper in this world

182
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,120
really stupid enough to die for someone else?

183
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,160
Someone like you, Mr. Iron

184
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,440
would never die for anyone.

185
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
When the time comes

186
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,760
you’ll see.

187
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,160
My time is up.

188
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,800
It’s time for me to leave this world.

189
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Goodbye.

190
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Farewell.

191
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Copper.

192
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Copper!

193
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Copper!

194
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Cop…

195
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,240
Reveal your true self now, Iron.

196
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,080
The devil disguised as a good man.

197
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,680
I’ve been waiting for it all to finally be over.

198
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,680
It’s either you or me.

199
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
It’s you.

200
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,960
You’re the cause of everything that happened in this world.

201
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,000
Being silent like this

202
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,640
is not like you at all.

203
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,680
The truth is right there, reflected in your eyes.

204
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,880
Look into my eyes.

205
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,080
Look deep inside to find the truth.

206
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,280
The truth that even you wouldn’t expect.

207
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,519
I told you to look into my eyes.

208
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,680
Look into my eyes.

209
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
I won’t.

210
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,960
I don’t want to be near someone like you.

211
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,600
Finally you spoke.

212
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,200
I thought you’d let me do all the talking.

213
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,720
What the hell are you doing?

214
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,800
I’m doing it right now.

215
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,800
This is just the beginning.

216
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,200
This pain won’t kill you

217
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,720
compared to what you’ve done.

218
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,360
On your knees. Now!

219
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,920
I said, on your knees.

220
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Bow to me.

221
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,920
Someone like you deserves to suffer in Avici hell.

222
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,200
A hundred billion worlds. A hundred billion lifetimes. Forever.

223
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,880
I told you to bow.

224
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,800
Bow!

225
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
Iron!

226
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Answer me.

227
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Taiyo!

228
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
Wake up.

229
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,400
Come back to me right now.

230
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Open your eyes.

231
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,520
I said, open your eyes!

232
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,120
You can’t just leave me here alone.

233
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
Think.

234
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Think.

235
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,400
Come on, think.

236
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:41,720
Think, think, think, think, think!

237
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
I have to do something.

238
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
Yes, I have to help.

239
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,000
But how?

240
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,680
Somebody, help me.

241
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
No.

242
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,200
When everyone was here, it was terrifying.

243
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,160
Being left alone? I don’t want that either.

244
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,080
Let my friends go now!

245
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,280
I said let go!

246
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,840
I’d rather die than bow to someone like you.

247
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,160
Whether it’s someone like me or someone like you

248
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
the two of us are no different.

249
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,200
You won’t die that easily, Iron.

250
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,760
Why can’t I move?

251
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,840
If you have any guts, let me go.

252
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,920
How dare you give me orders?

253
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,680
In this world, you have no right to ask for anything.

254
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,400
Plead with me.

255
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,240
Beg me.

256
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,800
Maybe I’ll be merciful and make an exception.

257
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,280
You won’t get shit from me.

258
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,160
The only thing you’ll get

259
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,000
is death!

260
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,560
Death?

261
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,880
The same death you handed to others?

262
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,520
You stole their breaths.

263
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,160
You took away their right to live.

264
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,440
And yet you got another chance to live.

265
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,080
The sins you created are taking shape.

266
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,640
Sooner or later

267
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,640
the truth will come out.

268
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,000
You really think someone like me

269
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,280
is afraid of sins?

270
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,680
I created them.

271
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,080
That means I can destroy them.

272
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,280
Now this is getting interesting.

273
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,080
This is how it’s supposed to be.

274
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
I love you.

275
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,520
I love you.

276
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,360
I love you.

277
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,160
I love you, Iron.

278
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
This is

279
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,280
my Iron.

280
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,360
A tear of pain.

281
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,560
It’s hope, actually.

282
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,360
If I have to die today

283
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,400
at least I still get to hope to live

284
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,640
and find the answers I seek

285
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,960
and understand what I’ve been

286
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,320
facing all my life.

287
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,400
I’m so glad

288
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,680
to have you right by my side.

289
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Same here.

290
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,000
Can you promise me

291
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,120
that you won’t leave me

292
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,680
that you’ll stay with me forever?

293
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,640
Why do I have to promise

294
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,640
when

295
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,720
right now we’re already together?

296
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,120
I’m just scared.

297
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,960
You don’t have to be scared.

298
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,760
Nothing can separate you from me.

299
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
I promise.

300
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,240
A fake promise.

301
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,360
You tricked me into trusting you

302
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,040
and then you killed me like an animal?

303
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Iron.

304
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,840
Do you see what you’ve done to me?

305
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,320
I had to die because of you.

306
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
That’s not true.

307
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,880
You fucking created this whole illusion.

308
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,960
I didn’t kill anyone.

309
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,920
I’m not that kind of person.

310
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,760
You’re the one who created this whole illusion.

311
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
That’s not true.

312
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,760
Not a single thing is true.

313
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,680
You still refuse to accept the truth even now?

314
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,040
I’ll accept it, but only if it’s something I actually did.

315
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,160
Not the bullshit you made up.

316
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,800
Do you think feelings can be faked?

317
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,000
You feel pain just like I do.

318
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,080
You feel love just like I do.

319
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,440
You feel anger just like I do.

320
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,440
You feel hate just like I do.

321
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,880
No one or anything

322
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,240
can control the human mind.

323
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,600
If you still have feelings

324
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,680
then everything is real.

325
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,960
You can’t escape the truth, Iron.

326
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,720
No one can escape it.

327
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,240
And why would I need to escape

328
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
when

329
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,160
the truth can’t touch me anyway?

330
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,280
Finally, you’ve revealed your true self

331
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,160
you demon.

332
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,360
I’m just playing the victim

333
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
letting you enjoy

334
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,560
the illusion I created.

335
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,880
Didn’t you say it yourself?

336
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,920
Know your enemy, know yourself

337
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,840
in a hundred battles

338
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,280
you’ll never lose.

339
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Taiyo!

340
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
What’s wrong with you?

341
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
Iron!

342
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
Finally, you’re smiling.

343
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Open your eyes!

344
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
Blood!

345
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You’re bleeding.

346
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,640
I created this world.

347
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,680
You’re just a player.

348
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,160
How can a player defeat the controller?

349
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,320
Iron.

350
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,440
What are you struggling for?

351
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
You saw it already

352
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,400
the more you fight

353
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,000
the more it fucking hurts.

354
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,120
You’re so damn stupid.

355
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,520
You were fooled then, and you’re still now.

356
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,280
But I admire you.

357
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,760
You’re the only player

358
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,720
who’s ever impressed me.

359
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Run.

360
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,240
We have to run away.

361
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,256
If we don’t run away, we’ll die for sure.

362
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,280
How are we gonna escape?

363
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,800
There’re guards everywhere.

364
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,840
And just the two of us will escape?

365
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,200
What about the rest of us?

366
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,840
We’ll all run away together.

367
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
If we don’t run away

368
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,480
we’re no different from that horror.

369
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,080
That way.

370
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,520
The one and only in my heart.

371
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,440
I love it.

372
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,680
That look in your eyes.

373
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It’s like

374
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,520
pleading

375
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,680
without saying a single word.

376
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,720
This is the best part

377
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,440
of killing someone.

378
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,440
It’s time to give you your punishment.

379
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,080
This is what it feels like to be on the brink of death.

380
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,160
What was it you once said to me?

381
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,080
You told me that

382
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,240
no one

383
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,200
or anything can ever control the human mind.

384
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,040
Then what I’m doing to you right now

385
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,000
isn’t that called control?

386
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Or.

387
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,040
You’re not even damn human.

388
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,040
Finally

389
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,400
what I’ve always wanted to know

390
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,240
now, I finally know

391
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,680
that my love

392
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,080
is to keep me in your evil world.

393
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,280
And my love

394
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,040
started from that evil.

395
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,600
I’m so glad

396
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,800
to have you right by my side.

397
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,480
Can you promise me

398
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,320
that you won’t leave me

399
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,480
that you’ll stay with me forever?

400
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,640
I am everything that is wrong

401
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,960
in my own world.

402
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,600
Narcissistic.

403
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
Arrogant.

404
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,480
And evil.

405
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
But that

406
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,280
makes me even stronger.

407
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,520
Humans

408
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,200
tend to cling to their so-called good deeds.

409
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,320
That doesn’t give them value.

410
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,280
No principles.

411
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,000
Only reasons.

412
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
But most people

413
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,600
just follow their feelings.

414
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,480
Taiyo is already dead.

415
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
If he’s dead

416
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,440
then his body should disappear.

417
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Shit!

418
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,720
He’s gone!

419
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,960
Smile a little, Marduk.

420
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,080
Bite me.

421
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,480
Swallow me.

422
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,520
Come closer to me.

423
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,080
Your life is yours.

424
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,680
Ask your heart

425
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,040
if you want to taste me.

426
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,360
What did you say?

427
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,520
Say it louder.

428
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
I can’t hear you.

429
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,120
Say it louder.

430
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
It’s you!

431
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,200
You created this world.

432
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
Just realizing now?

433
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,320
No wonder it’s you.

434
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,320
Did you know all along

435
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
that it was me?

436
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,120
No.

437
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,040
I never thought it was you actually

438
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,080
because I trusted you.

439
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
Even if it was you.

440
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,800
I can accept that.

441
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Accept?

442
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,840
I don’t need your acceptance

443
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,120
or anyone else’s.

444
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,120
I am my own.

445
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,600
I did whatever it took

446
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,040
to make you pay attention to me.

447
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,280
Even a split second was enough.

448
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
I know how you feel.

449
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,760
Some feelings

450
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,120
can’t be put into words or explained.

451
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,880
But if it ever gets too much

452
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,200
if you need to let it out

453
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,040
or if you want my help with anything

454
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
just let me know.

455
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
At least

456
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,840
you wouldn’t feel so alone.

457
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,040
Missing someone

458
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,800
is a kind of yearning.

459
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,680
Why don’t you

460
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,240
try looking at the happiness that’s right in front of you?

461
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,840
The happiness right in front of me?

462
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,240
Love.

463
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,880
Love?

464
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,120
Love

465
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
can happen again and again

466
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,640
in many forms.

467
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,040
Love.

468
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,160
Love without expecting anything back.

469
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
Love

470
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,800
is about wanting to see the ones we love

471
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
happy.

472
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,840
Just like how Copper accepted you?

473
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,480
And he was even willing to die for you.

474
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,560
Hello

475
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,680
brother!

476
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,680
Whether it’s the real world

477
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
or an imaginary one

478
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,960
how you respond in different situations

479
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,840
is what determines

480
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,600
whether you win

481
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,080
or lose.

482
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
My little sister

483
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,000
is so lucky

484
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,880
to have someone who openly loves her with all his heart.

485
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,800
You can never forget me.

486
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,400
Those two

487
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,240
are just a spring fling.

488
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,799
The last meal of this experiment.

489
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Doctor.

490
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,240
There’s a speaker in my head.
