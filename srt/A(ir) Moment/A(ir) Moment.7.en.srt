1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,120
Who are we?

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,040
And what is this place?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,320
What are we doing here?

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,319
Even if we knew, would it change anything?

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:11,840
No.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,376
Then why do you want to know?

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,920
I

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,560
Am certainty.

9
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,280
I

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,040
Am fate.

11
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,000
Ananke.
Yes.

12
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:22,119
Ananke is the final answer.

13
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,760
I’m the one

14
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,680
who wants to fucking kill all of you.

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,439
Because if you all die.

16
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,240
I’ll be the only one who survives

17
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,560
survives this game in this fucking world.

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,120
What game?

19
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,440
You wanna know?

20
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,400
Then why the hell would I tell you?

21
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,640
You murderer.

22
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,920
You killed me!

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,560
We died because of you!

24
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,840
You’re sinister!

25
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,680
Evil!

26
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,480
You murderer.

27
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,959
I won’t let you go.

28
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,200
Even if I have to die instead of you.

29
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
I’d do it.

30
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
You.

31
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,720
You’re the one who killed us all.

32
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,000
Finally, you’ve revealed your true self

33
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,640
you demon.

34
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,600
I’m just playing the victim

35
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
letting you enjoy

36
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,960
the illusion I created.

37
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
What’s going on?

38
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,720
How did we end up back here?

39
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
What the fuck is this?

40
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,560
What is happening to us?

41
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,760
If this is a new beginning

42
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,720
why are our memories still here?

43
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
Iron.

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Iron.

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,720
We’re separated

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,120
by nature.

47
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,920
And we’re separated

48
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,520
by fate.

49
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,280
My little sister

50
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
is so lucky

51
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,160
to have someone who openly loves her with all his heart

52
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,440
without having to hide anything.

53
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,200
You’ll come back to me someday.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,080
Please take care of my niece or nephew in her belly.

55
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,680
A speaker?

56
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Speaker.

57
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,520
There’s a speaker in my head.

58
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Speaker.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Speaker.

60
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,240
Babe, do you think

61
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,000
he’ll ever wake up?

62
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,760
He’s not dead yet.

63
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
But I.

64
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,240
I’d die every day for sure

65
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,200
if I weren’t with you, Babe.

66
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,280
Doc said

67
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,160
to give him an injection every hour.

68
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,760
And if we don’t give him the injection.

69
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,440
Babe, do you think he’ll ever wake up?

70
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
My little sister

71
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
is so lucky

72
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,360
to have someone who openly loves her with all his heart

73
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,200
without having to hide anything.

74
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,120
You’ll come back to me someday.

75
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,920
Please take care of my niece or nephew in her belly.

76
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
A speaker.

77
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,040
There’s a speaker in my head.

78
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Speaker.

79
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
Speaker.

80
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
Speaker.

81
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Speaker.

82
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Speaker.

83
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Speaker.

84
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
Speaker.

85
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Speaker.

86
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,240
You can never forget me.

87
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,000
Those two

88
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,800
are just a spring fling.

89
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
But me.

90
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,800
I’m the one you can’t escape

91
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,560
no matter how hard you try.

92
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,440
If you truly love my brother

93
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,520
as much as you love me

94
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,880
then I wish you good luck.

95
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Eve.

96
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,080
But the baby in my belly

97
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,360
will probably never get the chance to come out and see the world.

98
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,160
We meet again, Iron.

99
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,200
Bite me.

100
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,440
Swallow me.

101
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
What do you say?

102
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
Iron?

103
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Your life is yours.

104
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,800
Ask your heart

105
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,080
if you want to taste me.

106
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,120
The psychopath DNA from your dad

107
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,000
is still inside you.

108
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,600
No matter how far you run

109
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,200
it’ll still be ringing in your head

110
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,120
telling you to do

111
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,200
things that ordinary people

112
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,880
wouldn’t even dare think about.

113
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,600
I have three questions.

114
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,400
Answer them for me.

115
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
Yes, Mom.

116
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,560
If you knew that the butterfly flying out of the cage

117
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,200
would die in the storm ahead

118
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,080
would you open the cage

119
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,480
or keep it confined?

120
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,040
It depends on

121
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
who the butterfly is important to.

122
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,440
If it’s important to me.

123
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,240
I’d let it go and die.

124
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,480
Because its death

125
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,600
might hurt someone more than confinement.

126
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,280
And I want to see that.

127
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,920
If you don’t want the fire in someone’s heart to burn out

128
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,160
but it means your hands will get burned

129
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,960
would you reach out your hand

130
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,600
or just stand there and watch the fire die out?

131
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,560
I might reach out my hand

132
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,680
if I were sure the fire wouldn’t go out again.

133
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,200
But if it keeps going out again and again

134
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,360
letting it die out

135
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,280
might be the kindest thing to do.

136
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Between being a god that no one loves

137
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,640
and being a demon

138
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,600
that someone hugs through tears

139
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,200
what would you choose?

140
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
Maybe

141
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,040
your answer

142
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,920
might tell me

143
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,760
whether you still choose to be human.

144
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,840
What would you choose?

145
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
Mom.

146
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,920
I miss you.

147
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,560
I miss you too.

148
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,320
I love you.

149
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,440
I love you too, Mom.

150
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,640
I’m sorry

151
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,000
that I couldn’t protect you.

152
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,680
I believed that

153
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,840
maybe

154
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
love could change you.

155
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,240
But some people

156
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,960
were born

157
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,400
to destroy hope

158
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,480
even their own mother’s.

159
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
That’s right.

160
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,000
Mom, stop lying to yourself.

161
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,640
You expected too much.

162
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,440
I never wanted you to love me.

163
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
Water.

164
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Mr. Iron.

165
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,080
Mr. Iron.

166
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
Mr. Iron.

167
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,839
The last meal of this experiment.

168
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Doctor.

169
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,000
A special serum

170
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,560
designed to temporarily erase memories.

171
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,080
Its mechanism

172
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,039
is based on the Reversal Loop principle

173
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,960
of the hippocampus nervous system.

174
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
The serum

175
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,640
releases a synthetic substance

176
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,000
that stimulates a mechanism called.

177
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,240
Neurofeedback Inversion.

178
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,840
This causes the process of storing short-term memories

179
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,280
and medium-term memories

180
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,000
to reverse, like rewinding a tape.

181
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,160
But it’s not permanent data deletion.

182
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,680
It’s merely a freezing process

183
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,240
and time rewinding in the mind.

184
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,200
All the feelings in the head

185
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
rewind backward.

186
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,800
If this is a new beginning

187
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,840
why are our memories still here?

188
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,360
Reverse Flow Sensation.

189
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,960
Duration of effect

190
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,760
6 to 12 hours.

191
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
And after that

192
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,320
the suppressed memories

193
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,000
will gradually seep back naturally.

194
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
Iron.

195
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
Eve.

196
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Eve.

197
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
The human mind

198
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,560
is not designed to be easily controlled.

199
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Because the mind

200
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,920
is not something anyone can change for someone else.

201
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,960
Even its owner

202
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,400
cannot control it.

203
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,040
Thanks a lot, Iron.

204
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,760
Let go of me!
Let go of me, damn it!

205
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,920
My dear Iron.

206
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
I’m afraid

207
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,720
afraid of losing you.

208
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,040
Before I had you

209
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,320
my heart felt empty.

210
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,520
But now

211
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,840
with every beat of my heart

212
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,360
there’s only you.

213
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,320
If we could see what’s coming

214
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
that would be great.

215
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
The human mind

216
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,400
is the only thing no one can truly control.

217
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,840
He has very strong brain waves

218
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,320
especially with the serum injected.

219
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,480
It’s not just rewinding his own memories

220
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,920
but he’s pulling images

221
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
sounds

222
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,400
and feelings from all of us in this room

223
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,360
and mixing them into his brain.

224
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,560
Right now, his mind is filled with stories

225
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,360
that never actually happened.

226
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,240
You’re afraid of me, aren’t you?

227
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
What do you say?

228
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Iron?

229
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,000
Our memories

230
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,480
are becoming part of his life story.

231
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,640
You and the lawyer

232
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,000
should let him go already.

233
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,800
We’ve been experimenting on him for way too long now.

234
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,360
In fact

235
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,720
he was supposed to die a long time ago.

236
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
You’re awake?

237
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Marduk!

238
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,120
I won’t let you go.

239
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,040
Even if I have to die instead of you.

240
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,760
Just seeing him breathing

241
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,000
even if he doesn’t say anything

242
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,440
is still better than being in a world without him.

243
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
That

244
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,120
is the most painful thing.

245
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,600
You’re quite a sensitive person yourself, Doctor

246
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,520
to let your mind be so easily disturbed.

247
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,280
No matter where you are

248
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,200
no matter who you’re with.

249
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
I’ll be here

250
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
right next to you.

251
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,520
I don’t know.

252
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,720
What do you want me to feel?

253
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,240
Regret?

254
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,320
And why would I feel that way?

255
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,760
Killing someone

256
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,320
is just a process.

257
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,560
That’s all.

258
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,320
It’s like when you wake up in the morning

259
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,640
you look in the mirror and see yourself there

260
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,440
but you don’t feel anything about yourself.

261
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,240
Maybe what I did

262
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,760
could be called an act of mercy.

263
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,440
I don’t understand you people at all.

264
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,080
Why do you struggle so much to stay alive?

265
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,440
Even though you know

266
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,720
that you’ll die eventually.

267
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,040
You’ll die eventually.

268
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,440
This experiment

269
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,600
could be called a failure.

270
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,000
Controlling the human mind

271
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,839
is not as easy

272
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,440
as you believe.

273
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,920
But in this failure

274
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,760
we’ve discovered something even more important.

275
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,040
The mind

276
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,480
is not data

277
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,800
not electricity

278
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,960
but a hierarchy of signals

279
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,760
that respond to stimuli

280
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,640
and to its own fears.

281
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
The mind

282
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
mental states

283
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
and the self

284
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,080
do not operate in a linear fashion

285
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,400
but rather in a loop.

286
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,440
And memories

287
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,640
are the chains

288
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,360
that bind the self to the past.

289
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Our job

290
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,440
is not to control minds

291
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,360
but to design a new loop

292
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,040
for someone

293
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,840
without them even knowing it.

294
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,520
We will continue to develop this

295
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,360
because control

296
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,040
is what humans

297
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,560
fear the most.

298
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,280
But the whole world

299
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,520
has always been under control.

300
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,680
You just

301
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,720
don’t see it.

302
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
And God

303
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,560
is just another control system

304
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,199
that humans choose to believe in

305
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,440
voluntarily.
