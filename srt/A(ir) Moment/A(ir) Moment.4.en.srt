1
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,360
Who are you guys?

2
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,160
And how did you guys get here?

3
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,840
We don’t know either

4
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,640
who we are.

5
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
All we know is

6
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,720
we have to survive.

7
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,920
It’s brutal and scary.

8
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,440
No idea where everyone else went.

9
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,720
It’s like in this world

10
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,760
it’s just us.

11
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,920
Just toxic air.

12
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,880
And all that crazy stuff.

13
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,480
No idea if we went back in time

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,640
or if everything has fallen apart.

15
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,720
Is this everyone in your group?

16
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,840
No.

17
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,080
There were four of us.

18
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,640
But then, all of a sudden, she became something else.

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,240
We can’t explain it either.

20
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,760
She tried to control herself

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,760
but she failed.

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,120
She tried to hurt us

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,040
but it was like

24
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,040
she was fighting herself

25
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,080
to protect us.

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,560
So we ran.

27
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,840
If she had really lost it

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,320
we wouldn’t be here.

29
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,920
Why do we have to go through this?

30
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,440
We almost died because of that thing too.

31
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,200
Smile.

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,280
Laughter.

33
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,680
Happiness.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,320
That’s hope.

35
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
It’s the light at the end of the tunnel

36
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,760
that keeps us alive.

37
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,840
Then, all of a sudden, it went out.

38
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,080
Everything went dark.

39
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,480
Like someone

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,560
wanted it to happen.

41
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
Like we

42
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,320
are

43
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,640
are animals.

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,600
Exactly.

45
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,760
We’re being herded like animals.

46
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,800
Like

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,800
we were herded here to meet you guys here.

48
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,200
Whenever we find the light

49
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,680
that’s when

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,520
the devil takes over us.

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,520
Same as

52
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,880
Ananke.

53
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,840
Yes, Ananke

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,920
is the final answer.

55
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,240
If we happen to die today

56
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,680
at least we still get to hope

57
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,880
to live

58
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,760
and find the answers we seek

59
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,240
understand what we’ve been facing

60
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,920
all our lives.

61
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,320
And I

62
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,040
won’t regret it at all.

63
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,240
Unlike you

64
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
who pretend to be above fate

65
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,680
and always control it

66
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,120
but never had the chance to hope.

67
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,520
Not even once.

68
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,520
That means

69
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,640
we were in different places

70
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,880
different times

71
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,880
but the same timeline.

72
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,880
And we’ve gone through the same things.

73
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,960
Why

74
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,680
does this kind of thing happen?

75
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,560
Marduk

76
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,520
if

77
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,400
everything is the same

78
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,040
then

79
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,200
do you think

80
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,000
they also ran around naked chasing each other

81
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,520
like we did?

82
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,560
It shouldn’t be that much the same, right?

83
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,480
What?

84
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,640
Oh.

85
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,240
No.

86
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,640
Nothing.

87
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,400
Are you guys hungry?

88
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Wanna eat something first?

89
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,520
No!

90
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,040
If you’re hungry, go look for food outside.

91
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
Not here.

92
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,000
Because all the food

93
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,080
is ours.

94
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:53,640
And how can you be so sure

95
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,720
it’s yours?

96
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,320
Since everything that’s happened

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,720
we’ve been through the same things.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,320
Been through the same things, so what?

99
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,120
We got here first.

100
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,240
That means it’s ours.

101
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,640
Getting here first

102
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,160
doesn’t mean you own everything.

103
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,960
Got here first, saw it first.

104
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,920
That makes it ours.

105
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,320
You guys have no right whatsoever.

106
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,440
Stop!

107
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,680
It’s for all of us.

108
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,960
Take your time.

109
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,480
Eat as much as you want.

110
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,480
And if you need help with anything

111
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,520
just let us know.

112
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,920
Iron

113
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,400
just like you told me

114
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,440
that we couldn’t figure out what it was.

115
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,000
Now
I get it.

116
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,720
Women.

117
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,920
Right.

118
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,680
Women.

119
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,160
Will something else happen to us?

120
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,040
Why is it

121
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,160
that the more we search for answers

122
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,440
the more new questions

123
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,000
keep showing up?

124
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,680
If those three mutate

125
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,360
what are we gonna do?

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,280
If those three are like us

127
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,280
there must be symbols on their arms.

128
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,320
T…

129
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,200
Tina.

130
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,360
Astar.

131
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,880
Eve.

132
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,200
If you’re full, hurry up and get out.

133
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,280
Get out where?

134
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,720
Get out of here.

135
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,720
No.

136
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,720
We’re staying.

137
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,600
No.

138
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,080
Why not?

139
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,920
If you guys can stay

140
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,120
then so can we.

141
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,600
If you wanna leave

142
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,240
go ahead.

143
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,520
Get out!

144
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,840
Taiyo.

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,480
Taiyo.

146
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,360
Taiyo!

147
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,840
Taiyo.

148
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,280
Taiyo.

149
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,680
Taiyo.

150
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,280
Taiyo!

151
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,880
Taiyo!

152
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,960
Eve.

153
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,120
Eve!
Eve!

154
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,560
Eve!

155
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,880
Eve!

156
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,720
Eve!

157
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,240
Eve.

158
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,080
The symptoms those two were showing

159
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
are like

160
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,200
A mutation is about to happen.

161
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,240
Should we lock them up?

162
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,160
Lock them up here.

163
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,640
If our world right now

164
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,840
is really being controlled by something

165
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,720
then it’s no different than a game

166
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,840
because there has to be a loser

167
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,800
and a winner.

168
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
And the winner

169
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,560
has to be us.

170
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
How are you feeling?

171
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,040
I don’t know.

172
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,760
I

173
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,080
can’t explain it.

174
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,960
I have a headache

175
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,680
and I’m confused.

176
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,760
It feels like

177
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,680
hundreds, thousands of needles

178
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,880
stabbing into my head

179
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,880
and all over my body.

180
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,360
When I try to think

181
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,800
I can’t figure it out.

182
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,920
I can’t figure it out either.

183
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,640
It was weird.

184
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,480
Creepy.

185
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,440
Scary.

186
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,080
I feel like

187
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,320
I’ve had those symptoms before too.

188
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,480
I feel

189
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,200
the same way you do.

190
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,040
I told you to chase them off.

191
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,080
Why would you let them stay?

192
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,960
Ever since they got here

193
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,000
it’s been nothing but trouble.

194
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,440
When it was just the four of us

195
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,760
had anything like this ever happened?

196
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,280
I don’t think it has anything to do with those women.

197
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,800
It might just be

198
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,520
it just isn’t time yet.

199
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,440
When we’re ready

200
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,480
we’ll make our move right away.

201
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,200
And

202
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,680
how do we know

203
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,480
when we should make our move?

204
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,600
Well

205
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,440
when they’re asleep.

206
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,640
And what if

207
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,840
they know what’s going on?

208
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,880
By the time they figure it out

209
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,440
they’ll probably all be dead.

210
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,000
And what if

211
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,920
they’re not dead yet?

212
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,800
Then we won’t just lock them up

213
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,720
we’ll burn them alive.

214
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,480
Make them

215
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,800
feel like the living dead.

216
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,000
You could say that’s what it feels like

217
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,040
but we’re just still breathing.

218
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,480
That’s all.

219
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,160
Still breathing

220
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,880
isn’t that a good thing?

221
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,400
It is.

222
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,600
Being alive

223
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,480
is always a good thing

224
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,760
because at least

225
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,640
we know

226
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,120
what we’re living for.

227
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,360
And who we’re living for.

228
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,360
I’m thirsty.

229
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
I’ll go get it for you.

230
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:21,800
Iron!
Iron!

231
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,800
Iron, what’s wrong?

232
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,800
Iron!

233
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:28,880
Tina.

234
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,840
Tina!

235
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,880
Iron!

236
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,720
Iron!

237
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,920
Iron!

238
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,480
Iron, what’s wrong?

239
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,040
Iron!

240
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,280
What’s going on?

241
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,560
I don’t know.

242
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:45,920
I don’t know either.

243
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,000
Iron.

244
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,120
Shit!

245
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,600
Tina!

246
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,560
Tina!

247
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,240
Tina.

248
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,680
Tina.

249
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,640
Tina is really dead.

250
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,840
How did this happen?

251
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,840
Is it really this easy to die?

252
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,360
I don’t know either.

253
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,440
Why does this kind of thing have to happen to us?

254
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,400
If not mutate

255
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,680
then die.

256
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,520
Will something even worse happen?

257
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,720
It’s all my fault.

258
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,560
Tina died because of me.

259
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,800
If only I hadn’t agree to that crazy idea

260
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,560
none of this would have happened.

261
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,480
Crazy idea?

262
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,200
What idea?

263
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
What were you guys planning to do?

264
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,400
Have you realized yet

265
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,640
that your soft-heartedness, your kindness

266
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,960
is what led to this?

267
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,440
Now’s not the time to place blame.

268
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,040
Not the time?

269
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,200
Are you waiting until we all die first?

270
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,600
You?

271
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,760
Or you?

272
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,680
Ever since these bitches showed up

273
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,520
nothing but fucking shit has happened.

274
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,400
If you want to die, then die.

275
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,840
I don’t want to die yet.

276
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,960
My life is too valuable to die.

277
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,040
If you don’t stop

278
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,040
you’re the one who’s gonna die.

279
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,360
Do you really think only your life matters?

280
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,360
No one here wants to die

281
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,200
or wants anyone else to die.

282
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,840
If we all wanted to die

283
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,360
then why have we fought to survive until now?

284
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,080
What Taiyo said

285
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,640
makes sense.

286
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,720
Right now

287
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,800
only the four of us are still fine.

288
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,680
You saw it too

289
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,080
when Taiyo had a seizure.

290
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,280
Maybe

291
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,200
that was some kind of warming sign for us.

292
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,400
What warning?

293
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,000
You think I’m going to die?

294
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,480
You’re the one

295
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,200
who’s going to die next.

296
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,120
Fuck that!

297
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,600
Why don’t you think

298
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,240
it’s that bitch

299
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,079
who’s going to die next, not me?

300
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,000
Are you gonna stop yet?

301
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,280
Isn’t this bad enough already?

302
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,760
If you can’t talk properly

303
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,600
then don’t talk at all.

304
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,680
You’re afraid of the truth, Iron.

305
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,320
You’ve fallen in love with this bitch.

306
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
I saw

307
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,520
you two kissing.

308
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,240
And it was a heated makeout.

309
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,840
And watching you two

310
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,600
made me horny.

311
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,040
Hey!

312
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,280
What the fuck!

313
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,559
Can you stop laughing like that?

314
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,120
I won’t.
What are you gonna do about it?

315
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,520
Stop!

316
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,680
Tina said

317
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,120
she would kill everyone.

318
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,440
I don’t know either

319
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,200
what Tina was thinking.

320
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,560
Tina
While

321
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,560
I love you.

322
00:22:21,561 --> 00:22:22,860
both of us were kissing

323
00:22:22,861 --> 00:22:24,400
Why are you doing this to me?

324
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,600
Tina, let go of me.

325
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,360
I love you.

326
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,280
the second

327
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,400
Why are you doing this to me?

328
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:32,960
I’m about to run out of breath
I don’t wanna die yet.

329
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,680
all of a sudden

330
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,640
Tina was like…

331
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,240
If

332
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,440
Tina hadn’t died

333
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,880
all of us here

334
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,600
might have died instead.

335
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,200
You all have to die.

336
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,840
I’ll burn you all alive.

337
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,320
This world belongs to me only!

338
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,920
You’re all invaders!

339
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,800
Your lives are mine!

340
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,920
Mine alone!

341
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,240
I don’t know either

342
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,840
what happened to Tina.

343
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,240
We’d never seen Tina act like this before.

344
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,000
Normally

345
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,480
Tina was

346
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
kind

347
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
cheerful

348
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,800
always willing to help us.

349
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Right, Eve?

350
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,000
Right, Eve?

351
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,280
Dead people can’t talk.

352
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,440
Who do you want me to ask?

353
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,320
The last person who was with her

354
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,880
is the most suspicious.

355
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,720
Maybe

356
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,280
this was your plan.

357
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,480
You killed Tina

358
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,280
and now you’re blaming it all on a dead person.

359
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,120
Am I right?

360
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,320
Yes!

361
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,440
You’re fucking right.

362
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,960
I’m the one

363
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,680
who wants to fucking kill all of you.

364
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,960
Because if you all die

365
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,120
I’ll be the only one who survives

366
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,800
survives this game in this fucking world.

367
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,120
Stupid.

368
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,040
You’re stupid too.

369
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,840
You’re stupid too.

370
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,920
Stupid!

371
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,280
You’re fucking stupid too!

372
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,680
Stupid.

373
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,400
Game.

374
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,040
What game?

375
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,480
You wanna know?

376
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,880
Then why the hell would I tell you?

377
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,400
You’re all a bunch of dumbasses.

378
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,120
Huh?

379
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,360
Why the hell should I tell you anything?

380
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:38,840
That’s funny.

381
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,640
Astar!

382
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,320
Astar!

383
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Astar!

384
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,039
What the hell is going on?

385
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,240
What do we do now?

386
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,600
They died. Just like that.

387
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,080
How could they die so easily?

388
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,160
I don’t know

389
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,800
but it’s better that they’re dead.

390
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,880
Let’s go back upstairs.

391
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,240
I don’t want to be near

392
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,600
or even look at these bitches.

393
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,800
Disgusting.

394
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,040
We don’t even know

395
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,600
what death is.

396
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,400
Why should we fear it

397
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,960
when death

398
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,960
is as natural as birth?

399
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,480
Funny how

400
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,760
in the end

401
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,360
we all have to die

402
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,800
die alone, no matter what.

403
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,640
Astar!
Tina!

404
00:27:04,481 --> 00:27:05,800
Where did they go?

405
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,560
Where did they go?

406
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,040
What happened?

407
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,800
The bodies of Astar and Tina are gone.

408
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,280
That’s impossible.

409
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,040
Or this whole thing

410
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,000
is just an illusion.

411
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,440
I told you not to trust these bitches.

412
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,200
Are they faking their deaths?

413
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,280
Or did someone take their bodies?

414
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,280
What the hell is this?

415
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,680
What the hell is this world?

416
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,480
Born out of nowhere.

417
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,880
Dead just as suddenly.

418
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,800
Who the hell are you?

419
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,320
Come out!

420
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,920
Come out!

421
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,720
Come out!

422
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,480
Game.

423
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,160
What game?

424
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,520
You wanna know?

425
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,280
Then why the hell would I tell you?

426
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,880
Why the hell should I tell you anything?

427
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,240
Eve

428
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,320
let’s go upstairs.

429
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,800
Down here looks

430
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
sketchy.

431
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,160
We don’t know what’s gonna happen next.

432
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,280
We have to be even more careful.

433
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,320
If something happens to you

434
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
I’ll be miserable for sure.

435
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,080
So worried about each other.

436
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,920
You better be careful

437
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,480
or you’re gonna die because of her.

438
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:07,840
Eve.

439
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:09,120
Just go ahead and kill me!

440
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,400
Kill me!

441
00:29:10,401 --> 00:29:11,639
Kill me right now!

442
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,640
Let’s end this right now.

443
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,000
I don’t even know why I should stay alive.

444
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,760
Just kill me!
Eve.

445
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,760
Eve!

446
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,760
Guys

447
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,520
let’s go upstairs.

448
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,400
It’s still better than down here.

449
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,160
The safest place

450
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,960
might be the most dangerous one.

451
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,240
What do we do next?

452
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,880
Are you really not going upstairs?

453
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,680
No.

454
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,600
I don’t wanna die.

455
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,000
If you want to stay here

456
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,600
then stay here by yourself.

457
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,480
Dying upstairs is no different than dying down here.

458
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,840
When the time comes

459
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,000
we’re all gonna die anyway.

460
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,120
No one sets a deadline or anything.

461
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:21,840
We

462
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,920
don’t need to act strong all the time.

463
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,840
If you’re lonely

464
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,360
we’ll be upstairs.

465
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,120
Then go ahead and keep watch

466
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,960
since you’re so skeptical

467
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,640
since you’re so afraid to die.

468
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,040
Yeah!

469
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,480
If I’m gonna die anyway

470
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,400
I might as well

471
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,640
get it over with.

472
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,520
Fuck.

473
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,560
Tina.

474
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,480
Astar.

475
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,680
They’re all dead.

476
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,800
Then why do I need to keep living?

477
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,440
Eve, you still have us.

478
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,440
I might be next in line

479
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,040
because women

480
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,320
are always the weakest.

481
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,600
That’s why

482
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,840
women have men to protect them.

483
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,280
You’re so nice to me.

484
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
In my world

485
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,120
I have only you, Eve.

486
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,240
I need to take care of you the best I can.

487
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,640
Let’s be together.

488
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,160
There are only a few of us left.

489
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,600
What’s gonna happen tomorrow

490
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,720
we have no way of knowing.

491
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,400
But what I do know

492
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,560
is that I don’t want to lose you

493
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,160
or anyone else.

494
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,240
You’re not watching over the house anymore?

495
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,560
Fucking nosy!

496
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,680
Am I nosy

497
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,120
or are you scared?

498
00:33:06,121 --> 00:33:07,359
I’ve never been scared.

499
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:07,960
Enough!

500
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,280
Just stay with us.

501
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,440
Right now, we need to stick together

502
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,760
help each other.

503
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,760
We have no idea what’s coming next.

504
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,280
And what if those two never actually died?

505
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,640
What if this is all a setup to kill us?

506
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,160
How can dead people

507
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,920
come back to life?

508
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,160
Why are you so skeptical?

509
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,560
There’s a lot of us.

510
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,360
Doesn’t matter how many of us there are.

511
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,200
Ever heard of this saying?

512
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Know your enemy, know yourself

513
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,600
in a hundred battles

514
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,720
you’ll never lose.

515
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,640
We just need to be ready

516
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,600
to handle whatever comes next.

517
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,720
From here on out, what’s going to happen

518
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,160
we have no way of knowing.

519
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,360
Everything keeps changing.

520
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,160
But I believe

521
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,520
if we stick together

522
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,680
we still get to hope.

523
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,200
I have hope too.

524
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,920
I just hope that

525
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,280
the next person to die

526
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,480
isn’t me.

527
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,400
Don’t think like that.

528
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,320
I get it. It’s hard not to.

529
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,920
I think the same way.

530
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,920
But if we prepare

531
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,600
to handle whatever comes next

532
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,200
that’s better than doing nothing.

533
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,120
Death

534
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
isn’t as scary as you guys think.

535
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,440
You’ve already seen it

536
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,440
death

537
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,160
comes so easily.

538
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,640
But the ones left behind

539
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,000
they’re the ones who suffer.

540
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,520
Which is scarier?

541
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,640
No matter where we are

542
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,400
if we’re going to die anyway

543
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,240
then why should we fear death?

544
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,120
I’m afraid

545
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,640
afraid of losing you.

546
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,200
Before I had you

547
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,400
my heart felt empty.

548
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,120
But now

549
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,120
with every beat of my heart

550
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,800
there’s only you.

551
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,360
Maybe we weren’t destined to be together

552
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,120
but at least

553
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,560
right now we’re together.

554
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,240
We’re separated

555
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,720
by nature.

556
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,360
And we’re separated

557
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,080
by fate.

558
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,000
Can’t we just stay together?

559
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,920
No.

560
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,120
Everything has already been determined.

561
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,120
If we could see what’s coming

562
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,040
that would be great.

563
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,000
Or maybe it wouldn’t.

564
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,440
Because right now

565
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,000
this is as good as it gets for us.

566
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,160
So good that I wish I could freeze this moment.

567
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,320
The two of us

568
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,760
should have met in a better world.

569
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,240
It doesn’t matter

570
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,360
where we met.

571
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,000
Even if it’s better

572
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,760
or worse than this

573
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,160
as long as we have each other

574
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,680
that’s enough.

575
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,640
Eve.

576
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,560
Eve!

577
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,440
Eve!

578
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,400
Eve!

579
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,360
Eve!

580
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,080
Shit!

581
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,040
Eve!

582
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,760
Iron.

583
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,360
Eve.

584
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,320
Eve.

585
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,920
What’s going on?

586
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,640
How did we end up back here?

587
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,600
What the fuck is this?

588
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,280
What is happening to us?

589
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,360
If this is a new beginning

590
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,360
why are our memories still here?

591
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,560
The four of us are back at the starting point.

592
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,640
We’re not sure if we returned

593
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,880
or if we never left at all.

594
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,800
Everything that happened

595
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,600
feels like just

596
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,640
an illusion.

597
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,340
Right now, I’m happy

598
00:40:48,341 --> 00:40:49,679
that I have you by my side.

599
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,160
Can I hug you?

600
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:53,880
Marduk!
Help!

601
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,839
You can’t just leave me this easily, Marduk.

602
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,719
If miracles are real

603
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,839
I won’t let you go.

604
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,280
Even if I have to die instead of you

605
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,640
I’d do it.
