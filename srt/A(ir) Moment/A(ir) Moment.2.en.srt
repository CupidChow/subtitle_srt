1
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,160
Where were you two all night?

2
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
And what happened?

3
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,400
Why do you look like this?

4
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,840
Both of us got attacked.

5
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,320
Attacked?

6
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,160
Attacked by who?

7
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,096
Is there anyone else other than the four of us?

8
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,520
Right.

9
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,560
If there was someone else out there

10
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,360
why would they attack their own people?

11
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,360
He’s a beast.

12
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
Hideous.

13
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
Disgusting.

14
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,120
Filthy.

15
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,240
As low as Satan

16
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,520
locked away in hell

17
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,280
never to be reborn.

18
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,240
He’s human just like us

19
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,680
with flesh and blood

20
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
with a heart

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,360
a face and hair.

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,280
Like they were created by some kind of torture.

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,080
But when he bit me

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,480
I don’t think he actually meant to.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,840
Because if he really wanted to bite me

26
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,440
I wouldn’t be alive right now.

27
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,280
His eyes looked

28
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
full of sorrow

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
full of fear

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,640
fear of something worse than death.

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,240
He seemed like

32
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,400
like Taiyo said.

33
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,240
But I felt something soft in him.

34
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,880
Maybe he was trying to warn me

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
trying to help

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,400
or trying to tell me something.

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
Soft?

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,360
Soft, my ass!

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Look at us.

40
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,720
If I hadn’t saved you

41
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
you’d have been dead alongside him right now.

42
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,480
You can’t judge things based on your emotions alone.

43
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Use your brain.

44
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,720
I think you

45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,640
have lost it after getting bitten.

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,160
And between your brain and your emotions

47
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
what’s the difference?

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,200
I’m sure I’m not imagining things.

49
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,920
Then think about what’s actually possible.

50
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,680
Don’t make random guesses by yourself

51
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,200
and say he’s good because of that

52
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
good because of this.

53
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,040
If he was actually good like you’ve said

54
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
why did he attack us?

55
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,320
Maybe he didn’t mean to attack us.

56
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,840
He just didn’t know how to communicate

57
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,320
or how to handle things like we do.

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
Or

59
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,736
Maybe he was being controlled by something.

60
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,880
Controlled?

61
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Iron

62
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,480
be realistic here.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,160
Who would be controlling him?

64
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,200
I only saw him

65
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,120
you

66
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
and me.

67
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
Weird.

68
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Really weird.

69
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,040
The first time the four of us met

70
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,760
we almost killed each other.

71
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
Don’t you guys remember?

72
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
Yeah.

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
And

74
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,200
what if there were another four before us?

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,280
But maybe they killed each other

76
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,200
and only one survived.

77
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,760
Or maybe there are others out there

78
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,800
that we haven’t met yet.

79
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,080
Right now, anything’s possible.

80
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Right.

81
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,160
If that thing hadn’t saved us

82
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,160
the four of us would’ve killed each other by now.

83
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,160
The devil in there

84
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
saved us?

85
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,760
Bite me.

86
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,560
Swallow me.

87
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,000
Only an idiot

88
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,120
would believe something like that.

89
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,480
Can you just shut up for once?

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,160
What did you just say?

91
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,280
Then who else would act weak like you?

92
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,240
Not sure if you’re actually weak

93
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,400
or if you’re just pretending

94
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,840
to get someone’s attention.

95
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,560
So you want me to fake, acting like a good person like you?

96
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Not happening.

97
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,800
I never said I was a good person.

98
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,600
I’m just trying to stay alive.

99
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,440
If you wanna die, be my guest.

100
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,000
Just go ahead and die

101
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,680
since you’re acting like a coward anyway.

102
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,840
Haven’t you heard?

103
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,560
The weak

104
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
tend to die first.

105
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,320
Why waste your time?

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,120
You have no right

107
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,120
to tell someone to die

108
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
or live.

109
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,680
You’re not God.

110
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,120
So, you still believe

111
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,240
God fucking exists?

112
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
He never existed.

113
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
Dumbass!

114
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,960
He’s just something made up

115
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,320
to fool idiots like you.

116
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,040
Didn’t you say it yourself?

117
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,120
Why isn’t it possible?

118
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
Is what you believe

119
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
the only possibility?

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Enough already!

121
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,560
Why are we fighting each other?

122
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,120
Shouldn’t we be thinking about

123
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
what to do next?

124
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,120
That ferocious beast

125
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,760
might lead us to the truth.

126
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,000
Then we’ll finally know

127
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
who we are

128
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
where we came from

129
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,080
and what happened to this world.

130
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,200
A world that once had everything.

131
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Ferocious

132
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,320
but maybe better than us humans.

133
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,360
We’re no difference from Kannis.

134
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
So what are you saying?

135
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,520
Are we different from Kannis or not?

136
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,680
Different or not

137
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,200
we need to find answers

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
what happened

139
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,560
and what he wanted from us.

140
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,480
But from what I saw and felt

141
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,600
there was something intelligent

142
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,679
that fails for the smallest things

143
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
that are invisible.

144
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,840
It’s like a natural trap we were born with.

145
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,560
They’re flaws that we’re kind of aware of

146
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,160
but we overlook them.

147
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,560
Those flaws

148
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,280
will then come back to bite us

149
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,920
and drag us into catastrophe.

150
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Ananke.

151
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Ananke?

152
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
That’s right.

153
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Ananke.

154
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,400
Who is Ananke?

155
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,360
I

156
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,880
Am fate.

157
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
The power of faith.

158
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
I

159
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:56,000
Am the most powerful dictator in every situation.

160
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,280
Some of my beliefs

161
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,000
make me reflect on

162
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
who I am

163
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,880
where I came from

164
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
why I was born

165
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,400
and how I was born.

166
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,600
Was I meant to exist with others

167
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,720
or to be alone?

168
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,880
And where did everyone else go?

169
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,280
Why are only the four of us left

170
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,320
with no memories at all?

171
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
In the end

172
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
no one

173
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
or nothing is perfect.

174
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,440
We were all created flawed

175
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
distorted

176
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,960
broken and shattered.

177
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,600
Then we piece ourselves back together

178
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,239
to become more perfect.

179
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,840
While we’re still breathing

180
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,680
we’re all afraid

181
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,440
and filled with pity.

182
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,480
The only way to overcome it

183
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,560
is to face it.

184
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,560
Seek out the flaws

185
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,960
and fix them.

186
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,080
Conquer fear at every moment.

187
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,080
Turn it into awareness

188
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,000
and truly understand ourselves

189
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,200
and purify our souls.

190
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,720
Everything in this world

191
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,320
has an origin.

192
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,240
There used to be something called religion.

193
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Religion?

194
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
What’s religion?

195
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,560
Belief

196
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,800
or something

197
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,000
that teaches people to be good.

198
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,280
And what makes someone a good person?

199
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
I’m not sure.

200
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,400
But I think there must be some kind of principles

201
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
something measurable.

202
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,120
And who came up with those principles?

203
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
That person

204
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,040
must have been a good person

205
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,960
accepted by many people

206
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,880
to be able to create them.

207
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,800
It’s uncertain.

208
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
Nothing is absolute.

209
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,320
What we feel today

210
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
tomorrow

211
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
yesterday

212
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,720
is never the same.

213
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,320
Tomorrow, we might not even have air to breathe.

214
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,600
I don’t believe there’s such a thing as the best person.

215
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,160
There’s no way for us to know

216
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,680
if he were in a situation like this

217
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,840
would he really still be a good person?

218
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,320
You sound so pessimistic.

219
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,240
Well, it’s kind of hard to be optimistic right now.

220
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,840
Things could get even worse.

221
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,120
Then why not try to find something good in it

222
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,480
so you can have hope?

223
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
I’m not hopeless.

224
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,880
I’m just looking at reality.

225
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,240
Good people

226
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:48,281
maybe they’re not as pure-minded as you guys think.

227
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,840
They do good

228
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,880
just to make people think they’re good.

229
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
That’s all.

230
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,480
And how do you know what they’re thinking?

231
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,760
Can you read minds?

232
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,440
If you can,

233
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
then

234
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,000
try reading my mind to see

235
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,120
what I’m thinking right now.

236
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
I don’t know.

237
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,880
I’m just trying to understand it in my own way.

238
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,160
You don’t know

239
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,320
or are you just pretending not to?

240
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,120
The way you reacted at that moment

241
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,600
gave me a good feeling, but I can’t even explain why.

242
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,560
But there was someone

243
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
who could do it.

244
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,840
He reached the peak of being a good person.

245
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,320
He could let go of everything in life

246
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,680
and elevated himself

247
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,480
to the highest level of belief

248
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
spirituality

249
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
peace.

250
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
But

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,240
that was a long, long time ago.

252
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
I don’t remember

253
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,240
who he was

254
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
what his name was.

255
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,600
He was just a selfish person.

256
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Could a person

257
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,680
really have no feelings at all?

258
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,120
Letting go of everything

259
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,040
how can a human be that cold?

260
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
No idea.

261
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
No idea at all.

262
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,800
It just popped into my head

263
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,200
for a second. That’s all.

264
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,640
I know of someone.

265
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,680
This man is pretty good.

266
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,720
He loved everyone

267
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,880
sought to redeem sins

268
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,040
and sacrificed his own life

269
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,640
for the happiness of others.

270
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
He chose love

271
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,800
overlooked hate.

272
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,320
I know of someone who sought peace

273
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,640
never bowed to anyone.

274
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,360
He could have started a war at any time.

275
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,720
And he was highly persuasive among his own people.

276
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,320
Those who followed him were extremely devoted

277
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,200
and willing to sacrifice their lives.

278
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,680
It’s like anyone who wants to be a good person

279
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,120
must also be willing to sacrifice their life.

280
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,080
If I say

281
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,240
a good person is someone who follows religion principles

282
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,736
then maybe I need to rethink things.

283
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,040
Because if it’s someone like you

284
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,000
no matter what religion you follow

285
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,600
you’d probably end up destroying it.

286
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And you

287
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,760
you’d probably follow every teaching

288
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,360
without ever thinking to question it.

289
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
And you

290
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,920
you’d probably twist the teachings

291
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,840
and start your own religion.

292
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,280
But there’s someone above all of that.

293
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,320
He’s invisible.

294
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,920
He’s the one pulling all the strings.

295
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,040
Those good people

296
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,280
are just his tools.

297
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,560
He’s called…

298
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
Called what?

299
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
I don’t remember.

300
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,800
You probably mean God.

301
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,776
Why do you keep talking about him?

302
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
So annoying.

303
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
If he really exists

304
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
then call him out.

305
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Where is he?

306
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Up in the sky?

307
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,280
Open your fucking eyes.

308
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,880
Do you see anything besides emptiness?

309
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,880
I’m not saying I don’t believe.

310
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,800
If he does exist

311
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,160
I want to meet him once.

312
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,680
I want to see him while I’m still human.

313
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,200
I want to believe in an answer

314
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,440
that I can see with my own eyes

315
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,360
not just in stories

316
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,000
passed down by others.

317
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,640
Whether a story is good or bad

318
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,680
depends on who’s telling it.

319
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
What are you doing?

320
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,000
I told you we’re not eating that.

321
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,440
Why do you keep forcing us to eat that devil fruit?

322
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
Are you scared

323
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,040
of the devil?

324
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,120
Or are you afraid we’ll see the real you?

325
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,280
If you’re not going to eat it

326
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
then don’t.

327
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Just eat some.

328
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,480
It’ll help you feel better.

329
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,080
At least, it’s better than not eating anything.

330
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Right, Copper?

331
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Try.

332
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Thanks.

333
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,480
Have you noticed that those two have been acting strange?

334
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Strange how?

335
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
I don’t know.

336
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,640
But from what I’ve seen, I feel like

337
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,400
those two have feelings for each other

338
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,200
when they’re close.

339
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Haven’t you noticed?

340
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
How do you know

341
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,760
if those two have feelings for each other?

342
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,520
When you say feelings

343
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
what do you mean?

344
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,920
Feelings are feelings.

345
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,680
It’s not just the way people normally look at each other

346
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,760
It’s a deeper gaze

347
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,880
like they don’t want either of them to vanish from their lives.

348
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,800
I’m not sure either.

349
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,080
Maybe it’s something else.

350
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,680
I guess I’m just imagining things.

351
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
Don’t mind me.

352
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,120
Sometimes I just talk nonsense.

353
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Hey!

354
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Don’t overthink it.

355
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
It’s nothing.

356
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Overthink?

357
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,000
Why would I have to overthink it?

358
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,960
They just looked at each other.

359
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
See?

360
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,840
Even I can look at you.

361
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,360
I’m just worried about you.

362
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,680
I know you’re a good person.

363
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,360
You like to help others.

364
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,560
I just don’t want to see you sad.

365
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
That’s all.

366
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Sad?

367
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,280
Why would I be sad?

368
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,480
Well, you were alone with him all night.

369
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
And you fed him

370
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,320
this devil fruit.

371
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,000
You think I don’t know

372
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,760
what happened between you and him?

373
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,720
You felt something, didn’t you?

374
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,200
Last night

375
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:05,480
when Iron got bitten by Kannis

376
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,800
he lost so much energy that he passed out.

377
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,880
He could barely breathe.

378
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,840
But he wouldn’t stop rambling.

379
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,440
He just kept saying the name

380
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,360
Copper.

381
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,840
“Copper.”

382
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,640
“Hold me.”

383
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,320
“I need warmth.”

384
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,960
“Kiss me.”

385
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,880
“I need air.”

386
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
“That’s it.”

387
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
“Just like that.”

388
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,800
“I want you so bad.”

389
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,200
That voice kept repeating

390
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
all night long.

391
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Yeah?

392
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,360
It must’ve been the wound from Kannis’ bite.

393
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,840
Don’t you think

394
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,640
while you and he were…

395
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,760
he might have felt that way about you

396
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,160
but he was actually just using you

397
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,480
as a substitute for Iron?

398
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,240
Who knows?

399
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,120
He was with you

400
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,280
but he might’ve been thinking about someone else

401
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,160
because the body and the feelings

402
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,000
can be separated.

403
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,240
Like the moon and the sun.

404
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,840
They’ll never meet

405
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,280
but that doesn’t mean they can’t long for each other.

406
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,440
Because if one of them disappeared

407
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,760
the world would lose its balance.

408
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Right?

409
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,960
I think Marduk is acting weird.

410
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,520
Like something’s on his mind.

411
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,640
I can’t quite put my finger on it.

412
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,520
Iron, can you try talking to him?

413
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,240
And why do I have to go talk to him?

414
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,680
He seems fine to me.

415
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,480
I tried talking to him

416
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,800
but it didn’t make things any better.

417
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,600
I think

418
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,560
he probably wants to talk to someone he’s comfortable with.

419
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,560
I think if you talk to him

420
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,560
you might be able to help.

421
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
So, what’s up with you?

422
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
I…

423
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
I just…

424
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
I know how you feel.

425
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,560
Some feelings

426
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,960
can’t be put into words or explained.

427
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,040
But if it ever gets too much

428
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,320
if you need to let it out

429
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,560
or if you want my help with anything

430
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
just let me know.

431
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,120
Do you think there’s something weird between those two?

432
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,240
I thought

433
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,920
he had feelings for you.

434
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,240
But why

435
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,040
all he thinks about is Iron?

436
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
But it’s probably normal.

437
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,680
There are only a few of us here.

438
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,160
It’s nothing.

439
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
Are you sure

440
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
that’s normal?

441
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,520
Let me think.

442
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,640
Last night

443
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,800
after Iron got bitten by Kannis

444
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,440
he lost so much energy that he passed out.

445
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,840
I was really weak, too.

446
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
At that moment

447
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,640
I really thought I was going to die.

448
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
But all of a sudden

449
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,480
I felt this warmth I can’t even explain.

450
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,360
Those arms

451
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,720
wrapped around me.

452
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,999
That warm chest

453
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
brought me back to life.

454
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
At the same time

455
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,880
I could hear Iron’s faint voice

456
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,320
full of intense emotion.

457
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
That voice

458
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,440
I could hear it the whole time.

459
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,720
It was like

460
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,920
there was only desire in this world.

461
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,920
Look at the way those two look at each other.

462
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,239
He seems concerned

463
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,400
extra caring.

464
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,200
Not the way he was with you.

465
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,280
He seems worried

466
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,040
about whether Iron is okay.

467
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,360
Because if something really happened to Iron

468
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,800
he’d be devastated.

469
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
But whatever.

470
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
It’s nothing.

471
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Nothing?

472
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,720
It might have just been

473
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,520
my imagination.

474
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,640
What if it really happened?

475
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
I don’t know.

476
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,560
I can’t say for sure.

477
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,480
Because if it’s not true

478
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,920
then I’ll just look like a jerk.

479
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,880
But I think it’s true

480
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,720
because he and I

481
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
You and

482
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,960
who?

483
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Me and Marduk.

484
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
What?

485
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,120
What happened between you and him?

486
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
Me and Marduk

487
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
we kissed.

488
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
I’m sorry.

489
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,480
I

490
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,760
Shouldn’t have told you.

491
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,400
Better than making me look like an idiot

492
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
keeping me in the dark.

493
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,520
The issue isn’t whether you know or not

494
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,000
but it’s about

495
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,400
what you do, now that you know.

496
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,560
If Marduk wasn’t in the picture

497
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,480
Iron might have feelings for you.

498
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,360
You wouldn’t have to feel bad

499
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,239
like you’re being looked down on

500
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,760
like your heart is being played with.

501
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
People

502
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,800
you can’t really tell by their face.

503
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
What do you mean?

504
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
At least

505
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,560
you wouldn’t feel so alone.

506
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,840
Thanks a lot, Iron.

507
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Let’s go inside.

508
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,040
The weaker ones have to die.

509
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,720
By die, I mean

510
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,640
they just disappear from this world.

511
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,440
And there are many ways to disappear from the world.

512
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,640
That’s just how the world works.

513
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,119
If there are people who are happy

514
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,400
there must be people who suffer.

515
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,640
You just have to suck it up

516
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,200
get through this emotional moment.

517
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,680
Honestly

518
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,360
those two look perfect together.

519
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
What do you think?

520
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,000
Stop!
Let go of me!

521
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,120
Stop!

522
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,360
Let go of me, damn it!

523
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,440
Stop!

524
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,520
Let go of me!

525
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
Come here.

526
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,680
What the hell is wrong with you?

527
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
I’m sorry.

528
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,600
What the hell are you guys doing?

529
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
Copper

530
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
what have you done?

531
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,560
Why did you do it?

532
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,880
I don’t know.

533
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,640
I couldn’t control it.

534
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,280
I saved your life, Copper.

535
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Do you remember?

536
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,560
You almost died.

537
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,200
And this is how you repay me?

538
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,040
You want Iron so bad

539
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,760
that you’re going to kill me?

540
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,680
What is he talking about?

541
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
Answer me!

542
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,480
The reason why these two are like this

543
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,480
is because of you

544
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
Iron.

545
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
Because of me?

546
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,360
Because of me?

547
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,400
What did I do to piss you guys off?

548
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Huh?

549
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,520
Answer me!

550
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,560
Answer me!

551
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,240
Answer!

552
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
Answer me!

553
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I hate you.

554
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,200
You really don’t know, Iron?

555
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,560
When you act all nice to everyone

556
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,280
deep down, how do you really feel?

557
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,160
Are you faking it?

558
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,160
Or do you just not feel a damn thing?

559
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,240
It was you, right?

560
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,920
Who made this whole thing up?

561
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,040
Why did you do it?

562
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
What did I do?

563
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,440
Why not assume these two are lying?

564
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,840
You can’t even trust yourself.

565
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
You’re pathetic.

566
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
I’m not lying.

567
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
I’m not lying either.

568
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,160
Tell us what really happened that night.

569
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,400
Say something.

570
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,960
Why are you not saying anything?

571
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,920
You can’t even remember yourself.

572
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,840
Then how can you call me a liar?

573
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
I don’t remember.

574
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,400
But that doesn’t mean what you said is true.

575
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,720
I should feel something

576
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,680
but I don’t feel anything.

577
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,560
Especially with you

578
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,880
I don’t feel a thing.

579
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,640
I’ve never even thought about killing anyone

580
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,400
even if you don’t feel a thing for me.

581
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,960
But the ones who shared kisses

582
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,560
now want to take the other one’s life out of this broken world.

583
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,280
There’re only a few of us left, so why would you do that?

584
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,520
I want to know, too.

585
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,200
You two kissed.

586
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,880
You want to kill him

587
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,280
because he doesn’t have feelings for you.

588
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,480
You want everyone to desire you, Copper.

589
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,440
You brought this on yourself.

590
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,640
How is that my fault?

591
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,480
I was just minding my own business

592
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,680
but you guys

593
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,560
are putting all the blame on me.

594
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
I didn’t think anything.

595
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,320
It was just a kiss.

596
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,320
I didn’t feel anything.
Enough already!

597
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,160
What the hell are you doing?

598
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,440
If me being here

599
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,200
is just causing problems

600
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
Hey!

601
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,320
I’ll just leave.

602
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,160
Are you happy now?

603
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,360
You want us to hate each other.

604
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
You’re an asshole.

605
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,360
Iron would think you’re a good person.

606
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,720
A good person in the guise of a demon.

607
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
You’re not human.

608
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
A good person in the guise of a demon

609
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,320
or a demon in the guise of a good person

610
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,399
there’s no difference.

611
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
It’s different.

612
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,960
At least

613
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,320
I’ve never thought about hurting anyone

614
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,200
with this kid of hatred.

615
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,560
I wish you happiness.

616
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
Eat well.

617
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
Sleep well.

618
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,160
Live comfortably.

619
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,840
You and I, let’s just die together right here.

620
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,359
People like you shouldn’t be alive.

621
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,360
Hey, stop!

622
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,040
Let go!
Let go of me!

623
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,256
Let go of me! I’ll gonna kill him.

624
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,080
I said let go of me!

625
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
I said let go of me!

626
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,920
You only care about yourself.

627
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
You and he

628
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,440
are the same, no conscience at all.

629
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
He’s the problem.

630
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,120
Don’t you realize that?

631
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,200
You might be right

632
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,080
but I don’t want you to regret it later.

633
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,640
If he dies today

634
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,320
he’ll never know how coward

635
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,840
evil

636
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,520
and selfish he is.

637
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,800
You gotta let him live.

638
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,920
Let him live with sorrow

639
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,760
pain

640
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,840
and guilt for the rest of his life.

641
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,880
Why are you guys talking nonsense?

642
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Pain

643
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,560
sorrow

644
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,400
guilt

645
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,840
they can’t get to me.

646
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,680
Dumbasses!

647
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,080
You guys take each other’s side, thinking you’re right.

648
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,760
Taiyo, you damn beast!

649
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:37,800
I’m Taiyo

650
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,080
who is above everything in this world.

651
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,640
Death or whatnot can’t do anything to me.

652
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,800
I’ll make sure you know and see that

653
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,880
I’m capable of way more than you think.

654
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,680
You admit it now, right?

655
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880
This whole thing

656
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
you did it, right?

657
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,760
I never admit anything.

658
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,600
How you think is your business.

659
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,240
It’s none of my business.

660
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,240
In case, that’ll make you

661
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,880
feel better and

662
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,000
feel less guilty.

663
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,360
You and I, let’s part ways right here.

664
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,960
Just go wherever you want.

665
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
Don’t bother me.

666
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,080
Aren’t you glad

667
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,800
to see me here?

668
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
Here

669
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,480
I’m giving the devil fruit

670
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,240
back to you.

671
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,880
Whatever happened in the past

672
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,120
let it stay there.

673
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,040
Now

674
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,600
it’s just the two of us.

675
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,280
What are you doing?

676
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,400
I’ll do just what the devil fruit is trying to tell you.

677
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
What does it say?

678
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,760
Don’t be so naive.

679
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,040
Didn’t we both see the same image?

680
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,320
The image of us being happy

681
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,520
somewhere

682
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,880
just the two of us.

683
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,720
No!

684
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
No!

685
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,040
It wasn’t you and me in that image.

686
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,080
You want this devil fruit, right?

687
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,840
Take it.

688
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,960
I don’t want it anymore.

689
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,160
No.

690
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040
Then what do you want?

691
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
I want you.

692
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
Copper!

693
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,280
I’m lonely?

694
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,560
What’s lonely?

695
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,640
No.

696
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,160
Not lonely.

697
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,840
We have so many of us here.

698
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Right?

699
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:46,880
Run.

700
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,280
We have to run away.

701
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,280
If we don’t run away, we’ll die for sure.

702
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
How are we gonna escape?

703
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,800
There’re guards everywhere.

704
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,840
And just the two of us will escape?

705
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,520
What about the rest of us?

706
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,000
We’ll all run away together.

707
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,960
If we don’t run away

708
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,680
we’re no different from that horror.

709
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,720
I heard a voice.
Sweetheart.

710
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,120
The voice sounded

711
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,360
like trying to help.
This way.

712
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:43,199
Don’t tell me

713
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,520
Ananke came back.
This way.

714
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
Quick, run!

715
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,600
It’s like someone knew we’d be here

716
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,440
right now.
