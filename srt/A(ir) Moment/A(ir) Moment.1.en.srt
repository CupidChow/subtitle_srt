1
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,080
Who are you?

2
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
I’m asking, who are you?

3
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Who are you?

4
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
Who the hell are you?

5
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
Who the hell are you?

6
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Who am I?

7
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,960
What the hell is going on?

8
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
Shit!

9
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Hey!

10
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,320
Bow to me.

11
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,920
Swallow me.

12
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,279
Come closer to me.

13
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,039
Your life is yours.

14
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,639
Ask your heart

15
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,600
if you want to taste me.

16
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,119
This man is mine.

17
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,720
That man is mine.

18
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,680
Look at the eyes of that young man.

19
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,920
Stop arguing with me already.

20
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,760
Are you afraid of me?

21
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,080
You’re afraid of me, aren’t you?

22
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,559
You want to know, don’t you?

23
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,120
Who am I?

24
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
What do you say?

25
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Iron?

26
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
Iron?

27
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
That’s right.

28
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,240
Iron, it’s your name.

29
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,480
My Iron.

30
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Taiyo.

31
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,720
And you

32
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Marduk.

33
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,960
And you

34
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,480
Copper.

35
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,200
And who are we?

36
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,440
What is this place?

37
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,040
What are we doing here?

38
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,640
Oh dear.

39
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,080
Do you want to know?

40
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,160
I won’t tell you.

41
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,440
You humans are foolish and ignorant

42
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,440
lost in your own sensitive emotions without direction.

43
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,239
You

44
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,240
are no different from beasts.

45
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
Beasts?

46
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,520
What are beasts?

47
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
What is this place?

48
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,000
And what the hell do you want?

49
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,800
And what do you think I want?

50
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,320
How pitiful!

51
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,200
You don’t even know your own life.

52
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,440
And how would I know?

53
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Am I right?

54
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Iron?

55
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,040
What do you say?

56
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
Taiyo?

57
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,520
Want to taste me again?

58
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
Marduk?

59
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Are you craving?

60
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,160
Copper?

61
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,360
Come on, give me a smile.

62
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,160
What are you doing?
Run!

63
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,760
Do you want to die?
Let’s go!

64
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
Let’s go!

65
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Who are we?

66
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
And what is this place?

67
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,200
What are we doing here?

68
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,400
Why are only four of us left?

69
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,240
Where did everyone else go?

70
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,640
Or maybe there are survivors behind that toxic fog.

71
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,600
And what if there aren’t any?

72
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,560
Maybe everyone else on Earth has already died.

73
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Who knows?

74
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,640
Maybe the four of us are lucky

75
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,040
to be chosen to live.

76
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,240
Or unlucky

77
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
that we’re not dead yet.

78
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,520
And don’t you want to know

79
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,840
who we are?

80
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,160
Even if we knew, would it change anything?

81
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
No.

82
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,800
Then why do you want to know?

83
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
Knowing yourself

84
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,000
is better than not knowing.

85
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,440
I don’t think there’s anyone

86
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,760
who doesn’t want to know themselves.

87
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
Because at the very least

88
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,240
we should know

89
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
who we are.

90
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,000
Not without identity

91
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,200
without memories like this.

92
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
Identity?

93
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
What identity?

94
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
You are

95
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
stupid.

96
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,720
Everything is just made up.

97
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
How about this?

98
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,920
Let’s suppose, I

99
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,320
am a great god.

100
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,120
And you guys

101
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,120
are my slaves.

102
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Sounds good?

103
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,040
Would you want that?
Would you want that?

104
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
That’s nonsense.

105
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,800
Nonsense? So what?

106
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,440
It’s still better than sitting here like an idiot

107
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,920
holding onto that fruit.

108
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,920
Do you actually think it’ll get you out of here?

109
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,800
How is what you’re doing any different from me?

110
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
Huh?

111
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Weird.

112
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,120
Freaking weird.

113
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,600
The more we wonder

114
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,000
the more we ask questions.

115
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,560
But we keep circling back to the same questions we’ve always wanted answers to.

116
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,440
What exactly are the answers?

117
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,360
But we must have some memories left.

118
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Memories that

119
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,000
are enough for us to know who we are

120
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
where we come from.

121
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,920
How is it possible that only the four of us remain on Earth?

122
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,280
Why wouldn’t it be possible?

123
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,720
Then that means only what you’re thinking

124
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,080
is possible?

125
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:21,440
It doesn’t matter now.

126
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,800
What matter is how we will survive

127
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,360
in this cruel world.

128
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,680
Then why do we have to live in this crappy world?

129
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,240
There’s nowhere else

130
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,080
more comfortable than this?

131
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,640
If there is

132
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,520
why are we stuck here?

133
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,120
You’re fucking stupid.

134
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,960
Why don’t we go see what’s out there first?

135
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,360
What’s the point of arguing here?

136
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
Then you go.

137
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Go ahead.

138
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,920
Go die out there.

139
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
Good idea actually.

140
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,320
If one of us dies

141
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,600
we’ll have something to eat.

142
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Sounds good?

143
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Why not?

144
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
I’m hungry.

145
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,920
Or are you guys not hungry?

146
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,400
I’m gonna go out there.

147
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,160
Maybe I can find something we can eat.

148
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Hold up.

149
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
I’ll go with you.

150
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
No need.

151
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
I can go by myself.

152
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
Why?

153
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Are you scared?

154
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Where do you think

155
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
we’re going?

156
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,320
No idea.

157
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,760
Are we just gonna keep walking

158
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,440
without a destination like this?

159
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,639
So you think there is?

160
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Destination?

161
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
I don’t know.

162
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
Hey!

163
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
Hey!

164
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Are you okay?

165
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Eat up.

166
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Hey!

167
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
What’s wrong?

168
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Are you okay?

169
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
What?

170
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,480
If we actually find food

171
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,320
do we have to bring it back to share with those two?

172
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
Yeah.

173
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,840
Hot!

174
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Iron.

175
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Iron.

176
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Iron!

177
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,120
We meet again, Iron.

178
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,760
What’s all this?

179
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,480
And who are you exactly?

180
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,520
I really don’t understand.

181
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,560
You humans

182
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,520
are the most noble creatures

183
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,119
but are always full of confusing questions and contradictions.

184
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,200
And you shouldn’t ask anyone but yourself.

185
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,040
But if knowing who I am

186
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,240
will help you overcome your fate

187
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,800
I’ll give you a chance to find out

188
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,920
but first, you must overcome the rules I’ve created.

189
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
What rules?

190
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,599
They’re only as easy or as hard

191
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,160
as you think they are.

192
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,880
But for a foolish human like you, it shouldn’t be too much for your brain to handle.

193
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,360
I don’t think this man is stupid.

194
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,440
I like him.

195
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
We’ll find out.

196
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,280
I dare you to guess

197
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,480
and ask me three questions.

198
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,400
If your answers are wrong

199
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,240
you’ll never know who I am.

200
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,760
And you

201
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,960
will fall into the darkness with no way out

202
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,480
fall into karma

203
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,680
and the cruel fate for the rest of your life.

204
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,560
And what if I win?

205
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,840
Then you’ll get what you want.

206
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,760
Know what you want to know

207
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,120
about me.

208
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
Fine.

209
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,080
Why did you agree so easily?

210
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,439
There’s nothing you can trust at all.

211
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Stop it.

212
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,200
Let’s begin.

213
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,760
First question.

214
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,800
I

215
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,800
Am the first and the last

216
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,760
who creates and destroys all life on Earth at once.

217
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,160
No one or nothing

218
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,600
can escape me.

219
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,360
What do you think I am?

220
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,520
Air.

221
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
See?

222
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,960
I told you he isn’t stupid.

223
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,560
Your chance has come.

224
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Iron.

225
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
Go ahead.

226
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,880
I am strong

227
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,760
but sensitive.

228
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
I can destroy anything

229
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,400
but give life.

230
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,480
Water.

231
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,680
Your question is so easy, Iron.

232
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Second question.

233
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
I

234
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,360
Am the evil that exists in every molecule of this world.

235
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,120
I’m invisible

236
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,640
causing pain

237
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,000
and consuming every living thing

238
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,400
whether they breathe or not.

239
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
Germs.

240
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
Germs.

241
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,960
I give warmth

242
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,560
shine bright

243
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,400
burn

244
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,480
destroy everything to ashes.

245
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,000
Why is your question so easy?

246
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,800
Iron

247
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,640
I’m so disappointed in you.

248
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,560
The sun.

249
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,040
Last question.

250
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,040
If your answer is wrong

251
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,080
your chance is over.

252
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,400
I

253
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,200
Am the deepest darkness on Earth.

254
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,720
I’ve been with you since birth.

255
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,560
I am the last thing you’ll think of.

256
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,440
I am a gift that every living thing on Earth will receive

257
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,040
And no one

258
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,360
can escape.

259
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,040
What do you say, Iron?

260
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,320
Are you giving up?

261
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,960
Death.

262
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,520
I

263
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,920
Am the smallest thing

264
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,920
and it’s still in me right now.

265
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,920
No surprise a question like this comes from a human.

266
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,840
Full of gaps

267
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,640
and flaws.

268
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,680
The answer is

269
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,840
your identity.

270
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,960
What do you say, Iron?

271
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,440
Am I right?

272
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,120
Is that the correct answer?

273
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,560
My Iron.

274
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,920
It’s hope, actually.

275
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,320
Hope.

276
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,640
Because I still have hope.

277
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,560
If I have to die today

278
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
at least

279
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,760
I still get to hope

280
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,360
to live

281
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,880
and find the answers I seek

282
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,800
understand what I’ve been facing all my life.

283
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,960
Unlike you

284
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,680
who pretend to be above fate

285
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,120
always control it

286
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,360
but never had the chance to hope.

287
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,960
Not even once.

288
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,320
You, confident and arrogant human!

289
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,640
I’ve defeated you.

290
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,240
Now

291
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,800
give me what I want.

292
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,760
Absolutely.

293
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,080
The fact is

294
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,840
I am

295
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:24,560
the chaos and the beginning of the universe.

296
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,040
I

297
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,560
Am the most powerful dictator in every situation.

298
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,960
Both humans and gods

299
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,000
respect my power.

300
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
I

301
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:47,400
Am the only thing that influences everyone’s decision

302
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,520
from the moment you first opened your eyes

303
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,920
until the last moment

304
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,960
of your breath.

305
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,320
I

306
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,720
Am something you can’t run from.

307
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I

308
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,600
Am certainty.

309
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
I

310
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,320
Am fate.

311
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,040
Ananke.

312
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,679
Have you noticed that those two have been acting strange?

313
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,639
It’s like those two have feelings for each other.

314
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,400
I
Shouldn’t have told you.

315
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:56,599
Better than making me look like an idiot

316
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,839
keeping me in the dark.

317
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,879
The weaker ones have to die.

318
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,399
By die, I mean

319
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,519
they just disappear from this world.

320
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
Let go of me, damn it!
