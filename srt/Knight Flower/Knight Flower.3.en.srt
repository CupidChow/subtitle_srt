1
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:44,782
According to "Good Conduct for Women," a man and a woman are not to sit together

2
00:00:44,782 --> 00:00:47,552
and not to exchange objects directly.

3
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:51,432
That rule is normally applied, of course. But even during the ancestral rituals or funerals,

4
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:55,072
it says to exchange objects using a basket or some other tools.

5
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:56,722
Why is that so?

6
00:00:56,722 --> 00:01:01,822
It is to avoid any possible physical contact between a man and a woman.

7
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:05,602
Sir, I am in danger right now, so help me first!

8
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:06,862
Why are you doing this?

9
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:08,582
Hold on tight.

10
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:11,042
Not over there, but me!

11
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:48,822
[Knight Flower - Episode 3: I think I saw you from somewhere]

12
00:01:54,922 --> 00:01:56,942
My Lady!

13
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:02,522
What on Earth is going on?

14
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:07,822
My Lady, there are too many eyes.

15
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:11,092
Looks like they were bandits.

16
00:02:12,422 --> 00:02:14,002
Nothing happened.

17
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:16,722
Were they people you know?

18
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:18,302
The thing is...

19
00:02:18,302 --> 00:02:20,042
I think I know you.

20
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:23,962
We met at the bookstore back then, did we not?

21
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:26,432
Who is it?

22
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,022
I am the captain of Capital Garrison.

23
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,382
I just happened to meet—

24
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:33,462
What? You are the captain?

25
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:38,052
No need to be surprised by a captain.

26
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:41,582
I am the third rank royal secretary of this country.

27
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:44,432
Brother.

28
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:51,682
I just figured we were all startled.

29
00:02:53,852 --> 00:02:56,992
Is your injury from last time okay?

30
00:02:56,992 --> 00:02:59,472
You were injured? Where?

31
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:01,442
I am okay.

32
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:05,442
My Lady seems to have been startled, so please excuse us.

33
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:07,492
Hold on.

34
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:09,922
Since you witnessed an incident firsthand,

35
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:11,422
I cannot let you go freely.

36
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:15,122
We will start investigating at Capital Garrison, so please cooperate with us.

37
00:03:15,122 --> 00:03:17,372
Are you serious right—

38
00:03:23,222 --> 00:03:25,552
"We were on our way to go pray at a nearby temple.

39
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:28,482
So we cannot change our destination."

40
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:32,882
That is what My Lady said.

41
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:39,822
In that case, we will accompany you to the temple.

42
00:03:39,822 --> 00:03:42,832
The bandits might strike again.

43
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,412
Tell him, "How rude!"

44
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:50,842
- Me?
- Yes.

45
00:03:50,842 --> 00:03:53,772
One is a captain and the other is the royal secretary.

46
00:03:57,842 --> 00:04:00,172
How can you be so rude?

47
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:01,432
A man and a woman must keep a distance.

48
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:06,252
So, how are you unaware it is uncomfortable for a widow to be talking to another man like this?

49
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:09,902
On top of that, if Capital Garrison investigates the encounter with bandits,

50
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:14,402
do you really not know what kind of aftermath the rumors will cause?

51
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:18,942
I apologize for my rudeness.

52
00:04:20,362 --> 00:04:23,662
I will make sure you are not troubled by what happened today.

53
00:04:23,662 --> 00:04:25,412
We will take our leave now.

54
00:04:25,412 --> 00:04:27,902
- Let us go now.
- Yes.

55
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:30,092
Please take care.

56
00:04:41,412 --> 00:04:43,912
What a great time to meet one's enemy.

57
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:48,932
My Lady, when did you become enemies with the captain?

58
00:04:48,932 --> 00:04:53,142
I mean, you can just tell he looks like he will become my enemy.

59
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:56,072
I can just tell he will arrest you at once if he knows who you are.

60
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:58,762
Right? You saw him rolling me earlier. Right?

61
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:00,722
He has not an inkling of humanity in him.

62
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:03,792
I must never encounter him again.

63
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:08,092
You met that captain before, did you not?

64
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:09,792
Yeon Seo, it hurts here.

65
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:13,012
Over here, too. Right here.

66
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:17,372
I have leaped through the air but never rolled down.

67
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:22,342
You know a bigger problem could have happened from trying to release the bandits. Right?

68
00:05:23,172 --> 00:05:25,462
Just consider you prevented a serious problem

69
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:28,432
from happening because people saw you rolling on the dirt.

70
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:31,602
Gosh, I did not think of it like that.

71
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:35,642
Anyhow, what should we do about all this?

72
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:37,432
It is not like I can carry them all.

73
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:40,492
- Let us leave them here.
- All of this?

74
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:44,702
Offerings are good, but it would be better for the starving people to take them.

75
00:05:44,702 --> 00:05:47,532
We have been delayed. Let us hurry on.

76
00:05:57,262 --> 00:05:59,732
That could have been terrible.

77
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:02,092
Good thing we happened to walk by.

78
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:04,102
Was it not a dangerous situation?

79
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:08,472
Sir, I am in danger right now, so help me first!

80
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:09,692
Not over there, but me!

81
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:11,262
Why are you doing this?

82
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:14,572
It did not look dangerous at all.

83
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:16,102
What do you mean by that?

84
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:20,112
Did it not seem like she was actually trying to help the bandits?

85
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:23,042
Are you saying they are on the same side as the bandits?

86
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,062
That is probably not the case.

87
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:26,882
She is the Left State Minister's eldest daughter-in-law.

88
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:29,302
The Left State Minister?

89
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:31,662
Wait! How would you know that?

90
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:36,282
I met her by chance at Myeongdogak a while ago.

91
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:40,762
The rumored Left State Minister's eldest daughter-in-law, huh?

92
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:45,092
What rumor are you talking about?

93
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:54,332
I do not know the details, but she was originally a military officer's daughter.

94
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:59,362
She lost her parents at a young age and had one older brother.

95
00:07:01,902 --> 00:07:07,622
I heard she got married all alone without her older brother present.

96
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:09,852
On top of it all,

97
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:12,722
her groom died the morning of their wedding day

98
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:16,222
and was widowed even before she got to see his face.

99
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:19,282
Are you saying she is a virgin widow?

100
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:25,022
That is her story, so I am sure her life was not easy, either.

101
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:28,552
However, none of these things matter.

102
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:32,222
For His Excellency Seok, the greatest minister in history,

103
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:35,222
should his daughter-in-law receive the Memorial Gate for Virtuous Women,

104
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:38,352
the family will become the best clan in this country.

105
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:45,142
The dead and the living are both used greatly for the clan.

106
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:53,922
I heard the Finance Minister's extremely valuable drawing was stolen.

107
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:57,285
Do you know what drawing it is, Left State Minister?

108
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:01,782
I would have loved to see it for myself once.

109
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:05,222
It is called "A White Tiger in the Mountain."

110
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:08,212
This humble one was also curious, actually.

111
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:14,392
However, please do not speak that way in front of the officials.

112
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:19,102
A king must first worry about the chaotic situation of this country

113
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:23,402
where a thief dared to steal from a minister of this country,

114
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,642
before you are curious about the stolen drawing.

115
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:28,862
Oh, I see.

116
00:08:28,862 --> 00:08:31,962
I did not think it through again.

117
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:35,802
They say a tree falls because pests ate it hollow

118
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:41,282
and walls fall because of small faults, do they not?

119
00:08:41,282 --> 00:08:45,802
You must always remember that the people must fear the Royal Court

120
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:48,722
and the social hierarchy must stand correctly

121
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:52,302
for this country's fundamentals to remain strong.

122
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:56,512
I understand.

123
00:08:56,512 --> 00:09:01,132
I will always engrave your teachings in my heart.

124
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:03,042
Please rest assured.

125
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:08,982
The Criminal Arresting Agency will catch the thief soon and lessen your worries.

126
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,692
W-Why are you doing this?

127
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:20,952
I have never even heard of "A White Tiger in the Mountain."

128
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:22,302
W-What—

129
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:25,742
Whether you see or hear about the tiger, bring it to me right away.

130
00:09:25,742 --> 00:09:30,042
Y-Yes, of course. I will, without question.

131
00:09:30,782 --> 00:09:33,472
Also, make sure to remember the seller of the drawing.

132
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,452
Y-Yes.

133
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:38,022
If they took someone else's possession,

134
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:43,822
I should at least slash their wrist. Do you not think so?

135
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:52,112
Be discreet, so no one will know.

136
00:09:52,112 --> 00:09:53,372
Y-Yes.

137
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:54,822
- Okay?
- Y-Yes.

138
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:57,702
- Okay?
- Y-Yes, yes!

139
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:12,722
He was talking too loudly to demand to be discreet.

140
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:14,902
Are you okay, sir?

141
00:10:14,902 --> 00:10:17,042
I have never even heard of or seen the drawing.

142
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:18,962
But everyone wants the drawing from me.

143
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:22,422
You can leave now, too. I have no idea.

144
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:26,922
Sir, that man is Kang Pil Jik's right-hand man. Right?

145
00:10:26,922 --> 00:10:28,852
Why is he looking for "A White Tiger in the Mountain"?

146
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:31,322
H-How on Earth would I know?

147
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:34,992
How many times have I said that I have never heard of or seen the drawing?

148
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:37,292
Please listen to me when I am speaking.

149
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:41,672
Unless they are crazy, would that drawing be circulating right now?

150
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:45,402
I am sure it is hidden in a place where no one knows.

151
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:26,812
Madam, you have a guest.

152
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:30,342
A guest?

153
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:40,302
What brings you all the way here, Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong?

154
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:43,462
I hope I am not troubling you by coming so suddenly.

155
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:47,152
Not at all. Please come inside.

156
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:51,882
Your decorations are very neat.

157
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:55,032
This is your first time coming to my home. Right?

158
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:57,542
I only saw you at the Peonies Club.

159
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:00,352
I finally got a chance to visit.

160
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:05,522
Anyhow, what brings you here?

161
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:11,212
I came because I wanted to ask if the Peonies Club can

162
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:16,322
go out and join the almsgiving this time around.

163
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:18,472
The almsgiving?

164
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:23,102
I have been managing it on a small scale.

165
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:26,762
But Queen Dowager was very joyous about it.

166
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:31,792
I did not think it would be a bad idea to do a good deed together.

167
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:36,022
Are you saying you go out for almsgiving in person?

168
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,182
It is not that difficult.

169
00:12:38,182 --> 00:12:41,232
The servants prepare all the food anyway and

170
00:12:41,232 --> 00:12:45,062
I only give them out to people.

171
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:54,612
So, what do you think about coming to tomorrow's almsgiving?

172
00:12:54,612 --> 00:12:56,362
I am not sure.

173
00:12:56,362 --> 00:12:59,732
Would anything be different just because we go?

174
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:06,802
The General Affairs Minister's wife and their second daughter-in-law already joined us a few times.

175
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:12,092
The General Affairs Minister's wife did?

176
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:15,392
On this year's Queen Dowager's birthday,

177
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:21,392
pious sons, daughters-in-law, and faithful widows all over the country will be rewarded.

178
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:28,792
So, his wife and his widowed second daughter-in-law must be attending.

179
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:33,562
I do not know if the people's lives will change just because we go,

180
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,632
but we will join you since it is for a good cause.

181
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:43,582
It will also be a good experience for my eldest daughter-in-law, who only leaves home to go to the shrine.

182
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:49,212
That is right. It will be a good experience.

183
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:03,282
Sir, Kang Pil Jik is looking for "A White Tiger in the Mountains."

184
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:04,192
What are you saying?

185
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:08,642
The Garrison Commander told me earlier to see if that drawing was in the market for stolen goods.

186
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:11,892
So, I went to the art supply store, and guess who I met.

187
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:17,892
Kang Pil Jik's right-hand man was asking about the drawing's whereabouts!

188
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:19,912
Kang Pil Jik's men are looking for the drawing?

189
00:14:19,912 --> 00:14:23,612
Yes, and he was really brutal about it.

190
00:14:25,052 --> 00:14:27,502
The Capital Garrison is already investigating.

191
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:30,022
But those people are looking for the drawing?

192
00:14:30,022 --> 00:14:32,022
There must be another reason.

193
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:33,852
Of course, there is.

194
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:36,052
First, because it is an expensive drawing.

195
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:39,672
Second, because a person who wants the drawing ordered them.

196
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:43,352
Third, because the drawing has a secret other people must not know.

197
00:14:43,352 --> 00:14:44,812
A secret?

198
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:48,292
And fourth, the last reason. This one is the most important.

199
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:53,392
To catch our legendary Midam, who took the drawing!

200
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:57,402
Kang Pil Jik must be trying to catch our Midam.

201
00:14:57,402 --> 00:15:00,412
The knife scar was really scary-looking! Geez!

202
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:03,982
Your Midam is not an easy target, so do not worry.

203
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:06,562
Oh, that is right.

204
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:08,762
What?

205
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:19,422
My Lady.

206
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:24,952
Myeongdogak sent a letter.

207
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:28,082
A letter? For what business?

208
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:36,572
I know you have done a lot of things as a woman, hiding your face.

209
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:39,062
The sacred laws clearly exist.

210
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:42,852
If you keep disturbing the capital's security and act recklessly,

211
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:48,812
I will let you know it is my job to catch such people as the captain of Capital Garrison.

212
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,692
I will make sure to catch you,

213
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:56,602
so please do not appear before me.

214
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:58,232
Let me take a quick look.

215
00:15:58,232 --> 00:16:00,752
- What are you doing!
- I have to confirm something.

216
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,362
You cannot do this!

217
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:07,222
Right, I hope you will return the drawing as soon as possible.

218
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:12,722
Is it bad news?

219
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:22,562
W-Was this from the captain we met earlier today?

220
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:27,062
I knew it!

221
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:33,822
So, the captain already saw you doing this and...

222
00:16:34,982 --> 00:16:38,442
he saw you doing this, too, huh?

223
00:16:41,442 --> 00:16:47,002
Why did you keep quiet about such important matters?

224
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:50,622
If something were to happen, I was wondering whether I should go to prison for you

225
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:53,292
or get beaten to death by Madam when I have only one body—

226
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,192
Gosh, I can still hear you.

227
00:16:55,192 --> 00:16:57,512
Gosh, I need to get new ones.

228
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,892
My Lady!

229
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:02,242
Do not worry. I will not be arrested.

230
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:04,562
How will they arrest me if I do not go outside for them to catch me?

231
00:17:04,562 --> 00:17:06,482
It is a problem because you do go out.

232
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:09,762
I say this all the time, but you are the meanest.

233
00:17:14,072 --> 00:17:20,482
So, is he telling you to return the drawing or not?

234
00:17:23,552 --> 00:17:25,462
Give it to me.

235
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:09,102
My, my.

236
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:13,272
Wow, who drew this, huh?

237
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:15,802
Each stroke is so full of strength.

238
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:19,362
It feels like I am looking at a real tiger.

239
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:26,172
Are you being reckless or are you ignorant?

240
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:33,632
I am sure I told you not to appear before me.

241
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:36,512
I came because you told me to return it.

242
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:41,552
I also said I will not catch you as long as I do not see you.

243
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:44,742
Oh, that was what you meant?

244
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:52,022
Since you came on your own accord, you must be prepared to be caught.

245
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:56,312
I am not so easy to catch, though.

246
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:04,892
It will be a hard catch, then.

247
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:08,362
Let us simply say you never saw me.

248
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:03,842
What a mess that tiger had to bring me!

249
00:20:29,652 --> 00:20:31,552
Who is out there?

250
00:20:39,842 --> 00:20:41,812
Stop right there!

251
00:20:50,632 --> 00:20:52,142
Hold on!

252
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:54,982
Pardon me...

253
00:20:54,982 --> 00:20:57,472
I will conduct a quick check.

254
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:04,532
Sir, please save me first! Over here!

255
00:21:08,992 --> 00:21:11,022
Stop right there!

256
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,332
Who are you? Show yourself!

257
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:28,342
That is none of your business, sir.

258
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:30,082
There!

259
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,882
Who are you!

260
00:21:41,882 --> 00:21:43,992
Gosh! It is me, Sir!

261
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:46,992
What brings you sneaking in?

262
00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:49,762
What is the matter with you these days?

263
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:51,882
This is extremely strange.

264
00:21:51,882 --> 00:21:54,332
There is no way all of them are the same person.

265
00:21:54,332 --> 00:21:56,372
But they all look like one person.

266
00:21:56,372 --> 00:21:59,832
They all look like one person?

267
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:00,942
Who is it?

268
00:22:00,942 --> 00:22:03,112
Forget it. You can leave.

269
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:07,652
Does it feel like you saw her somewhere, or does she look familiar?

270
00:22:07,652 --> 00:22:10,562
Have you also experienced this strange thing?

271
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:14,922
Gosh, of course! Most people experience it in their prime.

272
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:17,672
This is completely normal, Sir.

273
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:20,582
Even when you are reading or working...

274
00:22:20,582 --> 00:22:23,322
- You just dreamed of her. Right?
- Yes.

275
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:26,822
When everyone in the world looks like one person,

276
00:22:26,822 --> 00:22:28,932
it is nothing other than love—

277
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,942
Shut up!

278
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:33,542
Gosh! No need to be embarrassed in front of me.

279
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,962
It might feel awkward since it is your first time feeling it.

280
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:39,702
That is what people call I.L.A.D.

281
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:41,152
I.L.A.D?

282
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:45,452
In, Love, And, Denial.

283
00:22:45,452 --> 00:22:50,452
It means you deny the feeling of love that has already grown.

284
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,322
Which noble family's lady is it?

285
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:54,592
Should I be your cupid of love?

286
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:56,792
Why you little!

287
00:23:06,522 --> 00:23:10,272
Sir, please come out soon. The Garrison Commander already went to Sugumun.

288
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:11,812
Sugumun?
[Sugumun: Gwanghwamun today]

289
00:23:11,812 --> 00:23:15,092
Dangsanggwan ladies are going out to Sugumun for almsgiving today.

290
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:19,502
So we have to be on tight watch and make sure nothing happens.

291
00:24:00,462 --> 00:24:03,632
The road is a bit rough. Right?

292
00:24:03,632 --> 00:24:06,972
Thank you all for coming.

293
00:24:06,972 --> 00:24:13,072
The ground nearby is muddy, so be careful when you are getting off.

294
00:24:14,782 --> 00:24:18,612
"Good Conduct for Women" states one must answer promptly and politely when a parent-in-law summons them.

295
00:24:18,612 --> 00:24:23,012
Do not dare to gag, burp, sneeze, cough, or stand on one foot...

296
00:24:23,012 --> 00:24:26,062
That is enough, Cho Yeo Hwa. You can do it!

297
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:35,562
Welcome.

298
00:24:36,472 --> 00:24:38,632
You have arrived.

299
00:24:39,222 --> 00:24:44,472
I am sorry, but I was only able to prepare 10 seoks this time.
(1 seok = 160 kg of rice)

300
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,232
Not at all.

301
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:54,992
I am only thankful you care for each almsgiving.

302
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:05,282
Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong, it looks like you only brought your daughter-in-law.

303
00:25:06,452 --> 00:25:09,932
I could not prepare because I got ahead of myself.

304
00:25:09,932 --> 00:25:13,302
I will provide more support next time.

305
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:14,482
Yes.

306
00:25:14,482 --> 00:25:21,532
I did not know you and your daughter-in-law were doing such good deeds in secret.

307
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:24,072
Though I know what your intention is.

308
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:27,712
You found out late but bothered to come out.

309
00:25:27,712 --> 00:25:29,892
That is what matters.

310
00:25:30,392 --> 00:25:32,752
My Ladies!

311
00:25:32,752 --> 00:25:35,772
How are you all doing?

312
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:43,632
I am the Garrison Commander Hwang Chi Dal, who will escort my precious ladies safely again today.

313
00:25:43,632 --> 00:25:48,772
I am thankful to Capital Garrison for the support.

314
00:25:48,772 --> 00:25:51,222
Do not mention it.

315
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:55,212
Sweetheart, you may come out now.

316
00:26:08,982 --> 00:26:11,012
My goodness.

317
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:12,812
Oh, my.

318
00:26:18,442 --> 00:26:23,022
She was not afraid of dirtying her shoes that are as white as snow.

319
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:28,752
She is so virtuous for not sparing herself!

320
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:37,032
She came to work, so dirtying her clothes will not matter.

321
00:26:37,642 --> 00:26:39,382
Sweetheart.

322
00:27:01,382 --> 00:27:05,372
The rumored faithful widow, Madam Baek, who is in her fifth year now.

323
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:10,282
Just like a swan that is striding on a quiet surface of water,

324
00:27:10,282 --> 00:27:15,512
how can she be so graceful and dignified?

325
00:27:16,892 --> 00:27:18,572
That is true.

326
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:23,882
Protecting one's dignity is one of the virtues of a woman.

327
00:27:30,972 --> 00:27:35,562
Mother, I reckon the sun is too strong for your eyes.

328
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:41,992
Well, I have things to prepare, so please excuse me.

329
00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:43,562
Yes.

330
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:52,602
Now, then. Until the preparations are done, please go under the prepared awning!

331
00:27:53,712 --> 00:27:55,722
Watch out for the steps!

332
00:27:55,722 --> 00:27:57,552
Gosh, the steps!

333
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:04,432
Are there any new, interesting books?

334
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,232
Oh, yes.

335
00:28:06,932 --> 00:28:10,482
These two books arrived just now.

336
00:28:16,802 --> 00:28:18,942
Mister, I am here.

337
00:28:18,942 --> 00:28:22,102
Oh, you are here? Hold on a moment.

338
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:23,632
Yes.

339
00:28:32,402 --> 00:28:35,232
Here is the book you dropped last time.

340
00:28:35,232 --> 00:28:38,672
I was going to entrust it to the bookstore, but we meet again like this.

341
00:28:38,672 --> 00:28:42,002
Oh, you are the Royal Secretary—

342
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:44,222
[I Woke Up as Royal Secretary's Wife]

343
00:28:45,832 --> 00:28:48,182
It is not like that. Please do not misunderstand.

344
00:28:48,182 --> 00:28:52,522
What do you mean? I am not the type to misunderstand,

345
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,462
but what are you saying is not like that?

346
00:28:54,462 --> 00:28:56,472
I am not the one who borrowed this book.

347
00:28:56,472 --> 00:28:58,182
Then, why do I have that book and

348
00:28:58,182 --> 00:29:01,702
where is the person who ran into me?

349
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:04,832
I do not know, either.

350
00:29:06,822 --> 00:29:08,472
Here are the transcribed books.

351
00:29:08,472 --> 00:29:10,532
Oh, really?

352
00:29:21,492 --> 00:29:25,622
Did you transcribe this book on arithmetic, too?

353
00:29:25,622 --> 00:29:27,042
Yes.

354
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:31,502
I have been wanting to read it.

355
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:34,102
I will buy this copy.

356
00:29:34,102 --> 00:29:37,592
It is a hard book, so you have to give me at least one nyang.

357
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,102
Here are two nyang.

358
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,962
It is also for the medicine last time.

359
00:29:48,962 --> 00:29:51,662
What kind of medicine costs one nyang?

360
00:29:51,662 --> 00:29:55,002
You will be in trouble if you spend money like this.

361
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:00,782
Wait—

362
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:11,482
Is that girl a regular here?

363
00:30:11,482 --> 00:30:13,122
Are you talking about Yeon Seon?

364
00:30:13,122 --> 00:30:16,712
She transcribes all kinds of books and makes quite the earning from here.

365
00:30:16,712 --> 00:30:20,222
I do not know if it is because she is staying with the annex lady in the Left State Minister's home,

366
00:30:20,222 --> 00:30:23,422
but her writing skills are something else.

367
00:30:25,852 --> 00:30:29,352
Oh, my! You are so good with jokes.

368
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:33,692
You shine even in a shabby place like this.

369
00:30:33,692 --> 00:30:36,402
Is she not great, really?

370
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:39,222
She brings out rice for the people every time and

371
00:30:39,222 --> 00:30:41,662
even leads by example.

372
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:44,122
Thank you. Thank you.

373
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:48,022
She is an example all women can follow.

374
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:53,242
She compliments my daughter-in-law for having all the fundamental virtues

375
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:57,112
of a faithful widow every time we meet.

376
00:30:57,112 --> 00:30:59,882
I do not know what to do.

377
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:04,992
What a widow keeping her loyalty needs is passion for her husband,

378
00:31:04,992 --> 00:31:08,022
rather than fundamental virtues.

379
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:13,532
My eldest daughter-in-law was not satisfied with going to the shrine every day,

380
00:31:13,532 --> 00:31:19,452
so she begged to let her stay by her husband's grave for the rest of her life.

381
00:31:26,202 --> 00:31:31,102
"Good Conduct for Women" states not to talk back or flatter your elder,

382
00:31:31,102 --> 00:31:34,232
do not meddle with dirty deeds

383
00:31:34,232 --> 00:31:37,832
and it is better not to speak recklessly.

384
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:42,262
That is not an easy feat.

385
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:45,692
She is really great.

386
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:52,702
That is true.

387
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,472
The pinnacle of a virtuous woman is...

388
00:31:58,342 --> 00:32:02,442
taking one's own life to follow after her husband.

389
00:32:20,942 --> 00:32:23,552
We should not have come. We really should not have.

390
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,602
Is something wrong?

391
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:29,202
It is a battle without swords, as furious as the Northern blizzards.

392
00:32:29,202 --> 00:32:33,742
The Left State Minister's wife and the General Affairs Minister's wife are at each other over there.

393
00:32:33,742 --> 00:32:39,302
They call them "Sweetheart... Sweetheart," but send them to the grave.

394
00:32:39,302 --> 00:32:41,002
Most of all...

395
00:32:43,982 --> 00:32:47,052
They just kill each other in front of everyone!

396
00:32:47,572 --> 00:32:50,882
I mean, what is the big deal about a Memorial Gate?

397
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:54,702
Anyway, if something goes wrong here, you and I both

398
00:32:54,702 --> 00:32:57,422
will go to the afterlife holding the Grim Reaper's hand.

399
00:32:57,422 --> 00:33:00,342
So keep your head on straight!

400
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:03,052
Yes, I understand.

401
00:33:03,052 --> 00:33:06,012
Let us get back home safely!

402
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:11,332
You should hurry up and go to my position.

403
00:33:14,982 --> 00:33:16,522
You see, I told you.

404
00:33:16,522 --> 00:33:20,022
It is because you handed over the fraudster to the Criminal Arresting Agency.

405
00:33:26,832 --> 00:33:29,282
Sir, are you nervous?

406
00:33:29,282 --> 00:33:35,762
Bi Chan, what is your opinion of that lady wearing mourning clothes?

407
00:33:35,762 --> 00:33:37,532
That lady?

408
00:33:38,992 --> 00:33:41,682
Gosh, you should never get close to her.

409
00:33:41,682 --> 00:33:46,442
She looks so cold that she will not even bleed if you pierce her.

410
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:49,262
Gosh, it is so chilling just to think about it.

411
00:33:50,352 --> 00:33:53,572
Stop looking at her. You might meet eyes with her.

412
00:33:53,572 --> 00:33:56,422
Why would our eyes meet?

413
00:33:57,622 --> 00:34:00,552
Bi Chan, you should go and help them move their luggage.

414
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:02,352
Oh, okay.

415
00:34:12,322 --> 00:34:14,732
Everything is ready, so let us go.

416
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:16,452
Mother, everything is ready.

417
00:34:16,452 --> 00:34:18,522
All right, let us go.

418
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:21,912
Mother, you must be tired. You should stay here.

419
00:34:21,912 --> 00:34:24,892
I will go and do your part as well.

420
00:34:24,892 --> 00:34:26,502
All right.

421
00:34:26,502 --> 00:34:28,192
Mother.

422
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:32,872
No, no, do not get up.

423
00:34:32,872 --> 00:34:36,022
Since everything is ready, I will go by myself.

424
00:34:36,022 --> 00:34:39,312
You should stay seated here.

425
00:34:43,772 --> 00:34:45,462
Wait!

426
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:48,982
You should wear your long hood.

427
00:34:50,282 --> 00:34:51,572
But if I am to work—

428
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:55,962
With so many people out there, how could you show your face?

429
00:34:55,962 --> 00:34:58,902
When you are plating porridge, have a servant hand it over.

430
00:34:58,902 --> 00:35:01,912
Or place it on the ground.

431
00:35:01,912 --> 00:35:03,532
Yes...

432
00:35:22,212 --> 00:35:25,132
Gosh, why is he here?

433
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:38,582
Right! There is no way he would recognize me.

434
00:35:58,172 --> 00:35:59,652
How have you been?

435
00:35:59,652 --> 00:36:01,912
Well, every day is the same.

436
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:05,062
I do transcriptions and serve My Lady.

437
00:36:06,342 --> 00:36:07,432
What about you, Grand Merchant?

438
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,392
Things are the same for me, too.

439
00:36:09,392 --> 00:36:13,502
I fix the troubles that My Lady caused at my merchandising business.

440
00:36:15,722 --> 00:36:19,432
The 900 nyang you entrusted to me last time has made 50 nyang more.

441
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:22,552
Since when did I check those things?

442
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,052
This is the 20 nyang I saved this month.

443
00:36:29,052 --> 00:36:32,695
Grand Merchant, please invest it and create more profit.

444
00:36:32,695 --> 00:36:35,802
You could have bought two tile-roofed houses in Hanyang already.

445
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:40,512
Someone who is good at math like you should run our business.

446
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:45,852
Do not tell Lady yet about this.

447
00:36:47,022 --> 00:36:50,092
Still, do you not think it is better to tell her?

448
00:36:50,092 --> 00:36:52,552
It is not like Lady purchased you as a slave,

449
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:55,132
and you can leave if you so desire.

450
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:57,572
Why would I need a house of my own?

451
00:36:57,572 --> 00:37:00,762
It is not like Lady can come whenever she wants.

452
00:37:08,932 --> 00:37:11,802
All right, get in line.

453
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:18,892
Gosh, my goodness.

454
00:37:33,412 --> 00:37:36,232
Gosh, so uncomfortable. How do I work wearing this?

455
00:37:36,232 --> 00:37:37,732
Give it to me.

456
00:37:37,732 --> 00:37:39,832
All right, get in line.

457
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:41,732
Gosh, seriously.

458
00:37:41,732 --> 00:37:44,052
She would succeed at anything.

459
00:37:48,912 --> 00:37:50,802
All right, take this.

460
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:54,482
I gave you a lot. There are people behind you, too.

461
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:56,492
Come on, give me more!

462
00:37:56,492 --> 00:37:58,812
Give me some, too!

463
00:38:13,852 --> 00:38:17,212
Please give me a bit more.

464
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,952
Next.

465
00:38:21,642 --> 00:38:23,682
Come over here.

466
00:38:25,962 --> 00:38:28,362
You have to give according to the set amount.

467
00:38:29,462 --> 00:38:31,612
All we can give them is porridge.

468
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:33,882
Are you saying we should be stingy with even this?

469
00:38:33,882 --> 00:38:37,582
If we give them like that, there will be those who will not get any.

470
00:38:44,432 --> 00:38:46,142
All right, get in line.

471
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:47,492
Will it not run out?

472
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,312
Do not worry and wait.

473
00:38:49,312 --> 00:38:50,902
I am dying of hunger.

474
00:38:50,922 --> 00:38:53,472
- Get in line, get in line!
- Sook.

475
00:38:53,472 --> 00:38:56,672
Find my Sook, please.

476
00:38:57,152 --> 00:38:59,872
Goodness, Sook.

477
00:38:59,872 --> 00:39:01,782
Have you seen my granddaughter?

478
00:39:01,782 --> 00:39:03,742
My granddaughter disappeared...

479
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:05,192
Your granddaughter?

480
00:39:05,192 --> 00:39:07,982
Gosh, what do I do?

481
00:39:09,082 --> 00:39:12,532
Find my granddaughter...

482
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:14,502
Goodness, Sook...

483
00:39:14,502 --> 00:39:16,612
Do not worry about her.

484
00:39:16,612 --> 00:39:20,592
It would not be strange at all for someone to die here.

485
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:23,812
Or maybe life was too hard, so she ran away.

486
00:39:25,962 --> 00:39:28,432
She whined about how hungry she was yesterday.

487
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,972
That grandma probably did not even get to eat anything.

488
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:34,322
My goodness, what do we do?

489
00:39:34,322 --> 00:39:36,922
She even lost her baby...

490
00:39:38,092 --> 00:39:39,912
Eat slowly.

491
00:39:40,562 --> 00:39:42,692
Oh, it's food!

492
00:40:04,332 --> 00:40:09,282
Your Majesty, did your fever subside a bit?

493
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:12,612
My head still hurts and my stomach is queasy,

494
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:15,772
but since I took the tonic, it should subside soon.

495
00:40:15,772 --> 00:40:18,332
It has already been 15 years.

496
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:21,332
Is it that hard for you to bear?

497
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:24,162
It feels like I have forgotten all about it,

498
00:40:24,162 --> 00:40:27,992
but just when I feel I am over it, I cannot sleep because of nightmares.

499
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:34,782
My apparent weakness must seem so pathetic to you.

500
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:42,022
Well, I also lost my adult son to death.

501
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,632
How could I not know that sorrow?

502
00:40:44,632 --> 00:40:50,682
I have caused you to feel sorrow as well.

503
00:40:51,872 --> 00:40:57,312
Though I understand how you must feel since you were full of filial piety from youth,

504
00:40:57,312 --> 00:40:59,682
but if you stay bedridden too long,

505
00:40:59,682 --> 00:41:03,202
there will be much talk.

506
00:41:03,202 --> 00:41:06,992
Even if I were to handle all of the affairs of the court,

507
00:41:06,992 --> 00:41:12,602
you do need to show your face there, Your Majesty.

508
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:19,412
It appears I am always just a burden to you, Left State Minister.

509
00:41:19,412 --> 00:41:22,372
No, no! Do not think that way.

510
00:41:22,372 --> 00:41:27,102
I will serve you faithfully by your side, Your Majesty,

511
00:41:27,102 --> 00:41:34,342
so if you just work hard, I am sure you will become a benevolent king.

512
00:41:36,342 --> 00:41:38,712
I understand.

513
00:41:39,252 --> 00:41:42,782
Then, you should rest up today,

514
00:41:42,782 --> 00:41:45,922
and you should come to the Royal Council Hall tomorrow.

515
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:48,552
I fully understand.

516
00:41:48,552 --> 00:41:52,022
I will leave now.

517
00:41:56,422 --> 00:42:01,442
Your Majesty, the Royal Secretary of Defense is here.

518
00:42:01,442 --> 00:42:03,772
Have him enter.

519
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:26,682
You look exhausted, Your Majesty.

520
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:32,672
Thanks to the Left State Minister's excessive worry,

521
00:42:32,672 --> 00:42:36,382
I have used up all my energy for today.

522
00:42:36,382 --> 00:42:40,362
You have dealt with it every day for decades. Why are you having a hard time now?

523
00:42:40,362 --> 00:42:43,092
It is hard because I deal with it every day!

524
00:42:43,972 --> 00:42:45,472
Gosh!

525
00:42:46,452 --> 00:42:50,692
I heard your younger brother is in charge of investigating the theft of the Finance Minister's drawing.

526
00:42:50,692 --> 00:42:54,102
I did not hear about that yet.

527
00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:56,762
How did you know about that?

528
00:42:56,762 --> 00:42:58,442
I am the king, after all.

529
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:02,022
Do you think you are my only ears out there?

530
00:43:02,022 --> 00:43:05,222
But if he succeeds in finding the drawing,

531
00:43:05,222 --> 00:43:08,622
would he not be leaving the Capital Garrison and entering the court?

532
00:43:08,632 --> 00:43:14,362
Your Majesty, it appears you really want to see me shrivel up and die.

533
00:43:15,422 --> 00:43:17,672
Look here, Yoon Hak.

534
00:43:17,672 --> 00:43:22,262
Even though you try to distance yourself from your younger brother out of concern,

535
00:43:22,262 --> 00:43:25,282
you cannot avoid everything.

536
00:43:25,282 --> 00:43:29,112
- Your Majesty...
- If that is fate,

537
00:43:29,112 --> 00:43:32,092
there is nothing you can do.

538
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:36,582
Just like how I am my father's son,

539
00:43:37,302 --> 00:43:39,182
that is the same for him.

540
00:43:41,762 --> 00:43:47,872
I would like the events of that day to be a passing dream for my younger brother.

541
00:43:49,122 --> 00:43:51,102
A dream, you say...

542
00:43:52,842 --> 00:43:57,992
Perhaps I have dreamed a dream as well.

543
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:02,922
I have chased them for 15 years, and yet I could not find any corroborative evidence,

544
00:44:02,922 --> 00:44:05,862
so perhaps I have misunderstood

545
00:44:05,862 --> 00:44:09,772
my father's death from the start.

546
00:44:10,742 --> 00:44:16,692
Your Majesty, we have not found the whereabouts of all those who disappeared that day.

547
00:44:16,692 --> 00:44:18,732
I am sure we will hear some news soon.

548
00:44:18,732 --> 00:44:22,842
Please stay strong and wait a little longer.

549
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:24,912
All right.

550
00:44:29,552 --> 00:44:33,022
I am grateful to have you.

551
00:44:33,022 --> 00:44:34,892
No, Sire.

552
00:44:42,632 --> 00:44:43,922
We are not starving today.

553
00:44:43,922 --> 00:44:46,972
I know, right? It has been so long!

554
00:44:46,972 --> 00:44:48,242
Be careful!

555
00:44:48,242 --> 00:44:50,452
My goodness.

556
00:44:50,452 --> 00:44:52,092
Eat up, my son.

557
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:53,892
Food always comes first.

558
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:57,122
It has been so long since we ate like this.

559
00:44:57,122 --> 00:45:02,032
It would not be strange at all for someone to die here.

560
00:45:03,312 --> 00:45:06,232
Or maybe life was too hard, so she ran away.

561
00:45:06,232 --> 00:45:08,772
Goodness, Sook...

562
00:45:09,672 --> 00:45:13,232
Where did you go?

563
00:45:13,232 --> 00:45:17,002
Grandmother, you were not able to eat anything today. Right?

564
00:45:22,082 --> 00:45:23,842
Grandmother!

565
00:46:05,872 --> 00:46:09,062
It is dangerous. Hurry up and get out.

566
00:46:10,222 --> 00:46:12,012
Hurry!

567
00:46:40,352 --> 00:46:42,362
Goodness...

568
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:58,372
Let me take a look at you. Are you all right?

569
00:47:01,122 --> 00:47:03,732
What happened here?

570
00:47:07,542 --> 00:47:09,922
What have you done?

571
00:47:09,922 --> 00:47:13,962
I told you over and over to watch your actions!

572
00:47:15,712 --> 00:47:17,262
Are you all right?

573
00:47:17,262 --> 00:47:18,632
I am all right.

574
00:47:18,632 --> 00:47:21,682
The roof suddenly collapsed.

575
00:47:21,682 --> 00:47:23,762
Goodness.

576
00:47:25,752 --> 00:47:28,072
My gosh...

577
00:47:30,872 --> 00:47:35,552
You have got quite an amazing daughter-in-law.

578
00:47:36,232 --> 00:47:43,542
She demonstrated how she risked danger to save a weak old lady.

579
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:47,902
Is she not a good example for many women around?

580
00:47:50,822 --> 00:47:55,822
I am sure Queen Dowager would greatly praise her.

581
00:47:59,722 --> 00:48:01,305
Are you all right?

582
00:48:01,305 --> 00:48:03,195
Yes...

583
00:48:05,472 --> 00:48:06,962
Let us go now.

584
00:48:06,962 --> 00:48:09,062
Yes, Mother.

585
00:48:10,862 --> 00:48:13,062
All right.

586
00:48:31,966 --> 00:48:33,346
What is the matter?

587
00:48:33,346 --> 00:48:35,956
One of the heads escaped.

588
00:48:37,556 --> 00:48:41,336
- What!
- She was brought in from near Sugumun.

589
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:43,606
What do you even do right after getting fed?

590
00:48:43,606 --> 00:48:45,936
- I am sorry.
- You always say you are sorry!

591
00:48:45,936 --> 00:48:48,706
You keep saying it with that mouth of yours.

592
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:54,706
How many times did I say everything must go without any mistakes?

593
00:48:54,706 --> 00:48:56,886
She could not have gotten too far.

594
00:48:56,886 --> 00:48:59,526
I will go catch her right away and bring her back.

595
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:05,306
Geez...

596
00:49:42,936 --> 00:49:44,876
Brother!

597
00:49:46,226 --> 00:49:49,116
What do you do going around that your entire body is full of bruises?

598
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:50,396
It is nothing.

599
00:49:50,396 --> 00:49:52,756
How is this nothing?

600
00:49:57,346 --> 00:50:01,706
How could a military officer not be able to take care of his own body?

601
00:50:03,336 --> 00:50:07,506
Well, I heard you are looking for the Finance Minister's stolen drawing.

602
00:50:07,506 --> 00:50:12,776
Seeing how you know about it as well, Brother, I guess that drawing is quite valuable.

603
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:15,476
I have found the drawing, so I should return it to him tomorrow.

604
00:50:15,476 --> 00:50:17,766
Did you catch the thief?

605
00:50:18,606 --> 00:50:24,766
I, too, want to see the face of the one who jumped the wall of the Finance Minister's house.

606
00:50:25,506 --> 00:50:30,346
I was unable to see his face, either.

607
00:50:30,346 --> 00:50:33,556
A thief you were not able to catch?

608
00:50:33,556 --> 00:50:36,206
What an unusual guy he must be.

609
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,866
I wonder which walls he will jump over next.

610
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:43,756
All right.

611
00:50:54,396 --> 00:50:56,646
Do not work too hard.

612
00:50:56,646 --> 00:50:59,216
Do not get too involved, nor be too visible.

613
00:50:59,216 --> 00:51:01,696
Many officials live just fine doing their jobs.

614
00:51:01,696 --> 00:51:03,806
Brother...

615
00:51:03,806 --> 00:51:06,086
Just live like that.

616
00:51:09,326 --> 00:51:13,926
If I had not survived at your house back then, Brother,

617
00:51:14,956 --> 00:51:17,606
and became Park Su Ho...

618
00:51:19,126 --> 00:51:22,986
If I had not forgotten what happened that day,

619
00:51:23,966 --> 00:51:30,356
would it have been okay for me to live a bit more proactive life?

620
00:51:34,095 --> 00:51:36,826
I cannot guarantee that.

621
00:51:36,826 --> 00:51:38,696
Perhaps...

622
00:51:39,616 --> 00:51:45,396
you would have lived as a womanizer.

623
00:51:48,196 --> 00:51:50,386
I should go now.

624
00:51:54,836 --> 00:51:57,036
You should eat your meals on time.

625
00:51:57,036 --> 00:51:58,636
Yes.

626
00:51:59,606 --> 00:52:01,786
Get home safely.

627
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:13,655
[Rest in Peace, Seok Jeong Ji]

628
00:52:15,496 --> 00:52:18,056
Are you not hungry?

629
00:52:18,056 --> 00:52:20,856
My Lady, are you hungry?

630
00:52:23,546 --> 00:52:26,646
Not me. I wondered if ghosts get hungry, too.

631
00:52:26,646 --> 00:52:31,006
Ghosts? If Madam heard you, she would freak out!

632
00:52:31,956 --> 00:52:36,056
I get scolded every day. What is the big deal?

633
00:52:37,376 --> 00:52:39,376
What is the matter?

634
00:52:39,376 --> 00:52:43,456
Why are you speaking as if you have given up on everything?

635
00:52:45,146 --> 00:52:51,196
Yeon Seon, what do you think is the most important thing in the world?

636
00:52:51,196 --> 00:52:52,186
Money.

637
00:52:52,186 --> 00:52:55,026
I should not have asked you that, I suppose.

638
00:52:55,026 --> 00:52:57,546
What about you, My Lady?

639
00:52:57,546 --> 00:53:01,876
You have been with me for 12 years, yet you still do not know?

640
00:53:01,876 --> 00:53:06,536
They say you can look deep into water but barely into a person's heart.

641
00:53:06,536 --> 00:53:10,546
You say eating three meals a day is the most important

642
00:53:10,546 --> 00:53:13,426
but you treat your life as less valuable than food

643
00:53:13,426 --> 00:53:17,036
to give medicine to an old man in the East,

644
00:53:17,036 --> 00:53:20,066
to provide a place to sleep for a homeless child in the West,

645
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:22,946
and to help a fugitive slave escape in the South.

646
00:53:22,946 --> 00:53:25,776
So how could I understand you?

647
00:53:25,776 --> 00:53:27,576
Why did you leave out the North?

648
00:53:27,576 --> 00:53:30,386
The North is here in Bukchon.

649
00:53:30,386 --> 00:53:35,696
You even worry about the meals of the ghost of your husband, whose face you have never seen.

650
00:53:35,696 --> 00:53:38,146
Loyal Wife Cho.

651
00:53:38,146 --> 00:53:40,666
You are quite good.

652
00:53:41,796 --> 00:53:46,126
So, who are you worried about today?

653
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:52,906
People were grabbing their starving stomachs and barely getting in line,

654
00:53:52,906 --> 00:53:59,256
yet I was handing out a measly bowl of porridge and daintily walking around with a long hood around my face.

655
00:54:00,586 --> 00:54:04,126
How silly I must have looked.

656
00:54:04,126 --> 00:54:08,276
I am worrying about how pathetic I was today.

657
00:54:08,276 --> 00:54:11,736
You cannot help everyone, My Lady.

658
00:54:11,736 --> 00:54:14,136
That is something even the king cannot do.

659
00:54:14,136 --> 00:54:17,156
And I think you forgot it because it was a long time ago,

660
00:54:17,156 --> 00:54:20,546
but I would have died a long time ago if it was not for you.

661
00:54:20,546 --> 00:54:24,395
Back then, on the first day you left the house, My Lady...

662
00:54:33,126 --> 00:54:37,206
You are right. That day was really tough.

663
00:54:37,696 --> 00:54:41,806
My life of having to weep all the time despite not being sad

664
00:54:41,806 --> 00:54:45,336
seemed so sad and pitiful.

665
00:54:46,636 --> 00:54:48,896
I was only 20 years old.

666
00:54:48,896 --> 00:54:53,766
At that moment, I gained a sliver of courage.

667
00:54:53,766 --> 00:54:59,036
The courage to jump the walls and run away without looking back.

668
00:55:04,966 --> 00:55:05,986
You better not tell your brother!

669
00:55:05,986 --> 00:55:10,776
It so happened that you found me barely alive on the street.

670
00:55:10,776 --> 00:55:12,716
Who are you over there!

671
00:55:12,716 --> 00:55:14,756
Who the hell is she?

672
00:55:14,756 --> 00:55:16,596
What are doing?

673
00:55:18,306 --> 00:55:20,206
Run! Run!

674
00:55:23,496 --> 00:55:26,816
Are you okay? Wake up!

675
00:55:29,736 --> 00:55:31,626
Do you want some?

676
00:55:41,436 --> 00:55:43,946
- You could not abandon me on the street,
- It is okay.

677
00:55:43,946 --> 00:55:46,556
but you could not run away with me,

678
00:55:46,556 --> 00:55:49,326
so you came back to this house.

679
00:55:50,776 --> 00:55:53,096
This is yours, Yeon Seon.

680
00:55:55,946 --> 00:55:58,256
What use would it be for me to learn to read?

681
00:55:58,256 --> 00:56:00,076
Of course, it would be useful.

682
00:56:00,076 --> 00:56:04,446
You need to know how to read to expand your view of the world.

683
00:56:15,866 --> 00:56:19,036
Why? Is it not going well?

684
00:56:19,706 --> 00:56:22,556
For every piece of embroidered cloth, I will give you one nyang.

685
00:56:22,556 --> 00:56:25,156
You feed me three meals a day, My Lady.

686
00:56:25,156 --> 00:56:27,906
What is the point of me having money?

687
00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:33,406
You will be able to do a lot more with it, even when I am not with you someday.

688
00:56:42,896 --> 00:56:47,026
My Lady, you are doing what you can.

689
00:56:47,906 --> 00:56:49,616
Yes.

690
00:56:49,616 --> 00:56:51,896
Thank you for consoling me.

691
00:56:52,486 --> 00:56:55,416
It must have been a long day for you. Please go down and rest.

692
00:56:55,416 --> 00:56:59,816
What you need to worry about is Madam waiting for you tomorrow.

693
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:00,896
What?

694
00:57:00,896 --> 00:57:04,526
You have your mother-in-law to deal with tomorrow.

695
00:57:04,526 --> 00:57:06,116
- You always screw it all up at the end—
- That is your reality, My Lady.

696
00:57:06,116 --> 00:57:08,645
- You always screw it all up at the end—
- That is your reality, My Lady.

697
00:57:09,756 --> 00:57:11,936
Yeon Seon.

698
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:16,976
When I close my eyes, it looks like my future.

699
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:19,346
I can see nothing.

700
00:57:19,346 --> 00:57:21,576
Nothing at all.

701
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:26,936
Have you seen my granddaughter?

702
00:57:26,936 --> 00:57:30,656
My granddaughter disappeared...

703
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,046
I must go out.

704
00:57:32,046 --> 00:57:33,846
Where are you going to go?

705
00:57:33,846 --> 00:57:36,476
That poor grandmother weighs on my heart.

706
00:57:36,476 --> 00:57:39,126
Her granddaughter went missing, and then her house also collapsed.

707
00:57:39,126 --> 00:57:41,666
She probably has nowhere to sleep.

708
00:57:48,136 --> 00:57:51,126
[Almsgiving]

709
00:57:51,126 --> 00:57:53,256
Gosh, darn it.

710
00:57:54,816 --> 00:57:56,706
Damn it.

711
00:57:58,436 --> 00:58:00,766
What is this!

712
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:05,396
Is all that rice that was here gone?

713
00:58:05,396 --> 00:58:09,256
You saw the line before! They probably ate it all!

714
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:14,296
My wife is pregnant, yet she has not had anything to eat...

715
00:58:14,296 --> 00:58:17,106
We will have to wait until the next almsgiving.

716
00:58:17,106 --> 00:58:20,016
Goodness, do you think it is even made with proper rice?

717
00:58:20,016 --> 00:58:24,096
It is probably full of dirt and pebbles!

718
00:58:28,186 --> 00:58:29,636
Over there.

719
00:58:29,636 --> 00:58:31,046
Is that rice?

720
00:58:31,046 --> 00:58:32,116
- Rice?
- Rice?

721
00:58:32,116 --> 00:58:34,076
W-Wait...

722
00:58:35,066 --> 00:58:36,286
It is rice!

723
00:58:36,286 --> 00:58:39,396
Quiet! Put it in here!

724
00:58:39,396 --> 00:58:43,306
- What happened?
- What is this? Why is there rice on the ground?

725
00:58:43,306 --> 00:58:44,656
What is this?

726
00:58:44,656 --> 00:58:47,596
- Heaven rained down rice for us.
- I know, right?

727
00:58:47,596 --> 00:58:49,966
What good luck!

728
00:58:59,456 --> 00:59:01,186
Here, here.

729
00:59:01,186 --> 00:59:02,436
This is rice.

730
00:59:02,436 --> 00:59:05,516
I know, look at its sheen!

731
00:59:05,516 --> 00:59:07,576
It looks so good!

732
00:59:09,456 --> 00:59:11,716
Oh, my. He is wearing a mask.

733
00:59:11,716 --> 00:59:14,236
Maybe we are going to die...

734
00:59:15,676 --> 00:59:16,676
What is the matter?

735
00:59:16,676 --> 00:59:19,476
Gosh, w-w-we are sorry!

736
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:23,746
We lost our minds at the sight of rice...

737
00:59:23,746 --> 00:59:25,156
What?

738
00:59:25,156 --> 00:59:29,126
Geez, when did this get a hole?

739
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:33,706
Wait!

740
00:59:34,986 --> 00:59:39,456
By chance, is there a grandmother who lost her granddaughter?

741
00:59:39,966 --> 00:59:41,526
G-Grandmother?

742
00:59:41,526 --> 00:59:45,236
Right. That grandma who was going around looking for her missing granddaughter.

743
00:59:45,236 --> 00:59:46,366
Where is she right now?

744
00:59:46,366 --> 00:59:48,806
Her house collapsed, and she was not in her right mind.

745
00:59:48,806 --> 00:59:51,526
So she is staying at the house across from hers.

746
00:59:53,466 --> 00:59:55,246
Go.

747
00:59:55,246 --> 00:59:56,966
Wait!

748
00:59:58,536 --> 01:00:02,826
Do you know around when her granddaughter went missing?

749
01:00:02,826 --> 01:00:05,326
When was it again?

750
01:00:05,326 --> 01:00:08,806
Since children disappear from here all the time...

751
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:11,306
There are more children who went missing?

752
01:00:12,126 --> 01:00:14,936
Well, yeah, lots of them.

753
01:00:14,936 --> 01:00:17,256
- Yeah, there are many.
- Yeah...

754
01:00:17,256 --> 01:00:20,996
- It happens all the time.
- It happens quite often. Quite often.

755
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:23,876
But you did not know?

756
01:00:29,506 --> 01:00:31,486
I am sure she probably came back here.

757
01:00:31,486 --> 01:00:34,106
- Find her!
- Yes!

758
01:01:09,176 --> 01:01:10,326
No one is there.

759
01:01:10,326 --> 01:01:12,616
There was no child in this area.

760
01:01:12,616 --> 01:01:16,856
You go that way, and you go this way with me.

761
01:01:22,826 --> 01:01:28,056
I had my doubts, but as the saying goes, the enemies meet on a bamboo bridge.

762
01:01:28,056 --> 01:01:30,896
You mean a single log bridge.

763
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:33,926
I will catch you for sure today.

764
01:01:33,926 --> 01:01:36,386
I am not one to get caught so easily.

765
01:01:36,386 --> 01:01:39,436
I have no business with you nor want to fight you,

766
01:01:39,436 --> 01:01:42,306
so you should just go your way.

767
01:01:49,836 --> 01:01:51,236
Here you are.

768
01:01:51,236 --> 01:01:55,536
Spare me, Mister! Please!

769
01:01:55,536 --> 01:01:57,146
Spare me, please!

770
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:58,636
Please!

771
01:01:58,636 --> 01:02:01,306
Mister, please spare me!

772
01:02:01,306 --> 01:02:03,956
Please!

773
01:02:05,176 --> 01:02:08,776
Did you come here to catch that kid?

774
01:02:08,776 --> 01:02:11,816
Then, that is a different story.

775
01:02:38,446 --> 01:02:41,286
Have you seen my granddaughter?

776
01:02:41,286 --> 01:02:43,026
Gosh, have you seen my granddaughter?

777
01:02:43,026 --> 01:02:44,546
Grandmother!

778
01:02:44,546 --> 01:02:46,956
Goodness, Sook! My child!

779
01:02:46,956 --> 01:02:49,306
Grandmother!

780
01:02:49,306 --> 01:02:51,096
Sook...

781
01:02:51,906 --> 01:02:53,276
What are you doing!

782
01:02:53,276 --> 01:02:54,476
Hand over the child.

783
01:02:54,476 --> 01:02:56,006
Grandmother...

784
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:59,276
Stay where you are. I will handle this.

785
01:03:00,766 --> 01:03:02,276
Fine.

786
01:03:03,066 --> 01:03:05,096
Take me instead.

787
01:03:06,056 --> 01:03:08,786
Was I not your target from the start?

788
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:11,166
We came to catch him.

789
01:03:11,946 --> 01:03:13,326
I told you to hand over the child.

790
01:03:13,326 --> 01:03:16,536
I am saying I will let you catch me.

791
01:03:21,876 --> 01:03:23,936
Stop right there!

792
01:03:41,785 --> 01:03:44,256
Now, what is this?

who you were that you would dare be so shameless in front of the captain.

811
01:05:28,226 --> 01:05:31,186
What! A masked man appeared and took the child?

812
01:05:31,186 --> 01:05:34,236
Leave right now and find that masked man.

813
01:05:34,236 --> 01:05:38,786
Are you saying this may not be a kidnapping of a single child?

This may make you Kang Pil Jik's target.

If someone commits wrongdoing, will you be able to arrest whoever that is?
