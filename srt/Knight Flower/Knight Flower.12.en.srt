1
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,179
Wait!

2
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:37,489
Wait a moment.

3
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:41,289
- I mean...
- Do you know a man named Cho Seong Hoo?

4
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:47,069
Cho Seong Hoo is dead.

5
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:51,969
I found him one year after his disappearance...

6
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:55,839
and killed him.

7
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:57,699
My name is Captain Park Su Ho of the Capital Garrison.

8
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:00,749
I came to deliver an urgent message to His Majesty.

9
00:01:11,669 --> 00:01:14,519
She is not breathing.

10
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:21,889
Hold on a moment!

11
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,859
What did you tell me just now?

12
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,089
- Sweetheart.
- Madam.

13
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,159
Let go of me!

14
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,919
You have something to tell me, Madam.

15
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:33,529
Madam, what did you say to me?

16
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:37,069
How rude of you to do this in front of His Majesty!

17
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:45,289
Listen, all of you!

18
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:50,689
Everything that happened today

19
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:53,329
is due to my lack of caution.

20
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:56,829
Everyone should go home now.

21
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:05,459
I will make sure to find out the truth behind what happened today!

22
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:09,089
Until then, none of you...

23
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:14,339
better make a rash move.

24
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:48,189
[Knight Flower - Episode 12: Knight Flower]

25
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,169
You made a lot of preparations, which is unlike you, Your Majesty.

26
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:07,489
You should not have bothered to do this but arrest me and interrogate me instead.

27
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:16,419
Did you forget what the Finance Minister's wife testified to with her death?

28
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:19,659
All the circumstances regarding Father's death by poison have been exposed.

29
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,059
But how are you so shameless?

30
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:25,839
I told you I do not know about that matter.

31
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,499
Also, even if it were actually true,

32
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:34,239
there is no way to prove it since the Finance Minister's wife is dead now.

33
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,869
Left State Minister, have you no fear for the heavens?

34
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:41,009
Royal Secretary of Defense,

35
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,469
if you wish to protect His Majesty's life, at the least,

36
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:47,779
lead him down the correct path.

37
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:52,239
You dared to oppose me with this meager plan?

38
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:59,159
There is an old saying that says

39
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,239
"A monkey drowns, trying to catch the moon floating on the water."

40
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,169
How do you not know you are only an arrogant monkey, Your Majesty?

41
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:12,539
How dare you! I am the king...

42
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,339
How are you exactly the same as the previous foolish king?

43
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,959
Do not talk about my father with your mouth!

44
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,349
My father tried to...

45
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:31,239
build a good country where all of the people can prosper.

46
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:40,029
A good country where all the people can prosper?

47
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:47,199
So, the country you dream of ignores the laws and customs of classes

48
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,419
where even the low class can take the state exam and the slaves can become court officials?

49
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:55,869
Have you ever thought about what would happen to this country, then?

50
00:04:55,869 --> 00:05:00,049
If everyone is allowed to live according

51
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,359
to their capabilities regardless of their class,

52
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:06,269
this country will become even stronger in the future.

53
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:11,579
Did you just say, "regardless of their classes"?

54
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,929
You also became the king without doing anything,

55
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:20,659
but only because you were the oldest son of a king, did you not?

56
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:22,879
Everyone knowing their place and

57
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,829
keeping the positions they were born into is the right thing to do.

58
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:31,799
Do not forget it is the way of the world.

59
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:35,539
If you intend to defy it to the end,

60
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:41,039
you will be the first one to forsake your position, Your Majesty.

61
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,429
Brother...

62
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:59,849
You are not bad. You should be able to protect yourself now.

63
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,279
You are not even on duty today.

64
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:08,199
I will craft you an Acorus sword fitting for you.

65
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:12,069
Do not go.

66
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,629
You cannot go.

67
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:16,839
Brother.

68
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,819
Brother—

69
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:22,069
Are you okay?

70
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,409
My Lady.

71
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,139
What about Father?

72
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:33,289
He has not come home yet.

73
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,599
Captain said he had an urgent message for you and

74
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:50,289
he will wait for you at the bookstore until you come.

75
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:58,422
[Hwang Bookstore]

76
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:18,229
Are you okay?

77
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:24,569
Apparently, Father had...

78
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:28,989
killed my brother.

79
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,379
How could he do that?

80
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:37,919
How could he kill my brother and

81
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,999
look at me with such a gentle face?

82
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,039
It cannot be.

83
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,579
The Finance Minister's wife must have been mistaken.

84
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:52,039
That is what I was going to tell you about.

85
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:57,989
Kang Pil Jik confessed to having killed your brother...

86
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:03,979
as he was ordered by the Left State Minister.

87
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:13,069
Madam!

88
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:17,269
Mother.

89
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:22,339
Is there anything you know about today's happening?

90
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:28,099
How could I know about external matters?

91
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:30,799
It is just that...

92
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:37,159
I hope nothing happens to you and your wife.

93
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:42,669
Mother, what does it mean my wife's brother disappeared?

94
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,389
He disappeared a few months before her marriage and

95
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:48,449
she still has not heard from him.

96
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:52,069
He did not contact her for more than a decade.

97
00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:56,549
But she prays every time, believing he is still alive.

98
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:59,449
She must have endured those harsh and tough years

99
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:03,599
because of her longing for her brother.

100
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:09,299
That is probably what gave her the strength to endure.

101
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:27,899
Did you kill Cho Seong Hoo?

102
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,449
Is anyone outside?

103
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:33,109
Captain! Captain!

104
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:37,909
Tell me when, where, and...

105
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:40,959
how you killed Cho Seong Hoo!

106
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,599
One year after searching for Cho Seong Hoo,

107
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,599
I found him when he showed up in Bukchon.

108
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,429
I followed him into the forest behind Sadanggol—

109
00:09:55,429 --> 00:10:00,149
Are you saying he had come to Bukchon?

110
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:02,309
Father.

111
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:05,269
Yes, Daughter-in-law.

112
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:07,499
Is it not too hot?

113
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,599
Yes, I am fine.

114
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:12,179
Is there still no news from your brother?

115
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,269
No, not yet.

116
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:17,439
I am also looking everywhere.

117
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,219
He knew he would die if he got caught, but to see his younger sister...

118
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:25,949
he returned and...

119
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:28,659
So, he did return.

120
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:31,069
He had come back.

121
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:40,349
When you killed him,

122
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:42,939
was...

123
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:46,959
the Left State Minister at the scene?

124
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:04,909
Where are you going?

125
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:07,839
Do not follow me.

126
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:10,989
I will come with you.

127
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:13,619
I would like to be alone.

128
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:44,929
Am I the one...

129
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,129
who got you killed in the end?

130
00:11:50,849 --> 00:11:53,549
You came to see me and...

131
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,869
At a strange place without a single family or kin...

132
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:07,859
You should have died when my brother died!

133
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:10,709
...though my days were filled with sorrow,

134
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:14,229
I was able to firmly stand my ground...

135
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:18,549
because while doing things I could afford to do,

136
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:21,829
I waited for the day...

137
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:29,289
I could meet you proudly as your sister, Cho Yeo Hwa, who stayed alive.

138
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,179
Father.

139
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:33,939
Yes.

140
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,569
Let us wait for him together.

141
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:44,159
The one I served as my parent is the enemy who killed you, Brother.

142
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,339
How can the heavens be so cruel to me?

143
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,209
What am I supposed to...

144
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,749
live for now?

145
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:10,699
Now... I am going to do...

146
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,889
the final job I must complete.

147
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:26,319
Now that the Finance Minister's wife died as well,

148
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:30,969
there must not be any evidence left.

149
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:37,999
Your Excellency—

150
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:40,379
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

151
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,589
Who are you?

152
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:49,209
Did you really kill Cho Seong Hoo?

153
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:53,059
How would you know that man?

154
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:55,319
Even after killing Cho Seong Hoo,

155
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:59,449
you acted so shamelessly as if he werestill alive!

156
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:03,989
Curious about who I am? Then...

157
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:07,189
I will show you...

158
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:10,329
just what you have done.

159
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:22,609
Y-Your Excellency, this way now.

160
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:24,599
Hurry up and come.

161
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:44,149
Why are you stopping me? Why?

162
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,099
Do you mean to die here?

163
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:48,079
Will you reveal your identity, kill the Left State Minister,

164
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,099
and throw your life away as well, Madam?

165
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,399
Yes!

166
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,729
I will kill that man and meet the consequences.

167
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:57,229
Is that not what you and His Majesty want to do as well?

168
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:01,449
Hence, I was going to end it, but why are you stopping me?

169
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:03,289
I also think...

170
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:05,629
countless times a day that I can just

171
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:09,459
kill the Left State Minister and sacrifice my life to avenge my parents!

172
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:13,589
However, I cannot do that.

173
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:19,829
Would your brother really want you to die avenging him?

174
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:32,879
If that is the only way to end this,

175
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:36,539
I will be the one to do it.

176
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:38,669
So, please.

177
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:42,439
Please do not put yourself in harm's way.

178
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,569
You came home late.

179
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:16,219
You were shocked today. Right?

180
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:18,359
Are you all right?

181
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,329
Yes.

182
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:25,979
Wife, you only need to keep things in order at home for me.

183
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:29,799
There is no need for you to care about external matters.

184
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,469
Yes.

185
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,789
You must be tired. Go inside and rest now.

186
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:05,279
I heard the masked one ambushed you!

187
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,179
Even Park Su Ho showed up at the scene.

188
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,779
I am sure those two are on the same side.

189
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:17,129
What in the world is going on here?

190
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:26,769
Bring Prince Ahn San to the capital.

191
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:28,479
Sorry?

192
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:35,809
His Majesty would know better than anyone what it means to bring Prince Ahn San.

193
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:40,729
Though related, he comes from the collateral family and he is only six years old.

194
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:45,229
I choose who gets to be the king anyway.

195
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:48,039
He only needs to be of the Royal Family's blood.

196
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,029
In addition,

197
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,889
the younger, the better, is it not?

198
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:02,859
I believed...

199
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:06,929
Brother to be alive all this time.

200
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:14,579
There was a secret space where Brother and I practiced martial arts.

201
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:20,089
I left a letter there before I got married.

202
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:25,529
When I went there again, the letter was gone, and

203
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:28,369
this sword was lying there.

204
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:33,759
That is why I believed Brother was alive.

205
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:37,929
I think he was probably...

206
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:41,919
trying to leave this sword to me.

207
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:48,929
I will craft you an Acorus sword fitting for you.

208
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:51,949
A secretive and special sword perfectly fitting for you.

209
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:54,529
A special sword?

210
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:26,849
My one and only sister, Yeo Hwa.

211
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:32,299
If you are reading this letter, it would probably mean I am not by your side.

212
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:38,069
So, please forgive your foolish brother who failed to come back as he promised.

213
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:41,839
Are you living the life you want right now?

214
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:46,609
Are you willingly doing the things you want to be doing in life?

215
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:51,959
If the Crown Prince safely became the king,

216
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:54,779
please deliver the other letter to him.

217
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,249
Also, no longer think of your brother

218
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:05,319
who is only leaving you a heavy burden when he could not even protect you.

219
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:48,839
Kang Pil Jik was murdered!

220
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:53,129
Who goes there?

221
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,149
Okay!

222
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:06,119
Please excuse me for a moment.

223
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:15,149
What brings you here?

224
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,769
I intend to ask you about what happened yesterday at the palace.

225
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:20,189
Not your business.

226
00:21:20,189 --> 00:21:25,709
By chance... did you already know that tea was poisoned?

227
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:30,129
How on Earth would I know that?

228
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:32,049
If you had known,

229
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:35,209
would you have stopped me before I drank it?

230
00:21:37,749 --> 00:21:39,419
You would not have.

231
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:43,109
You came in to find out such a trivial thing?

232
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:46,509
You should have taken public office long ago and tended to state affairs.

233
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:48,709
But you are just sentimental like women.

234
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:50,539
When will you come to your senses?

235
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:54,969
Though I do not know state affairs or politics, I know my duty to my family.

236
00:21:54,969 --> 00:21:57,549
You abandoned your parents and lived the way you pleased.

237
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,989
So what right do you have to mention family now?

238
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:04,979
There is no way you would know that all of this is for our family.

239
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:09,699
What are you trying to gain even by risking your family's life?

240
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:15,219
I hope Mother and my wife never have to experience hardship again.

241
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:18,729
This is my last request as your son, Father.

242
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:31,959
It looks like you really like the food.

243
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:35,659
I must eat.

244
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:39,249
I must eat well and do what I need to do.

245
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:43,439
You just have to deliver your brother's letter to His Majesty. Right?

246
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:46,799
I will do that and do something else, too.

247
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,149
Well, I heard sobbing all night,

248
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:53,349
so I was worried you would become bedridden.

249
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:56,679
I still do not know you well enough, My Lady.

250
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:01,269
I should have worried about what you will be doing next.

251
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:06,479
All right, I will be back.

252
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:09,419
Please be careful.

253
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,789
You are still the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law. What if someone finds out

254
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:15,269
while you are roaming around Woonjong Street like that?

255
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,039
Do not worry about a thing. I am a daughter-in-law they kept for 15 years.

256
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,749
Would they kill me for spending a night outside?

257
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:25,649
W-Well—

258
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:29,679
She should just become bedridden.

259
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,619
She makes me so anxious. I cannot stand this.

260
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,509
What is it you must tell me?

261
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:45,979
Yes, t-the thing is...

262
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:51,229
I personally saw who killed Kang Pil Jik.

263
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:57,529
L-Last night, a masked person secretly snuck into the Capital Garrison and—

264
00:23:57,529 --> 00:23:59,139
A masked person?

265
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:05,779
Yes, the thing is, I heard what the masked one said while killing Kang Pil Jik.

266
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:10,209
And I thought I should tell you, Your Excellency.

267
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:12,429
What did he say?

268
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:17,589
It was something like avenging the death of Cho Seong Hoo or something...

269
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:21,979
and saying he will give the evidence of that day to His Majesty...

270
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:27,169
to have the Left State Minister pay for what he did.

271
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:13,349
Your Majesty, Yeo Hwa of the Cho Family is here before you.

272
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:15,859
Did you want to see me?

273
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,429
My brother, Cho Seong Hoo, you were looking for

274
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:25,429
was already killed by the Left State Minister.

275
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:30,209
I heard from the Royal Secretary of Defense.

276
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:34,509
I feel very bad for you.

277
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:38,249
Since the evidence of treason my brother had has disappeared,

278
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:41,509
what do you plan to do now?

279
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:47,959
I dare ask again, Your Majesty.

280
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:50,919
After finding the evidence of treason,

281
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:53,449
what did you plan to do?

282
00:25:53,449 --> 00:25:56,359
I planned to eliminate the Left State Minister

283
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:02,229
and build a country where all of its people prosper, as my father had wished to.

284
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:04,829
Had you failed to find the evidence,

285
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:10,019
were you just going to wait without doing anything?

286
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:15,859
You must have thought I was truly cowardly.

287
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:18,799
From the moment you took the throne,

288
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,399
I have lived as a widow, the most insignificant being in Joseon.

289
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:31,439
Do you know how I have lived each day?

290
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:36,869
Besides longing for my husband and mourning,

291
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:43,119
I thought about the things I could do every day,

292
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,599
wore a mask, and jumped over walls.

293
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:49,749
Because even if I should die today,

294
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:54,739
I am nothing if I do not do something.

295
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:58,549
If I do nothing, there is no reason to stay alive.

296
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:03,199
So, I sought to live by whatever means.

297
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:10,189
Have you spent each day thinking about

298
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:16,059
what you must do for your people in your seat, Your Majesty?

299
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:24,819
Besides taking down the Left State Minister and revealing the truth of that day,

300
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:28,219
what I must do today as the king...

301
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:31,739
for the sake of my people...

302
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:36,359
The thing I must do each and every day,

303
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:41,739
I had forgotten to do the obvious.

304
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:46,869
I am a complete fool of a king.

305
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:50,159
So I am sincerely sorry and...

306
00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:54,589
ashamed.

307
00:27:54,589 --> 00:28:01,079
I believe you will become a benevolent king, Your Majesty.

308
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:16,639
I apologize for having to take out a sword in front of you.

309
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:21,909
This sword is the only thing my brother left behind for me.

310
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:27,549
Inside it, there is the letter Brother protected with his life.

311
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:35,109
So, please become a king who can willingly admit he is sorry and ashamed.

312
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:42,669
Please... do not let people like me lose hope for a better world.

313
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,439
My beloved Crown Prince, So.

314
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:41,679
If something should happen to me, it is surely the doing of the traitor, Seok Ji Seong.

315
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,679
I beseech you to stay alive and take the throne without fail.

316
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,579
So you can accomplish what your father could not do,

317
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:55,389
which is to become a strong king who creates a world

318
00:29:55,389 --> 00:30:01,699
where all people can realize their own dreams.

319
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:15,339
Without fail, your son will...

320
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:24,299
become a strong king who can accomplish your will, Father.

321
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:41,469
How did I end up doing these jobs?

322
00:30:41,469 --> 00:30:46,189
I thought my life would be safe to the end.

323
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:50,969
His Majesty will never forget your achievement, Garrison Commander.

324
00:30:50,969 --> 00:30:55,519
You see, I have six children.

325
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,519
My youngest daughter is not even married yet.

326
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,889
Oh! This is way too scary! Too scary!

327
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:08,969
Please do not worry. Everything will end safely without trouble.

328
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:12,009
You were so flawless this early morning, too.

329
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:18,722
You are the truly flawless one, pretending to be the masked one.

330
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:22,919
What happened to Kang Pil Jik?

331
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:29,779
There.

332
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:33,959
Please pull me out quickly.

333
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,639
I cannot breathe.

334
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:37,679
- Hyungnim?
- M-Man Sik, is that you?

335
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,819
- Goodness, Hyungnim!
- Yes, yes.

336
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:41,589
Should we just leave them like this and go?

337
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:43,329
I was also thinking that right now.

338
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:47,189
I did everything you told me to do. Please spare me.

339
00:31:47,189 --> 00:31:49,559
Since you confessed, you will be spared.

340
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:53,959
But you will have to live as a butcher until you die.

341
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,329
- Take them away.
- Yes!

342
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:57,669
- W-Wait a moment—
- Hyungnim!

343
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:58,599
Sir!

344
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:01,159
Hyungnim!

345
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:05,919
Where do you think the Left State Minister will go?

346
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,689
Since he thinks the masked one and I are on the same side, would he not come to me?

347
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:14,569
I am His Majesty's closest aide.

348
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:17,569
I am sure he will come to me.

349
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,659
We will find out once we go out there.

350
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:28,029
Would the Left State Minister have taken the bait by now?

351
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,909
Yes, we are being followed as expected.

352
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:36,159
There seem to be about five.

353
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,649
I cannot sense anything at all.

354
00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:40,889
There are five of them?

355
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:43,809
- Brother.
- Yes.

356
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:47,179
You know how to wield a sword. Right?

357
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:51,079
I am this country's Royal Secretary of Defense. Do not worry.

358
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:54,659
I am able to protect myself.

359
00:32:56,829 --> 00:32:59,299
Just in case you need it.

360
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,429
What are you holding?

361
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:08,249
Please deliver this to His Majesty.

362
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:10,189
Hold on!

363
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:12,719
Hand over the letter.

364
00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:17,889
That I cannot do.

365
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:48,859
- I got the letter.
- Escape.

366
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:55,139
It is done.

367
00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:02,959
Does this make me more or less a captain now?

368
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:12,339
Your Excellency.

369
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,859
This is it.

370
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,659
Your Majesty, the Left State Minister entered the Royal Council Hall.

371
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:59,799
Your Majesty, I, Prince Ahn San, seek your presence.

372
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:01,939
[Prince Ahn San, Lee So's second cousin once removed from his father's or ancestor's female sibling]

373
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:05,979
Left State Minister,

374
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,799
what is the meaning of this sudden act?

375
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:11,469
Why did you bring Prince Ahn San here?

376
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:17,459
You need to show me your firm resolve to protect your throne

377
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:22,439
in order for me to show you my resolve to serve you, Your Majesty.

378
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:24,079
A firm resolve?

379
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,699
You must dethrone the Queen Dowager without hesitation.

380
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:34,849
You must ask the Queen Dowager about the crime of the Finance Minister's wife,

381
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:37,469
who dared to poison you and paid it with her life.

382
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,989
- Left State Minister!
- Or else,

383
00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:46,449
would you let young Prince Ahn San inherit the throne now?

384
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:08,859
Your Majesty, I told all the court officials to enter.

385
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:12,339
The court officials at this early hour?

386
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,849
Let them enter!

387
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:17,929
Yes.

388
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:42,679
Left State Minister, this is Prince Ahn San, is he not?

389
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:49,849
Nonetheless, I have clearly delivered my message, Your Majesty.

390
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:53,949
So I will take Prince Ahn San and leave now.

391
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:57,779
Stop right there, Your Excellency.

392
00:37:00,169 --> 00:37:03,219
Someone is here to see you, Your Excellency.

393
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:07,739
Let her enter!

394
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:23,069
- A woman?
- What is this...

395
00:37:23,069 --> 00:37:25,119
What is going on?

396
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,939
Wait! What on Earth is going on?

397
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:31,209
My, now!

398
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:51,209
Your Majesty, how can you let a woman enter the Royal Council Hall?

399
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,799
W-Why are you—

400
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:14,579
Madam Cho, tell us why you came in here.

401
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:20,459
I am His Excellency Left State Minister Seok Ji Seong's daughter-in-law.

402
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:22,829
How dare you come in here?

403
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:27,829
I am also the younger sister of the Royal Guard Cho Seong Hoo, who undertook

404
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:31,669
the last secret order of the previous king 15 years ago.

405
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:39,179
After my brother disappeared 15 years ago,

406
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:41,499
I married into the Seok Family by arrangement.

407
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:45,409
On the day of the wedding, my husband died, so I have been living as a faithful widow.

408
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:48,029
You better shut your mouth!

409
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:53,189
All this time, I had a kind father-in-law who was also the greatest minister of all time

410
00:38:53,189 --> 00:38:55,869
and my life as a faithful widow was not so bad.

411
00:38:55,869 --> 00:39:01,609
Your Majesty, why are you making court officials listen to a mere woman's complaint?

412
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:09,829
Yes, I am a mere woman and I intend to personally accuse my father-in-law,

413
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:12,749
here at this place!

414
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:15,039
- Do you know what is happening?
- What is she saying?

415
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:17,249
How could this be...

416
00:39:17,249 --> 00:39:23,149
Firstly, for making me his daughter-in-law to hold me hostage to lure in Cho Seong Hoo

417
00:39:23,149 --> 00:39:25,269
and murdering Cho Seong Hoo!

418
00:39:25,269 --> 00:39:31,299
Secondly, for massacring the Head Royal Guard Im Kang's family.

419
00:39:31,299 --> 00:39:32,599
Im Kang?

420
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:34,929
The previous Head Royal Guard?

421
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:39,329
His entire household was killed by thugs. Right?

422
00:39:39,329 --> 00:39:41,529
That is what I thought.

423
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:44,319
Let him enter!

424
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:05,299
I am Im Hyeon Jae, the son of the previous Head Royal Guard Im Kang.

425
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:09,299
I am before His Majesty as the witness of that day.

426
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:12,559
All members of his household were killed, were they not?

427
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:14,189
That is what I heard, too.

428
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:20,659
Alas, is he not Park Su Ho, the stepson of the Grand Chancellor?

429
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:26,939
Royal Secretary of Defense, is he not your younger brother?

430
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:32,609
Royal Secretary of Defense, explain what is going on.

431
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:34,439
Yes.

432
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,399
Fifteen years ago, on the night the previous king passed away,

433
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:42,729
I saved the Head Royal Guard's young son who was dying, as per the royal decree,

434
00:40:42,729 --> 00:40:45,559
and brought him to my house.

435
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:51,709
I was heartbroken because a loyal subject like Im Kang suffered such an atrocity.

436
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:54,379
But his son was alive like this!

437
00:40:59,009 --> 00:41:01,149
Lastly, for the previous king—

438
00:41:01,149 --> 00:41:03,259
Shut your mouth!

439
00:41:03,949 --> 00:41:08,589
Do you really wish to be kicked out of my family?

440
00:41:09,939 --> 00:41:11,839
Father...

441
00:41:13,909 --> 00:41:16,909
I came to this place to die.

442
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:21,409
Would I be afraid of merely being kicked out?

443
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:36,489
My brother left this sword behind!

444
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:38,339
Inside this,

445
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:44,309
there is the previous king's written will that says the Left State Minister Seok Ji Seong is a traitor.

446
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:09,969
The Left State Minister Seok Ji Seong poisoned the previous king,

447
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:14,089
killed the previous Head Royal Guard, Im Kang, and my brother, Cho Seong Joo,

448
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:17,259
who received the previous king's letter.

449
00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:21,779
I and Im Hyeon Jae, who is standing here,

450
00:42:21,779 --> 00:42:26,759
and this letter are the evidence.

451
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:37,899
As the daughter-in-law of the Left State Minister who plotted treason,

452
00:42:37,899 --> 00:42:42,669
I will face the consequences along with my father-in-law.

453
00:42:42,669 --> 00:42:45,329
Left State Minister, what is she saying right now?

454
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:48,209
The previous king was killed by poison?

455
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:50,309
You killed Im Kang?

456
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:51,899
Go on and speak.

457
00:42:51,899 --> 00:42:57,429
Your daughter-in-law would not say such things with her life on the line!

458
00:42:57,429 --> 00:43:00,029
I heard the Finance Minister's wife also died after drinking a poisoned tea.

459
00:43:00,029 --> 00:43:02,249
Is that rumor also true?

460
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:04,729
And so?

461
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:10,799
Even if all that were true, what does it matter?

462
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:15,409
They were all done to protect this country.

463
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:19,309
Had I not eliminated the previous king after much thought,

464
00:43:19,309 --> 00:43:23,739
what do you think would have happened...

465
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:27,689
to all of you and the fate of this country?

466
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:40,309
Father,

467
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:43,929
you should stop now.

468
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,719
Y-You are...

469
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:09,409
Yes, Father. It was me.

470
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:20,029
Unbelievable!

471
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:38,719
Do not make me regret not having slain you that day.

472
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:41,069
H-How did you...

473
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:45,229
Your Majesty, please order a royal decree.

474
00:44:45,229 --> 00:44:50,009
I have a lot of things to discuss separately with my father.

475
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:55,089
Listen! Arrest the traitor, Seok Ji Seong, immediately!

476
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:57,169
Yes, Sire!

477
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:10,549
Do not lay a finger on my body!

478
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:37,649
It was all to protect the nobles who are the foundation of this country.

479
00:45:37,649 --> 00:45:41,319
All I did was protect the positions our descendants

480
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:47,899
will be protecting, which were passed down from generation to generation.

481
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,529
Keep this in mind.

482
00:45:53,529 --> 00:45:59,959
This country of Joseon is the noblemen's country.

483
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:25,599
Who on Earth are you?

484
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,969
Have you already forgotten who I am?

485
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:39,459
I am Cho Yeo Hwa, the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law.

486
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,502
[Hodugwan]

487
00:47:07,502 --> 00:47:10,029
After you murdered the previous king and

488
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:14,889
became Kang Pil Jik and the Finance Minister's wife's support,

489
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:19,979
your daughter-in-law has been jumping walls every night

490
00:47:19,979 --> 00:47:22,679
to fight them off, risking her life.

491
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:27,329
And out of all those things, one thing...

492
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:32,289
Be relieved that I did not punish you in person with

493
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:36,829
my own hands and sword.

494
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:40,759
I tend to make my move before the laws apply.

495
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:42,789
But just this once,

496
00:47:43,299 --> 00:47:48,189
I am going to see the sovereign laws

497
00:47:48,189 --> 00:47:52,589
make you pay for your crime, Father.

498
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:08,809
The guilty, Seok Ji Seong,

499
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:12,499
instigated the previous king's death by poison and damaged the written royal command.

500
00:48:12,499 --> 00:48:17,429
He murdered the Head Royal Guard Im Kang, his household, and Cho Seong Hoo

501
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:20,639
to get rid of the evidence of treason.

502
00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:23,849
Mother!

503
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:28,319
Father has been arrested for treason.

504
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,459
Treason?

505
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:32,239
Mother!

506
00:48:32,989 --> 00:48:37,059
The guilty, Seok Ji Seong, shall be stripped of his rank and public office and demoted to the lowest class.

507
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:41,849
He will receive 100 beatings and be confined by thorns on Bogil Island in the Jeolla Province.

508
00:48:41,849 --> 00:48:46,869
And further ordered to regret his crime until the day of his death.

509
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:51,559
Carry them out at once!

510
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:53,449
Yes!

511
00:48:59,389 --> 00:49:04,689
Your Majesty, I dared to seek you out for a favor.

512
00:49:04,689 --> 00:49:06,709
Tell me whatever it may be.

513
00:49:06,709 --> 00:49:10,909
I will always listen to what you have to say.

514
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:14,139
Your Majesty, I dare request of you

515
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:20,589
to pardon the other family members who are already hurt by my father's crimes.

516
00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:23,179
Just as I have been deceived by Father my whole life,

517
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:27,209
they are all irrelevant to this incident.

518
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:34,449
As you said, what fault would his household have when they knew nothing?

519
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:39,569
Thank you for your grace.

520
00:49:53,562 --> 00:49:57,832
[Hwayeon]

521
00:49:57,832 --> 00:50:00,239
Is this really not too much?

522
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:02,219
A divorced woman?

523
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:06,319
She lived as a widow all this time and now, she has to spend the rest of her life as a divorced woman.

524
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,919
What can I do in this situation?

525
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:11,199
She had to mourn all day, confined in her house

526
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:15,369
and now she is about to be stamped as a divorcee.

527
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:18,759
Once she got to leave home, I was going to grow Myeongdogak with her.

528
00:50:18,759 --> 00:50:22,619
Both widows and divorced women are not treated as humans in Joseon anyway!

529
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:28,259
In the end, she went through all this trouble to live without a name.

530
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:31,789
Be it the Qing Dynasty or anywhere else, I am going to run away with My Lady!

531
00:50:31,789 --> 00:50:35,359
This is all because of that Left State Minister's—

532
00:50:37,009 --> 00:50:39,359
S-Sir.

533
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,009
Yes.

534
00:50:41,009 --> 00:50:42,799
Sure.

535
00:50:45,889 --> 00:50:50,739
I came because I wanted to know what my wife would do.

536
00:50:50,739 --> 00:50:52,259
Where did she go?

537
00:50:52,259 --> 00:50:54,669
She left early in the morning.

538
00:50:54,669 --> 00:50:57,369
But I do not know where she went, either.

539
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:00,249
My goodness.

540
00:51:00,249 --> 00:51:05,029
What is going on for everyone to be gathered here?

541
00:51:05,849 --> 00:51:09,719
Sir Royal Secretary, what brings you here?

542
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:16,049
I also wanted to know what would happen to Madam.

543
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:24,689
There is an urgent matter, so I am going to the palace.

544
00:51:24,689 --> 00:51:27,419
I will not be able to come home for a few days.

545
00:51:48,209 --> 00:51:50,179
What brings you here?

546
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:52,939
I felt like you would be here.

547
00:51:54,989 --> 00:52:01,029
Do you remember the question you asked me a long time ago?

548
00:52:01,029 --> 00:52:04,829
You asked me how I was going to live after

549
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:07,279
finding out about my brother's whereabouts and

550
00:52:07,279 --> 00:52:11,499
exposing all of the Left State Minister's crimes.

551
00:52:12,569 --> 00:52:16,509
Did you think about it?

552
00:52:18,979 --> 00:52:21,739
After everything is over,

553
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:26,449
who will I live as or what will I live as?

554
00:52:27,029 --> 00:52:31,579
Not as someone's daughter-in-law or somebody's wife.

555
00:52:32,889 --> 00:52:35,789
The one who shows up on moonlit nights. Not that, either.

556
00:52:38,929 --> 00:52:43,879
However, even after all of this is over,

557
00:52:43,879 --> 00:52:51,039
I realized that I would still be Seok Family's daughter-in-law until the day I die.

558
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:55,429
Even if I end up getting divorced,

559
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:57,629
since I was clearly a nobleman's daughter-in-law,

560
00:52:57,629 --> 00:53:01,679
my life will not be much different from a widow's.

561
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,699
What do you mean by that?

562
00:53:03,699 --> 00:53:06,279
That is what the laws state, so it cannot be helped.

563
00:53:06,279 --> 00:53:07,619
We can ask His Majesty—

564
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:12,039
It was probably already difficult enough to have my family spared.

565
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:16,339
His Majesty cannot change the laws just because of me.

566
00:53:16,339 --> 00:53:19,489
- Madam.
- Therefore, Sir, you should also...

567
00:53:22,689 --> 00:53:24,429
go on about your way now.

568
00:53:24,429 --> 00:53:26,799
I cannot do that.

569
00:53:26,799 --> 00:53:31,179
Whether you are masked, widowed, or divorced,

570
00:53:31,179 --> 00:53:34,399
none of it matters to me.

571
00:53:34,399 --> 00:53:36,849
I will be by your side.

572
00:53:38,369 --> 00:53:42,849
I will... accompany you.

573
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:51,979
That is what the laws state, so what can we do?

574
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,579
Sir, this is really unfair for My Lady.

575
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:57,109
She lived 15 years as a widow, eating only...

576
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:59,439
She ate only one meal a day and mourned every day.

577
00:53:59,439 --> 00:54:01,549
She could not even go outside.

578
00:54:01,549 --> 00:54:03,919
Is there really no way?

579
00:54:03,919 --> 00:54:06,549
Even so, she cannot very well...

580
00:54:07,729 --> 00:54:11,069
stay in that house anymore.

581
00:54:11,069 --> 00:54:14,669
His Majesty also finds it unfortunate.

582
00:54:14,669 --> 00:54:17,109
But it cannot be helped.

583
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:21,579
By the way,

584
00:54:22,249 --> 00:54:24,639
there is something I would like to know.

585
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:29,409
My Lady said she never got to see Junior Joo and married him.

586
00:54:29,409 --> 00:54:32,219
Do people marry that way, too?

587
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:34,409
Even lovebirds come in pairs,

588
00:54:34,409 --> 00:54:37,499
so a person cannot marry all alone, can she?

589
00:54:44,669 --> 00:54:50,349
I came to report a scammer here!

590
00:54:53,939 --> 00:54:56,209
That scammer I am talking about...

591
00:54:57,009 --> 00:54:58,829
is me!

592
00:54:59,689 --> 00:55:03,379
- What the heck is he thinking?
- Seriously.

593
00:55:07,769 --> 00:55:09,559
Move aside, everyone. This is Capital Garrison.

594
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:12,939
Move aside, move aside.

595
00:55:12,939 --> 00:55:16,919
What are you doing? Hurry up and arrest me!

596
00:55:18,859 --> 00:55:20,509
Gosh, I told you!

597
00:55:20,509 --> 00:55:26,459
Why are you doing this in front of the palace, not Yejo?
(Ministry of Rites, Protocol, Culture and Education)

598
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:34,199
It is to tell people my marriage was wrong from the beginning!

599
00:55:35,909 --> 00:55:41,159
This marriage was a fraudulent one, wrong from the beginning!

600
00:55:43,699 --> 00:55:47,689
I had escaped to the Qing Dynasty, blinded by love.

601
00:55:47,689 --> 00:55:53,639
But Father took in Yeo Hwa of Cho's Family as daughter-in-law, knowing this.

602
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:57,209
So, this is clearly a fraudulent marriage!

603
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:03,099
I got married in the Qing Dynasty

604
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:06,139
and I already have a wife!

605
00:56:06,139 --> 00:56:08,649
- W-What?
- W-Wife?

606
00:56:09,189 --> 00:56:11,179
I already have a wife!

607
00:56:11,179 --> 00:56:12,749
Wife.

608
00:56:12,749 --> 00:56:15,049
Since I cannot have two wives,

609
00:56:15,049 --> 00:56:19,129
this marriage must be made void!

610
00:56:22,209 --> 00:56:24,959
So, are you saying that poor woman

611
00:56:24,959 --> 00:56:30,319
lived pitifully as a widow because of her husband...

612
00:56:31,759 --> 00:56:34,309
who was alive and even married?

613
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:37,449
- Let this go first and talk.
- Do not overdo it.

614
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:39,179
I did not know, either.

615
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:42,179
I did not know, either!

616
00:56:44,759 --> 00:56:49,729
It does not mean I did not sin against that woman, even if I did not know.

617
00:56:49,729 --> 00:56:53,299
So, please grant freedom...

618
00:56:53,919 --> 00:56:57,669
to that woman who must have suffered because of me!

619
00:56:57,669 --> 00:57:00,769
Willingly permitted.

620
00:57:04,589 --> 00:57:08,489
Your Majesty!

621
00:57:08,489 --> 00:57:12,279
Your Majesty!

622
00:57:14,029 --> 00:57:18,009
I came out briefly because I heard something interesting was going on.

623
00:57:19,329 --> 00:57:23,889
I will notify Yejo and make this marriage null and void.

624
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:30,719
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty!

625
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:37,459
That is a very suitable order.

626
00:57:41,169 --> 00:57:43,529
What do you mean, the Madam disappeared?

627
00:57:43,529 --> 00:57:46,799
This is all she left behind.

628
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:53,299
I will be well, so do not worry about me.

629
00:57:53,299 --> 00:57:56,849
W-Wait, is this all?

630
00:57:58,529 --> 00:58:03,279
I did not sense anything last night when she left home and came to Myeongdogak.

631
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:07,199
Is this really all she left behind before leaving?

632
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:12,059
Did she even know the marriage was voided before leaving?

633
00:58:33,919 --> 00:58:36,529
If you leave like this,

634
00:58:36,529 --> 00:58:39,639
will you never come back to this house?

635
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,649
Yes.

636
00:58:41,649 --> 00:58:43,699
Well...

637
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:49,009
It might be uncomfortable to live at Myeongdogak.

638
00:58:49,009 --> 00:58:53,499
It is okay for you to stay here until you find—

639
00:58:54,579 --> 00:58:56,839
Will it not work?

640
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:03,419
They said the heavens destine marriages.

641
00:59:03,419 --> 00:59:09,169
I was really glad you were the husband

642
00:59:09,169 --> 00:59:11,999
who came back after 15 years.

643
00:59:14,409 --> 00:59:16,359
Live well.

644
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,679
Freely.

645
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:23,689
Well, it would be even better if we ran into each other at night sometimes.

646
00:59:26,009 --> 00:59:28,649
I like great people.

647
01:00:00,259 --> 01:00:02,519
I am sorry.

648
01:00:03,929 --> 01:00:07,579
This is the only thing I can say.

649
01:00:07,579 --> 01:00:09,829
I am sorry.

650
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:11,909
Mother.

651
01:00:14,399 --> 01:00:17,179
Every day, I resented you,

652
01:00:17,179 --> 01:00:22,589
saddened by you, and even hated you.

653
01:00:24,179 --> 01:00:27,769
But because I had you, Mother,

654
01:00:27,769 --> 01:00:30,279
and because I was with you,

655
01:00:30,279 --> 01:00:33,589
I was able to endure those long years.

656
01:00:34,189 --> 01:00:38,429
Will you allow me to consider you

657
01:00:38,429 --> 01:00:41,289
my last family member?

658
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:44,959
Wherever I may end up living,

659
01:00:45,869 --> 01:00:53,029
can I think to myself that I have a mother and rely on that thought?

660
01:00:58,219 --> 01:00:59,959
Of course.

661
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:02,719
Please...

662
01:01:03,729 --> 01:01:07,859
forget all about those hard times and...

663
01:01:08,369 --> 01:01:10,829
live well.

664
01:01:10,829 --> 01:01:15,149
Live well, laughing and smiling.

665
01:01:15,149 --> 01:01:16,809
Yes.

666
01:01:17,689 --> 01:01:20,819
I will do that.

667
01:01:20,819 --> 01:01:25,399
I will make sure to live like that.

Someone's daughter-in-law, somebody's wife, or someone's lover.

670
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:13,249
I do not want to be called any of that.

671
01:02:13,249 --> 01:02:17,699
Did you not tell me this one time?

672
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:22,659
That I should worry about myself first before other people.

673
01:02:23,689 --> 01:02:28,339
I would like to try living like that for once.

674
01:02:29,089 --> 01:02:33,839
So, you should also stop worrying about me and think about yourself,

675
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:36,509
living with smiles on your face.

- Is it for Mr. Joo?
- Yes.

01:04:51,439 --> 01:04:54,439
It was extremely hard to get His Majesty's permission,

706
01:04:54,439 --> 01:04:57,279
but I can finally be able to live as a loafer.

707
01:04:57,279 --> 01:05:01,749
Your dream is to be a loafer. That is funny.

708
01:05:02,889 --> 01:05:10,089
Living quietly and away from the tiresome court has long been my wish.

709
01:05:10,089 --> 01:05:12,089
Oh, right.

710
01:05:12,089 --> 01:05:16,779
Did you choose the mansion in Hanyang you said was your dream?

711
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:19,449
There are a few places I like,

712
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:22,759
but I have not really fallen for one.

713
01:05:23,569 --> 01:05:26,599
There is this one great house.

714
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:29,259
The yard is always full of sunlight and

715
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,899
the flowers bloom in all four seasons.

716
01:05:31,899 --> 01:05:34,219
Where is that place?

717
01:05:44,429 --> 01:05:48,139
Is this not your house, Sir?

718
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:51,789
Would you like to...

719
01:05:51,789 --> 01:05:54,629
take a look around with me?

720
01:05:56,849 --> 01:05:58,549
Yes.

721
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:16,099
Your Excellency, you are here.

722
01:06:17,069 --> 01:06:18,939
Bi Chan!

723
01:06:20,029 --> 01:06:24,269
All right, did you bring what I told you to bring?

724
01:06:24,269 --> 01:06:27,509
Yes, right here.

725
01:06:27,509 --> 01:06:29,519
What is this?

726
01:06:30,179 --> 01:06:32,099
Is it not sajudanja?

727
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:33,729
[Sajudanja (Four Pillars): a paper that contains a bride or groom's fortune telling (birth year, month, day, and hour)]

728
01:06:33,729 --> 01:06:38,369
Your marriageable age is nearly full to the brim that it is flooding.

729
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:42,089
Since you have been postponing marriage so far, it is time you make up your mind.

730
01:06:42,089 --> 01:06:45,479
Right, of course, you should.

731
01:06:45,479 --> 01:06:47,929
- Thank—
- I cannot, Father!

732
01:06:51,309 --> 01:06:55,039
What do you mean by that?

733
01:06:55,749 --> 01:07:01,129
I will have to live the rest of my life as a wife after getting married.

734
01:07:02,729 --> 01:07:06,519
But I want to enjoy dating more!

735
01:07:09,709 --> 01:07:12,089
Why that little—

736
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:20,769
Minister of Defense.

737
01:07:21,909 --> 01:07:23,499
Did something happen here?

738
01:07:23,499 --> 01:07:27,589
It is better you do not know, Garrison Commander.

739
01:07:28,529 --> 01:07:31,189
What have you been doing all this time not getting used to her?

740
01:07:31,189 --> 01:07:34,339
You should have been prepared for that much.

741
01:07:35,019 --> 01:07:36,999
I heard the Ministry of Defense is very busy.

742
01:07:36,999 --> 01:07:39,879
Is it okay for you to be out here like this?

743
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:45,589
This is handmade by an artisan from Cheongsong.

744
01:07:45,589 --> 01:07:51,019
I got it in person to congratulate you on becoming the Garrison Commander.

745
01:07:51,019 --> 01:07:58,299
I went through so much to get this rare white porcelain—

746
01:07:58,299 --> 01:08:02,919
Garrison Commander, we found the hideout of the ones who kidnap women.

747
01:08:03,729 --> 01:08:06,149
Where is it? Let us go.

748
01:08:06,149 --> 01:08:08,599
Wait! You cannot go alone!

749
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:10,729
Wait for me!

750
01:08:11,959 --> 01:08:13,819
Wait—

751
01:08:14,669 --> 01:08:18,549
I want to go, too.

752
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:27,319
Ever heard of the story about the masked one who appears when the moon is shining brightly?

753
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:29,349
- Of course!
- Who is it?

754
01:08:29,349 --> 01:08:32,119
It has been forever since he disappeared.

755
01:08:32,119 --> 01:08:34,059
Calm down. Calm down.

756
01:08:34,059 --> 01:08:35,739
Hold your horses.

757
01:08:35,739 --> 01:08:38,749
I will be telling a story about that woman today.

758
01:08:38,749 --> 01:08:41,119
That woman? The masked one was a woman?

759
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:43,749
Come on, I heard he was so good at martial arts.

760
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:45,949
No way!

761
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:50,909
I call that woman...

762
01:08:52,019 --> 01:08:55,159
the Knight Flower.

763
01:08:56,219 --> 01:08:58,519
Please help!

764
01:09:00,459 --> 01:09:03,679
S-Sir, why are you doing this?

765
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:11,639
I was wondering who caused all the noise in the peaceful capital again.

766
01:09:11,639 --> 01:09:13,119
It was you lot, huh?

767
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:15,099
Who goes there?

768
01:09:30,829 --> 01:09:34,609
Alas, I had just arrived in the capital.

769
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:38,569
Am I not being too welcomed on the first day?

770
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:43,189
I will make you into pulp today.

771
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:52,469
- Garrison Commander!
- Huh?

772
01:09:52,469 --> 01:09:54,069
Garrison Commander!

773
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:57,019
Hey, run away for now!

774
01:10:03,369 --> 01:10:05,749
- Go that way.
- Yes.

775
01:10:05,749 --> 01:10:07,669
Are you okay?

776
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:16,689
Who are you that

777
01:10:16,689 --> 01:10:21,099
you are hiding your face in the middle of the capital and swinging a sword around?

778
01:10:21,099 --> 01:10:23,499
Did you come back because you didn't trust

779
01:10:23,499 --> 01:10:26,709
the Capital Garrison and you were worried about the capital's security

780
01:10:26,709 --> 01:10:31,889
or could there be a different reason you came back?

781
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:36,439
It is not because I do not trust Capital Garrison.

782
01:10:36,439 --> 01:10:39,419
Now that I spotted you again...

783
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:52,979
...you can never leave my sight.

784
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:56,579
I am not one to get caught so easily.

785
01:10:57,299 --> 01:11:00,749
I shall give you a chance.
