1
00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:51,159
Seriously, did you have to do it yourself when your shoulder hurts?

2
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:57,109
I am sure someone worries about the old lady who lost her shelter to escape the rain.

3
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:58,819
Gosh.

4
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,479
So, the one who is worried will come and do it himself.

5
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:11,259
Sir, put this on, at least.

6
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:12,529
What?

7
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,249
When you work in a dusty place like this,

8
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:17,939
you should put these things around your neck.

9
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,549
Otherwise, your throat will be sore, and you will have a runny nose all day.

10
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,609
Do it like this and...

11
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:26,369
I am fine.

12
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,159
There.

13
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:38,599
What is this?

14
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,729
No one is looking. So what?

15
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,549
- Turn around now.
- What?

16
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:45,139
When you are working...

17
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,599
Your arm.

18
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:51,339
Convenience is the best thing.

19
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,499
How is it?

20
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,499
Well, it is not too bad.

21
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,619
I will wrap things up here,

22
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:15,609
so you go find out where the old lady is staying.

23
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:17,059
Yes.

24
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:33,789
You are from back then!

25
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:35,899
W-What is this now?

26
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:38,569
- Is it another masked one?
- Guess so.

27
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:40,759
He is somewhat tall and all.

28
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,509
I think I saw him from somewhere.

29
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:45,069
What are you holding right now?

30
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,019
- It is rice.
- O-Oh, my, are you crazy?

31
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:48,089
How can you tell him?

32
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:49,169
Did you steal it?

33
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,749
G-Goodness, seriously.

34
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:54,909
W-What makes you think we would steal from others?

35
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,489
I know.

36
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,219
Speak the truth.

37
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,869
Where did you get the rice from?

38
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:08,719
- N-No, we absolutely did not steal it.
- Yes, yes...

39
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,209
A person who was masked just like you gave it out for us to eat.

40
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:13,069
H-He is right.

41
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:15,229
- Masked?
- Yes.

42
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:18,329
Where is that person right now?

43
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,869
Over there.

44
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,929
For some reason, what happened today...

45
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:31,019
Feels quite familiar, right?

46
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,899
Seriously.

47
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,269
Stop!

48
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:06,249
Since I got caught, let go of the old lady, please.

49
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,209
What are you doing here?

50
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,199
Why are you looking like that?

51
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,109
- Are you two on the same side?
- No!

52
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:15,829
Do not add to the trouble and go on.

53
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:16,899
I am trying to help you.

54
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,449
Be quiet. Do you not see this sword?

55
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,799
- I will get taken instead—
- You can take me.

56
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,869
I do not need either of you. Hand over the child.

57
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:25,969
Who on Earth are you ordering to take you?

58
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:28,059
If you come close, I will take this man's life—

59
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,609
That is not my problem.

60
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:31,199
That was too mean!

61
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,069
If it were not for you, this would not even have happened.

62
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:36,559
Oh, really? This is all my fault?

63
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:39,829
Do you want to go at it with me?

64
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:42,609
How can you let him take your sword?

65
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:45,129
Do not worry. I will give it back once I am done.

66
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:46,499
Yes.

67
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,889
Go!

68
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:02,399
Goodness, Sook!

69
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,999
Oh, my.

70
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:11,869
Go to Myeongdogak right now and say a masked one helped you.

71
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,989
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

72
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,779
I am your opponent.

73
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,589
Captain! Sir!

74
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:34,799
He must be from the Capital Garrison!

75
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:37,389
- Let us go!
- Captain!

76
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:59,599
My goodness.

77
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,019
They are the ones you need to arrest.

78
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,329
Why are you chasing me?

79
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:27,039
Because I know where they came from,

80
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,489
but I do not know your purpose.

81
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,199
What could it be? You saw it all.

82
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,389
I am saying this because I saw it all, but why—

83
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,679
What are you doing right now?

84
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:38,059
Let go of me!

85
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:40,109
Let go of me!

86
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:57,629
It is fine now.

87
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,069
- Have you gone mad?
- I was curious...

88
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:07,469
about who you were that you would dare be so shameless in front of the captain.

89
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:11,179
Maybe you have a trustworthy sponsor...

90
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:16,329
or you are a noble of high stature who would not fear a mere captain—

Sir! Captain!

93
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:29,039
Sir, are you okay?

94
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:33,439
A masked one.

95
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,579
A full moon?

96

My Midam?
[Mask + Full Moon = Legendary Midam]

97
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:41,449
Sir, it was Midam.

98
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:43,159
Bi Chan—

99
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:46,889
I think my shoulder got worse.

100
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:51,999
That is not important right now. That was our Midam.

101
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:53,519
What are you saying?

102
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,099
I do not see anything.

103
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:59,499
I am sure I saw her. Did you not see him?

104
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,419
- Bi Chan.
- Yes.

105
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:05,769
I am not in a good condition today, so let us go back now.

106
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,219
Yes.

107
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:12,459
Gosh! You really did not see him, Sir?

108
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,449
No. Let us go now.

109
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:16,079
I am sure that was Midam.

110
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,779
Goodness.

111
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,129
- Yeon Seon.
- Yes?

112
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:33,659
Why do you think Kang Pil Jik's henchmen were trying to take that child?

113
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,549
She was not like Ggot Nim, whose father sold her off.

114
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:41,919
It could not have been to feed, shelter, and care for her like you did for me, could it?

115
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,439
Then?

116
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,019
If it were not for you, I would also have been caught by their likes

117
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:50,109
and sold off to a brothel or as someone's concubine.

118
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:52,499
Because no one would have known.

119
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:56,779
It would not be strange at all for someone to die here.

120
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:00,109
Or maybe life was too hard, so she ran away.

121
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:03,229
Those trashy bastards.

122
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:07,749
Saving someone is a great deed,

00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:11,759
but you said they were Kang Pil Jik's henchmen.

124
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,449
Did you already forget they tried to kill Grand Merchant?

125
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:16,349
How can I forget that?

126
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:19,549
I am too outraged to see them still running around all high and mighty.

127
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:22,299
They kill people like it is nothing.

128
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:24,229
Nothing good will come out of getting involved.

129
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:27,859
I should have kicked them all out of the capital so I would not have to deal with them.

130
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,479
They even use swords against a child.

131
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:31,519

You are a noble of high stature who would not fear a mere captain—

136
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,359
No way.

137
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:51,979
Gosh, how would he know who I am?

138
00:09:51,979 --> 00:09:55,149
They will turn the entire capital upside down to look for the masked one now.

139
00:09:55,149 --> 00:10:00,019
You really have to be careful. Okay?

140
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:03,289
I will be really careful.

141
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:07,619
First, contact Myeongdogak to check if the old lady and her granddaughter are okay.

142
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:08,959
Yes.

143
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:16,609

147
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:29,639
You get scolded every day anyway, so what does it matter now?

148
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:32,579
You are the meanest of them all.

149
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:39,869
Have you called for me, Mother?

150
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:44,629

163
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:36,069
Are we going somewhere?

164
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:40,639
No, go inside for now.

165
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:45,879
What! A masked man appeared and took the child?

166
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,559
It was the same man who caused a scene at the lodge before.

167
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,389
However, now that I see him this time,

168
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:53,609
I think he is the one who saved Jang So Woon seven years ago.

169

What? It was him?

170
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:59,659
Yes, in addition, there was another weirdo.

171
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,859
So I could not bring the child.

172
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:04,979

- You are sorry?

You know full well that I am just waiting to get him.

175
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:12,369

- I am sorry—
- If you say...

00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:28,419
and another mistake,

181
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:35,929
I hold myself back by thinking about the half-rotten potato you shared with me back when I was a hungry butcher,

182
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:39,769
I think about it again, and again...

183
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,199
Take note.

184
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,929
Hyungnim!

185
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:46,959
Go at once and find the masked one.

186
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,459
Yes!

187
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:11,499
I am sure I told you not to appear before me.

188
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,169
I came because you told me to return it.

189
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,239
Let go of me!

190
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:37,189
Sir, a new romance novel has just come in.

191
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:45,419
[Day Flower]

192
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:49,299
Two were found dead at Gyeongsang-do.

193
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:52,039
Three are still nowhere to be found.

194
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:56,399
Jeong Hae Joon, Pyo Hyeon Woong, Cho Seong Hoo.

195
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:04,499
Tell them to hurry up on the next issue.

196
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:06,369
Yes, Sir.

197
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:09,229
Just try it on.

198
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,869
Try it on. Go ahead.

199
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:18,559
Disguising as a man would be safer than a mask.

200
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,339
- How much is this?
- That one is one nyang.

201
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,499
- How much is that?
- That one is one nyang, too.

202
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:32,609
- How much is this one?
- You chose the expensive one.

203
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:41,959
Is it a gift for your lover?

204
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:44,329
A lover? I do not have such a thing.

205
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:47,279
If you do not, just say so. Why get so serious about it?

206
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,259
Because you are accusing the wrong person.

207
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:53,129
In that case, who are you buying that hat for?

208
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:55,579
W-Well, that is...

209
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,259
for myself!

210
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:02,209
By the way, what brings you here, Sir?

211
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:06,369
I was also looking to buy a hat.

212
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:10,769
We meet so often, so it would be great to exchange names.

213
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:14,019
My name is Park Yoon Hak.

214
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:16,519
Okay, thank you for telling me.

215
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:19,089
Hold on.

216
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,449
Why are you leaving without a reply?

217
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,479
Are you asking for my name as well right now?

218
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:34,719
Who else would I be asking right now, then?

219
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:40,349
My name is Yeon Seon.

220
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:42,899
Lee Yeon Seon.

221
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,859
All right.

222
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:51,659
Let me see this.

223
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:58,739
This one would be the best fit for you.

224
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,349
I will see you next time, then.

225
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:19,139
I did not doubt at all you would get this back for me.

226
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:27,649
After losing the drawing, I was so upset.

227
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:30,509
I could not even eat or drink.

228
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:32,259
Can you see?

229
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,189
I lost weight.

230
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:36,589
I did find the drawing—

231
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:40,449
Yes, did you catch the bastard who should rot in hell?

232
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:44,399
The thing is, I could not catch the thief.

233
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,139
What?

234
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,949
You could not catch him?

235
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,269
Also, after I got the drawing, I saw a crack inside the fillet.

236
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:55,719
What? Where?

237
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:58,029
Whoa, it really is cracked.

238
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:00,059
Do you know how much this is worth?

239
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:03,319
This drawing cannot be damaged in any way.

240
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:06,859
No! These fillets you see right here

241
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,879
were made using a 100-year-old paulownia tree.

242
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:12,899
What are you going to do? What will you do?

243
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:15,589
I am sorry.

244
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:18,869
Sorry or whatever. You take responsibility.

245
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:19,719
Sorry?

246
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:23,589
You could not even catch the thief and got the fillet cracked, so you take responsibility!

247
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,919
- However—
- If you do not

248
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,329
have it replaced with the same one, I will not let you be.

249
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:31,399
Do you understand?

250
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:34,529
My goodness, how wretched.

251
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,579
Give it one more practice.

252
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,779
- No, no, do not waddle around like that.
- Waddle?

253
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:51,409
You have to tread lightly like a butterfly.

254
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:58,449
No, no, no, you cannot flail around your arms.

255
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:03,259
Walk softly like how the first snow falls on a tree branch.

256
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:09,339
No, no, your legs cannot be crooked like that.

257
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:13,119
No, no, do not waddle around like that.

258
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,639
You have to tread lightly like a butterfly.

259
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:23,309
No, no, do not mooch around like that.

260
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:27,669
All right, there you go. Lower your hands and

261
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:30,209
bring your legs together now.

262
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,299
No, no.

263
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:38,199
Gosh! O-Oh, my!

264
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:40,119
Have you gone mad?

265
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,589
How are you unable to do this?

266
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,209
Again!

267
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:52,039
What are you doing, Wife?

268
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:56,359
You are home, Your Excellency.

269
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:59,149
Were you waiting for me outside until it got this late?

270
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:00,769
You could have waited inside.

271
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:02,679
Have you arrived, Father?

272
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,059
Yes, Sweetheart, have you—

273
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:12,399
Father?

274
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:15,409
Why are you coming out from there?

275
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:20,349
As you know, our eldest daughter-in-law has become an example for all women.

276
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:26,949
She was practicing getting out of a palanquin gorgeously, treading lightly like a picture.

277
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:32,999
I see.

278
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,799
But the sun has set now.

279
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,879
I reckon you should call it a day here and try again tomorrow.

280
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:48,659
O-Oh, okay. We will do that.

281
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:51,409
You can go inside and rest for today.

282
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:53,259
Yes, Mother.

283
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,929
- Now, please come in.
- Yes.

284
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:13,709
Your Excellency,

285
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:19,219
Her Highness Queen Dowager has gifted "Good Conduct for Women" to our eldest daughter-in-law.

286
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:23,059
This is it.

287
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:26,469
Thanks to our eldest daughter-in-law, I can finally afford to

288
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:30,009
utter a good report in front of our deceased ancestors.

289
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,609
You did so well.

290
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:34,309
However,

291
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:38,489
how can it be our eldest daughter-in-law's doing?

292
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:43,739
It is your doing for having taught her so well.

293
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:47,939
You are the one who taught the orphaned girl

294
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:52,599
everything from A to Z, are you not?

295
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:55,439
- Your Excellency...
- Right.

296
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,839
That is an apple.

297
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,829
It was sent from Cheongsong for His Majesty as a royal offering.

298
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:12,869
I remembered that you like apples.

299
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,139
So, I secretly brought one with me.

300
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:19,689
Oh, my.

301
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:27,099
My, I cannot tell where the apple is.

302
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:29,259
M-My goodness.

303
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:45,489
[Seok Jeong]
This is all because of you.

304
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:50,959
[Rest in Peace, Seok Jeong Ji]

305
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:58,489
My Lady.

306
00:21:58,489 --> 00:21:59,919
Goodness.

307
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,399
Gosh, do you know how many times I got in and out of the palanquin?

308
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:05,949
I cannot even stand right now.

309
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,349
Near the end, the sky was turning yellow.

310
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:10,359
Gosh, I am nauseous, too.

311
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:13,209
Straighten your legs first. I will massage them for you.

312
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:15,739
Wait! What did Myeongdogak say?

313
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:19,549
They sent the old lady and the child to a safe place,

314
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:21,949
but the child said something odd before leaving.

315
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:24,129
Something odd?

316
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:26,479
She said she will tell you the details in person later.

317
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,379
Straighten them.

318
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:29,759
I will have to go see her.

319
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,749
- R-Right now?
- Goodness gracious.

320
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:36,059
How can I wait until later?

321
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:38,009
I knew you would do this.

322
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:41,239
I prepared a carriage just in case.

323
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:43,449
A carriage?

324
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:47,209
Since your legs hurt, you probably can't run.

325
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:05,029
Your lips will reach the outer walls of the capital.

326
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:07,399
Are you still mad at me?

327
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,739
No matter what I think, it is weird.

328
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:11,589
What is?

329
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:14,729
You and Midam...

330
00:23:15,449 --> 00:23:17,339
know each other. Right?

331
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:19,329
That is such nonsense.

332
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:20,449
W-We don't.

333
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:23,239
You somehow obtained the drawing Midam had stolen and

334
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:25,249
yesterday's happening was also...

335
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,819
Please be honest with me now.

336
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:32,659
Bi Chan.

337
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,589
Do you know where they sell fillets made with 100-year-old paulownias?

338
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:40,029
Do not change the subject!

339
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:45,609
I think your Midam is the one who cracked the Finance Minister's fillet.

340
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:48,149
From what I saw earlier, he would have her killed—

341
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:49,999
Myeongdogak.

342
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:08,889
Yeon Seon said My Lady cannot walk, and

343
00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:11,229
told me to bring a carriage.

344
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:13,019
But she said I must not bring a palanquin.

345
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:15,189
Do not even talk about palanquins.

346
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:16,699
Yes.

347
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:20,189
We are almost there.

348
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:21,849
Please hang in there even if it is uncomfortable.

349
00:24:21,849 --> 00:24:24,809
Not at all. I am very comfortable.

350
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:29,319
It feels like I am lying on top of a cloud.

351
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:39,619
- Goodness, goodness! Thank you for your work!
- Oh, hi.

352
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:44,119
- Hi.
- Oh, you are here.

353
00:24:53,189 --> 00:24:55,129
[Myeongdogak]

354
00:24:58,179 --> 00:24:59,979
- My goodness.
- Please be careful.

355
00:24:59,979 --> 00:25:01,989
Over here.

356
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:04,609
Gosh!

357
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:07,799
My legs are killing me.

358
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:18,359
Gosh, Grand Merchant, what is the matter?

359
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:21,609
After receiving your letter, I asked the child a few questions.

360
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:25,349
She said she heard other children's voices when she was taken.

361
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:27,629
Other children?

362
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:33,249
Are you saying this may not be a kidnapping of a single child?

363
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:35,259
I am scared.

364
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:39,319
I also felt something was off, so I am looking into this more.

365
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,989
During the last few years, in areas near Hanyang,

366
00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:45,149
there were a lot of cases where children her age have disappeared.

367
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:47,119
I am scared.

368
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,479
I want to go home.

369
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:54,409
Kang Pil Jik, that scum, does that kind of stuff, too?

370
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:56,119
It would not be surprising.

371
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:59,519
For money, he would not hesitate to sell children to get rich

372
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:01,649
and not feel even an ounce of guilt.

373
00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:05,829
Grand Merchant, keep a watch on the goods that go in and out of Kang Pil Jik's business.

374
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:11,439
And also, look into areas near Pil's Lodge where children might be detained.

375
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:14,539
So, what are you going to do?

376
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:17,089
If you really secure evidence of human trafficking,

377
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:20,189
what are you going to do, then?

378
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,729
This is on a different level from the things you have been doing.

379
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:27,129
You might suffer greatly and

380
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:29,789
this may make you Kang Pil Jik's target.

381
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,689
Grand Merchant,

382
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:34,219
I know what you are worried about.

383
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:40,529
However, if there are children who are desperately waiting for help,

384
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:44,549
we need to do what we can first. Right?

385
00:26:50,129 --> 00:26:53,279
We will need someone to handle the aftermath.

386
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,709
Everything aside, we need a trustworthy person

387
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:59,279
who can take on Kang Pil Jik.

388
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:02,409
What is the matter?

389
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:06,739
Grand Merchant, Garrison Captain is here.

390
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:09,089
Wait! Why did he come here again?

391
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:12,639
For now, please hide in there.

392
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:17,469
Gosh, my legs.

393
00:27:26,889 --> 00:27:29,419
What brings you here?

394
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:31,919
I am sorry for coming at this late hour.

395
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,579
The Finance Minister's drawing's—

396
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:42,129
The Finance Minister's drawing's fillet has cracked.

397
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:45,419
So, I came to ask if you have one like this.

398
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:48,429
It is a paulownia tree, huh?

399
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:54,119
If I do not have it restored, he is prepared to chase the thief to hell.

400
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:57,329
Are you trying to help the one who stole the drawing?

401
00:27:57,329 --> 00:27:58,879
What are you saying?

402
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:01,849
I just do not want things to get complicated.

403
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:06,429
From what I hear, you can find all kinds of things at Myeongdogak.

404
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:08,169
You came to the right place.

405
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:10,299
I will check if we have it in stock.

406
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:12,309
Could you wait for a moment, please?

407
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:13,919
Surely.

408
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:25,089
I know you are listening in on me.

409
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:27,699
Please come out now.

410
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:36,969
If you are not going to come out, I might as well go in.

411
00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:39,379
It is barely big enough for me alone.

412
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:58,559
You make a scene every time.

413
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,439
Gosh, why did you come here this time?

414
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:04,969
Because the drawing's fillet was cracked.

415
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:08,719
Then, I will leave you to your business.

416
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:13,159
My, my. You cannot just leave like this.

417
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:16,799
I was yelled at by the Finance Minister and almost had my head

418
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,629
cracked open because of you-know-who.

419
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:26,449
I was going to visit where you live anyway.

420
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:30,849
You are the one who broke the fillet, but I got yelled at, which was unfair.

421
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,029
How would you know where I live?

422
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:35,069
I came here because I do not know.

423
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:40,939
If you are scared of getting yelled at by the Finance Minister, I will take it to him.

424
00:29:40,939 --> 00:29:43,359
Put it back down.

425
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:47,149
I will try jumping his house walls one more time.

426
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:49,829
Hand it over now.

427
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,079
I said, hand it over—

428
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:25,019
What is all this?

429
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:29,759
Did you put them in there?

430
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:31,919
Did you put them in there?

431
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:42,799
Did you find the masked man?

432
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,879
I watched Myeongdogak all day,

433
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:47,529
but there were no traces of the masked man.

434
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:52,089
However, I did see the captain enter Myeongdogak.

435
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:54,819
The captain entered Myeongdogak?

436
00:30:56,369 --> 00:31:00,259
He would not have gone to buy a ring for his lover.

437
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:04,579
The masked man, Park Su Ho, and Myeongdogak...

438
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:08,279
What about the item?

439
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,419
I filled in one more head, so I will send it right away.

440
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:12,239
All right.

441
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:14,609
Nobody would know even if they died.

442
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:17,229
If we send them on the boat going out this time,

443
00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:20,299
they should earn us the money to bribe the Finance Minister.

444
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:22,089
Yes.

445
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,099
Please have your conversation while sitting down.

446
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:39,199
What happened to the people from yesterday?

447
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:43,369
I moved the old lady and the child to a safe location.

448
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:46,019
Do you do that every single time?

449
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:47,749
What are you talking about?

450
00:31:47,749 --> 00:31:50,739
For kids like that child yesterday or someone like Ggot Nim.

451
00:31:50,739 --> 00:31:53,089
Gosh, well...

452
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:58,419
We will need someone to handle the aftermath.

453
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:04,649
Everything aside, we need a trustworthy person who can take on Kang Pil Jik.

454
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:10,619
If someone commits wrongdoing,

455
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:14,159
will you be able to arrest whoever that may be?

456
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,739
That is my job.

457
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:20,469
Can I really trust you?

458
00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:22,729
Of course.

459
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:31,549
It appears Kang Pil Jik is kidnapping children.

460
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,009
That child we rescued yesterday heard other children.

461
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:37,299
I will have someone at Myeongdogak look into it more—

462
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:39,529
That will not be possible.

463
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:42,629
There is a national law in this country,

464
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:45,939
so the one who needs to fix this is not Myeongdogak,

465
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:47,869
but the Capital Garrison.

466
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:52,549
If this is true, everything will be processed according to national law.

467
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:54,369
According to national law, you say?

468
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:58,699
What I am saying is that a mere masked man should not

469
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:00,859
stir up the city for this.

470
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:12,749
Goodness.

471
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:24,269
We have confirmed the deaths of two people we were looking for in Gyeongsang-do.

472
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:27,619
And there are three others whose whereabouts are still unknown.

473
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:31,309
Jeong Hae Joon, Pyo Hyeon Woong, Cho Seong Hoo.

474
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,109
Are they all the Head of the Royal Guards, Im Kang's men?

475
00:33:34,109 --> 00:33:37,769
Yes, they are royal guards who disappeared

476
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:41,009
from the palace after the former king passed away.

477
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:46,269
That night, someone had left with my father's jade plate.

478
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:52,199
If we find that man, we may be able to find out the truth of what happened that day.

479
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:55,539
We are searching everywhere for any leftover traces.

480
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:58,539
So, please wait a little bit longer.

481
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:03,289
This time, we will be able to find him for sure, Your Majesty.

482
00:34:09,499 --> 00:34:13,209
[Cho Seong Hoo]

483
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:16,169
So, you want to do what?

484
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:19,379
I think we need to investigate Kang Pil Jik's merchandising business.

485
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:24,189
Stop right there. How many times have I told you that you should not bother them?

486
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:28,109
Do you know what may happen to you if you disturb the hornet's nest?

487
00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:31,819
He held a Tujeon gambling ring at Pil's Lodge last time.
(Traditional Korean poker)

488
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:36,189
Also, I saw one of his men kidnapping a child from the slum village.

489
00:34:36,189 --> 00:34:38,919
Kidnapping a child?

490
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:42,389
That was probably something his subordinate did on his own.

491
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,299
He took over the entire Unjong Steet commercial district.

492
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:46,309
Why would he want to kidnap children?

493
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:51,499
Because we keep going easy on him, Kang Pil Jik looks down on us.

494
00:34:51,499 --> 00:34:53,869
What? Looks down on us?

495
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:55,289
Think about it.

496
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:58,209
Garrison Commander, you are the face of the Capital Garrison!

497
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:00,829
What does he think of you

498
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,829
that he would send the bill for Tujeon gambling like that?

499
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:07,759
Garrison Commander, I hold no grudge about my salary being cut.

500
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:11,409
But if we just let things slide by like this so easily,

501
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,219
what would Kang Pil Jik think of us?

502
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:15,169
What! So easily?

503
00:35:15,169 --> 00:35:17,689
He dares view our Capital Garrison as a bowl of soup?

504
00:35:17,689 --> 00:35:20,039
There is circumstantial evidence.

505
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:26,009
With your permission, I will catch him red-handed and lift up the name and honor of the Capital Garrison.

506
00:35:26,009 --> 00:35:31,749
Also, Garrison Commander, you need to do something like this to rise up much higher.

507
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:34,039
You are right.

508
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:37,789
How long am I supposed to rot here?

509
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:42,269
The honor of the Capital Garrison and my wings are in your hands—

510
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:44,159
No...

511
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:47,169
Let us go right now.

512
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:50,999
I will lead the way!

513
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:58,629
A mere masked man?

514
00:35:58,629 --> 00:36:02,589
Well, fine! I am sure they will take care of everything at the Capital Garrison!

515
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:05,139
My Lady, you were quite hurt by that.

516
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:06,739
Hurt?

517
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:09,309
Everything he said was all correct.

518
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:10,929
What would I do by catching Kang Pil Jik?

519
00:36:10,929 --> 00:36:13,429
Throw him in jail or send him into exile?

520
00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:14,799
If the law fixes everything,

521
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:17,469
why would people experience injustice and why would you jump walls?

522
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:21,359
What is the point of jumping walls when I am a mere masked man?

523
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,279
Still, the Capital Garrison says they will investigate Kang Pil Jik.

524
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:25,699
Please let it go.

525
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:27,959
If everything will be fixed according to the law,

526
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:30,819
who cares how I am treated?

527
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:32,989
I am a mere masked man, after all.

528
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,759
The captain will probably hurry, too, since he has seen something.

529
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:41,589
I wonder if he will follow the procedure and find the children first...

530
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:44,149
Lady Madam.

531
00:36:44,149 --> 00:36:45,469
What is it?

532
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:49,629
The Peonies Meeting is here, so you are to come down.

533
00:36:49,629 --> 00:36:51,619
All right.

534
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:53,639
I will be back.

535
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:00,469
[Good Conduct for Women]

536
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:03,389
How happy must you be?

537
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:10,399
Now, you should receive the Memorial Gate.

538
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:14,269
Did you decide to send her to watch her husband's tomb?

539
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:19,129
That is...

540
00:37:21,229 --> 00:37:25,879
There is no way you are bringing up the Memorial Gate

541
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:30,989
for receiving the Queen Dowager's "Good Conduct for Women."

542
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:38,329
A Memorial Gate is not something to be decided by tomb-watching, either.

543
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:54,019
A-Are you going to enter first?

544
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:56,019
You should enter.

545
00:37:56,949 --> 00:38:01,779
I will show him the might of the Capital Garrison today.

546
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,959
Welcome.

547
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:17,739
Have you been well, too?

548
00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:19,959
Thanks to you, I am.

549
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:21,439
Have a seat.

550
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:23,489
Yes, Mother.

551
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:35,299
Well, I wanted to thank you all for helping out last time.

552
00:38:35,299 --> 00:38:40,589
How about we go to see the flowers tomorrow?

553
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:43,939
- That sounds great!
- Sounds good.

554
00:38:43,939 --> 00:38:46,689
What about your daughter-in-law...

555
00:38:47,669 --> 00:38:51,949
coming out with us?

556
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:59,389
What are your thoughts?

557
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:07,679
I need to read Mother's thoughts.

558
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,679
Mother's thoughts...

559
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:12,179
[Mother's Thoughts]

560
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:18,479
Thank you for asking,

561
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:23,409
but I am concerned that my heart will be stirred up by being intoxicated by beautiful things,

562
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:26,499
so I will only accept your thoughts.

563
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:30,099
It is a shame.

564
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,859
What brings you here, Garrison Commander?

565
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:45,969
The thing is...

566
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:49,939
about the Tujeon gambling last time...

567
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:51,569
Goodness.

568
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:56,379
Were you upset that I sent the bill to the Capital Garrison?

569
00:39:56,379 --> 00:39:58,969
That is not it.

570
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:02,439
Is that not illegal?

571
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:08,279
It was a social gathering of esteemed individuals.

572
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:19,489
I heard there was circumstantial evidence of buying and selling children using illegal high-interest loans.

573
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:24,249
I cannot let them steal my hard-earned money!

574
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:29,159
Then, well, so, but...

575
00:40:30,049 --> 00:40:32,059
Kidnapping.

576
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:39,749
There is an eyewitness who saw you kidnap a child a few days ago.

577
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:44,299
That is something that has nothing to do with me.

578
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:48,309
Oh. Not too long ago,

579
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:53,939
my men rescued a child from being taken away by a masked man.

580
00:40:53,939 --> 00:40:56,519
Is that a problem?

581
00:40:57,209 --> 00:41:00,439
Since we received a report,

582
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:05,879
I think we should follow procedure and have you come to the Capital Garrison for a cup of tea

583
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:09,639
and hear the details from you. What do you think?

584
00:41:10,529 --> 00:41:14,779
This is so upsetting, Garrison Commander. Why are you doing this?

585
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:18,989
- You out there!
- Yes, sir!

586
00:42:07,009 --> 00:42:10,169
Search everywhere for any Tujeon gambling or illegal activities in the lodge.

587
00:42:10,169 --> 00:42:12,049
Yes, sir!

588
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:15,649
See if there are any places where the children may be locked up.

589
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:17,929
Yes.

590
00:42:20,649 --> 00:42:23,459
I heard Kang Pil Jik was taken into the Capital Garrison.

591
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:25,649
The great Kang Pil Jik was taken in?

592
00:42:25,649 --> 00:42:27,249
Really?

593
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:28,689
Goodness.

594
00:42:28,689 --> 00:42:31,229
Tavern Lady, is that really true?

595
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:33,609
Yeah, you did not know?

596
00:42:36,029 --> 00:42:38,389
Oh, you should eat more.

597
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:01,259
They do not seem to be in there.

598
00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:02,729
It may not be located inside.

599
00:43:02,729 --> 00:43:05,899
Stay and search the nearby area, Bi Chan.

600
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:08,279
Okay. Are you heading into the Capital Garrison?

601
00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:11,359
I must talk with Kang Pil Jik.

602
00:43:23,419 --> 00:43:27,249
Where are you going right now dressed like that?

603
00:43:28,479 --> 00:43:30,949
It is a message from Hwal Yoo.

604
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:33,449
They went to Kang Pil Jik's house first according to the procedure,

605
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:35,469
and they could not find the children.

606
00:43:35,469 --> 00:43:38,199
It is Pil's Lodge of all places.

607
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,559
I will just go to see if the kids are all right.

608
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,209
There may really be children locked up there.

609
00:43:43,209 --> 00:43:45,879
Still, it is dangerous to go in a mask.

610
00:43:45,879 --> 00:43:48,419
Then what? Should I go dressed in mourning clothes?

611
00:43:48,419 --> 00:43:53,269
I prepared this just in case of the worst-case scenario.

612
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:57,509
Since this is a really urgent situation...

613
00:44:29,729 --> 00:44:31,949
Look here, give me some wine.

614
00:44:31,949 --> 00:44:33,909
Okay.

615
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,719
I am sure you did not call me here to brag about your chairs.

616
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:17,889
I am a busy man. What do you want with me?

617
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:22,519
A few days ago, someone witnessed a child being kidnapped by unidentified assailants.

618
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,289
I know.

619
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:28,579
I heard that a masked man is going around here and there in the city.

620
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:34,419
Should you not catch him instead of me?

621
00:45:56,919 --> 00:46:00,269
That day, according to the testimony of the witness,

622
00:46:00,269 --> 00:46:05,639
your men were threatening a child with a sword, not the masked man, Merchant Kang.

623
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:07,839
Goodness.

624
00:46:08,649 --> 00:46:13,549
I do not know who it was, but he must have a grudge against me and slandered me.

625
00:46:13,549 --> 00:46:18,249
Is that not something that happens often among merchants?

626
00:46:18,249 --> 00:46:24,449
Captain, it appears you have wasted your time over something trivial.

627
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:29,139
We will find out if it was a waste of time after doing a bit more investigating.

628
00:46:29,139 --> 00:46:32,699
We will see if what the eyewitness saw was true or not.

629
00:46:38,539 --> 00:46:41,289
Sometimes, innocent curiosity...

630
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:44,589
can lead to disaster.

631
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:53,499
What happened with the Capital Garrison officers?

632
00:46:53,499 --> 00:46:56,599
It appears they were unable to find anything out of place, so they left.

633
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:58,249
Good thing we brought them here.

634
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:02,949
Until we send them off to Jemulpo tomorrow night, guard this place so not even a mouse gets in.

635
00:47:02,949 --> 00:47:04,749
Yes, sir.

636
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:50,689
Who is there?

637
00:47:55,959 --> 00:48:00,659
Where is the outhouse around here?

638
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:03,049
That way. Go that way.

639
00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:04,839
Oh, I see.

640
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:06,879
Thank you.

641
00:48:06,879 --> 00:48:09,559
Gosh, goodness.

642
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:27,549
- I said, the outhouse is that way!
- What is the matter?

643
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,649
Thank you so much.

644
00:48:34,649 --> 00:48:37,879
On this moonlit night!

645
00:48:40,499 --> 00:48:42,539
Is this the way to the outhouse?

646
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:45,479
Or is it that way?

647
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:50,899
Why are you being like this? You should stop now.

648
00:48:50,899 --> 00:48:55,669
Royal Secretary of Defense! This is clearly the Finance Minister's abuse of authority!

649
00:48:55,669 --> 00:48:59,049
Even if the Finance Minister is close to Merchant Kang Pil Jik,

650
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:01,979
there is no way he did so for personal gain.

651
00:49:01,979 --> 00:49:06,599
I heard that the Finance Minister periodically receives bribes from Kang Pil Jik.

652
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:08,429
I know all about the rumors.

653
00:49:08,429 --> 00:49:10,789
Look here! Who do you think you are slandering?

654
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:11,959
It is probably not true.

655
00:49:11,959 --> 00:49:15,949
You would not believe the rumors that he even took for himself

656
00:49:15,949 --> 00:49:17,319
- the produce offered to the king?
- That is right!

657
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:20,649
You even stole from the king's offerings?

658
00:49:20,649 --> 00:49:23,239
What are you saying, you bastard? Say that one more time!

659
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:25,049
- Let me finish you off today!
- Come on!

660
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:27,789
- Come here!
- Do not just yell.

661
00:49:27,789 --> 00:49:30,719
- You little!
- Come here!

662
00:49:32,029 --> 00:49:37,419
But are the Finance Minister and the Justice Minister not coming?

663
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:41,939
Why are they not coming without a word?

664
00:49:41,939 --> 00:49:47,369
There was a minor argument between the Finance Minister and the Justice Minister.

665
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:49,559
That is probably why...

666
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:52,429
Are you saying that the Finance Minister and the Justice Minister got into a fight?

667
00:49:52,429 --> 00:49:55,609
Tell us in detail what you mean.

668
00:49:55,609 --> 00:50:02,069
From what I heard, it appears the Finance Minister wants someone that the Capital Garrison arrested set free.

669
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:03,689
Strange.

670
00:50:03,689 --> 00:50:06,529
Why would the Finance Minister get involved with the affairs of justice?

671
00:50:06,529 --> 00:50:09,939
That is why he got furious.

672
00:50:09,939 --> 00:50:13,619
Who did he say to release?

673
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:16,229
I heard it was the head merchant of the

674
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:20,349
greatest merchandising business in our country, who is close to the Finance Minister.

675
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:25,369
If it is the greatest merchandising business in Joseon, are you referring to Hwayeon Merchandising?

676
00:50:26,409 --> 00:50:32,619
Your Majesty, it has been a long time since it has changed to Kang Pil Jik's Merchandising.

677
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,439
If what you are saying is true, Royal Secretary of Defense,

678
00:50:36,439 --> 00:50:40,239
this is a breakdown of the court's discipline.

679
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:45,719
Your Majesty, I will summon the Finance Minister and the Justice Minister and rebuke them sternly.

680
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:47,209
Well...

681
00:50:47,889 --> 00:50:49,869
do not rebuke them too harshly.

682
00:50:49,869 --> 00:50:53,979
If it is not a major problem, try to wrap it up here.

683
00:50:53,979 --> 00:50:56,339
I understand.

684
00:50:56,339 --> 00:50:59,159
I will look into the details of this matter

685
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:02,039
and resolve it well.

686
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:04,399
Do so.

687
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:09,759
Captain Park Su Ho!

688
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:12,649
What is the matter?

689
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:14,929
I told you it was a hornet's nest!

690
00:51:14,929 --> 00:51:18,449
Do not say anything more, and release Kang Pil Jik immediately!

691
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:20,459
But we have not finished our investigation. Why release him?

692
00:51:20,459 --> 00:51:22,449
Right now, the investigation is not the problem!

693
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:25,429
I am about to lose my head!

694
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:28,479
Were you trying to screw me over?

695
00:51:28,479 --> 00:51:32,999
I heard you broke the Finance Minister's expensive fillet for the drawing!

696
00:51:32,999 --> 00:51:35,029
Damn it!

697
00:51:46,959 --> 00:51:49,529
Your brother is the Royal Secretary of Defense,

698
00:51:49,529 --> 00:51:52,789
so I guess you have nothing to fear.

699
00:51:52,789 --> 00:51:55,509
Regardless of who my brother is,

700
00:51:56,849 --> 00:52:00,049
it would be nothing in comparison to your supporter.

701
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:03,849
If you knew my supporter was so powerful,

702
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:07,929
you should not start problems.

703
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:11,819
Unlike how I seem, I tend to hold onto grudges,

704
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:14,849
so your life may be in danger.

705
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:18,179
Are you worrying about my life as well?

706
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,359
Next time, I will not just let it slide.

707
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:43,839
Kang Pil Jik was released?

708
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,499
As soon as he was released, the news spread throughout the city.

709
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:48,089
What about the children?

710
00:52:48,089 --> 00:52:50,919
I think there are children locked up in Pil's Lodge for sure!

711
00:52:50,919 --> 00:52:52,769
Since Kang Pil Jik was released,

712
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:56,769
I do not think the Capital Garrison will be able to act immediately...

713
00:52:56,769 --> 00:52:59,099
Gosh, that darned captain!

714
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:04,149
I should have known it when he used public authority for personal reasons. Gosh...

715
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:10,839
Oh my goodness!

716
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:13,579
Look who this is.

717
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:18,689
Goodness, goodness.

718
00:53:18,689 --> 00:53:22,189
It appears you are not happy to see me.

719
00:53:22,189 --> 00:53:25,219
I heard you were released in just one day.

720
00:53:25,219 --> 00:53:30,499
It appears your power is quite great, Merchant Kang.

721
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:34,719
What do you mean, power?

722
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:38,139
I was merely released because I was innocent.

723
00:53:38,139 --> 00:53:41,279
What a useless effort to hide your shame!

724
00:53:41,279 --> 00:53:44,809
Some day, you will pay the price.

725
00:53:49,729 --> 00:53:54,289
You really should see that happen before you die.

726
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:59,409
Then I shall be on my way. I am behind in work.

727
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:01,999
Let us go.

728
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:14,139
This looks exactly like it.

729
00:54:14,139 --> 00:54:16,249
Great work. You should go now.

730
00:54:16,249 --> 00:54:18,209
Okay.

731
00:54:31,249 --> 00:54:34,749
- Brother.
- I heard the Capital Garrison arrested Kang Pil Jik.

732
00:54:34,749 --> 00:54:38,079
He was already released before the investigation was completed.

733
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,919
Did you step up and arrest him?

734
00:54:42,109 --> 00:54:46,729
Did I not already tell you he is not just any merchant?

735
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:51,449
I have already seen for myself a few times.

736
00:54:51,449 --> 00:54:55,749
The illegal Tujeon gambling ring at Pil's Lodge and the kidnapping of children in the slum village...

737
00:54:55,749 --> 00:54:58,799
I could not keep silent any longer!

738
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:02,029
Do you think that will be resolved that easily?

739
00:55:02,029 --> 00:55:04,229
So many people in the court are tied to him!

740
00:55:04,229 --> 00:55:10,179
How could a military official on a nation's payroll do nothing when they see injustice?

741
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:14,789
If it were you, could you do that, Brother?

742
00:55:21,049 --> 00:55:23,289
What is this?

743
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:29,089
It is a document that shows Kang Pil Jik's Merchandising stealing the king's offerings from the court.

744
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:34,629
To catch him, it is impossible to do so with just a few weak circumstantial evidence.

745
00:55:34,629 --> 00:55:37,179
You need to gather up corroborative evidence,

746
00:55:37,179 --> 00:55:38,849
and catch him in one go.

747
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:40,669
Brother...

748
00:55:40,669 --> 00:55:42,389
Be careful.

749
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:44,859
Do you understand?

750
00:55:44,859 --> 00:55:46,459
Yes.

751
00:56:04,939 --> 00:56:06,299
Any issues at the lodge?

752
00:56:06,299 --> 00:56:08,079
No, nothing much.

753
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,949
What about the Capital Garrison bastards?

754
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,579
They did not come anywhere near here.

755
00:56:13,129 --> 00:56:16,499
We should have caught and killed them.

756
00:56:17,189 --> 00:56:21,329
I am tired after losing sleep because of some nobody.

757
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:24,199
I will go inside and get some rest.

758
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:37,519
My "A White Tiger in the Mountains"...

759
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,819
I replaced the fillet with the same kind.

760
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,659
A hundred-year-old paulownia tree?

761
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:53,579
Yes. Please check to see if it is the same.

762
00:56:59,069 --> 00:57:01,469
It looks to be right.

763
00:57:04,949 --> 00:57:06,719
Great work.

764
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:08,249
Here.

765
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:11,259
You should have a drink, too.

766
00:57:15,749 --> 00:57:17,089
What is this?

767
00:57:17,089 --> 00:57:20,449
This came out of the drawing's fillet.

768
00:57:23,609 --> 00:57:25,959
You should throw away something like this.

769
00:57:25,959 --> 00:57:28,989
Are you messing with me?

770
00:57:28,989 --> 00:57:33,559
Why did you bring something useless like this?

771
00:57:37,209 --> 00:57:39,329
Then, I will be on my way.

772
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:43,109
You were the one...

773
00:57:43,769 --> 00:57:47,819
who had Merchant Kang taken into the Capital Garrison. Right?

774
00:57:49,259 --> 00:57:53,389
Do you know what a hassle I went through because of that?

775
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:57,419
If a person is too upright, that is also a problem.

776
00:57:57,419 --> 00:58:02,399
You need to know to be flexible and overlook things at times.

777
00:58:03,319 --> 00:58:05,229
You may leave.

778
00:58:23,619 --> 00:58:28,069
How many days has it been already?

779
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:33,029
Madam says to make up your mind now.

780
00:58:33,029 --> 00:58:35,249
All right.

781
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:38,459
You may leave.

782
00:58:59,439 --> 00:59:02,889
Minister of Justice, you bastard!

783
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:07,529
Your Excellency!

784
00:59:07,529 --> 00:59:09,819
That damned bastard...

785
00:59:11,579 --> 00:59:13,669
You have had enough to drink.

786
00:59:13,669 --> 00:59:15,699
Just leave it.

787
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:19,989
You should put away the table now and go to sleep.

788
00:59:20,649 --> 00:59:23,749
How dare you touch this!

789
00:59:27,979 --> 00:59:30,109
Your Excellency...

790
00:59:31,649 --> 00:59:34,449
The living "Good Conduct for Women"!

791
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:37,709
Because people respect you,

792
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:41,089
you have become so arrogant.

793
00:59:41,089 --> 00:59:42,799
You are drunk.

794
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:47,919
If those who revere you as the "Good Conduct for Women" knew who you really were,

795
00:59:47,919 --> 00:59:50,909
I wonder how their faces would change.

796
00:59:52,749 --> 00:59:54,679
I am just so curious.

797
00:59:54,679 --> 00:59:56,559
You should stop now.

01:00:02,249 --> 01:00:03,849
Stop it now, Your Excellency!

801
01:00:03,849 --> 01:00:05,929
And yet, you dare...

802
01:00:05,929 --> 01:00:09,469
look down on me!

803
01:00:13,979 --> 01:00:16,449
You would look down on me?

804
01:00:17,209 --> 01:00:19,249
Get up!

805
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:22,119

It has been a while, Your Excellency.

815
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:50,559
I am sorry for disturbing you because of me.

816
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,549
I have drawn attention to myself over something trivial while doing business.

817
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:58,259
Something trivial, you say?

818
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:03,419
Your name was spoken of in the palace.

819
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:07,049
And yet, did you just say it was something trivial?

820
01:02:07,049 --> 01:02:10,089
I will never act rashly again.

821
01:02:10,089 --> 01:02:12,289
Did you forget?

822
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:17,239
You lived like a beast, and I made you the head merchant of a merchandising business.

823
01:02:17,239 --> 01:02:19,909
- Was that not enough?
- That is not so!

824
01:02:19,909 --> 01:02:22,319
I am always grateful to my core for the kindness you showed me—

825
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:28,149
You do not mistakenly believe that what you did 15 years ago was a major accomplishment, do you?

826
01:02:28,149 --> 01:02:32,359
I swear I never thought that. Not even in my dream.

827
01:02:33,429 --> 01:02:36,489
- Pil Jik.
- Yes?

828
01:02:37,649 --> 01:02:42,849
I know that a horse needs fodder to make him run.

829
01:02:42,849 --> 01:02:46,649
However, if the horse shakes off the owner to eat the fodder,

830
01:02:46,649 --> 01:02:50,069
will the horse's neck be safe?

831
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:56,509
I...

832
01:02:56,929 --> 01:03:00,759
really hate cumbersome things.

833

Do not forget that.

834
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:06,059
Yes, sir! I will take that to heart.

835
01:04:17,449 --> 01:04:21,029

I prepared it just in case you are unable to go out in a mask.

840
01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:48,899
Did you spend all the money you have saved for things like this?

841
01:04:48,899 --> 01:04:50,439
I did not know that...

842
01:04:50,439 --> 01:04:55,439
and worried how you could not buy a house yet after all the money you got from me.
