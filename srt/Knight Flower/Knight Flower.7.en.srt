1
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:41,617
I am the eldest daughter-in-law of the Left State Minister,

2
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:45,260
Cho Yeo Hwa.

3
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,327
You chose to break through head-on?

4
00:00:53,327 --> 00:00:57,917
I trust you will not tell anyone about my identity, Sir.

5
00:00:57,917 --> 00:01:00,517
I am this country's captain. How can you trust me—

6
00:01:00,547 --> 00:01:02,997
I know you have helped me every time, Sir.

7
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:06,507
- I never helped you
- Not me.

8
00:01:06,507 --> 00:01:10,067
You helped the helpless people.

9
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:14,507
Ggot Nim and the children who were trafficked.

10
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:18,007
The Finance Minister's servant and his lover, too.

11
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:22,187
All of them were incidents you helped me with.

12
00:01:23,657 --> 00:01:28,567
I got involved in all of them by coincidence.

13
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:32,007
Did you ask me why I go to this extent?

14
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:43,357
As you know, Sir, I am a widow.

15
00:01:43,357 --> 00:01:45,007
A widow is...

16
00:01:45,747 --> 00:01:47,807
a sinner.

17
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:51,537
Because my husband, who I have never met, died,

18
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:54,817
I must wear mourning clothes, eat small amounts, and

19
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:57,127
cannot even leave my house for the rest of my life.

20
00:01:57,127 --> 00:02:02,537
For I am a sinner who is not allowed to do anything...

21
00:02:03,217 --> 00:02:05,337
besides missing my husband.

22
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:10,387
The way for me to atone for my sin is

23
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:15,887
to die to follow my husband in the end.

24
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,857
I am afraid I might become someone who is

25
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:23,507
only waiting for her death because I cannot do anything.

26
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:26,717
Since I am a sinner just for being alive,

27
00:02:26,717 --> 00:02:31,557
I am doing whatever I can to live on.

28
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:35,927
So...

29
00:02:36,647 --> 00:02:38,317
would you give me...

30
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:43,207
a chance at life as well, please?

31
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:52,877
[Knight Flower - Episode 7: It is right under your nose]

32
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:56,107
Did you just say the Left State Minister's eldest daughter-in-law?

33
00:02:56,107 --> 00:02:58,267
Yes, Your Majesty.

34
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:02,687
Six months after a man named Cho Seong Hoo went missing,

35
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:06,727
his younger sister got married to the Left State Minister Seok Ji Seong's oldest son.

36
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:09,387
How could such a thing...

37
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:11,727
Were they engaged since they were young?

38
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:14,507
That did not seem to be the case.

39
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:18,257
This can never be a coincidence.

40
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:21,647
Someone like the Left State Minister suddenly accepted a daughter-in-law

41
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:23,867
from an unknown family with no reputation?

42
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:29,257
If Cho Seong Hoo had received the jade pendant from the late king,

43
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:34,407
the Left State Minister could have taken his sister hostage to get him.

44
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:36,397
He could easily do something like that.

45
00:03:36,397 --> 00:03:40,177
If he did, Cho Seong Hoo would not have been able to show up easily.

46
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:45,577
Perhaps that madam might know her brother's whereabouts.

47
00:03:45,577 --> 00:03:49,907
He clearly seems to be the one who received Father's last secret order.

48
00:03:49,907 --> 00:03:54,567
So, find out in detail how his sister became the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law

49
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,567
and if there is anything she knows.

50
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,567
Yes, Your Majesty.

51
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,427
I will...

52
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:25,767
give you a chance.

53
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:36,207
However, you must be within my sight, whatever it is you may do.

54
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:38,797
What do you mean by that?

55
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:42,057
How can I save your life?

56
00:04:43,257 --> 00:04:47,527
Therefore, so you will not do anything reckless again,

57
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:50,417
do not leave my sight.

58
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:55,497
I only do small deeds like giving out rice and

59
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:58,617
- medicinal herbs—
- Small deeds?

60
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,547
You dared to jump over Dangsanggwans' residence walls,
(Government officials)

61
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:04,607
stole a criminal at the Criminal Arresting Agency,

62
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:06,907
and pointed your sword at a captain just now.

63
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,697
That is not something you should say.

64
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,097
I will be watching you.

65
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:16,527
If you jump over the Left State Minister's walls again,

66
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:18,447
I will be walking into...

67
00:05:19,157 --> 00:05:20,627
your house's...

68
00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:24,387
entrance gates.

69
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:48,057
What did the Finance Minister's wife say she will do from now on?

70
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,287
The thing is...

71
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:53,977
Since she lost her husband, tell her to live without making any noise.

72
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:57,997
Fitting the title of the Living Good Conduct for Women,

73
00:05:57,997 --> 00:06:03,767
she should seclude herself to a hermitage deep in the mountains.

74
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:05,767
- However—
- Why?

75
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:09,067
Do you want to join her so you can serve her there?

76
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,107
N-Not at all.

77
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:14,657
I will deliver Your Excellency's words without leaving a word out.

78
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:19,267
In that case, wrap up the Finance Minister's matter that way.

79
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:26,687
Your Excellency.

80
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:32,897
There is a person who has been a concern for me.

81
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:35,917
He is the captain who has been after the Finance Minister's case.

82
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:40,807
But it is difficult for this humble one to meddle with.

83
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:43,387
Who is it?

84
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:46,347
His name is Park Su Ho,

85
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:49,717
the younger brother of Park Yoon Hak, Royal Secretary of Defense.

86
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:52,797
The younger brother of the Royal Secretary of Defense would be...

87
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,137
Is he the Grand Chancellor's son?

88
00:06:56,137 --> 00:06:59,797
Yes, when he turned ten more than a decade ago,

89
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:02,687
he was suddenly adopted.

90
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:08,507
The rumors also say he is a bastard child the Grand Chancellor had out of wedlock.

91
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:12,737
There is no way it's him for he is too upright.

92
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:21,267
Find out more about him in more detail.

93
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:24,587
Yes.

94
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:49,197
How did it go?

95
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:52,637
A complete fail.

96
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:55,547
"Do not leave my sight."

97
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:58,407
He should just not help if he is going to threaten me.

98
00:07:58,407 --> 00:08:01,197
To me, it does not sound like a threat.

99
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:03,127
How will he keep watch over me?

100
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:06,167
Will he barge into my house or what?

101
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:09,677
I should have followed Madam Baek when she left.

102
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:11,267
Just give me the word.

103
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:14,597
I will make a village for widows in Gaegyeong.

104
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:22,927
Right, Madam Baek said something odd to me before leaving for Hamgyeong Province.

105
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:28,597
The ring the Finance Minister's wife said Yong Deok stole.

106
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:30,367
Madam Baek's ring?

107
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:35,477
She said she already knew it belonged to Madam Baek.

108
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:41,477
Wait! Are you saying the Finance Minister's wife gave a false testimony?

109
00:08:43,627 --> 00:08:46,757
Why on Earth would the Finance Minister's wife do that?

110
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:51,987
The Elder has...

111
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:55,147
totally forgotten my contribution, huh?

112
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:57,717
That is what I am saying.

113
00:08:57,717 --> 00:09:03,127
However, you probably will not be going into seclusion for real.

114
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:06,337
If you first reside by his grave,

115
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:12,437
I will secretly secure a place for you in the Qing Dynasty.

116
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:17,477
What did I do wrong that I have to go to the Qing Dynasty?

117
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:19,847
The entire Joseon is in Elder's hands.

118
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:24,427
So you cannot go against his will.

119
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:31,577
Who is the one who put the said Joseon in his hands, and what now?

120
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:38,557
He will not be able to get rid of me so easily.

121
00:09:47,697 --> 00:09:50,107
Sir, this is not the time for you to be here.

122
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:53,337
The entire capital is talking about how the corpse disappeared!

123
00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:54,177
What do we do?

124
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:58,047
What if our Midam gets arrested at this rate?

125
00:09:58,047 --> 00:10:01,137
Bi Chan, there is a job you must do.

126
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:02,667
Sorry?

127
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:14,407
Would this not be better for your Midam?

128
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:17,117
Is it not the love of the century?

129
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:21,907
Our fate, which could not be fulfilled in this life, I will meet you in my next life!

130
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:23,547
And the Garrison Commander must also—

131
00:10:23,547 --> 00:10:27,617
If he knows as well, the entire capital will be only a matter of time!

132
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,727
Speaking is one of my strengths.

133
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:32,467
Yes, check on Myeongdogak whenever you can, too.

134
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:35,437
I will fulfill my entrusted duties!

135
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:45,777
They said to beware of a silent man and still water.

136
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:50,577
Does it even make sense for a widow to go beyond the walls?

137
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:56,547
Her facial expression did not even change when she pretended to be womanly and shy.

138
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:59,567
How dare she fool around outside at night?

139
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:00,427
Mother—

140
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:03,407
There is a limit to how much shame she can bring to the family.

141
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:06,787
That arrogant wife of the Minister of General Affairs

142
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:10,397
stopped eating and is sick in bed.

143
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:11,877
However,

144
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:18,327
how fortunate it is that I have no need for such worries?

145
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:24,467
I always thought the Minister of General Affairs' daughter-in-law could not even be compared to you.

146
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:27,017
It is all thanks to your teachings, Mother.

147
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:33,547
Yes. And since such a thing happened, you will have to be extra careful.

148
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:35,077
I will keep that in mind.

149
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:39,747
And know that I will be watching even the smallest movements you make.

150
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:44,467
Yes.

151
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:49,317
Oh, what a cruel fate!

152
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:52,157
How can you be leaving in such sorrow,

153
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:56,227
abandoning the one you love?

154
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:59,127
So, what happened to his corpse?

155
00:11:59,127 --> 00:12:04,047
Looking for her lover's corpse that was thrown away in a barren land,

156
00:12:04,047 --> 00:12:07,317
she wanders all night long, and

157
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:09,787
- she finally found it.
- This is so sad.

158
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:14,637
Thinking he might still be alive, she tries to breathe life into him.

159
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:21,487
But his cold corpse did not say anything in return.

160
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:24,357
How is that woman going to live from now on?

161
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:29,087
With her small body, she dragged the big corpse of her lover and

162
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:34,397
that is how she disappeared from the world.

163
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:43,867
What a beautiful and sad story.

164
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:48,467
Sir, are you okay?

165
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:02,987
Who said you can do business here?

166
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:05,727
Let me tell you who did.

167
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:08,467
I told myself that I can.

168
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:12,627
How dare you speak such nonsense so fearlessly! Do you even know who this street belongs to?

169
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:19,207
From what I can see, you do not seem to be the owner of this street.

170
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:28,577
I clearly know from here to there that this is Woonjong Street!

171
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:30,667
Am I wrong?

172
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,267
I am right!

173
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:35,017
I am— Folks!

174
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,537
Am I wrong? Anyhow!

175
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:42,317
- Put it back to how it was and apologize!
- Apologize?

176
00:13:43,077 --> 00:13:44,277
Say that again.

177
00:13:44,277 --> 00:13:46,117
Hold on.

178
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:49,367
Are you okay?

179
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:57,977
Wow! You would not be able to do this if you knew who I was.

180
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:02,827
Hold on.

181
00:14:02,827 --> 00:14:05,037
What are you all doing?

182
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:12,667
Stand up.

183
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:16,497
Thank you.

184
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:20,097
Drawing your swords on Woonjong Street in broad daylight?

185
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:21,957
Have you no care for the laws?

186
00:14:21,957 --> 00:14:24,777
Look who we have here.

187
00:14:27,447 --> 00:14:32,117
Why are you scolding my men this time?

188
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:37,817
You should just look the other way and disregard the merchants' turf war.

189
00:14:38,717 --> 00:14:42,817
Oh, I only tried to stop them thinking they were thugs.

190
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:45,357
You know so little about the world.

191
00:14:45,357 --> 00:14:48,957
That is how you can barge into places fearlessly.

192
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:50,607
Oh, right.

193
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:54,827
I heard you also went to the Criminal Arresting Agency regarding the Finance Minister's case.

194
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:59,227
You are the one who has a lot of interest in this incident, Merchant Kang.

195
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:02,687
I cannot help but be interested!

196
00:15:04,997 --> 00:15:10,427
That bitch Jang So Woon and you are involved, Sir.

197
00:15:14,177 --> 00:15:19,207
There is a girl who comes to pick up needlework at the Capital Garrison. Right?

198
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:21,247
Goodness! My, my!

199
00:15:21,247 --> 00:15:27,377
Seeing how surprised you are, I am curious about who she is.

200
00:15:27,377 --> 00:15:31,207
Now, then, please take care.

201
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:42,537
Thank you for the help.

202
00:15:42,537 --> 00:15:45,227
My name is Joo Yo Seop.

203
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:51,017
I lived in a different country for a long time.

204
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,467
I apologize.

205
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:57,917
By the way, what happened to Woonjong Street, which used to be friendly and affectionate?

206
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:01,147
If you are planning to sell goods,

207
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:04,867
go to Myeongdogak and ask the Grand Merchant.

208
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:07,357
Sorry for the trouble when we just met.

209
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:17,257
Though it looks like this, I made all parts of this plum hairpin by hand.

210
00:16:17,257 --> 00:16:20,007
Gift it to your lover.

211
00:16:20,007 --> 00:16:22,147
I-I do not have such a thing, so it is okay.

212
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:26,677
Hey, now! I can just tell you have one.

213
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:30,147
It is my thanks, so please accept it.

214
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:34,427
- Wait— br> - All right.

215
00:16:39,657 --> 00:16:41,907
The Royal Family, the example for all people,

216
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:45,217
is stopping the Finance Minister's wife from residing by the grave?

217
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:47,337
That has never happened in all eternity.

218
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:52,087
Still, how can I coldly reject my mother's earnest request?

219
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:54,007
She heard the word early in the morning

220
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:58,417
and even ended up crying, saying she could not let Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong go like that.

221
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,077
Your Majesty should not get involved in this in the first place.

222
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:07,737
Could you not make a reason for the Finance Minister's wife to stay in Hanyang?

223
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:11,447
She has shown great generosity to the less fortunate people all this time.

224
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,497
If the Royal Court takes charge and comes up with a great cause—

225
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:20,077
If the Queen Dowager interferes with the Finance Minister's wife's matter due to personal feelings,

226
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:23,217
it will be a mockery in the end.

227
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:29,217
So, you must dissuade her and perform your duties as her son, Your Majesty.

228
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:38,527
You have become much thinner in the meantime.

229
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:45,117
There were a lot of things to care for and organize before leaving.

230
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:47,777
So I must have waned a bit.

231
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:51,077
When are you leaving to reside by the grave?

232
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:53,227
I am not sure.

233
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:58,517
I was going to leave tomorrow if I could,

234
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:04,057
but Her Highness Queen Dowager won't allow me to.

235
00:18:04,057 --> 00:18:08,027
You have a lot of things to do here, Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong.

236
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:11,547
So, if you go like that, I would be sad as well.

237
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:15,547
I am also sincerely sad that I did not get to befriend you,

238
00:18:15,547 --> 00:18:21,067
Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong, and your daughter-in-law more closely.

239
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:24,047
We can start visiting more often now if anything.

240
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:26,877
The reason why I came to you today is

241
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:33,507
because I actually would like your daughter-in-law's teachings.

242
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:35,077
Sorry?

243
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:38,837
Though she had visited me in the past, I told her not to come anymore

244
00:18:38,837 --> 00:18:41,197
because I was preoccupied with thoughts of leaving.

245
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:45,437
But I do not think I will be able to leave for a while.

246
00:18:45,437 --> 00:18:50,217
So, I would have lots to learn from your daughter-in-law,

247
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:53,887
who has already been a widow for many years.

248
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:57,527
How could I dare to teach you, Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong?

249
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:58,947
Please take back your words.

250
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:03,817
She is right. My child should be the one learning from you.

251
00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:13,917
In that case, what do you think about her keeping me company

252
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:16,337
in my house from time to time?

253
00:19:36,387 --> 00:19:40,587
Oh, Royal Secretary of Defense!

254
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:42,867
Are you on the way to meet His Majesty?

255
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:47,757
Yes, he asked to play janggi for the first time in a long time, so I came to keep him company.
(Korean chess)

256
00:19:47,757 --> 00:19:50,067
You work so hard for His Majesty.

257
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:53,077
But I've never even bought you a drink.

258
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:55,077
My, I am not deserving.

259
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:57,527
I am only doing what I have to do.

260
00:19:57,527 --> 00:20:00,407
They said to strike the iron while it is hot.

261
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,487
Will you come to my house this evening?

262
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:08,137
Yes, it would be my pleasure if you would invite me any time.

263
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:10,567
I will be waiting, then.

264
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:14,107
Oh, right.

265
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:19,827
I heard you have a brilliant younger brother.

266
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:23,397
You should bring him with you on the way.

267
00:20:23,397 --> 00:20:25,777
Are you talking about my younger brother?

268
00:20:25,777 --> 00:20:28,777
I heard he is a talent who placed first on the martial exam.

269
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:32,927
It will be nice to meet him while we are at it.

270
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:39,007
Yes.

271
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:41,837
I will be waiting, then.

272
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:59,897
Yeon Seon, the Finance Minister's wife is acting strange—

273
00:20:59,897 --> 00:21:01,167
Oh, my!

274
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,697
I was surprised, too!

275
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:07,607
Yeon Seon told you she was going to the bookstore earlier and left.

276
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:09,927
Oh, did she?

277
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:11,477
By the way, what brings you here?

278
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:14,387
It was too quiet, so I came in.

279
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:17,907
But you were sitting and staring blankly.

280
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:23,887
Madam said we are having guests today.

281
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:26,717
So, she wants you down by the kitchen.

282
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:28,447
I got it.

283
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,827
What are you doing right now?

284
00:21:56,827 --> 00:22:00,087
Oh, I-I came to buy something.

285
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:05,947
You should be looking at the goods, then. Why have you been looking at people like this?

286
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:08,227
Could it be you are looking for someone?

287
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:10,097
Gosh, not at all.

288
00:22:10,097 --> 00:22:11,047
A criminal?

289
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:12,527
Goodness, definitely not the case!

290
00:22:12,527 --> 00:22:13,287
A lover?

291
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:16,427
Gosh, absolutely not the case!

292
00:22:17,157 --> 00:22:19,747
Who are you looking for, then?

293
00:22:22,017 --> 00:22:28,247
With such a beautiful face, how can you every time...

294
00:22:29,107 --> 00:22:32,267
Did you say I am beautiful?

295
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:40,627
Did I leave the fire on by the furnace?

296
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:50,027
Gift it to your lover.

297
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:51,897
I-I do not have such a thing, so I am fine.

298
00:22:51,897 --> 00:22:55,717
Hey, now! I can just tell you have one.

299
00:23:13,717 --> 00:23:16,877
My mind has been unruly because I can't sleep at night.

300
00:23:21,677 --> 00:23:25,297
Hey, did you hear?

301
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:28,997
What are you talking about?

302
00:23:28,997 --> 00:23:32,447
The criminal who killed the Finance Minister.

303
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:38,047
Gosh, he loved ever so passionately!

304
00:23:38,047 --> 00:23:39,967
I heard.

305
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:45,077
However, if there is a man who stole a felon's corpse, he must be caught and beheaded.

306
00:23:45,077 --> 00:23:46,867
The Capital Garrison should catch him and—

307
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:49,297
I will not let him!

308
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:54,637
How can you be so harsh?

309
00:23:54,637 --> 00:23:57,267
Even after hearing such a sad story,

310
00:23:57,267 --> 00:24:04,387
are you really going to look away from the heartfelt sorrow?

311
00:24:04,387 --> 00:24:07,737
Well, then. What should we do?

312
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:11,137
The higher-ups said to dismiss the case already.

313
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:16,057
So, do not reignite the fire by trying to look for the corpse thief.

314
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:21,237
I will not let that happen!

315
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:27,067
I understand.

316
00:24:31,897 --> 00:24:33,367
What is the matter?

317
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:37,797
The Royal Secretary of Defense wants a word with the captain.

318
00:24:37,797 --> 00:24:39,937
Brother does?

319
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,907
- Tavern Lady.
- Gosh, hello.

320
00:24:41,907 --> 00:24:45,347
- Give me a bowl of soup and rice and some rice wine.
- Yes.

321
00:24:45,347 --> 00:24:47,177
Welcome.

322
00:24:47,177 --> 00:24:51,087
The Left State Minister invited my younger brother and me to his house just now.

323
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:52,837
How did he know about your younger brother?

324
00:24:52,837 --> 00:24:56,787
I do not have a good feeling about this, Your Majesty.

325
00:24:57,687 --> 00:25:02,217
It cannot be a coincidence for such things to occur in a row.

326
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:07,797
Before things turn south, I must hurry and meet your younger brother.

327
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:12,717
What is the matter?

328
00:25:12,717 --> 00:25:14,537
There is a place we must go together.

329
00:25:14,537 --> 00:25:16,347
Where are we going?

330
00:25:16,347 --> 00:25:19,737
The Left State Minister invited us to his home.

331
00:25:19,737 --> 00:25:21,147
The Left State Minister did?

332
00:25:21,147 --> 00:25:25,357
Why? Have you met the Left State Minister before?

333
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,317
N-No, I have not.

334
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,167
I have never met him yet.

335
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:33,047
Su Ho.

336
00:25:33,697 --> 00:25:36,527
No matter what the Left State Minister says today,

337
00:25:36,527 --> 00:25:38,597
you better not answer him thoughtlessly.

338
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:39,717
Sorry?

339
00:25:39,717 --> 00:25:42,177
You will find out the reason in time.

340
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:45,137
So, watch out for everything you say and do.

341
00:25:45,137 --> 00:25:47,257
I will do that.

342
00:25:47,257 --> 00:25:48,867
Yes.

343
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:54,117
[Joseph Joo]

344
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:57,997
Hence, if you lend me a sales stand,

345
00:25:57,997 --> 00:26:02,647
I will give 20% of my profit to Myeongdogak.

346
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:08,007
Your skills are quite good.

347
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:13,537
Well, these Western-styled goods are not common.

348
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:18,287
So, customers will storm into Myeongdogak like clouds.

349
00:26:19,237 --> 00:26:21,657
And this is just between you and me.

350
00:26:26,697 --> 00:26:29,577
I am very good with my words.

351
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:40,387
O-Oh, okay, then.

352
00:26:40,387 --> 00:26:43,297
You will start with 20%, but once your business is going,

353
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:45,927
what do you say you give 30%?

354
00:26:45,927 --> 00:26:51,757
Instead, we will store and deliver your goods.

355
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:54,487
Okay.

356
00:27:01,627 --> 00:27:04,207
Our deal has been sealed now.

357
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:07,197
You can start selling tomorrow.

358
00:27:07,197 --> 00:27:09,487
- I got it.
- Additionally...

359
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:11,527
You can enter!

360
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:19,677
My name is Ggot Nim.

361
00:27:20,197 --> 00:27:23,087
This child will be your assistant from now on.

362
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:26,737
I will show you around Myeongdogak, so follow me.

363
00:27:29,177 --> 00:27:30,847
Now, then.

364
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:40,947
His looks and speech are weird,

365
00:27:42,237 --> 00:27:45,227
but he is surely a nobleman's son.

366
00:27:46,017 --> 00:27:47,817
Who could it be?

367
00:27:55,057 --> 00:27:57,027
Welcome home, Your Excellency.

368
00:27:57,027 --> 00:28:01,507
I made you busy by suddenly saying there will be guests. Right?

369
00:28:01,507 --> 00:28:05,967
Not at all. It is naturally the duty of the women's quarters.

370
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:09,777
Daughter-in-law, it must have been hard for you today, so you should go in and rest now.

371
00:28:09,777 --> 00:28:11,877
Yes, Father.

372
00:28:12,427 --> 00:28:16,597
Your Excellency, the Royal Secretary of Defense has arrived.

373
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,227
You came at the perfect time!

374
00:28:24,227 --> 00:28:26,237
Yes, Left State Minister.

375
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,487
Welcome.

376
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:29,967
Thank you for your precious time.

377
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:33,267
Thank you for having us over.

378
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:38,037
You must be the Royal Secretary's younger brother.

379
00:28:38,037 --> 00:28:39,377
Please let me introduce myself.

380
00:28:39,377 --> 00:28:42,957
My name is Park Su Ho, and I am the captain of Capital Garrison.

381
00:28:44,027 --> 00:28:46,257
I heard a lot about you.

382
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,397
It is a pleasure to meet you.

383
00:28:48,397 --> 00:28:53,237
Yes, I have also been wanting to meet you.

384
00:28:54,397 --> 00:28:56,767
All right, let us go up now!

385
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,437
- Yes.
- Yes.

386
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:06,477
All right, let us get back to our business.

387
00:29:07,987 --> 00:29:11,497
What are you doing here? Hurry up and go back inside.

388
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:13,607
Yes, Mother.

389
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:25,277
I did not even jump the walls today.

390
00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:27,867
Why on Earth did he come here?

391
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:30,767
Why is Yeon Seon still not home?

392
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:33,877
Though we have been cut off for a long time now,

393
00:29:34,597 --> 00:29:37,937
I have studied together with the Grand Chancellor and

394
00:29:37,937 --> 00:29:41,247
I had personally taught you when you were young.

395
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:44,767
But I feel I have been too indifferent so far.

396
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:52,217
It is an honor to be able to come to your house, for all officials respect you.

397
00:29:54,647 --> 00:29:58,997
Hearing such a thing in person is quite embarrassing.

398
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:01,857
Let us keep in touch more often from now on.

399
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:04,217
All right.

400
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:15,717
By the way, I heard you joined the Grand Chancellor's family when you were about ten?

401
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:22,847
Now, I know the Grand Chancellor's character quite well.

402
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:26,047
So, I do not believe those nonsensical rumors.

403
00:30:27,897 --> 00:30:30,937
He must have adopted you, knowing you were talented enough

404
00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:33,007
to take first place in the martial exam. Right?

405
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:35,787
I do not really know much about the situation back then.

406
00:30:35,787 --> 00:30:39,657
I just consider it fortunate I gained a good younger brother.

407
00:30:39,657 --> 00:30:41,087
My, now.

408
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:44,837
Yet you did not care when your brother worked in rural areas for three years.

409
00:30:44,837 --> 00:30:48,547
You are quite the inflexible one.

410
00:30:49,367 --> 00:30:52,357
Deep down, are you not upset about your brother who is like that?

411
00:30:52,357 --> 00:30:55,607
I have never thought so.

412
00:30:55,607 --> 00:31:00,547
Come find me whenever you run into a problem in the future.

413
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:08,397
I will help you without the Royal Secretary knowing.

414
00:31:11,117 --> 00:31:14,667
He must not bother you for personal matters.

415
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:17,927
I consider my people to be important.

416
00:31:17,927 --> 00:31:22,427
If he is a man of talent, he will be appointed to a good position as he deserves.

417
00:31:22,427 --> 00:31:25,857
I consider even my current position to be too good for me.

418
00:31:25,857 --> 00:31:30,737
Alas, your humility is too much.

419
00:31:32,037 --> 00:31:34,317
Please excuse me while I go to the outhouse.

420
00:31:34,317 --> 00:31:37,117
Sure thing. You can go ahead.

421
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,827
I will now pay more attention

422
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:55,677
to your younger brother than you.

423
00:31:57,607 --> 00:32:01,177
You do not need to do that.

424
00:32:02,197 --> 00:32:04,217
He does not have much ambition,

425
00:32:04,217 --> 00:32:09,297
so he is probably sincere when he says his current position is already good enough.

426
00:32:09,297 --> 00:32:14,717
Unlike your usual self, you are quite a strict older brother to your younger brother.

427
00:32:31,927 --> 00:32:34,037
What are you doing?

428
00:32:43,647 --> 00:32:45,967
What are you doing here—

429
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:49,637
What are you doing here?

430
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:51,907
I saw someone who was eavesdropping,

431
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:56,147
so I was just going to ask you what you were so curious about.

432
00:32:56,147 --> 00:32:59,297
Well, I...

433
00:33:00,157 --> 00:33:01,517
I have something to tell you.

434
00:33:01,517 --> 00:33:03,737
Tell me.

435
00:33:03,737 --> 00:33:05,957
I am sorry.

436
00:33:06,557 --> 00:33:11,567
So, I plead with you. Please do not say anything to Father.

437
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:13,737
Do you even know why I am here?

438
00:33:13,737 --> 00:33:15,467
If you keep my secret,

439
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:19,347
then I will make sure to repay this debt.

440
00:33:20,757 --> 00:33:24,037
I do not believe I will ever be in your debt.

441
00:33:24,857 --> 00:33:26,527
The day you tell anyone,

442
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:31,167
I will become a resentful ghost and watch you.

443
00:33:35,477 --> 00:33:40,537
I definitely told you that I will keep you in my sight.

444
00:33:42,277 --> 00:33:44,457
I am just saying you should not forget it.

445
00:33:50,717 --> 00:33:55,337
It is still early, so it is a shame to have to say goodbye.

446
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:59,077
We should not bother you both any longer.

447
00:33:59,077 --> 00:34:02,187
It was an honor to be invited to your house like this.

448
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:05,827
Then I will see you again.

449
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:07,367
Have a safe trip home.

450
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:10,067
- Yes, Madam.
- Yes.

451
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:12,707
- Let us go.
- Okay.

452
00:34:30,187 --> 00:34:32,647
Brother, you should head home first.

453
00:34:36,317 --> 00:34:39,217
Do you have more to talk to me about?

454
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:44,697
Come to the bookstore on Woonjong Street at the hour of the monkey.
(Between 3:00 -5:00 p.m.)

455
00:34:44,697 --> 00:34:46,297
The bookstore?

456
00:34:46,297 --> 00:34:48,467
Do not be late.

457
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:12,737
It has been a few days since I last saw you.

458
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:15,147
You have been well. Right?

459
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:19,247
Why are you walking outside alone at such a late hour with no fear?

460
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:22,477
I happen to be coming from the Left State Minister's house, and I did not see you.

461
00:35:22,477 --> 00:35:23,997
Why were you there?

462
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:27,457
The Left State Minister invited us to have some drinks.

463
00:35:28,257 --> 00:35:31,837
By chance, did the captain go as well?

464
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:35,927
He did go with me...

465
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:42,137
But why are you asking that?

466
00:35:42,817 --> 00:35:44,727
W-Well...

467
00:35:47,407 --> 00:35:50,847
He is really tall...

468
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:53,527
and he is handsome in every way,

469
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:57,407
so is it not natural to be curious about him?

470
00:35:58,537 --> 00:36:01,747
But I am taller than him,

471
00:36:01,747 --> 00:36:05,867
and I think I am pretty handsome, too...

472
00:36:07,147 --> 00:36:08,847
Yes.

473
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:13,957
Nothing extraordinary happened today. Right?

474
00:36:13,957 --> 00:36:15,937
Like what?

475
00:36:17,157 --> 00:36:22,047
For example, was the captain looking for someone?

476
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:26,577
Or did he say things that made no sense?

477
00:36:26,577 --> 00:36:30,087
By chance, are you curious about whether he might have looked for you?

478
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,107
That is not it!

479
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:34,317
Forget it.

480
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:38,867
Wait. Let me ask you something, too.

481
00:36:39,537 --> 00:36:41,177
Your Lady.

482
00:36:41,177 --> 00:36:42,827
What about My Lady?

483
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:47,807
Well, I was just curious about what kind of person she is.

484
00:36:48,527 --> 00:36:50,847
What kind of person is she?

485
00:36:51,527 --> 00:36:55,317
She has a beautiful heart and a face like a fairy.

486
00:36:55,317 --> 00:36:59,957
I have never seen anyone more beautiful than My Lady—

487
00:37:02,177 --> 00:37:06,707
But why are you suddenly curious about My Lady?

488
00:37:06,707 --> 00:37:09,187
I mean, it is just...

489
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:12,097
You said she was as beautiful as a fairy,

490
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:15,907
so is it not natural for me to be curious about her as well?

491
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,447
Yes. You are right.

492
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,877
I guess that is natural.

493
00:37:26,707 --> 00:37:28,937
Then, have a safe trip home.

494
00:37:28,937 --> 00:37:32,717
Wait— Hey. Well—

495
00:37:36,077 --> 00:37:37,467
Gosh.

496
00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:41,937
Why did she get upset?

497
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:53,817
There is no way he tells anyone when I begged him like that.

498
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:05,767
"A friend who is good to meet"?

499
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:18,217
If you want to hear about your brother,

500
00:38:18,217 --> 00:38:23,857
give this book to the person who comes to you in five days.

501
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:41,327
♫ The faraway place where moonlight lives ♫

502
00:38:41,327 --> 00:38:49,367
♫ Shall I confess my feelings there? ♫

503
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:57,317
♫ Beyond the crimson-lit skies ♫

504
00:38:57,317 --> 00:39:05,597
♫ I wonder if my love whom I miss is living there ♫

505
00:39:05,597 --> 00:39:09,087
♫ My feelings keep growing ♫

506
00:39:09,087 --> 00:39:14,007
There is a girl who comes to pick up needlework at the Capital Garrison. Right?

507
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:17,207
Gosh, goodness, goodness.

508
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:21,757
I am so curious as to who she is.

509
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:27,957
My Lady!

510
00:39:27,957 --> 00:39:30,537
Madam is calling for you.

511
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,787
I will be there soon.

512
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:43,677
- Did you call for me?
- Yes.

513
00:39:43,677 --> 00:39:46,487
There is a Peonies Meeting at Myeongdogak,

514
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:50,407
and the Finance Minister's wife said to make sure to bring you.

515
00:39:50,407 --> 00:39:52,467
Go and get ready.

516
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:54,567
Okay, Mother.

517
00:39:58,247 --> 00:40:03,167
Oh, your eyes are like a deep blue sea.

518
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,537
How could you say such things?

519
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:12,097
There was a woman who had eyes the same color as this ring.

520
00:40:12,097 --> 00:40:17,817
The story of a Joseon man who fell madly in love with her and abandoned his family and parents.

521
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:21,277
He abandoned his family and parents?

522
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:23,967
I guess you are curious.

523
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:27,687
I will start right away. This man is—

524
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:29,977
- That guy must be crazy!
- Uh-oh.

525
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:32,357
How could he turn his back on his family and parents?

526
00:40:32,357 --> 00:40:33,727
Crazy, you say?

527
00:40:33,727 --> 00:40:35,947
That is more than possible when you are blinded by love.

528
00:40:35,947 --> 00:40:39,907
A young man and woman named Romeo and Juliet in that faraway country, England.

529
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:43,037
When the guy died first, the girl followed him in death.

530
00:40:43,037 --> 00:40:44,777
To the very moment they died, the two of them—

531
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:48,477
What is this? Is this a Loyal Wife Memorial Gate story?

532
00:40:48,477 --> 00:40:50,837
Tell us a different story than that one.

533
00:40:50,837 --> 00:40:52,097
Yeah.

534
00:40:52,097 --> 00:40:56,207
Are you not curious about the story of a man and a woman who gave up their lives for love?

535
00:40:56,207 --> 00:40:59,347
Why would I be curious about a woman who followed her husband to death?

536
00:40:59,347 --> 00:41:01,407
But did you hear?

537
00:41:01,407 --> 00:41:03,057
After Madam Baek left like that,

538
00:41:03,057 --> 00:41:07,057
I heard the Loyal Wife Memorial Gate will be given to the Left State Minister's household.

539
00:41:07,057 --> 00:41:09,047
Really? Really?

540
00:41:09,047 --> 00:41:10,797
Memorial Gate?

541
00:41:10,797 --> 00:41:12,877
The Left State Minister's household? Why to that house?

542
00:41:12,877 --> 00:41:17,417
What else? The king is giving it because she maintained loyalty to her husband.

543
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:21,887
I am not saying 15 years of keeping loyalty is easy, but does that really deserve it?

544
00:41:21,887 --> 00:41:26,057
Everyone is just accepting it because it is the Left State Minister's house.

545
00:41:26,057 --> 00:41:30,717
I heard from somewhere that the Left State Minister's wife, who appears so gentle,

546
00:41:30,717 --> 00:41:33,907
is obsessed with getting the Memorial Gate.

547
00:41:33,907 --> 00:41:39,247
Since the eldest son, who was to carry on the family line, died on his wedding day.

548
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,317
Goodness.

549
00:41:40,317 --> 00:41:45,237
Wait. The eldest son died? W-What do you mean by that? I—

550
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:46,767
Was there a wedding in that household?

551
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:49,377
You must not know because you were in the Qing Dynasty for so long.

552
00:41:49,377 --> 00:41:51,687
That woman is quite unfortunate, too.

553
00:41:51,687 --> 00:41:55,087
She did not even have her first night. After mourning for 15 years,

554
00:41:55,087 --> 00:41:57,947
she is being driven out to live by the grave in the end.

555
00:41:57,947 --> 00:42:01,647
- I really cannot live like that.
- Me neither!

556
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:04,777
Who are they saying died?

557
00:42:05,497 --> 00:42:07,387
I did?

558
00:42:11,277 --> 00:42:14,857
So, in the end, did they kill me off?

559
00:42:21,377 --> 00:42:23,517
Have you been well, Grand Merchant?

560
00:42:23,517 --> 00:42:25,617
Welcome, Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong.

561
00:42:25,617 --> 00:42:30,027
I did not receive the message of your visit sooner. So, I could not clear the path and was quite busy.

562
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:31,627
Do not worry about it.

563
00:42:31,627 --> 00:42:33,877
All right, let us all go inside.

564
00:42:33,877 --> 00:42:35,137
Yes, all right.

565
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:37,467
Please enter this way.

566
00:42:52,727 --> 00:42:55,237
- It has been a while.
- It is nice to see you.

567
00:42:55,237 --> 00:42:57,477
By the way, have you heard the news?

568
00:42:57,477 --> 00:42:58,827
What news?

569
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:00,407
Not too long ago, at Myeongdogak,

570
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:05,377
a good-looking merchant with a silver tongue appeared.

571
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:07,957
I heard that, too!

572
00:43:07,957 --> 00:43:12,827
The way he acts gives off the vibe of a nobleman's son.

573
00:43:12,827 --> 00:43:17,367
He said there would be a major problem if you found out who he was!

574
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:21,317
Then, perhaps one of the noblemen had an illegitimate son?

575
00:43:21,317 --> 00:43:26,687
I wonder whose son he is...

576
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:33,257
In any case, he knew a woman's heart so well for a merchant.

577
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:38,597
It was like how the Left State Minister cares for Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong.

578
00:43:38,597 --> 00:43:41,457
What do you mean by that?

579
00:43:41,457 --> 00:43:45,347
Are you saying that he is a descendant of our family line?

580
00:43:45,347 --> 00:43:47,997
Oh, no, I just meant to...

581
00:43:47,997 --> 00:43:50,787
give an analogy of how nice he was.

582
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:58,097
Gosh, goodness. I guess I misspoke in front of your daughter-in-law.

583
00:44:08,297 --> 00:44:12,947
I guess I am a bit dizzy because I spend all my time at the shrine.

584
00:44:15,717 --> 00:44:20,297
How about we move your daughter-in-law inside to the main house?

585
00:44:20,297 --> 00:44:22,987
Could you do that for me?

586
00:44:22,987 --> 00:44:26,887
I brought her because the Finance Minister's wife asked me to.

587
00:44:26,887 --> 00:44:28,807
You should rest for a bit.

588
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:31,147
Yes, Mother.

589
00:44:34,197 --> 00:44:36,787
Careful, careful.

590
00:44:41,177 --> 00:44:45,477
Do you have something you must tell me?

591
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:48,957
I received this last night.

592
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:52,447
What is this about?

593
00:44:52,447 --> 00:44:55,247
Grand Merchant, may I come in?

594
00:44:55,247 --> 00:44:57,757
He should just stay at the Capital Garrison! Why is he here again?

595
00:44:57,757 --> 00:44:59,807
Should I turn him away?

596
00:45:01,387 --> 00:45:02,887
No.

597
00:45:02,887 --> 00:45:06,717
I have something to ask him anyway, so I should meet with him.

598
00:45:11,077 --> 00:45:13,177
Please come in.

599
00:45:19,547 --> 00:45:21,327
Why are you here?

600
00:45:21,327 --> 00:45:24,557
I have a share in Myeongdogak.

601
00:45:24,557 --> 00:45:27,337
I heard there was a Peonies Meeting.

602
00:45:29,447 --> 00:45:32,527
I guess you must be really comfortable with me now.

603
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,637
My Lady.

604
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,537
I am here legitimately,

605
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:47,877
so I have nothing for you to find fault with, Sir.

606
00:45:47,877 --> 00:45:52,317
But if you are following me on purpose to embarrass me—

607
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:53,397
- I am also a busy man.
- Then why are you here?

608
00:45:53,397 --> 00:45:56,267
- I am also a busy man.
- Then why are you here?

609
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:59,067
I came because I have something to say to the Grand Merchant.

610
00:45:59,067 --> 00:46:01,497
Do you want to meet in a separate room?

611
00:46:01,497 --> 00:46:04,057
You should speak here.

612
00:46:04,987 --> 00:46:08,097
Did you not tell me to stay in your sight?

613
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:12,497
You two should talk first.

614
00:46:22,497 --> 00:46:25,257
Have you all been waiting here?

615
00:46:26,137 --> 00:46:27,297
Welcome.

616
00:46:27,297 --> 00:46:30,037
You should take a seat here.

617
00:46:32,007 --> 00:46:34,767
Have you all been well?

618
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:36,537
Oh, yes.

619
00:46:36,537 --> 00:46:42,477
I know it is not right to go out while in mourning.

620
00:46:42,477 --> 00:46:45,257
I was concerned for the starving people

621
00:46:45,257 --> 00:46:49,947
outside the Sugumun before I leave to live by the grave.

622
00:46:49,947 --> 00:46:52,227
So, I urgently requested a meeting.

623
00:46:52,227 --> 00:46:53,777
It is all right.

624
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:56,097
You are quite the living "Good Conduct for Women".

625
00:46:56,097 --> 00:46:58,897
Yes, that is right.

626
00:46:59,807 --> 00:47:03,107
But where is your daughter-in-law?

627
00:47:03,107 --> 00:47:05,937
She was unwell, so I had her go inside the main house for a moment.

628
00:47:05,937 --> 00:47:08,657
You can greet her later.

629
00:47:08,657 --> 00:47:10,537
Okay.

630
00:47:11,497 --> 00:47:15,997
Kang Pil Jik is closely watching Myeongdogak and the masked one.

631
00:47:15,997 --> 00:47:18,427
That has been happening for a long time.

632
00:47:18,427 --> 00:47:20,377
Myeongdogak and the masked one...

633
00:47:20,377 --> 00:47:26,467
and he seems to know that I am also connected.

634
00:47:28,117 --> 00:47:33,537
I started being a part of Myeongdogak after saving the Grand Merchant seven years ago.

635
00:47:33,537 --> 00:47:39,457
The man who tried to kill the Grand Merchant then was Kang Pil Jik.

636
00:47:40,267 --> 00:47:42,837
I should have had Kang Pil Jik arrested back then.

637
00:47:42,837 --> 00:47:43,997
That is my job.

638
00:47:43,997 --> 00:47:47,367
I should have gotten rid of him at all costs!

639
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:50,437
I am not saying I will do that now.

640
00:47:50,437 --> 00:47:52,207
You should be careful.

641
00:47:52,207 --> 00:47:54,787
Yes, yes. I will.

642
00:47:54,787 --> 00:47:59,047
For the sake of Myeongdogak, I will not be coming out for a while.

643
00:48:03,137 --> 00:48:05,237
Can you not...

644
00:48:05,827 --> 00:48:08,667
consider yourself first?

645
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:23,017
How is the investigation to find the culprit of the Finance Minister's murder going?

646
00:48:25,707 --> 00:48:29,637
It is already a closed case, so I am investigating it in secret.

647
00:48:29,637 --> 00:48:32,607
Do not concern yourself with that anymore.

648
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:37,887
The Finance Minister's wife may already know that Yong Deok was not the culprit.

649
00:48:40,507 --> 00:48:42,827
Did you already know that?

650
00:48:44,037 --> 00:48:48,367
Then does she know the culprit?

651
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:53,077
Do not be curious about this matter any longer.

652
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:55,737
Do you know how much I went through because of that?

653
00:48:55,737 --> 00:48:58,827
Grand Merchant? Are you outside?

654
00:48:58,827 --> 00:49:01,677
How could you just leave like that?

655
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,417
Wait! You are the guy from...

656
00:49:04,417 --> 00:49:07,077
Is the Grand Merchant inside?

657
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:13,587
You are so rude!

658
00:49:13,587 --> 00:49:17,287
Oh, sorry. I am sorry. Sorry.

659
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,807
Have a good time.

660
00:49:24,397 --> 00:49:26,567
Are you all right?

661
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:31,817
See? I told you, you looked like you had a secret lover.

662
00:49:32,817 --> 00:49:35,297
Gosh, what is he...

663
00:49:49,517 --> 00:49:51,077
I am late in greeting you.

664
00:49:51,077 --> 00:49:54,097
Are you feeling okay?

665
00:49:54,717 --> 00:49:59,617
There is a lot to organize at the Peonies Meeting, so I did not even get to speak with you.

666
00:49:59,617 --> 00:50:07,097
By chance, could I see you for a moment tomorrow at my house?

667
00:50:11,117 --> 00:50:14,517
I will send her to your residence early tomorrow.

668
00:50:14,517 --> 00:50:17,707
Then I will see you tomorrow.

669
00:50:18,897 --> 00:50:21,297
All right. Then we will be going now.

670
00:50:21,297 --> 00:50:23,797
Yes. Have a safe trip home.

671
00:50:23,797 --> 00:50:26,717
- Let us go.
- Yes, Mother.

672
00:50:44,777 --> 00:50:47,887
You said you have something to tell me?

673
00:50:47,887 --> 00:50:51,907
You must not tell the Madam about anything I am about to ask you.

674
00:50:51,907 --> 00:50:53,657
All right, tell me.

675
00:50:53,657 --> 00:50:58,317
I need undisclosed information on the Finance Minister's wife.

676
00:51:03,537 --> 00:51:05,137
Gosh, you scared me.

677
00:51:05,137 --> 00:51:06,697
What are you doing here?

678
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:08,737
I was told to stop doing business temporarily.

679
00:51:08,737 --> 00:51:13,627
The Grand Merchant says start your business now that everyone has left.

680
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,837
Goodness, look at you being so lazy.

681
00:51:18,837 --> 00:51:21,387
You will pay dearly if you get complacent due to opening success.

682
00:51:21,387 --> 00:51:27,117
Quickly take whatever customers come and hold onto anyone who tries to leave.

683
00:51:29,267 --> 00:51:32,367
I should learn a thing or two from you, Senior Ggot Nim.

684
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:35,527
This is all for Myeongdogak.

685
00:51:37,827 --> 00:51:41,817
All right. Wait for me!

686
00:52:14,417 --> 00:52:16,227
Come this way.

687
00:52:49,387 --> 00:52:51,817
I finally get to meet you.

688
00:52:51,817 --> 00:52:55,237
It is His Majesty. Hurry up and pay your respects!

689
00:52:57,847 --> 00:52:59,487
All right.

690
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:02,707
I heard you were busy with various things as soon as you joined the Capital Garrison.

691
00:53:02,707 --> 00:53:07,287
All I did was do my best in the duties I was given.

692
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:11,717
I heard you found out that the Finance Minister's cause of death was poison.

693
00:53:11,717 --> 00:53:15,137
I heard you had said the real culprit was someone else.

694
00:53:15,137 --> 00:53:18,607
Then, who are you suspecting?

695
00:53:20,007 --> 00:53:22,147
I am suspecting...

696
00:53:22,147 --> 00:53:25,437
the Finance Minister's wife.

697
00:53:30,717 --> 00:53:34,817
I have not found conclusive evidence yet, but if you give me a little bit more time

698
00:53:34,817 --> 00:53:39,417
Fifteen years ago, when my father suddenly passed away,

699
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:44,017
everyone said he died of illness, but I could not believe that.

700
00:53:45,127 --> 00:53:46,927
I tried to look into the situation in depth,

701
00:53:46,927 --> 00:53:50,707
but the entire family of the Head of the Royal Guards who met my father that night

702
00:53:50,707 --> 00:53:53,117
was slaughtered by some unknown assailant.

703
00:53:53,117 --> 00:53:58,197
Your Majesty, do you know what happened to my family back then?

704
00:53:58,197 --> 00:54:02,637
Do you know where your chase will take you?

705
00:54:02,637 --> 00:54:07,777
The Finance Minister's death is definitely connected to the events of that day.

706
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:13,797
The forces that are trying to cover that up are still dominating this country,

707
00:54:13,797 --> 00:54:17,387
and I do not yet have sufficient power to overcome them.

708
00:54:18,117 --> 00:54:23,177
Thus, if you try to expose what happened to the end,

709
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:27,237
your life will also be in danger again,

710
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:30,617
so you should stop it now.

711
00:54:34,317 --> 00:54:37,817
But, Your Majesty, if I stop this here,

712
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:42,837
who will punish the grievous offense of the culprit of that day?

713
00:54:50,627 --> 00:54:56,367
You have the same look in your eyes as the Head of the Royal Guards that I remember.

714
00:54:56,967 --> 00:55:01,877
Such a true and upright look in your eyes.

715
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:08,887
I am sorry to you.

716
00:55:08,887 --> 00:55:13,767
However, is this also not an unavoidable fate?

717
00:55:14,757 --> 00:55:16,457
Yes.

718
00:55:20,767 --> 00:55:24,447
How about you join us?

719
00:55:38,337 --> 00:55:41,487
Was the slaughter of my parents

720
00:55:41,487 --> 00:55:44,647
connected to what happened then?

721
00:55:45,597 --> 00:55:51,647
That night, the late king called for me urgently.

722
00:55:55,607 --> 00:56:01,367
Yoon Hak, even if I end up unable to protect the crown prince,

723
00:56:01,367 --> 00:56:06,047
please remain by the crown prince's side and keep him safe.

724
00:56:06,047 --> 00:56:09,387
Yes, Your Majesty. I promise.

725
00:56:09,387 --> 00:56:15,227
Also, if something were to happen to the Head of the Royal Guards,

726
00:56:15,227 --> 00:56:19,037
could you take care of his remaining family?

727
00:56:19,037 --> 00:56:20,847
Pardon?

728
00:56:20,847 --> 00:56:27,387
I feel that I may have done something terrible to his family.

729
00:56:29,267 --> 00:56:33,407
There will be a major incident tonight.

730
00:56:33,407 --> 00:56:35,567
What do you mean by "incident"?

731
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:39,267
If I fail in this matter,

732
00:56:40,047 --> 00:56:45,627
I probably will not be able to see you again.

733
00:57:01,817 --> 00:57:05,817
Your Lordship! Your Lordship, are you all right?

734
00:57:08,907 --> 00:57:12,087
Child, are you awake?

735
00:57:12,087 --> 00:57:14,067
Hold on for just a bit!

736
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:21,827
A long time has passed without anything being revealed,

737
00:57:21,827 --> 00:57:24,827
and the events of that day are still not over.

738
00:57:24,827 --> 00:57:28,907
Thus, if you try to dig up this matter,

739
00:57:28,907 --> 00:57:33,357
you may not be able to continue living your current life.

740
00:57:37,217 --> 00:57:43,027
No matter how much I try to remember, the memories of that day remain hazy.

741
00:57:44,267 --> 00:57:47,727
It pains me, Brother.

742
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:55,587
That is why...

743
00:57:56,397 --> 00:57:59,847
you could never truly be Park Su Ho.

744
00:57:59,847 --> 00:58:01,957
I must know...

745
00:58:02,717 --> 00:58:06,417
what I went through 15 years ago

746
00:58:06,417 --> 00:58:10,017
in order to truly live as Park Su Ho.

747
00:58:35,897 --> 00:58:38,677
Why am I like this?

748
00:59:18,017 --> 00:59:19,697
That hurts...

749
00:59:49,867 --> 00:59:54,277
It is hard to meet with people after becoming a widow

750
00:59:54,277 --> 00:59:56,147
and I am already getting lonely.

751
00:59:56,147 --> 00:59:59,627
So it must have been so hard for you all these years.

752
00:59:59,627 --> 01:00:02,137
It was not hard.

753
01:00:04,447 --> 01:00:06,597
I did not have a husband from the start,

754
01:00:06,597 --> 01:00:10,057
so I do not really know the feeling of wistfulness and loneliness.

755
01:00:10,057 --> 01:00:13,907
My parents-in-law took good care of me as well.

756
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:21,517
The Left State Minister and the Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong are quite affectionate people.

757
01:00:27,237 --> 01:00:31,157
I heard you have an older brother you have not heard from.

758
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:38,387
My Lady!

759
01:00:39,157 --> 01:00:41,307
What is the matter?

760
01:00:41,307 --> 01:00:45,757
I think you need to go to the shrine immediately.

761
01:01:14,697 --> 01:01:18,017
Mother, I am back.

762
01:01:19,767 --> 01:01:22,187
Let me borrow your fan!

763
01:01:37,187 --> 01:01:39,777
What is this?

764
01:01:53,217 --> 01:01:57,787
[Knight Flower]

765
01:01:58,537 --> 01:02:00,327
[Unfinished Story]

766
01:02:00,327 --> 01:02:02,617
Gosh, what is he saying?

767
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:06,197
G-Goodness.

768
01:02:07,777 --> 01:02:10,367
Seriously...

769
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:15,417
- Calm down, Madam. I was just trying to cover your face—
- Why are you doing this to me?

770
01:02:18,117 --> 01:02:20,227
Gosh, look!

771
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:25,277
Grand Merchant...

772
01:02:25,277 --> 01:02:28,277
- This is not what you think it is, Grand Merchant!
- This is not what you think it is, Grand Merchant!

773
01:02:31,357 --> 01:02:33,737
W-What t-thought?

774
01:02:33,737 --> 01:02:37,467
And what were you two thinking?

775
01:02:38,517 --> 01:02:40,677
It is time for everyone to leave.

776
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:43,427
You should hurry up and come out.

777
01:02:57,927 --> 01:03:00,017
My Lady, are you hot?

778
01:03:00,017 --> 01:03:02,257
Your face is red.

779
01:03:02,257 --> 01:03:03,987
No!

780
01:03:03,987 --> 01:03:07,037
Why is the weather so cold?

781
01:03:16,597 --> 01:03:18,627
W-Whoa...

782
01:03:18,627 --> 01:03:20,457
What the...

783
01:03:20,457 --> 01:03:24,107
I mean, it is not even summer,

784
01:03:24,107 --> 01:03:26,527
so why am I so hot?

785
01:03:27,267 --> 01:03:32,717
♫ The one who made me live ♫

786
01:03:32,717 --> 01:03:38,257
♫ The one who made me cry ♫

787
01:03:38,257 --> 01:03:47,717
♫ This time that is like eternity feels like a moment ♫

788
01:03:47,717 --> 01:03:53,317
♫ The cold day of being battered by snow and wind ♫

789
01:03:53,317 --> 01:03:54,807
♫ I miss yesterday ♫

790
01:03:54,807 --> 01:04:00,647
It appears your brother was connected to something secretive in the palace.

791
01:04:00,647 --> 01:04:02,957
Who knows about that?

792
01:04:02,957 --> 01:04:05,057
My father-in-law?

793
01:04:05,057 --> 01:04:08,897
Should we get some sticky rice cake since we are out?

794
01:04:08,897 --> 01:04:12,307
My mother used to love the sticky rice cakes I would bring home.

795
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:13,187
Mother!

796
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:15,067
He is...

797
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:17,817
Oh, my god.

798
01:04:17,817 --> 01:04:21,077
What if the one who sent this note is dangerous?

799
01:04:21,077 --> 01:04:23,227
This is more dangerous than we had thought.

800
01:04:23,227 --> 01:04:24,447
It is better for you not to know.

801
01:04:24,447 --> 01:04:27,527
You are worried about My Lady again, I see.

802
01:04:27,527 --> 01:04:28,977
Sir!

803
01:04:28,977 --> 01:04:33,117
♫ It is always you ♫
