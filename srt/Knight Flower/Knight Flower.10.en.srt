1
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:42,521
H-How dare you...

2
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:57,421
What are you doing?

3
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:08,191
Madam, are you okay?

4
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:11,341
Please come to your senses, Madam!

5
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:15,841
Did you say tomb-watching?

6
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:17,831
Why?

7
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:19,161
Do you not want to?

8
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:22,801
No, it was just so sudden.

9
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:26,141
Well, I heard quite a bit of arguing among noblewomen took place

10
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:30,231
regarding the Memorial Gates for Virtuous Women.

11
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:33,001
I was not going to intervene because I considered

12
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,781
them to be simple jealousy.

13
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:38,621
But seeing even your mother suffer like that,

14
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:41,611
I cannot ignore them anymore.

15
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:44,921
However, if I suddenly go tomb-watching,

16
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:47,521
there is no one to take care of Mother, who has become weak—

17
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:50,701
I will take care of that, so do not worry.

18
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:55,281
You only have to fulfill your duty.

19
00:01:57,401 --> 00:02:03,251
He is making an advanced move in case I find out something more.

20
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:06,881
Why are you not answering?

21
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:10,661
Your Excellency, I think you should come outside for a moment.

22
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:12,861
What is the matter?

23
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:20,221
The Garrison Commander asked to see you for a moment.

24
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:23,031
At this late hour?

25
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:32,491
I, Garrison Commander Hwang Chi Dal,

26
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:35,541
apologize for the late visit, but a terrible incident took place inside the capital.

27
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,241
So, we are rushing to strengthen the security in Bukchon.

28
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,501
A terrible incident? What is going on?

29
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:44,501
An intruder broke into the Finance Minister's house just now

30
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:46,331
and tried to murder the Finance Minister's wife.

31
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:48,001
What did you say?

32
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,971
We are pursuing the intruder, but since it is too grave of a matter—

33
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,701
You can go back inside, Daughter-in-Law.

34
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,601
Yes, Father.

35
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:03,061
The Capital Garrison will do our best for the safety of the court officials above all...

36
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:06,211
Did you attempt to kill the Finance Minister's wife?

37
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:10,531
Father, did you really do it?

38
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:17,471
[Knight Flower - Episode 10: Keep Your Enemies Closer]

39
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:27,001
All right, did you catch the intruder?

40
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:28,331
Sorry?

41
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:31,861
Well, t-the thing is...

42
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,741
We lost him.

43
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:37,391
Did anyone see the intruder?

44
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,591
I saw him.

45
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:43,311
You saw him in person?

46
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:46,971
Yes, I could not get a clear look because it was too dark.

47
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:49,781
But the Finance Minister's wife must have seen the intruder's face.

48
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:53,211
So, we should be able to catch the culprit as soon as she wakes up.

49
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:56,581
Is that so?

50
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:01,371
I am glad you can catch the intruder.

51
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:04,291
We will stand guard at every house

52
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:08,301
of a court official so that even an ant cannot get through their doors.

53
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:12,021
We will especially pay extra care for your house,

54
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:15,131
so please rest assured and have a good night.

55
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:16,671
Thank you.

56
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:19,091
Now, then. Keep up the good work.

57
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,701
I will take another look, just to be sure.

58
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:32,861
Yes, through and through.

59
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:35,251
Make sure to look through and through.

60
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,921
Go bring the Defense Minister right now.

61
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:00,311
Yes, Your Excellency.

62
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:19,261
You are really making things cumbersome.

63
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:28,861
There are patrols everywhere today,

64
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:32,091
so tell her absolutely not to come out masked.

65
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:39,481
Who attempted to kill the Finance Minister's wife?

66
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:44,561
I think it was Kang Pil Jik.

67
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:49,271
Father has ordered me to tomb-watch.

68
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:52,831
Please find a way for me to go to Myeongdogak right now.

69
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:01,701
Starting with the golden goods, pack everything we saved.

70
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:03,271
Yes.

71
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,541
I am going to Gaegyeong right away— N-No...

72
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,821
I am leaving for the Qing Dynasty.

73
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:10,691
It is not like you were caught red-handed, so why are you trying to run away?

74
00:06:10,691 --> 00:06:13,501
Do you think I am running away because I fear the Capital Garrison?

75
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:18,971
Since I failed this job, Elder will not let me be.

76
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:22,681
Please do not worry. You are his sword, and he would not throw away his sword.

77
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:26,671
Getting a new sword is not even a problem for him!

78
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:29,171
Hurry up! Regardless of who catches us,

79
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:32,551
it will really be over this time.

80
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:34,221
Yes.

81
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:52,261
Can she really come out like that?

82
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:53,541
Please do not worry.

83
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,531
She will come out like nothing is wrong.

84
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:06,281
The capital is becoming rowdy.

85
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:10,541
I will not ask what is going on in detail.

86
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:16,951
However, what you and My Lady are doing is dangerous. Right?

87
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:20,281
Probably.

88
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:26,351
You might also be in danger since you are with this family's daughter-in-law all the time.

89
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:28,801
So you must be even more careful from now on.

90
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:33,021
I am... just so worried.

91
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:35,821
No need to start worrying in advance.

92
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:39,521
Your Lady will be fine.

93
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:44,471
Someone like you, who worries about her, is protecting her by her side.

94
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:48,211
Well...

95
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:52,731
Is there anything more you want to say to me?

96
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:57,111
I am... worried about you as well, Sir.

97
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:04,671
- Please be careful.
- Yes.

98
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:08,151
At such a shady place,

99
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:10,541
what are you two doing?

100
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:25,161
Why are you making everyone gather like this?

101
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:27,681
I am going to talk about my father-in-law.

102
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:30,501
Let us talk about the details when we all arrive.

103
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,501
Let us do that.

104
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:35,881
By the way, I have been meaning to ask you something.

105
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,281
Would it be okay for me to ask you?

106
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:39,981
Yes.

107
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,981
It is about my younger brother.

108
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:51,001
What is your relationship with my younger brother?

109
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:52,521
My relationship?

110
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:56,741
Just like brothers, friends, lovers, a couple, or a parent.

111
00:08:56,741 --> 00:09:00,821
I am asking about the relationship that exists between two people.

112
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:04,941
If I must choose one,

113
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:07,131
you can say we are friends.

114
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:10,761
A woman and a man are friends, huh?

115
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:15,191
Is that even possible in this country of Joseon?

116
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:19,061
Do I look like a woman to you right now?

117
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:24,301
What were you talking so affectionately about with Yeon Seon earlier, Sir?

118
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:28,091
A man and a woman at such a shady place.

119
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:33,821
So, this is what the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law is like.

120
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:35,461
I heard you are not even blood brothers.

121
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:39,511
But things you do quite resemble what the captain does.

122
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:42,791
Wait, Royal Secretary of Defense!

123
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:46,151
Hey, it is you, Bi Chan.

124
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:50,261
Gosh, where are you going when Bukchon is as chaotic as ever?

125
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:51,661
Huh?

126
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:54,871
I have not seen you before. Are you a rookie?

127
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:57,821
Sir Captain ordered me to escort Sir Royal Secretary of Defense.

128
00:09:57,821 --> 00:10:01,391
What? He gave you such an important job?

129
00:10:01,391 --> 00:10:06,011
Oh, I personally requested this person, which is why we are traveling together.

130
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:08,051
- You did, Sir?
- Yeah.

131
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:13,111
Su Ho seemed to be looking for you desperately earlier.

132
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,941
Oh, really? Where is he right now?

133
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:18,691
Oh, he told you to come to the Capital Garrison.

134
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:20,161
Okay!

135
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:23,451
See you later, Rookie.

136
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:35,301
You look quite nice in that uniform.

137
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:49,311
- Let's go.
- Yes.

138
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,621
Where are you headed in such a hurry?

139
00:10:57,621 --> 00:10:59,411
Hyungnim.

140
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:07,831
His Excellency already blocked off all paths on land and water.

141
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:11,601
What difference will it make to get out of this place?

142
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:24,121
Tomb-watching? What do you mean?

143
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:26,201
An intruder appeared in Bukchon right now,

144
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:29,421
but is that what you are urgently concerned about?

145
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:41,961
I guess Father must have been very bothered.

146
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:45,251
One fake letter, and he orders tomb-watching.

147
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:48,581
Also, it is Kang Pil Jik, not just an intruder.

148
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:51,121
It does not seem to be a coincidence that he told me to go

149
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:55,291
tomb-watching, and Kang Pil Jik tried to kill the Finance Minister's wife.

150
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:59,871
So... do you have to go?

151
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,331
Su Ho.

152
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:04,841
It is for the better.

153
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:07,811
I have been planning to send My Lady to the Qing Dynasty.

154
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,561
And I finally get the chance.

155
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,471
Qing Dynasty?

156
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,541
You cannot.

157
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:20,001
Would the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law leave for the Qing Dynasty right now?

158
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:21,621
Mind what you say.

159
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:24,401
I am not going anywhere.

160
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:30,671
Now, then. Let us discuss how I can stay here.

161
00:12:31,311 --> 00:12:32,951
- Let "us"?
- Us?

162
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:36,921
It seems the reason he told me to go tomb-watching is related to all the said matters.

163
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:40,801
So, am I not the best person to find out what that is?

164
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,051
I mean, of course—

165
00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:43,981
Looking at what happened to the Finance Minister's wife,

166
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:48,241
it seems going tomb-watching would have been my death.

167
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:50,311
The Finance Minister's wife and I...

168
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:54,801
would be remembered as great widows who killed ourselves after our husbands.

169
00:12:58,781 --> 00:13:02,981
I will never end up that way, so do not look at me like that.

170
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:08,511
Did you find anything related to the Finance Minister's wife while investigating Kang Pil Jik?

171
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:12,071
There is circumstantial evidence of stealing almsgiving rice, but we are still investigating.

172
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,301
Almsgiving rice?

173
00:13:19,521 --> 00:13:24,611
He has been stealing from those poor people who barely get to eat a bowl of porridge?

174
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:30,311
In their eyes, the people's well-being do not matter.

175
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:35,151
Is that not why you go out every night wearing a mask?

176
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:41,281
First off, I will look into the Finance Minister's wife.

177
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:45,391
I will look more into Kang Pil Jik, then.

178
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:49,311
Well, then, I...

179
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:53,981
Please find a way to make Madam stay, Brother.

180
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:58,681
- Me?
- You are still this country's Royal Secretary of Defense.

181
00:13:58,681 --> 00:13:59,621
So suddenly?

182
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,461
That is a great idea.

183
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:04,361
Please do that.

184
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:08,131
No, wait! That seems to be the hardest task.

185
00:14:08,131 --> 00:14:09,581
I will be counting on you.

186
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:12,331
W-Wait—

187
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:19,991
Let me see...

188
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:29,181
All right. Please take care, then.

189
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:40,441
Oh, Grand Merchant, I have a question for you.

190
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:43,791
Could I have a word with you for a moment?

191
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,151
I also have something to ask you.

192
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:50,121
Great timing.

193
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:52,081
Let us go.

194
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,761
You said you have something to tell me.

195
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:13,801
If you must go tomb-watching,

196
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:19,621
there is another way to stay inside the capital instead of going to the Qing Dynasty.

197
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:22,951
Should I dress up as a man and

198
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:25,011
start working at the Capital Garrison as a military officer?

199
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:28,081
- That is also a good idea.
- Sir.

200
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:34,181
The Royal Secretary of Defense asked a question.

201
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:36,221
Brother did?

202
00:15:36,221 --> 00:15:40,621
He asked about the relationship between you and me.

203
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:48,931
You and I cannot be in any type of relationship in any way.

204
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:56,631
Even if I am no longer the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law one day.

205
00:15:56,631 --> 00:16:00,781
- Madam.
- Yes, "Madam."

206
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:04,741
That is how you address me.

207
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:09,841
I am someone's wife.

208
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:16,161
So, we cannot be in any type of relationship in any way

209
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:19,131
nor should we ever be.

210
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:23,261
We are only people with the same fate who share the same goal

211
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:26,201
of resolving a problem.

212
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:27,911
Therefore,

213
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:32,421
I hope we will not be misunderstood by others going forward.

214
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:37,591
I understand...

215
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:40,081
what you mean.

216
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:52,861
It seems those people did not misunderstand us.

217
00:16:55,291 --> 00:17:00,441
You will not be put in a spot in the future.

218
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:16,551
I cannot believe I get to feed you with my own hands again.

219
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:18,361
Here.

220
00:17:20,311 --> 00:17:22,651
You cried all night last night, and you are at it again.

221
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:28,361
I am sorry. I just cannot calm down.

222
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:31,321
You stop, too!

223
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:34,981
If you keep crying, the tiger would come and take you,

224
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:37,861
but you have grown quite a lot, Jae Yi.

225
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:43,171
I will bring some gamju that you like, Brother.

226
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:45,091
[Gamju: Korean rice wine]

227
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:52,651
I will make sure to stay here.

228
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:54,471
Okay.

229
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:03,941
There, hurry up and eat so we can go home.

230
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:09,061
Your father would be so happy to see you.

231
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:12,261
Did Father search for me a lot?

232
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:14,281
Of course.

233
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:19,731
He desperately searched for you all over the land of Joseon.

234
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:24,361
The heavens have cared for us for our efforts.

235
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:32,371
Your wife also put so much effort into praying.

236
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:36,721
She is a really womanly and fair girl.

237
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:39,201
Her manners are so proper.

238
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:43,571
Goodness, goodness!

239
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:45,571
What the heck are you doing?

240
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:47,251
Why are you suddenly wailing?

241
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,101
I have to do anything to stall for time.

242
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:51,751
Goodness!

243
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:54,541
- Goodness, goodness—
- Can I come inside?

244
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,481
Goodness!

245
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:05,071
I told you to prepare to go tomb-watching.

246
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:07,741
But why are you wailing so loudly?

247
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:10,711
Could it be you are having second thoughts?

248
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:12,311
Not at all, Father.

249
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:15,911
How can I dare to defy your orders?

250
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:19,221
It is just my husband came out in my dreams last night,

251
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:23,121
crying ever so sadly that he will be all alone at the shrine if I leave.

252
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:26,091
So I just cannot bring myself to leave.

253
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:31,301
Yes, since your mother and I have watched you for a long time,

254
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:34,241
I understand your feelings for Jeong.

255
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:39,801
Hence, I am sure you will make the right choice for Jeong and our family.

256
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:43,411
The person to take you to the ancestral burial grounds will come in three days.

257
00:19:43,411 --> 00:19:46,981
- Father!
- Know that and prepare accordingly.

258
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:04,021
Looks like he will not hide his true colors even in front of me now.

259
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:13,121
I think I will have to find a way to prevent Madam Jo from going tomb-watching.

260
00:20:13,931 --> 00:20:19,301
I mean, is that really the task you were assigned in this matter?

261
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:22,851
This is the hardest task.

262
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:26,411
Mother has always been curious about the Left State Minister's wife.

263
00:20:26,411 --> 00:20:31,461
If I ask her to set up a meeting, it will buy her some time.

264
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:34,321
Thank you for your grace.

265
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:44,181
There comes someone to whom I just cannot be generous with my overflowing grace.

266
00:20:48,531 --> 00:20:53,201
Your Majesty, there is something I must tell you.

267
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:56,781
Let us head to the Royal Council Hall, then.

268
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:07,471
[Almsgiving Implemention Results Report]

269
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:13,061
[Almsgiving Implemention Results Report]

270
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:22,021
What is all this?

271
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:27,341
They are amounts of rice the Queen Dowager took for almsgiving in the last ten years and

272
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:31,531
the actual amounts of rice given out to the poor.

273
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:33,441
This is...

274
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:35,591
After the late king passed away,

275
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:39,781
you were able to be called a benevolent king by your people,

276
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:43,751
substantially thanks to Queen Dowager's contribution.

277
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:49,311
But if people find out she has been stealing the almsgiving rice all this time...

278
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:51,461
Left State Minister,

279
00:21:52,021 --> 00:21:54,881
distinguish what can be said and cannot be said.

280
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,191
Alas.

281
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:01,511
It would be more problematic if the court officials found out.

282
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:03,671
We may perhaps...

283
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:09,101
discuss the Queen Dowager's deposition.

284
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:12,901
How can this be Mother's fault?

285
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:17,571
Was this not done solely by the Finance Minister's wife?

286
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:23,581
Did you know the Finance Minister's wife was doing such a thing?

287
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,321
How would the court officials think a mere wife of a minister

288
00:22:28,321 --> 00:22:32,901
was able to pull off such an act without the Queen Dowager's order?

289
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:35,331
Mother is...

290
00:22:35,331 --> 00:22:40,681
an elder of the Royal Family who governed the Inner Courts peacefully her entire life.

291
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:44,471
I will absolutely not sit still and watch her

292
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:47,851
getting framed ever so unjustly,

293
00:22:47,851 --> 00:22:53,431
when she has been fulfilling her responsibilities wonderfully.

294
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:57,011
That is exactly what I want to tell you.

295
00:22:57,011 --> 00:23:02,041
You only need to sit still to protect your peaceful position for the rest of your life,

296
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,601
but Your Majesty keeps making thoughtless moves

297
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:08,611
and everyone is about to lose their place.

298
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:15,331
Since the Finance Minister's wife dared to corroborate with

299
00:23:15,331 --> 00:23:17,451
lowly hoodlums for personal gains,

300
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:20,091
the unspeakable incident last night

301
00:23:20,091 --> 00:23:22,731
also probably happened due to personal grudges.

302
00:23:22,731 --> 00:23:30,131
Therefore, Queen Dowager must no longer shield the Finance Minister's wife.

303
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:38,421
Now, then. This humble one trusts you engraved his words deeply in your bones...

304
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:42,601
and will take his leave now.

305
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:31,561
Madam, have you come to?

306
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,411
What happened?

307
00:24:34,411 --> 00:24:38,361
The Capital Garrison's captain saved your life.

308
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:41,971
What about him?

309
00:24:41,971 --> 00:24:43,741
Was he caught?

310
00:24:43,741 --> 00:24:46,481
They have not caught him yet.

311
00:24:46,481 --> 00:24:50,171
The Capital Garrison is standing guard outside.

312
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:55,621
And also, a person called Hwayeon Merchandising's owner is waiting for you.

313
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:58,791
She said she has something to tell you privately.

314
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:02,021
Grand Merchant? Why?

315
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:06,041
I hope it goes as she planned.

316
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,441
Please do not worry too much about her.

317
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,321
My Lady or your merchandising company.

318
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:24,531
I understand Grand Merchant Jang So Woon is the owner of Hwayeon Merchandising.

319
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:28,281
Who might you be?

320
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:30,461
Grand Merchant only acts as a representative.

321
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:33,641
I am the actual owner of the merchandising company.

322
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:36,921
How can I trust your words?

323
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:43,441
Is this still not enough to make you believe?

324
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:50,031
What use is a mere pendant like this one?

325
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:54,341
I know quite a lot of things from running a merchandising company.

326
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:56,521
So how about this?

327
00:25:56,521 --> 00:26:02,611
The relationship between the Finance Minister's drawing and Kang Pil Jik's merchandising company.

328
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:06,051
About the relationship between Kang Pil Jik and you, Madam,

329
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:08,981
or what the petals were inside the fillet...

330
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:14,101
My position allows me to learn about such things easily if I wish to.

331
00:26:15,101 --> 00:26:16,981
Who are you?

332
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:23,371
Could it be that the Elder sent you?

333
00:26:41,951 --> 00:26:44,141
I am the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law and

334
00:26:44,141 --> 00:26:48,411
Cho Seong Hoo's younger sister, Cho Yeo Hwa.

335
00:26:48,411 --> 00:26:51,111
H-How could you have...

336
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:55,431
I know not the reason you tried to bait me out.

337
00:26:55,431 --> 00:27:00,581
But it looks like you mistook me for an easy catch.

338
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:05,531
I cannot believe this.

339
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:11,611
You completely fooled everyone all this time.

340
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:14,541
It is too soon for you to say such things to me.

341
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:17,121
I know a lot of things about you, Madam.

342
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:21,791
But you probably do not know a lot of things about me.

343
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,791
What is the reason you came to me like this?

344
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:31,891
I must have you become my bait.

345
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:38,441
As you already know, I have been deceived by my father-in-law for 15 years.

346
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:43,491
I found out the truth behind everything, so I cannot very well do nothing.

347
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:46,551
You found out the truth behind everything?

348
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:50,241
Therefore, if you will help me,

349
00:27:50,241 --> 00:27:53,121
I will find a way for you to live.

350
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:03,421
Do you think I will do as you say?

351
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:06,491
You have no other way, do you?

352
00:28:07,581 --> 00:28:10,471
Who knows if someone else will be coming tomorrow to

353
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:12,251
strangle you again?

354
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:18,161
Father has never failed to do something he set his mind on.

355
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:25,211
Once you decide, please send a word.

356
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:30,461
If I do not hear from you in three days, I will take it as your refusal.

357
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:36,611
What do you want me to do to help?

358
00:28:36,611 --> 00:28:42,251
I will tell you that after you make up your mind.

359
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:45,251
Since you said you found out the truth behind everything,

360
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:52,041
are you also fully aware of matters regarding your brother?

361
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:56,881
Of course.

362
00:29:05,021 --> 00:29:07,161
Is that so?

363
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:19,491
My Lady!

364
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,411
How did it go?

365
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:28,871
She clearly knows Brother's whereabouts.

366
00:29:28,871 --> 00:29:33,001
I am sure she knows more than I do, at the very least.

367
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:34,831
Please deliver the news to the captain.

368
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:36,381
Yes.

369
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:39,821
Let us go.

370
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:46,591
Are you not open for business today?

371
00:29:46,591 --> 00:29:49,261
Oh, yes. We are under construction.

372
00:29:49,261 --> 00:29:51,391
So we will not be open for a while.

373
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:54,011
What about Merchant Kang? Is he inside?

374
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:57,651
Oh, well, t-the thing is...

375
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:11,041
What brings you here, Captain?

376
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,221
I came to meet Merchant Kang.

377
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:14,681
Is he inside?

378
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:17,721
He is currently not here.

379
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:22,321
Is that so? Tell him I was looking for him and that

380
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,721
he should come to the Capital Garrison.

381
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:27,051
- He must.
- Yes.

382
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,041
What if he had already run away?

383
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,501
Did you see the people standing behind that man?

384
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:39,021
They are not on the same side.

385
00:30:39,021 --> 00:30:41,141
Then?

386
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:42,871
Their outfits were unusual and

387
00:30:42,871 --> 00:30:44,841
they had military officers' swords.

388
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:49,651
But Kang Pil Jik's henchmen did not have a sword.

389
00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:51,411
It seems someone is watching them.

390
00:30:51,411 --> 00:30:55,791
So look into Kang Pil Jik's state and people who come and go, Bi Chan.

391
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,391
Yes.

392
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:04,421
I had forgotten what kind of man...

393
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,981
the Left State Minister was for a moment.

394
00:31:07,981 --> 00:31:08,941
Your Majesty.

395
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:14,031
There was no way he would have left any loopholes.

396
00:31:14,031 --> 00:31:16,921
There is not much time left now.

397
00:31:16,921 --> 00:31:19,011
We already found out many things.

398
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:21,841
Thinking about why he made the Finance Minister's wife the figurehead,

399
00:31:21,841 --> 00:31:24,841
I found that to be odd to begin with.

400
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:28,211
Instead of looking for a connection between the Finance Minister's wife and Left State Minister,

401
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:34,431
I should have thought about who would go down with the Finance Minister's wife first.

402
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:46,651
He was holding Father's death and Mother hostages.

403
00:31:46,651 --> 00:31:49,071
I am sure there is another way.

404
00:31:49,071 --> 00:31:54,781
I will bring corroborating evidence to arrest the Left State Minister.

405
00:31:54,781 --> 00:31:58,601
I will find it without fail, Your Majesty.

406
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:00,971
Left State Minister...

407
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:05,581
Left State Minister!

408
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:12,711
Kang Pil Jik has been completely tied down at Pil's Lodge.

409
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:16,091
What kind of big mistake did that fool make?

410
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:19,741
There is no need for you to know that much, Defense Minister.

411
00:32:19,741 --> 00:32:24,981
Would it not be better to get rid of him before he further ruins things?

412
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:30,041
Whether he will further ruin things or do more useful things...

413
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:32,461
Getting rid of him is not an urgent matter.

414
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:35,281
So let us wait and see.

415
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:38,561
More importantly,

416
00:32:40,411 --> 00:32:44,271
how will His Majesty react...

417
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:51,761
I told him so he would understand,

418
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:56,621
but if His Majesty gets greedy again,

419
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:11,291
I hope I will not have to waste my time and do the same task twice.

420
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:30,331
I did not get to take a closer look that day because I was in disarray.

421
00:33:30,331 --> 00:33:33,871
It is quite fascinating to see a noblewoman going around

422
00:33:33,871 --> 00:33:36,481
dressed like that.

423
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,421
Brother!

424
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:41,591
It is a compliment.

425
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:43,681
It is a compliment.

426
00:33:43,681 --> 00:33:46,081
Oh, I see...

427
00:33:46,081 --> 00:33:50,991
I heard from the Grand Merchant that you met the Finance Minister's wife today.

428
00:33:50,991 --> 00:33:53,911
I heard you pretended to be the owner of a merchandising business.

429
00:33:53,911 --> 00:33:58,831
Is it not too dangerous for you to tell her you have another identity?

430
00:33:58,831 --> 00:34:01,301
She has a lot of pride.

431
00:34:01,301 --> 00:34:04,921
She would not relent just because you beg or blackmail her.

432
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:09,421
Thus, is that not why my father tried to kill her?

433
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:14,881
That is why I just tried acting like I know everything already

434
00:34:14,881 --> 00:34:19,001
and lack nothing by telling her we should avenge together since we are on the same side.

435
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:20,531
What do you mean on the same side?

436
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:21,991
I am trying to fool her.

437
00:34:21,991 --> 00:34:25,961
I do not ever think of being on the same side as the Finance Minister's wife.

438
00:34:25,961 --> 00:34:32,711
I can never be on the same side as someone who messes with people's food!

439
00:34:32,711 --> 00:34:38,411
Whatever the Finance Minister's wife says may be of no use.

440
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:43,691
The Left State Minister blackmailed His Majesty using the Queen Dowager.

441
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:48,471
From the start, he made the Queen Dowager the support behind the Finance Minister's wife.

442
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:53,471
Goodness, how is he always using family to blackmail people?

443
00:34:54,281 --> 00:34:55,281
What about Kang Pil Jik?

444
00:34:55,281 --> 00:34:58,301
He is probably locked up inside Pil's Merchandising.

445
00:34:58,301 --> 00:35:00,241
Let us go.

446
00:35:01,441 --> 00:35:05,381
Shouldn't our actions go ahead of our words?

447
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:09,981
Who are you?

448
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,661
Y-You are...

449
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,581
It has been a while.

450
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:48,461
How dare you come crawling in here with no fear!

451
00:35:48,461 --> 00:35:52,091
I do not think now is the time for you to be talking like that.

452
00:35:52,091 --> 00:35:53,671
Hyungnim...

453
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:55,471
You got your sword taken away

454
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:58,321
and from the looks of it, you look like you are locked up here.

455
00:35:58,321 --> 00:35:59,891
Is it just my imagination?

456
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:03,291
Who would dare lock us in here?

457
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:09,021
I will overlook the fact that you have interfered in all of my affairs.

458
00:36:09,021 --> 00:36:11,481
Take it and leave.

459
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:15,211
Does he think that I came to steal from him?

460
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:17,661
Considering your track record...

461
00:36:18,431 --> 00:36:21,091
Who is the person behind you?

462
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:23,341
What about you? Who are you?

463
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:25,961
You should answer first.

464
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:30,381
The one who goes along with the masked one...

465
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:34,901
Are you not Captain Park Su Ho?

466
00:36:37,191 --> 00:36:41,081
I did hear you were pretty close to the masked one.

467
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:44,691
The Captain of the Capital Garrison cannot

468
00:36:44,691 --> 00:36:48,691
possibly kill someone wearing a mask. Am I wrong?

469
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:54,511
If I have committed a crime, you could just call me into the Capital Garrison and investigate me.

470
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:57,971
To think you would just come pointing a sword at me...

471
00:36:57,971 --> 00:36:59,811
What is my crime?

472
00:36:59,811 --> 00:37:01,191
Your crime?

473
00:37:01,191 --> 00:37:02,811
How could you do this without going through procedures?

474
00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:05,441
If you knew who I really was,

475
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:08,161
will you remember your crime?

476
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,491
I am the son of Im Kang, the Head of the Royal Guards,

477
00:37:16,491 --> 00:37:21,201
the one who alone survived when you killed my entire family.

478
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:23,371
Im Hyeon Jae.

479
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:27,681
- Hyeon Jae.
- Father!

480
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:38,101
Y-You remember that?

481
00:37:44,171 --> 00:37:46,591
I remembered, thanks to you...

482
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:48,661
who you are.

483
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:51,461
I do not know anything.

484
00:37:52,961 --> 00:37:55,131
The plan has changed.

485
00:37:55,131 --> 00:37:57,871
I will just kill him right now.

486
00:37:58,571 --> 00:37:59,781
Wait! Wait!

487
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:01,971
You said you would not stop me!

488
00:38:01,971 --> 00:38:06,221
Please stop him. Please spare me!

489
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:14,201
I made a promise to him.

490
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:17,741
You do as you wish.

491
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:25,361
I will do everything you say.

492
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:28,551
Why did you kill my family?

493
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:31,711
The Head of the Royal Guards had the royal decree.

494
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:35,601
I was told it would be a great help if I stole that from him.

495
00:38:35,601 --> 00:38:39,081
I do not know the details, either. I just...

496
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:45,271
did what the Finance Minister's wife told me to do.

497
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:54,851
Are you able to prove what you just said?

498
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:58,021
I-I am the corroborative evidence!

499
00:38:58,021 --> 00:39:00,971
If you spare me, I will testify to it, no matter what it takes.

500
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:07,241
If I die here, you will never be able to prove that.

501
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:10,551
If he does not have any evidence, either—

502
00:39:16,611 --> 00:39:18,081
Let us go!

503
00:39:18,081 --> 00:39:20,241
Are you all right?

504
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:31,281
You are lucky the wound is only this bad.

505
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:35,491
Gosh, things could have been really bad for you!

506
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,381
I know.

507
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:57,541
I am sorry.

508
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:58,851
I...

509
00:39:58,851 --> 00:40:01,741
Yes, you should be sorry.

510
00:40:01,741 --> 00:40:05,021
Our original plan was to scare them a bit and have them flee

511
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:06,711
and then follow them.

512
00:40:06,711 --> 00:40:11,831
Also, the basics of wearing a mask is not to show your face to your enemy.

513
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:14,791
And yet you let them see as we got there!

514
00:40:18,321 --> 00:40:21,171
Still, since I have someone following them,

515
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:23,181
the plan is not a failure.

516
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:25,781
You revealed who you are, Sir.

517
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:27,381
That was not part of the plan!

518
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:31,191
Seeing his shameless face, thinking I did not know anything,

519
00:40:31,191 --> 00:40:34,311
I almost killed him there on the spot.

520
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:39,321
I forgot why I even went there.

521
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:41,941
I should have gone by myself.

522
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:47,071
If you had gone by yourself, I guess you would not have gotten hurt like this.

523
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:54,251
Now that I think about it, it may have been really dangerous if I had gone by myself.

524
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:58,311
If you had not helped me, that blade could have stabbed me in the back, Sir.

525
00:40:58,311 --> 00:41:00,191
Madam!

526
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:03,221
That would never happen.

527
00:41:03,221 --> 00:41:06,121
Never again...

528
00:41:06,121 --> 00:41:09,171
will you ever get hurt.

529
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,491
Kang Pil Jik, that bastard.

530
00:41:16,491 --> 00:41:19,691
I will not hold you back next time, so kill him.

531
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:25,461
The hour is late, so I will be going first.

532
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:27,151
Yes.

533
00:41:40,141 --> 00:41:44,611
Your Excellency, Kang Pil Jik ran away.

534
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:47,061
What did you say?

535
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:51,381
Masked ones appeared, and it appears they fled in the chaos.

536
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:54,381
Masked ones?

537
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:01,541
Find out who they are.

538
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:04,401
Then what should I do about Kang Pil Jik?

539
00:42:05,371 --> 00:42:08,031
Just let him be.

540
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:12,611
It will be hard for him to live as a dog on the streets again,

541
00:42:12,611 --> 00:42:15,431
so he would not just disappear without a trace.

542
00:42:15,431 --> 00:42:17,051
Okay.

543
00:42:35,341 --> 00:42:39,691
It appears it will be difficult to go through the city gates.

544
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:49,621
From now on, I will follow them.

545
00:42:49,621 --> 00:42:52,061
Go to Sir and find out what I should do.

546
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:53,791
Yes.

547
00:42:55,431 --> 00:42:59,331
So, there really was a royal decree from my father.

548
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:02,951
What the loyal subject tried to protect with his life

549
00:43:02,951 --> 00:43:06,691
was taken from him in such a gruesome way.

550
00:43:06,691 --> 00:43:10,041
There is nothing more we can do now.

551
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,721
Your Majesty,

552
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:16,081
it is too soon to lose heart.

553
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:23,821
After the Head of the Royal Guards died, the late king called in Cho Seong Hoo, but he disappeared.

554
00:43:23,821 --> 00:43:26,221
If the Left State Minister searched for him that much,

555
00:43:26,221 --> 00:43:31,051
Cho Seong Hoo must have received a secret mission.

556
00:43:32,141 --> 00:43:35,491
I wonder if we would even be able to find that.

557
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:38,351
It appears the Finance Minister's wife knows that.

558
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:42,611
So, please wait a bit until the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law finds out about it.

559
00:43:42,611 --> 00:43:47,441
What if the Finance Minister's wife causes harm to the Queen Dowager?

560
00:43:48,441 --> 00:43:51,511
If she decides to find a way to survive by siding with the Left State Minister,

561
00:43:51,511 --> 00:43:54,391
what shall we do then?

562
00:43:55,191 --> 00:44:00,161
The crimes of the Finance Minister's wife is more than enough to have her beheaded.

563
00:44:00,161 --> 00:44:02,101
If there is nothing to gain from her,

564
00:44:02,101 --> 00:44:06,881
you can personally have her punished for her crimes immediately.

565
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:18,981
Madam, may I come in?

566
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:22,111
Come in.

567
00:44:26,611 --> 00:44:30,461
Someone asked me to deliver this letter to you.

568
00:44:58,721 --> 00:45:02,611
Last night, a stranger entered the men's quarters.

569
00:45:02,611 --> 00:45:05,271
It is probably the man guarding Kang Pil Jik.

570
00:45:05,271 --> 00:45:08,111
I think there are men hiding in various places under Father's orders.

571
00:45:08,111 --> 00:45:10,681
He must be looking for the one who sent that note, too...

572
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:13,211
Kicking me out is more his priority.

573
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:16,651
But seriously, what is the Royal Secretary of Defense doing?

574
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:19,341
While the captain and I were up all night running around,

575
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:20,931
he could not even take care of that?

576
00:45:20,931 --> 00:45:24,211
Maybe he has a reason for it...

577
00:45:25,411 --> 00:45:29,021
Are you, by chance, taking the Royal Secretary of Defense's side?

578
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:30,681
Pardon?

579
00:45:31,571 --> 00:45:33,711
S-Side?

580
00:45:33,711 --> 00:45:37,561
What reason does he have that he could not even handle that?

581
00:45:38,511 --> 00:45:40,911
My Lady!

582
00:45:41,811 --> 00:45:43,711
Madam has come home.

583
00:45:43,711 --> 00:45:45,211
Mother is back?

584
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:46,941
Please come out quickly.

585
00:45:46,941 --> 00:45:49,081
I will be there soon.

586
00:45:53,981 --> 00:45:58,381
Go and tell the Royal Secretary of Defense that he does not need to find a way for that.

587
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:01,351
Mother will gain some time for me.

588
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:03,971
Mother!

589
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:12,071
Did she forget that Madam wanted to send her off to tomb-watching more than His Excellency?

590
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:16,451
What! Who did you say has come?

591
00:46:17,301 --> 00:46:19,481
Father!

592
00:46:20,061 --> 00:46:23,151
Your Excellency, it is our Jeong.

593
00:46:23,151 --> 00:46:26,281
Our Jeong has come home.

594
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:28,181
Father,

595
00:46:28,181 --> 00:46:31,541
your undutiful son, Jeong, has come home only now.

596
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:33,751
H-How are you...

597
00:46:33,751 --> 00:46:36,111
You cannot believe it, either, right, Father?

598
00:46:36,111 --> 00:46:39,931
All the way home, I could not believe it, either...

599
00:46:42,461 --> 00:46:45,731
He was chased by bandits, nearly died, and he lost his memory.

600
00:46:45,731 --> 00:46:50,171
But a merchant rescued him and took him to the Qing Dynasty.

601
00:46:54,191 --> 00:46:57,911
I was unable to return because I did not remember anything.

602
00:46:57,911 --> 00:47:00,401
I heard you were quite heartbroken all these years.

603
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:04,931
I will never commit such filial impiety again.

604
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:15,891
Good, good! I see you have come home alive.

605
00:47:15,891 --> 00:47:22,061
I thought I would never see this father and son be so affectionate like this again...

606
00:47:25,411 --> 00:47:28,211
Mother, you are home.

607
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:30,871
Yes. It is good to see you, Dear.

608
00:47:30,871 --> 00:47:34,791
My Jeong, your husband has come home alive.

609
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:36,351
W-Who?

610
00:47:36,351 --> 00:47:38,661
My son, Jeong.

611
00:47:38,661 --> 00:47:41,931
He was perfectly fine and alive like this.

612
00:47:45,391 --> 00:47:49,261
I am sorry that it took me so long to come home.

613
00:47:49,971 --> 00:47:51,751
Wait! This guy is...

614
00:47:51,751 --> 00:47:53,441
M-My hair! My hair!

615
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:54,611
Why are you doing this?

616
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:59,041
Beautiful.

617
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:04,061
Is the Grand Merchant inside?

618
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:05,521
You are so rude!

619
00:48:05,521 --> 00:48:07,591
Oh, sorry. I am sorry.

620
00:48:07,591 --> 00:48:10,141
Have a good time.

621
00:48:12,871 --> 00:48:15,021
Oh, my gosh!

622
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:22,621
She has been mourning you for 15 years,

623
00:48:22,621 --> 00:48:24,411
so she is not used to being near a man.

624
00:48:24,411 --> 00:48:27,781
Gosh, how could she be so innocent?

625
00:48:28,381 --> 00:48:32,281
She will soon warm up to you, so do not be too heartbroken.

626
00:48:32,281 --> 00:48:33,961
Yes.

627
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:36,531
Let us head inside quickly.

628
00:48:46,161 --> 00:48:49,991
Now, I am dreaming the most bizarre of dreams.

629
00:48:58,661 --> 00:49:01,831
Are you doing this because I may drift elsewhere once I leave for tomb-watching?

630
00:49:01,831 --> 00:49:05,511
Why are you outside when you should be here?

631
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,721
May I come in for a moment?

632
00:49:09,721 --> 00:49:12,791
Dear Husband, please tell me he is not you! Please!

633
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:13,901
Please! Please!

634
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:16,931
- I will enter.
- No, you cannot!

635
00:49:17,841 --> 00:49:19,891
Pardon me.

636
00:49:22,771 --> 00:49:24,301
Well...

637
00:49:24,301 --> 00:49:26,051
Dear...

638
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,291
Dear Wife?

639
00:49:30,891 --> 00:49:33,151
I guess this is very confusing for you.

640
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:36,181
Please call me when you are calmer.

641
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,331
I will be waiting.

642
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:52,251
I did not think you would stop me from going tomb-watching like this.

643
00:50:01,221 --> 00:50:05,291
Bi Chan is following him without losing sight of him.

644
00:50:06,081 --> 00:50:10,151
He must watch carefully for anyone approaching them and where they are going.

645
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:13,371
I am keeping in contact with him constantly, so do not worry.

646
00:50:13,371 --> 00:50:16,271
- Okay.
- Father!

647
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,581
Daughter.

648
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:22,701
Why did you come here again?

649
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:26,141
The fateful love story that would only appear in a novel

650
00:50:26,141 --> 00:50:28,871
has appeared in the city again!

651
00:50:28,871 --> 00:50:32,471
The Left State Minister's son came home alive so that household is going crazy.

652
00:50:32,471 --> 00:50:36,631
It was well-known how she offered devout prayers every day for him.

653
00:50:36,631 --> 00:50:39,351
It appears the heavens have also been touched by it.

654
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:43,301
Whoa! How could something like that happen?

655
00:50:43,301 --> 00:50:45,661
Is this not a reason for celebration?

656
00:50:45,661 --> 00:50:48,741
How happy must the Left State Minister's wife be!

657
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:53,271
She gets to take off her mourning clothes and has a husband again!

658
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:56,191
I want to love someone like that, too!

659
00:50:56,191 --> 00:50:58,091
No, I will, Father!

660
00:50:58,091 --> 00:51:02,021
Well, if you were to do that, you would have to become a w-widow first...

661
00:51:02,021 --> 00:51:04,311
Nonsense!

662
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:07,331
That cannot be!

663
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:11,611
Captain Park!

664
00:51:13,411 --> 00:51:15,901
How could you say such stuff

665
00:51:15,901 --> 00:51:19,201
to the person who will become your husband!

666
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:24,201
I have some other guy in mind.

667
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:25,831
All right, then.

668
00:51:35,191 --> 00:51:38,211
Have you heard, Brother?

669
00:51:40,061 --> 00:51:41,711
I heard.

670
00:51:41,711 --> 00:51:43,961
How could a dead person come back alive?

671
00:51:43,961 --> 00:51:46,631
This cannot be!

672
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:50,161
I will enter.

673
00:51:57,671 --> 00:52:02,841
Dear Wife, I want to be alone with our Jeong for a moment.

674
00:52:02,841 --> 00:52:04,241
Of course, you do.

675
00:52:04,241 --> 00:52:07,771
I stayed right beside him continually since yesterday.

676
00:52:07,771 --> 00:52:10,481
Did you?

677
00:52:10,481 --> 00:52:13,381
Then, have a good conversation.

678
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:34,271
What are you up to that you came crawling in here?

679
00:52:34,271 --> 00:52:37,171
Everyone became happy, do you not think so?

680
00:52:39,081 --> 00:52:40,881
Except for you, Father.

681
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:43,491
You bastard!

682
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,561
I will forget everything you did to me,

683
00:52:50,561 --> 00:52:53,511
and I will take good care of Mother and my wife,

684
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:56,061
so do not worry too much.

685
00:52:58,221 --> 00:53:01,271
Do you know how much you have messed things up?

686
00:53:01,271 --> 00:53:03,071
Please...

687
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:05,891
Whatever your plans may be,

688
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:09,751
I hope other people do not get hurt by them.

689
00:53:24,181 --> 00:53:25,901
I...

690
00:53:26,601 --> 00:53:29,171
So, I...

691
00:53:30,581 --> 00:53:35,331
Brother, what am I to do?

692
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:43,191
This cannot be.

693
00:53:43,191 --> 00:53:44,871
This cannot be!

694
00:53:44,871 --> 00:53:47,131
Please just...

695
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:51,131
Never mind. Keep talking.

696
00:53:51,131 --> 00:53:55,491
If you do not at least talk, how would you be able to console yourself?

697
00:53:55,491 --> 00:53:57,301
I am just so curious.

698
00:53:57,301 --> 00:54:00,431
What kind of guy is he?

699
00:54:01,481 --> 00:54:04,311
You cannot wear mourning clothes

700
00:54:04,311 --> 00:54:08,411
in front of your husband, who is alive.

701
00:54:09,051 --> 00:54:12,161
I saw him a few times wearing mourning clothes, Mother.

702
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:16,461
I dressed you in the clothes Jae Yi wore before she got married,

703
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,651
but to think how nice you look in it...

704
00:54:18,651 --> 00:54:21,001
You look very beautiful.

705
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:23,391
Is that not so?

706
00:54:23,391 --> 00:54:25,441
Yes, Mother.

707
00:54:28,091 --> 00:54:31,481
She looks even more like that woman, dressed in colorful clothes.

708
00:54:31,481 --> 00:54:35,551
You have worn only mourning clothes ever since you married into our family.

709
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:38,431
You have gone through so much all these years.

710
00:54:38,431 --> 00:54:40,241
No, Mother.

711
00:54:40,241 --> 00:54:43,601
I was really fine. I mean it.

712
00:54:43,601 --> 00:54:49,801
Since my Jeong returned safe and sound, thanks to your devotion,

713
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:53,641
you should wear pretty clothes, go look around outside the walls,

714
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:56,481
and let us live a happy and abundant life.

715
00:54:56,481 --> 00:55:01,131
No, Mother. I am already living well, going outside these walls.

716
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,821
I wear black clothes instead of mourning clothes, too.

717
00:55:03,821 --> 00:55:06,721
I will just stay at the shrine wearing mourning clothes...

718
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:12,091
Right, how could you possibly express your emotions with words?

719
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:14,701
Though it is natural for you to be awkward,

720
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:17,781
but you need to get used to it.

721
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:21,481
All right, I will give you two some space,

722
00:55:21,481 --> 00:55:24,061
so have a good conversation.

723
00:55:24,061 --> 00:55:25,911
Oh, my. Oh, my, my.

724
00:55:25,911 --> 00:55:27,681
Mother?

725
00:55:27,681 --> 00:55:29,421
Mother...

726
00:55:53,271 --> 00:55:58,501
She definitely looks similar to the captain's secret lover.

727
00:55:59,161 --> 00:56:01,271
Why is he looking at me like that?

728
00:56:01,271 --> 00:56:04,571
By chance, does he remember?

729
00:56:06,881 --> 00:56:09,511
You have been through a lot.

730
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:12,461
No.

731
00:56:12,461 --> 00:56:13,691
Last time, at Myeongdogak—

732
00:56:13,691 --> 00:56:15,331
What do you mean, Myeongdogak?

733
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:18,101
I have never been to Myeongdogak.

734
00:56:18,101 --> 00:56:20,991
Well, that time, with your...

735
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,821
hair.

736
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:26,981
Back then, I did not know who you were...

737
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:28,341
I am sorry.

738
00:56:28,341 --> 00:56:31,491
At that time, I did not know you were my wife, either.

739
00:56:31,491 --> 00:56:35,851
But why did you say you were never at Myeongdogak?

740
00:56:36,591 --> 00:56:38,871
I thought he was a sick guy,

741
00:56:38,871 --> 00:56:42,141
but he seems to be pretty quick-witted.

742
00:56:42,141 --> 00:56:46,771
It appears she is hiding something.

743
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:50,171
As a mourning widow, I am not supposed to leave these walls,

744
00:56:50,171 --> 00:56:54,511
so I said that because I was afraid Mother would get angry if she found out.

745
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,911
I see.

746
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:58,551
I did not think of that.

747
00:56:59,511 --> 00:57:04,751
So, do you know the Captain of the Capital Garrison?

748
00:57:04,751 --> 00:57:06,221
Who is that?

749
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:09,121
I do not know him at all!

750
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,691
If you do not know him, that is fine.

751
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:26,701
Tonight may be your last chance.

752
00:57:26,701 --> 00:57:29,841
Wait for a moment. Let me take some time to think.

753
00:57:29,841 --> 00:57:32,271
What is there to think about?

754
00:57:32,271 --> 00:57:34,821
Will you keep staying here?

755
00:57:34,821 --> 00:57:37,141
Daughter.

756
00:57:45,051 --> 00:57:48,521
Why are you at the shrine again?

757
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:52,011
I guess I have become used to this space.

758
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:57,951
Your husband is alive now, so do not come up here again.

759
00:57:57,951 --> 00:57:59,041
Yes.

760
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:02,481
Also, until Jeong's room is prepared for him,

761
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:06,121
I have told him to stay at the annex, so keep that in mind.

762
00:58:06,121 --> 00:58:08,971
Yes. Pardon?

763
00:58:08,971 --> 00:58:12,311
Should you not bear children to carry our family name?

764
00:58:12,311 --> 00:58:19,031
I told him to stay at the annex until he produces a son.

765
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:29,151
I want to see a grandson as soon as possible.

766
00:58:32,161 --> 00:58:34,751
You should hurry on down.

767
00:58:55,941 --> 00:58:58,091
Do not worry so much.

768
00:58:58,091 --> 00:59:01,501
I am quite a good-mannered man.

769
00:59:02,881 --> 00:59:05,581
What are manners?

770
00:59:06,531 --> 00:59:09,851
You are earning your own punishment.

771
00:59:11,001 --> 00:59:13,581
It means someone knows etiquette.

772
00:59:13,581 --> 00:59:16,591
Since you say you know etiquette, I will tell you this.

773
00:59:16,591 --> 00:59:19,801
Since I got married alone and drank the wedding wine alone as well,

774
00:59:19,801 --> 00:59:25,061
would we not have to go through all of those processes properly to be an indeed married couple?

775
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,741
I did not think of that.

776
00:59:27,741 --> 00:59:29,621
Let us have the wedding again separately.

777
00:59:29,621 --> 00:59:34,031
However, did we give and receive marriage fortune letters?

778
00:59:34,031 --> 00:59:36,131
I am sure we did.

779
00:59:36,131 --> 00:59:40,681
You probably also received the marriage gift box.

780
00:59:40,681 --> 00:59:43,971
Then, first...

781
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:50,191
the marriage wine.

782
00:59:50,191 --> 00:59:53,741
Should I just kill him?

783
01:00:03,161 --> 01:00:05,081
I am sorry.

784
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:10,451
I am sorry for making you do all those things by yourself.

785
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:15,281
I have wanted to tell you that all day today.

786
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:17,481
I know nothing about you, Dear Wife,

787
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:20,061
but it is clear you are living like this because of me,

788
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:25,561
so I really wanted to... apologize to you for that.

789
01:00:25,561 --> 01:00:29,541
Even if someone is at fault, that is not Dear—

790
01:00:31,201 --> 01:00:33,151
Dear Husband's—

791
01:00:34,141 --> 01:00:36,671
That is not your fault.

792
01:00:38,341 --> 01:00:40,521
I said it just fine to the ancestral tablet,

793
01:00:40,521 --> 01:00:43,611
but I cannot say "Dear Husband" to a living person.

794
01:00:43,611 --> 01:00:47,371
Well then, let us sleep now.

795
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:54,481
If you are uncomfortable, I can sleep up there,

796
01:00:54,481 --> 01:00:58,501
and you can sleep down here.

797
01:01:10,301 --> 01:01:14,611
All right. Then I will go ahead and sleep.

798
01:01:14,611 --> 01:01:17,891
W-What are you doing right now?

799
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:20,321
Just sleep as you are.

800
01:01:20,321 --> 01:01:24,741
I have a habit of not being able to sleep wearing clothes.

801
01:01:25,621 --> 01:01:27,631
Gosh, seriously...

802
01:01:27,631 --> 01:01:31,061
I did not want to be like this from the first day...

803
01:01:31,061 --> 01:01:36,741
T-Then I will help you, so please turn around.

804
01:01:37,671 --> 01:01:39,911
Will you do that for me?

805
01:01:46,321 --> 01:01:49,551
Oh, Dear Wife, I actually—

806
01:01:50,951 --> 01:01:53,461
Gosh, Dear Husband.

807
01:01:53,461 --> 01:01:57,351
How could you be so weak with alcohol?

808
01:02:10,221 --> 01:02:12,151
Why are you here so late?

809
01:02:12,151 --> 01:02:14,021
I had trouble coming out.

810
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:17,691
Gosh, you would not be able to keep this up.

811
01:02:17,691 --> 01:02:19,631
What will you do now?

812
01:02:19,631 --> 01:02:21,861
I should find a way to leave the house quickly.

813
01:02:21,861 --> 01:02:24,861
Up until yesterday, we were looking for a way for you not to leave.

814
01:02:24,861 --> 01:02:28,021
You are really the extremely high-maintenance daughter-in-law.

815
01:02:29,231 --> 01:02:33,441
But how is your husband who came home alive?

816
01:02:33,441 --> 01:02:36,101
Could you stop it with the husband talk!

817
01:02:36,101 --> 01:02:38,331
It was that guy.

818
01:02:38,331 --> 01:02:40,641
It's the person named Joo, who was doing business here.

819
01:02:40,641 --> 01:02:42,101
Joo?

820
01:02:42,101 --> 01:02:46,581
His actions are weird and I do not know if he does it knowing anything or not.

821
01:02:46,581 --> 01:02:48,631
In any case, look into him for me.

822
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:50,831
Joo...

823
01:02:50,831 --> 01:02:52,651
This is quite weird.

824
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:55,491
It does not seem to be a coincidence.

825
01:02:55,491 --> 01:02:59,411
I must make the Finance Minister's wife confess everything by tomorrow somehow.

826
01:02:59,411 --> 01:03:02,451
This may be the last opportunity.

827
01:03:03,461 --> 01:03:06,051
If the Finance Minister's wife refuses to speak,

828
01:03:06,051 --> 01:03:10,701
I am afraid I may never find my brother.

829
01:03:10,701 --> 01:03:14,181
A person who is as pitiful as you is sleeping in the next room.

830
01:03:14,181 --> 01:03:18,001
So, could you wake him up and tell him to leave?

831
01:03:20,141 --> 01:03:22,261
Have you come?

832
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:26,601
I will give you my life, Elder.

833
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:49,621
Dear Wife.

834
01:04:04,001 --> 01:04:07,381
How much did he drink?

835
01:04:28,561 --> 01:04:33,881
I am seeing hallucinations now.

836
01:04:37,661 --> 01:04:39,521
Madam...

837
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:44,371
The wife of another.

838
01:04:44,371 --> 01:04:45,441
Madam.

I will go to Myeongdogak!

You bastard! Do you know how many hours we have been at this?

844
01:05:10,321 --> 01:05:12,391
Brother!

845
01:05:14,251 --> 01:05:18,531
I must go and ask what kind of guy he is!

846
01:05:19,571 --> 01:05:22,381
Let us go to Myeongdogak!

847
01:05:24,381 --> 01:05:25,951
Go then!

848
01:05:25,951 --> 01:05:28,861

Kang Pil Jik will try to kill you, Sir.

863
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:05,721
You must be careful.

864
01:06:05,721 --> 01:06:07,031
Are you...

865
01:06:07,031 --> 01:06:08,721
Let me ask you this.

866
01:06:08,721 --> 01:06:11,461
Is it better that my wife is your secret lover,

867
01:06:11,461 --> 01:06:14,391
or that she is a masked assailant?

868
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:17,001
I am thinking of having a small party with refreshments in two days.

869
01:06:17,001 --> 01:06:19,361
Left State Minister, you should bring Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong, your son,

870
01:06:19,361 --> 01:06:22,271
and your daughter-in-law with you.

871
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:25,631
I should resort to something cowardly.

872
01:06:25,631 --> 01:06:27,061
Your Majesty.

873
01:06:27,061 --> 01:06:29,831
