00:00:42,448 --> 00:00:44,295
Hello, Captain.

2
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:47,055
I apologize for visiting at a late hour.

3
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:50,575
Our business hours are already over, but if you are looking for something...

4
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:51,855
Well, the thing is...

5
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:53,365
Is that man—

6
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:56,978
I mean, did that person come here?

7
00:00:57,585 --> 00:01:00,685
Oh, you mean the person who entrusted Ggot Nim?

8
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,165
Well, I came to tell her something.

9
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:04,765
She is not here at the moment.

10
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,975
Oh, you can deliver my words instead, then.

11
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:08,885
The Capital Garrison will take care of it without fail,

12
00:01:08,885 --> 00:01:11,105
so tell her not to act recklessly.

13
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:12,795
Especially regarding Kang Pil Jik—

14
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:15,395
Sir Captain.

15
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:17,765
She already left.

16
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:19,425
What?

17
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:10,135
Oh, my!

18
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:16,995
Damn it!

19
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:35,545
I told you this is the Capital Garrison's business.

20
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:37,905
Wait! How did you know I came here?

21
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:39,505
That is not the issue here.

22
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:42,235
What makes you think you can come here alone?

23
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:47,315
My goodness.

24
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:58,985
- Are you okay?
- Get yourself together.

25
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:01,085
Get yourself together.

26
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,685
Are you okay?

27
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:06,255
Get yourself together.

28
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:08,985
What is this? Why is everyone down?

29
00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:11,905
Looks like we need to check inside.

30
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:19,925
How dare these brats!

31
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:22,155
Who untied them?

32
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:30,935
[Knight Flower - Episode 5: Love scandal of Joseon's men and women]

33
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:45,305
My Lady!

34
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:47,345
Who is this man?

35
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:50,865
- I will explain later. Get the children first!
- Yes.

36
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:52,175
There, be careful.

37
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:53,945
- Hurry.
- Where are we going?

38
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:56,655
Are we going home?

39
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:02,405
Careful, now.

40
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,325
Be careful.

41
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:08,595
Kids, you have to be quiet. Okay?

42
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:10,345
Yes.

43
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:24,015
Where are you taking the children?

44
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:44,185
Damn it!

45
00:04:44,835 --> 00:04:47,305
Whether it be the goods or the rats, find them right now!

46
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:48,915
Yes!

47
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:58,365
I am asking what you are going to do with the children!

48
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:00,855
I plan to send the children to a safe place.

49
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:04,525
You cannot just let the children go when they are the witnesses of the crime!

50
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:07,075
- They must be taken to the Capital Garrison—
- You cannot!

51
00:05:07,075 --> 00:05:09,265
I found the children, so I will take them.

52
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:11,465
How can you be so reckless?

53
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:14,855
Do you not think I can arrest you right now?

54
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:18,645
After tomorrow, those children will have been sold off and gone missing forever.

55
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:21,275
All the more reason to investigate and put an end to the case!

56
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:23,565
To me, the children's safety is putting an end to this.

57
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:29,075
Punishing Kang Pil Jik by law puts an end to this matter.

58
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:36,935
Are you certain Kang Pil Jik will be punished if you present the children as witnesses?

59
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:39,965
Can you prevent him from doing this crap ever again?

60
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:46,065
Can you guarantee the children will be able to go back to their lives safely after?

61
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:48,645
The country has its laws, the Capital Garrison, and the Criminal Arresting Agency,

62
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:54,135
but can you really say they take care of the powerless I have seen at night?

63
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:57,695
- That would be—
- Captain, you can continue investigating.

64
00:05:57,695 --> 00:06:01,915
I will do what I can do.

65
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:09,775
Are you not afraid of having your identity found out?

66
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:15,845
If you are going to arrest me, do so right now.

68
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:30,975

♫ I pray my love will be with me tomorrow ♫

74

Forgive me! We deserve to die!

75
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:16,565
On top of losing the children who were locked up,

76
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:20,385
the masked one and Park Su Ho, too?

77
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:21,675
Keep running your mouth.

78
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,915
Please spare me!

79
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:28,745
I am truly generous

80
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:34,115
for taking losers like you under my wing and making them my men.

81
00:07:34,115 --> 00:07:37,005
I cannot even cut you off.

82
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:41,775
- I beg your—
- What on Earth were you doing while I was gone?

83
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,375
Get rid of every single related thing right now.

84
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,365
Yes!

85
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:54,825
In addition,

86
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:58,465
do not do anything that may provide them with an excuse for a while.

87
00:07:58,465 --> 00:08:02,645
Be on the sly and find that masked bastard first!

88
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:06,595
- Yes, I understand.
- Yes!

89
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:22,915
Brother.

90
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:26,745
Where have you been at this late hour?

91
00:08:26,745 --> 00:08:28,535
Are you worried about me?

92
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:30,715
Worried for what?

93
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:38,265
I am glad to see you again after half a day.

94
00:08:38,265 --> 00:08:42,245
It looks like you were taught a lesson.

95
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,165
You were able to notice it?

96
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:48,935
Did someone really teach you a lesson?

97
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:56,475
Brother, would you like to have a drink?

98
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:09,395
Gosh, is it a person or a ghost?

99
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,825
Minister of General Affairs' daughter-in-law?

100
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:25,635
Whoa!

101
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:30,685
My Lady, are you all right?

102
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:32,585
Yong Deok.

103
00:09:37,605 --> 00:09:39,725
I am fine.

104
00:10:06,695 --> 00:10:08,765
Brother,

105
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:13,715
knowing what happened to me as a child and what kind of risk would follow,

106
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:18,035
why did you and Father take me in?

107
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:23,515
Though I do not remember the entirety of what happened,

108
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:29,765
you held my hand that day, regardless of what my background was and

109
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:32,595
what kind of danger might have befallen you.

110
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:37,125
What are you saying?

111
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,655
I cannot really remember.

112
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:43,725
So, although you treated me harshly every time,

113
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:47,545
I did not feel upset at all because you held my hand that day.

114
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:51,055
- Su Ho, I wish for you—
- I know.

115
00:10:51,055 --> 00:10:54,185
I know you are doing this because

116
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:56,755
no one must find out...

117
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,615
that I am alive and whose son I am.

118
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:03,375
You lived quietly all this time as I wished.

119
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,075
But what has gotten into you at this point?

120
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:17,465
I got to know a certain person coincidently.

121
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,265
Who is this person?

122
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:27,505
Are you not afraid of having your identity found out?

123
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:30,985
I mean, I am afraid as well. It makes me tremble.

124
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:32,665
Why would I not be afraid?

125
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:36,545
Can you prevent him from doing this crap ever again?

126
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:38,815
Was I too harsh?

127
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:56,685
Why does he stare at a person like that?

128
00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:09,025
I did not see anything, nothing at all.

129
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:11,865
"Good Conduct for Women," said, "Do not try to find out other people's secrets,

130
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,535
do not speak of other people's flaws..."

131
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:18,605
Oh my god! Whatever, whatever!

132
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:34,175
I do not really...

133
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,565
know who it is, to be honest.

134
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:40,845
What a lame fellow you are.

135
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:43,315
Anyhow, I was wondering if what she does is

136
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:47,995
similar to the warmth of your hand holding mine that day.

137
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:50,175
What on Earth are you talking about?

138
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:53,195
Which is why I wonder how she could dare to do that.

139
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:55,325
It is amazing how she can do such things.

140
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:58,605
I just cannot tell what she is thinking, either.

141
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:03,565
But her body is faster than her brain, so I wonder if she actually thinks.

142
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:06,785
And everything she says is not in the least bit wrong.

143
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,235
So it makes me angry!

144
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,065
So, who is this person?

145
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:18,895
I am the captain of the Capital Garrison!

146
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:23,375
However, I could not argue back.

147
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,665
So, who were you trying to argue back?

148
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:32,835
That is why I am going to arrest Kang Pil Jik without fail!

149
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:42,585
I did not know you were a light drinker until today.

150
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:51,915
I also did not know you had such a high alcohol tolerance until today.

151
00:14:06,505 --> 00:14:09,545
So, who is this person you are talking about?

152
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:16,535
I am not telling you, Brother.

153
00:14:18,535 --> 00:14:21,965
I am also dying to find out.

154
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:24,175
About what?

155
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:28,265
Exactly what kind of person she is.

156
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:30,735
So, tell me who it is!

157
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:35,195
Guess who it is.

158
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:40,575
Park Su Ho!

159
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:45,525
What on Earth have I done?

160
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:47,735
That is right.

161
00:14:47,735 --> 00:14:50,525
Have you sobered up a bit?

162
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:53,565
- When did you come?
- Last night.

163
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,255
Are you not being too harsh here?

164
00:14:57,255 --> 00:14:59,635
You told me to go find the evidence outside for two entire days.

165
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:02,075
But you were drinking with Sir Royal Secretary.

166
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:05,545
Also, why did you not tell me Kang Pil Jik was released?

167
00:15:05,545 --> 00:15:09,465
So, is there anything you found out?

168
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:13,375
I went to the Garrison Commander to report because you were drunk out of your wits.

169
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,245
And he told me not to even go near Kang Pil Jik.

170
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:19,015
If I try anything funny one more time...

171
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:26,915
Sir, do you know how weird you are acting these days?

172
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:29,225
What do you mean?

173
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:33,115
"I am also dying to find out.."

174
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:37,055
"Exactly what kind of person she is."

175
00:15:37,055 --> 00:15:39,535
Did I do that to you, too?

176
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:42,225
Strangely, including how odd you are acting,

177
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:45,315
incidents have been popping up everywhere since we came to Hanyang.

178
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:48,245
This is terrible!

179
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:51,535
The Finance Minister passed away!

180
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,885
Pardon?

181
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:56,295
Your Excellency! Your Excellency.

182
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:57,595
Please open your eyes.

183
00:15:57,595 --> 00:16:01,655
An earthshattering thing happened last night!

184
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:07,515
How can such an atrocious thing happen in the middle of the capital?

185
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:12,525
Especially when I am the Garrison Commander, above all!

186
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:14,395
He was fine up until yesterday, though.

187
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:17,455
He was fine! Of course, he was fine.

188
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:20,925
He was totally fine but outright got murdered!

189
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:23,595
- Wait, murdered?
- Are you saying he was murdered?

190
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:28,315
Well, would that portly guy have fallen sick overnight and died?

191
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:31,615
- Who could have?
- If I knew that, would I have—

192
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,255
Wait a moment.

193
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:38,525
You had quite a special relationship with His Excellency the Finance Minister.

194
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:43,935
Do not stay here, but go to the scene to catch the culprit.

195
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:47,115
Be quicker than the Criminal Arresting Agency!

196
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:48,605
Are we investigating as well?

197
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:50,735
Of course!

198
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:54,655
"I am also dying to find out."

199
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:59,685
"Exactly what kind of person she is."

200
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:04,195
Did I do that to you as well, Garrison Commander?

201
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:07,005
I am also curious about who on Earth killed him.

202
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,975
So, let us go right now. Lead the way!

203
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:10,635
Yes!

204
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:24,845
The children should have left for Hwayeon Merchandising in Hamgyeong Province by now.
(One of the Eight Provinces of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty.)

205
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,475
Yes, how fortunate.

206
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:35,705
Why are you sighing this time?

207
00:17:36,475 --> 00:17:38,785
Well, it is nothing serious.

208
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,775
It is not serious. And?

209
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:45,085
The captain showed up.

210
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:47,135
- Again?
- Exactly.

211
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:49,765
He somehow found out and showed up right there and then.

212
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:51,855
Could he have gone to rescue the children, too?

213
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:53,845
That seems to be the case.

214
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:57,335
He said he would take the children as witnesses.

215
00:17:57,335 --> 00:17:58,605
And then?

216
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:00,645
"You cannot. You just do your job right."

217
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:02,085
"Do not interfere with my work!"

218
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:05,115
Are you telling me that is what you said to the captain?

219
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:09,225
Wait! What if the captain really arrests you, My Lady?

220
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:14,395
That is why I told him to arrest me if he wants to, loud and clear!

221
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,875
My goodness.

222
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:23,375
Well, I do not think he will actually arrest me.

223
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,455
But it does not seem totally impossible, either.

224
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,815
What if he really does arrest you?

225
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:30,795
What if he finds out who you are?

226
00:18:30,795 --> 00:18:33,645
That is what worries me a little...

227
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:37,715
just a tiny little bit.

228
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:40,445
A tiny little bit?

229
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:42,135
A tiny little bit, you say?

230
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:45,005
It is making me shiver in fear!

231
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:48,315
Seriously, My Lady!

232
00:18:48,315 --> 00:18:51,205
How are you so carefree when it comes to yourself?

233
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:53,015
Geez!

234
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:56,345
Wait, Yeon Seon—

235
00:18:59,435 --> 00:19:01,645
Young Madam!

236
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:06,925
Madam said to get dressed quickly and come out to go pay her condolences.

237
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:08,235
What condolences?

238
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:13,685
They said the Finance Minister passed away last night.

239
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,055
How could this have happened?

240
00:19:26,055 --> 00:19:28,215
You are here.

241
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:32,395
How devastated you must be for such atrocity to befall you out of nowhere.

242
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:34,985
Devastated is not enough.

243
00:19:35,535 --> 00:19:39,695
I cannot express how heartbroken I am.

244
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:43,955
The Capital Garrison will capture the culprit without fail!

245
00:19:43,955 --> 00:19:46,405
The Criminal Arresting Agency is already investigating.

246
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:50,075
By the way, it is sad enough he passed away suddenly,

247
00:19:50,075 --> 00:19:53,495
so... must his corpse be examined at the scene as well?

248
00:19:53,495 --> 00:19:57,205
The Criminal Arresting Agency is even examining his corpse?

249
00:19:57,855 --> 00:20:01,115
What are you doing? Go in there right now and watch closely to make sure

250
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:04,985
the Criminal Arresting Agency does not make any mistakes!

251
00:20:04,985 --> 00:20:06,585
Yes.

252
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,685
Who dares to intrude?

253
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:42,545
You scoundrel—

254
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:14,315
Let me see the silver hairpin.

255
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:46,525
You have quite the quick feet.

256
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:49,295
That is what I want to say.

257
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:53,215
Do you bring your daughter-in-law even to these gatherings?

258
00:21:53,215 --> 00:21:59,255
As the saying goes, there are 1,000 brothers at a place of drinking and eating.

259
00:21:59,255 --> 00:22:03,905
But there is no one besides you amidst crises and perils.

260
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,215
The Finance Minister's wife has always been fond of my daughter-in-law.

261
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:10,318
But how could I forbid her to even visit at such a sorrowful time

262
00:22:10,318 --> 00:22:13,488
just because she is a widow?

263
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:17,655
- Let us go in.
- Yes, Mother.

264
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:26,138
[Prohibited]

265
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,515
Here it comes again.

266
00:22:41,515 --> 00:22:44,625
The northern blizzard with an invisible blade.

267
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:54,015
You are here.

268
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:55,875
How devastated you must be.

269
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,605
For such misfortune to befall you so suddenly.

270
00:22:58,605 --> 00:23:01,485
How could I ever console you?

271
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:06,405
Your daughter-in-law is here, too.

272
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:09,845
I was very startled by the sudden—

273
00:23:13,095 --> 00:23:15,725
...the sudden news.

274
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:19,855
The Capital Garrison and the Criminal Arresting Agency both came out to investigate.

275
00:23:19,855 --> 00:23:22,375
So, it is a bit chaotic.

276
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:25,425
Who would dare to harm the Finance Minister?

277
00:23:26,325 --> 00:23:28,455
Sir! Sir!

278
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:29,855
I did not do it, Sir!

279
00:23:29,855 --> 00:23:31,555
It was not my doing, Sir!

280
00:23:31,555 --> 00:23:34,015
- Sir! Sir!
- Hear ye!

281
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:35,705
Make him kneel!

282
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:39,635
Yong Deok.

283
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:41,395
My Lady.

284
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:47,755
This man is the culprit.

285
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:50,015
I did not kill His Excellency!

286
00:23:50,015 --> 00:23:53,795
This man is a member of our household.

287
00:23:54,285 --> 00:23:57,905
On what basis are you saying he is the culprit?

288
00:23:57,905 --> 00:24:03,355
Circumstantially, an inside job was suspected, so we searched the servant's quarters.

289
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:07,375
And this thing was found in his possession.

290
00:24:10,605 --> 00:24:17,145
This is indeed His Excellency's ring.

291
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:21,015
That ring is mine.

292
00:24:21,015 --> 00:24:23,455
Madam, please look at it closely!

293
00:24:23,455 --> 00:24:26,455
That is really mine, I swear!

294
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:30,575
In that case, where did you get that ring?

295
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:32,235
The thing is...

296
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:35,815
The thing is...

297
00:24:35,815 --> 00:24:41,165
According to another servant, he left his room last night and did not return until dawn.

298
00:24:41,165 --> 00:24:42,655
What did you do last night?

299
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:46,185
Last night, I did not even go near the men's quarters.

300
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:49,065
You will need someone to testify what you said.

301
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:50,745
Do you have one?

302
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:57,235
The thing is...

303
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:16,255
I apologize.

304
00:25:16,255 --> 00:25:21,165
The thing is, I was out in the cold for too long— So the coughs, the thing is—

305
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:31,845
How... How could you!

306
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:33,095
Madam Jeong.

307
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:35,605
After all His Excellency has done for you,

308
00:25:35,605 --> 00:25:39,265
how could you do such a cruel thing?

309
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:43,365
Please believe me.

310
00:25:44,005 --> 00:25:47,005
I have not lied about a single thing, Madam!

311
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,535
How dare—

312
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:50,055
Madam Jeong!

313
00:25:50,055 --> 00:25:51,975
- Hurry up and escort her inside!
- Yes, yes!

314
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:53,515
Gosh, please be careful.

315
00:25:53,515 --> 00:25:58,255
What are you all doing? Hurry up and tie up the culprit!

316
00:25:58,255 --> 00:25:59,175
- Yes!
- Yes!

317
00:25:59,175 --> 00:26:01,985
Madam, please believe me!

318
00:26:01,985 --> 00:26:04,045
- Madam!
- Take him!

319
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:06,675
Please believe me, Madam!

320
00:26:07,535 --> 00:26:09,235
No!

321
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:22,805
How could such a disastrous thing happen?

322
00:26:22,805 --> 00:26:25,125
A finance minister was murdered!

323
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,545
I know.

324
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:29,815
To make things worse, he was killed by his slave, embarrassingly.

325
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:33,915
He acted as if he owned the world. I knew this would happen one day.

326
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:38,515
Alas, Defense Minister, how can you speak that way?

327
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:43,505
Are you saying a flawed person can die at his slave's hands at any time?

328
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:45,065
That is not what I meant—

329
00:26:45,065 --> 00:26:46,125
What about the culprit?

330
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,675
He was caught at the residence just now and

331
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:51,355
handed over to the Criminal Arresting Agency.

332
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:56,855
The capital is becoming more chaotic by the day.

333
00:26:56,855 --> 00:27:00,715
Since this is a wicked crime where a high-ranking official was murdered,

334
00:27:00,715 --> 00:27:05,385
order a close investigation to see if a figure is behind the culprit.

335
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:06,485
Yes, Left State Minister.

336
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:10,765
Tell them to report all progress regarding this matter to me in person.

337
00:27:10,765 --> 00:27:13,945
Do you mean to take this matter into your own hands?

338
00:27:13,945 --> 00:27:18,795
We must promptly take care of the aftermath to set the country right!

339
00:27:18,795 --> 00:27:20,298
Yes.

340
00:27:20,298 --> 00:27:22,268
[Injeongmun]
(Gate at Changdeok Palace)

341
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:33,015
- Tavern Lady, two bowls of soup and rice here!
- Goodness, you are welcome!

342
00:27:33,015 --> 00:27:36,225
Goodness, give me a moment.

343
00:27:44,825 --> 00:27:47,165
What are you doing here at this time of the day?

344
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:51,215
W-Whoa, you are Sir Royal Secretary.

345
00:27:52,425 --> 00:27:53,515
Whoa, how great.

346
00:27:53,515 --> 00:27:58,565
You should also take a seat. I will buy you a drink.

347
00:27:58,565 --> 00:28:01,678
- Tavern Lady, one more bottle, please!
- Okay!

348
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:09,455
Gosh, why is everyone drinking alcohol that they cannot handle these days?

349
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:20,015
Are you drunk?

350
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:24,465
Oh, not sure. Is this what you call drunk?

351
00:28:24,465 --> 00:28:27,115
Today is my first time drinking.

352
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:29,775
It tastes great and makes me feel great, too.

353
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:33,918
I can see why people drink alcohol.

354
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:36,795
Goodness, you are asking for trouble.

355
00:28:36,795 --> 00:28:39,555
What more trouble could come my way?

356
00:28:39,555 --> 00:28:44,335
I mean, no amount of worrying will help!

357
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:53,395
I do not know anymore, either.

358
00:28:53,395 --> 00:28:56,345
She will do as she pleases.

359
00:28:56,345 --> 00:29:00,315
Who are you so worried about?

360
00:29:00,315 --> 00:29:05,165
There is this person I know!

361
00:29:05,165 --> 00:29:09,565
She saved me from starving to death when I was a child,

362
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:13,415
like a heavenly maiden who came down from the sky!

363
00:29:16,445 --> 00:29:20,875
I said I would buy a house and leave after saving 1,000 nyang.

364
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:25,595
So, I kept doing my best not to save 1,000 nyang.

365
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:32,895
You do not want to leave her side, huh?

366
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:37,945
That is not exactly it.

367
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:42,375
I can leave only after she becomes happy.

368
00:29:47,165 --> 00:29:50,205
I also have such a person.

369
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:55,175
That person needs to be happy for me to be at peace.

370
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:57,745
Gosh, I actually have two.

371
00:29:57,745 --> 00:29:59,855
Two such people?

372
00:29:59,855 --> 00:30:02,925
Whoa, one is hard enough, but you have two.

373
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:07,265
One person has no one but me by his side,

374
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:09,755
making him the loneliest in the world.

375
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:13,675
The other has no one to protect him but me.

376
00:30:13,675 --> 00:30:16,055
My poor younger brother.

377
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:20,605
You are also quite pitiful, Sir.

378
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:40,055
My.

379
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:46,605
Stop drinking and go back home now.

380
00:30:46,605 --> 00:30:48,065
Sorry?

381
00:30:48,565 --> 00:30:51,675
You are going to go back home anyway. Right?

382
00:30:56,655 --> 00:31:00,315
How did you know that?

383
00:31:00,315 --> 00:31:04,465
Well, because I also end up going back,

384
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,245
all the time.

385
00:31:23,985 --> 00:31:25,105
You cannot come inside.

386
00:31:25,105 --> 00:31:27,285
My! How impertinent.

387
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,125
How dare you lay your hands on a woman?

388
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,725
I said I was only going to see my father and leave.

389
00:31:35,725 --> 00:31:39,355
It has been more than ten days since I saw the Young Master.

390
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,565
What is the matter?

391
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:43,085
Hurry up and tell them to move.

392
00:31:43,085 --> 00:31:47,145
She said she is the Garrison Commander's daughter.

393
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:51,005
Oh, the one we were told never to let inside the Capital Garrison.

394
00:31:52,885 --> 00:31:55,425
I am Officer Bi Chan.

395
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:57,995
All right, Officer Bi Chan. Let me in now.

396
00:31:57,995 --> 00:31:59,555
That will be difficult.

397
00:31:59,555 --> 00:32:02,085
I am under the direct orders of the Garrison Commander.

398
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:03,935
But my father told me

399
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:06,285
- to bring him lunch.
- To bring him lunch?

400
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:08,285
He told me not to fall for that, too.

401
00:32:08,285 --> 00:32:12,815
The sun will be setting soon, so please go home now.

402
00:32:18,775 --> 00:32:20,495
What is this!

403
00:32:20,495 --> 00:32:21,525
What?

404
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:24,315
Did you just throw this basket at me?

405
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:25,555
I do not know.

406
00:32:25,555 --> 00:32:28,195
If you keep acting like this, then I will seriously—

407
00:32:28,195 --> 00:32:32,495
I think I should meet with the clerk of Hanseongbu again.

408
00:32:32,495 --> 00:32:34,235
Why all of a sudden?

409
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:35,785
I said I would see the young master and leave.

410
00:32:35,785 --> 00:32:37,395
I said he is not here!

411
00:32:37,395 --> 00:32:39,965
Do not lie to me! I know he is here!

412
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:41,525
Yes, go right away.

413
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:44,685
Run like the wind and do your work.

414
00:32:44,685 --> 00:32:46,465
Quickly!

415
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,605
If you do not leave now, I will really...

416
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:50,545
Please leave!

417
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:54,995
He has no choice but to be framed for it,

418
00:32:54,995 --> 00:32:57,305
yet he is not telling the truth!

419
00:32:58,025 --> 00:32:59,805
It is not like I can say that I saw something.

420
00:32:59,805 --> 00:33:02,385
But I cannot just ignore it.

421
00:33:03,635 --> 00:33:05,655
What can you not ignore this time?

422
00:33:05,655 --> 00:33:08,145
Yeon Seon! Why are you here only now?

423
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:10,755
I have been waiting for you.

424
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,875
I did some daytime drinking.

425
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,585
Drinking?

426
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:19,085
I was afraid I may just blab carelessly to you while drunk, My Lady.

427
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:21,095
So, I sobered up a bit before I came in.

428
00:33:21,095 --> 00:33:24,085
I will really be careful from now on.

429
00:33:25,595 --> 00:33:27,685
All right. Tell me.

430
00:33:27,685 --> 00:33:30,345
What can you not ignore now?

431
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:33,415
There is a widow who is in a worse situation than I am.

432
00:33:39,215 --> 00:33:41,965
Husband, you did not hear this.

433
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:49,285
[The Story of Madam Baek - What happened at the watermill]

434
00:33:57,095 --> 00:33:59,245
Gosh! Oh, my! Oh, my!

435
00:34:08,235 --> 00:34:09,645
Pardon?

436
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:11,185
No way...

437
00:34:11,185 --> 00:34:12,545
I was shocked, too.

438
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:14,955
I could not believe it despite seeing it with my own eyes.

439
00:34:14,955 --> 00:34:18,675
Do you know how many times I got in and out of a palanquin because of her? Daintily!

440
00:34:18,675 --> 00:34:23,175
Whoa, seriously. You were no match for her in many ways.

441
00:34:23,175 --> 00:34:24,895
Goodness.

442
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:27,795
In any case, in a situation like this,

443
00:34:27,795 --> 00:34:31,195
I am worried if the Minister of General Affairs' daughter-in-law is okay.

444
00:34:33,935 --> 00:34:38,455
Yet again, My Lady is worried about something else at a time like this.

445
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:43,245
It is quite worrisome.

446
00:34:52,895 --> 00:34:57,535
I thought something was suspicious when you said you lost the other one.

447
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:02,865
I never imagined you would dare to think of something so horrible!

448
00:35:02,865 --> 00:35:04,855
No, Mother. This is a misunderstanding.

449
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:07,935
Really, I lost it.

450
00:35:07,935 --> 00:35:12,545
Did you think I did not know you were out and about at night?

451
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:14,295
Mother...

452
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:19,015
Mother... Mother...

453
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:25,075
Seeing how you abstain from food to follow your husband to death,

454
00:35:25,075 --> 00:35:29,295
how could I watch and do nothing?

455
00:35:32,155 --> 00:35:34,025
Mother!

456
00:35:35,765 --> 00:35:39,455
Do not bring any more dishonor to our family,

457
00:35:40,345 --> 00:35:46,235
and remain to the end a woman praised by everyone.

458
00:35:47,085 --> 00:35:51,105
If you are still alive when I open the doors again,

459
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:52,885
then...

460
00:35:53,955 --> 00:35:57,425
you will not die a peaceful death.

461
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:04,445
Mother...

462
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:20,595
The Finance Minister suddenly died...

463
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,805
It is quite shocking.

464
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:26,465
I think you will have to brace yourself firmly.

465
00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:28,495
Is it that bad?

466
00:36:28,495 --> 00:36:32,815
"Report all progress regarding this matter to me in person."

467
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,685
That is what he said.

468
00:36:34,685 --> 00:36:38,325
It appears the Left State Minister is overreacting a bit.

469
00:36:39,085 --> 00:36:41,475
Do you think there is another reason for it?

470
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:46,205
First, since a minister of the court has died suddenly,

471
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:50,725
I think we should look into that matter carefully as well.

472
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:53,955
All right, I understand.

473
00:36:55,475 --> 00:36:58,565
Did you find out anything more about those three?

474
00:36:58,565 --> 00:37:02,505
Yes. I looked into their whereabouts that night.

475
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:06,945
One of them entered and left the palace, even though it was not his shift.

476
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:08,185
Who was that?

477
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:10,555
A man named Cho Seong Hoo.

478
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:13,915
Cho Seong Hoo?

479
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:18,095
Then, we should look into him first.

480
00:37:18,095 --> 00:37:20,265
Yes, Your Majesty.

481
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,345
What are you thinking about so intently?

482
00:37:37,345 --> 00:37:40,965
It was definitely a sweet scent.

483
00:37:40,965 --> 00:37:43,315
A sweet scent?

484
00:37:51,175 --> 00:37:55,195
There was a scent coming from the dead Finance Minister's mouth!

485
00:37:55,195 --> 00:37:57,805
What do you mean by "scent" from a dead man's mouth?

486
00:37:57,805 --> 00:38:00,255
Not only that, but the Finance Minister's mouth was—

487
00:38:00,255 --> 00:38:03,268
Did you bring the autopsy report?

488
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:06,445
You even personally confirmed it with the clerk already,

489
00:38:06,445 --> 00:38:08,595
but you want to look at it again?

490
00:38:13,455 --> 00:38:16,175
He died at the hour of the dog.
(Between 7:00 - 9:00 p.m.)

491
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:23,455
Was the cause of his death...

492
00:38:24,315 --> 00:38:26,755
trauma to the head?

493
00:38:26,755 --> 00:38:28,665
The thing is...

494
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:40,185
What was she trying to say, then?

495
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:49,265
Let us go.

496
00:38:50,635 --> 00:38:51,805
To where?

497
00:38:51,805 --> 00:38:54,915
You should at least tell me where!

498
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:58,085
I wonder if the Minister of General Affairs' daughter-in-law is okay.

499
00:39:01,025 --> 00:39:05,345
Look at this firm and vibrant handwriting.

500
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:08,795
When the Queen Dowager wrote this,

501
00:39:08,795 --> 00:39:11,425
do you think she only wrote it on these pages?

502
00:39:11,425 --> 00:39:13,225
Does she know about this situation?

503
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,945
She probably wrote it deep in her heart

504
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:18,855
and meditated on it.

505
00:39:20,015 --> 00:39:22,595
I am in no position to worry about her.

506
00:39:23,285 --> 00:39:27,175
How dare you think about something else when your mother is speaking!

507
00:39:27,175 --> 00:39:28,545
I am sorry, Mother.

508
00:39:28,545 --> 00:39:31,555
Though we received the Queen Dowager's "Good Conduct for Women,"

509
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:35,115
you are lacking in comparison to the Minister of General Affairs' daughter-in-law, even if you tried hard.

510
00:39:35,115 --> 00:39:37,125
What are you so preoccupied with?

511
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,805
Mother, you are right.

512
00:39:39,805 --> 00:39:41,825
She is a very thorough person,

513
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:44,255
so I am sure she would not do anything for others to find faults in her.

514
00:39:44,255 --> 00:39:46,975
Are you saying I am finding fault with you?

515
00:39:46,975 --> 00:39:49,215
Of course not, Mother!

516
00:39:49,215 --> 00:39:52,365
You have to do everything in advance so you do not trail behind

517
00:39:52,365 --> 00:39:54,535
the Minister of General Affairs' daughter-in-law.

518
00:39:54,535 --> 00:39:58,045
Then, what do you need to do now?

519
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:08,675
I am thinking about seeing for myself how the Minister of General Affairs' daughter-in-law is doing.

520
00:40:08,675 --> 00:40:10,765
What do you think, Mother?

521
00:40:10,765 --> 00:40:13,225
What do you mean by that?

522
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:16,775
What brings you here, Sir?

523
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:20,265
I wanted to ask a few questions to the culprit who was arrested yesterday.

524
00:40:20,265 --> 00:40:21,825
Are you talking about Yong Deok?

525
00:40:21,825 --> 00:40:24,565
Was there anything suspicious about him recently?

526
00:40:24,565 --> 00:40:27,435
Rather than suspicious, he seemed to have a secret lover.

527
00:40:27,435 --> 00:40:29,365
He was going out at night a lot.

528
00:40:29,365 --> 00:40:31,165
Secret lover?

529
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:34,915
By chance, do you know who that is?

530
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:36,155
Was it Goo Wol?

531
00:40:36,155 --> 00:40:38,578
Or was it Un Nyeon?

532
00:40:39,345 --> 00:40:44,045
Did you not say someone saw him meeting a woman in a mourning dress in Seonghwangdang?
(A shrine for folk religion gods)

533
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:47,015
I heard he fell in love with some widow.

534
00:40:47,015 --> 00:40:49,215
- Right!
- A widow?

535
00:40:49,215 --> 00:40:52,785
She was pretty and behaved modestly, too.

536
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:56,885
She did not seem to be a commoner's widow.

537
00:40:56,885 --> 00:41:00,825
Is this the love that I have only heard of?

538
00:41:02,115 --> 00:41:04,295
I must go to the prison.

539
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:19,545
What brings you here, Left State Minister's daughter-in-law?

540
00:41:19,545 --> 00:41:22,285
I hope I am not bothering you by suddenly coming here.

541
00:41:22,285 --> 00:41:25,635
No. Please come inside.

542
00:41:25,635 --> 00:41:29,085
I came to ask your daughter-in-law to teach me.

543
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:32,235
Where is she?

544
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:36,415
If you came to see my second daughter-in-law,

545
00:41:36,415 --> 00:41:38,635
I feel it will be difficult to see her now.

546
00:41:38,635 --> 00:41:41,275
Is she unwell?

547
00:41:44,225 --> 00:41:47,355
She is abstaining from food, saying she will follow her husband to death,

548
00:41:47,355 --> 00:41:51,195
making us worry.

549
00:41:51,195 --> 00:41:52,835
Please come inside for now.

550
00:41:52,835 --> 00:41:54,475
Yes.

551
00:42:03,465 --> 00:42:07,035
I think it is going to take some time.

552
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:11,375
Ma'am, please go to the kitchen and take a break with Soon Geum-daek.

553
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:13,625
I will stay here.

554
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:15,605
Should I?

555
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:38,025
Your daughter-in-law is a role model for all women mourning their husbands.

556
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:41,285
I would like to talk with her and have her teach me.

557
00:42:41,285 --> 00:42:43,435
You have wasted your time.

558
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:47,855
I do not think you will be able to meet my daughter-in-law.

559
00:42:47,855 --> 00:42:50,165
If you can tell me when I can meet her,

560
00:42:50,165 --> 00:42:53,345
could I come back for a visit then?

561
00:42:54,365 --> 00:42:59,295
I heard it had been 15 years since your husband died.

562
00:42:59,295 --> 00:43:04,685
I guess you still do not understand what a Loyal Wife is.

563
00:43:04,685 --> 00:43:10,705
Do you really not understand what it means for her to abstain from food?

564
00:43:12,115 --> 00:43:20,375
My daughter-in-law will soon become an exemplar of widows everywhere.

565
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:47,105
Sir, this is unfair.

566
00:43:47,105 --> 00:43:49,125
The ring was mine,

567
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:52,305
and I never laid a hand on His Excellency!

568
00:43:52,305 --> 00:43:55,215
Do you have anyone to verify your testimony?

569
00:43:55,865 --> 00:43:58,465
There is no way you purchased that jade ring yourself.

570
00:43:58,465 --> 00:44:01,095
Someone must have given it to you.

571
00:44:01,095 --> 00:44:04,175
I cannot ever tell you that.

572
00:44:09,095 --> 00:44:10,835
It is a crime of gangsang.

573
00:44:10,835 --> 00:44:12,265
[Crime of Gangsang - a crime of breaking the ethics of three bonds and five moral disciplines in human relations]

574
00:44:12,265 --> 00:44:15,015
If you cannot prove your innocence,

575
00:44:15,015 --> 00:44:17,915
you will be sentenced to beheading.

576
00:44:26,445 --> 00:44:30,685
After looking into it, I heard you have a secret lover.

577
00:44:30,685 --> 00:44:34,035
By chance, did you meet your secret lover that night?

578
00:44:34,035 --> 00:44:36,905
- I cannot tell you!
- Even if you will lose your life?

579
00:44:36,905 --> 00:44:39,795
I will just die.

580
00:44:39,795 --> 00:44:43,495
However, Sir, I swear it.

581
00:44:44,155 --> 00:44:46,975
I did not kill His Excellency.

582
00:45:07,185 --> 00:45:09,415
Did you see that, Sir?

583
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,595
What are you talking about?

584
00:45:10,595 --> 00:45:13,085
If that guy is not the culprit,

585
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:17,135
he is giving up his life for his secret lover.

586
00:45:17,665 --> 00:45:20,085
Such useless talk.

587
00:45:25,535 --> 00:45:29,015
So, is the case closed?

588
00:45:29,015 --> 00:45:31,605
Yes. Pretty much so.

589
00:45:31,605 --> 00:45:34,595
Though that servant is refusing to admit his crime,

590
00:45:34,595 --> 00:45:36,765
it will not be an issue anyway.

591
00:45:36,765 --> 00:45:40,055
He was caught at the scene, yet he still has not admitted to the crime?

592
00:45:40,055 --> 00:45:42,555
Is there some reason for it?

593
00:45:42,555 --> 00:45:44,315
Is it not the crime of gangsang?

594
00:45:44,315 --> 00:45:48,695
He will be punished by having his limbs torn, so he is probably holding out to the end.

595
00:45:51,045 --> 00:45:55,065
Did you bring the investigation files on the Finance Minister from the Criminal Arresting Agency?

596
00:45:55,065 --> 00:45:57,015
Yes, Left State Minister.

597
00:45:57,815 --> 00:46:01,275
You will see when you take a look, but there is nothing out of the ordinary.

598
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,895
And there was nothing out of the ordinary from the autopsy?

599
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:05,265
Yes.

600
00:46:05,845 --> 00:46:09,665
But it appears the Garrison Commander is desperate to perform a meritorious deed.

601
00:46:09,665 --> 00:46:11,315
According to Hanseongbu's clerk,

602
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:13,525
the Captain of the Capital Garrison, not the Criminal Arresting Agency, came

603
00:46:13,525 --> 00:46:15,575
and carefully looked through the autopsy report

604
00:46:15,575 --> 00:46:21,105
and asked what the purple spots that appeared in the corpse's mouth were.

605
00:46:43,705 --> 00:46:46,155
[Purple spots]

606
00:47:10,955 --> 00:47:15,145
Since you are not here, Your Excellency,

607
00:47:15,815 --> 00:47:18,345
it is quite upsetting.

608
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:25,925
Is anyone...

609
00:47:32,845 --> 00:47:36,485
Is... Is anyone outside?

610
00:47:52,845 --> 00:47:57,725
After such a long time, to think it was used once again.

611
00:47:59,985 --> 00:48:03,825
Your Excellency really treasured this...

612
00:48:07,775 --> 00:48:10,995
Why did you have to come out?

613
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,925
Seeing how there are men guarding the shed,

614
00:48:23,925 --> 00:48:26,795
I think she is in there.

615
00:48:26,795 --> 00:48:29,985
Go to Myeongdogak and ask them to send Hwal Yoo immediately.

616
00:48:29,985 --> 00:48:31,595
What are you planning to do?

617
00:48:31,595 --> 00:48:33,385
Should I not save her first?

618
00:48:33,385 --> 00:48:36,685
I can hear everything.

619
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:42,455
You think I do not know you are asking her to bring the leftover snacks?

620
00:48:42,455 --> 00:48:45,395
Goodness, seriously.

621
00:48:47,465 --> 00:48:53,255
I cannot raise my voice in the middle of the streets while I am mourning.

622
00:48:53,255 --> 00:48:56,975
It is just that I have an errand for Yeon Seon.

623
00:48:59,705 --> 00:49:01,285
- Gosh!
- Gosh.

624
00:49:01,285 --> 00:49:02,495
Oh, My Lady! Are you okay?

625
00:49:02,495 --> 00:49:06,245
Goodness, My Lady! You are too weak!

626
00:49:06,245 --> 00:49:11,765
This happened not because I pushed you but because you are weak, My Lady.

627
00:49:11,765 --> 00:49:17,535
My legs grow weak after walking just a bit because I always sit at the shrine.

628
00:49:17,535 --> 00:49:18,525
Let us get up.

629
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:21,965
Yes, be careful.

630
00:49:25,075 --> 00:49:28,935
Yeon Seon, my knees are weak.

631
00:49:28,935 --> 00:49:30,995
Hurry up and go to Physician Kim.

632
00:49:30,995 --> 00:49:32,495
Yes.

633
00:49:32,495 --> 00:49:35,215
Then, I will be on my errand.

634
00:49:35,215 --> 00:49:38,835
- Let us go slowly.
- Okay.

635
00:49:38,835 --> 00:49:41,515
Gosh, My Lady!

636
00:49:42,255 --> 00:49:44,985
By chance, could you give me a piggyback ride?

637
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:46,975
No way...

638
00:49:49,475 --> 00:49:52,705
That lady is the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law, right?

639
00:49:52,705 --> 00:49:55,145
Every time I see her, she is quite like

640
00:49:55,145 --> 00:50:00,575
a bunch of flowers that bloomed delicately on a cliff.

641
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,885
Gosh. I feel so sorry for her.

642
00:50:02,885 --> 00:50:04,825
A bunch of flowers?

643
00:50:04,825 --> 00:50:07,995
But why are you in such a bad mood since earlier?

644
00:50:07,995 --> 00:50:09,175
Me?

645
00:50:09,175 --> 00:50:13,755
I mean, your eyes are like that of a jealous man.

646
00:50:13,755 --> 00:50:14,995
Trembling in rage.

647
00:50:14,995 --> 00:50:16,825
How dare you!

648
00:50:16,825 --> 00:50:18,975
There is no way I would be like that.

649
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:20,735
Look at this guy...

650
00:50:34,005 --> 00:50:39,055
I do not know how I can thank you for coming like this.

651
00:50:39,055 --> 00:50:43,745
It has been over ten years since I served with the Finance Minister in the government.

652
00:50:43,745 --> 00:50:47,065
I am sorry I was not able to come right away.

653
00:50:47,065 --> 00:50:53,345
The Yeom family has not forgotten how you have always taken care of us.

654
00:51:01,385 --> 00:51:05,085
You must be quite heartbroken, but you should gather yourself

655
00:51:05,085 --> 00:51:08,865
and take care of your family now.

656
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:14,455
Queen Dowager was quite worried as well.

657
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,505
T-Thank you.

658
00:51:29,385 --> 00:51:33,815
You have tended to your house quite elegantly.

659
00:51:35,605 --> 00:51:40,055
You probably took care of every part of it.

660
00:51:41,525 --> 00:51:44,215
Not even a single tree,

661
00:51:45,945 --> 00:51:48,505
nor even a single flower petal.

662
00:51:58,635 --> 00:52:02,815
I trust that you have tended to them carefully.

663
00:52:07,885 --> 00:52:11,975
Then, I will be on my way.

664
00:52:46,275 --> 00:52:47,995
Who are you—

665
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:54,895
Now, what do we do?

666
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:06,495
Who are you!

667
00:53:07,025 --> 00:53:08,655
Drop that knife!

668
00:53:08,655 --> 00:53:12,235
- Are you assassins sent by my mother?
- Us?

669
00:53:12,915 --> 00:53:16,015
Though we are dressed like this, we are not assassins, so do not worry.

670
00:53:16,065 --> 00:53:17,815
- T-The...
- Get back!

671
00:53:17,815 --> 00:53:22,305
My life you want to take so badly, I will end it for you myself.

672
00:53:24,135 --> 00:53:26,315
Whoa! You cannot!

673
00:53:26,315 --> 00:53:28,115
Let go!

674
00:53:29,965 --> 00:53:32,195
How could you cover her mouth?

675
00:53:32,195 --> 00:53:34,465
Someone save me!

676
00:53:35,105 --> 00:53:38,025
- Do something.
- Geez!

677
00:53:38,025 --> 00:53:41,125
Please calm down!

678
00:53:49,495 --> 00:53:51,765
She seems to be in quite a shock.

679
00:53:51,765 --> 00:53:53,325
Let us go.

680
00:54:01,225 --> 00:54:04,085
- Great work, Hwal Yoo.
- Yes.

681
00:54:13,655 --> 00:54:16,125
Were there any injuries?

682
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:19,145
Well, I am fine.

683
00:54:20,295 --> 00:54:22,185
I meant the Minister of General Affairs' daughter-in-law.

684
00:54:22,185 --> 00:54:26,555
O-Oh, well, I did not hit her.

685
00:54:28,305 --> 00:54:30,755
What are you planning to do now?

686
00:54:30,755 --> 00:54:34,945
As I thought, she was not trying to take her own life.

687
00:54:35,785 --> 00:54:39,188
Are you that worried about the Minister of General Affairs' daughter-in-law?

688
00:54:39,725 --> 00:54:44,115
Since I am not unfamiliar with having to live a life of dying

689
00:54:44,135 --> 00:54:49,725
to become a role model for widows and for your family name.

690
00:54:49,725 --> 00:54:54,925
The minister's family will not be able to spread the rumor that Madam Baek was kidnapped.

691
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:58,485
I will look for a place to send her quietly.

692
00:54:58,485 --> 00:55:01,515
Thank you for your help every time, Grand Merchant.

693
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:08,435
I feel it will cost quite a bit.

694
00:55:08,435 --> 00:55:11,685
You and Yeon Seon seem to be growing more alike.

695
00:55:34,035 --> 00:55:36,715
When is she coming back?

696
00:55:51,305 --> 00:55:53,085
Are you all right?

697
00:55:53,085 --> 00:55:54,695
Who...

698
00:55:58,265 --> 00:56:00,875
Are you not the Grand Merchant?

699
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:03,845
Why am I here...

700
00:56:03,845 --> 00:56:05,955
You seemed to be in danger,

701
00:56:05,955 --> 00:56:09,125
so I brought you here at the risk of acting discourteously.

702
00:56:10,015 --> 00:56:15,075
I received a request from someone who was worried for your safety.

703
00:56:15,075 --> 00:56:18,215
If you were sincerely trying to end your life to follow your husband,

704
00:56:18,215 --> 00:56:21,715
I cannot stop you, but if you seek to live,

705
00:56:21,765 --> 00:56:28,325
I will help you so you can live a normal life somewhere far away.

706
00:56:29,715 --> 00:56:31,295
No.

707
00:56:31,885 --> 00:56:34,335
I cannot do that.

708
00:56:35,995 --> 00:56:40,715
If I am by myself, living is not truly living.

709
00:56:46,365 --> 00:56:49,505
What should I do now?

710
00:56:52,625 --> 00:56:55,485
How am I to live...

711
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:19,195
I definitely smelled a sweet scent from the corpse's mouth...

712
00:57:19,195 --> 00:57:21,745
Was it like a flower scent or something?

713
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:23,815
Are you messing with me?

714
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:28,105
Why did you bring something useless like this?

715
00:57:29,295 --> 00:57:31,055
Flower scent...

716
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:55,405
What scent would dried petals have that you keep smelling it?

717
00:57:57,845 --> 00:58:00,285
It does not smell like anything.

718
00:58:00,285 --> 00:58:02,915
Flower shoes and now flower petals.

719
00:58:02,915 --> 00:58:06,035
Did you fall for a woman or something?

720
00:58:07,615 --> 00:58:11,095
You are too distracting. Just stop and leave.

721
00:58:11,095 --> 00:58:12,605
All right.

722
00:58:14,275 --> 00:58:16,705
Sir, it melted.

723
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:18,595
Do flower petals melt?

724
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,035
What?

725
00:58:24,685 --> 00:58:26,475
Wait a minute.

726
00:58:40,595 --> 00:58:43,975
Sir! It melted! It melts!

727
00:58:46,025 --> 00:58:49,295
Sir, it gives off a flower scent. Smell it.

728
00:58:59,185 --> 00:59:00,845
It was this scent.

729
00:59:00,845 --> 00:59:04,915
I smelled this scent from the dead Finance Minister's corpse!

730
00:59:29,695 --> 00:59:31,675
Do not be too heartbroken.

731
00:59:31,675 --> 00:59:35,875
I know you did nothing wrong, Royal Physician.

732
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:38,915
Thank you, Left State Minister.

733
00:59:38,915 --> 00:59:44,355
I am worried that the crown prince will be too heartbroken over losing His Majesty.

734
00:59:44,355 --> 00:59:47,145
He needs to take over the throne now.

735
00:59:47,145 --> 00:59:50,345
Is His Highness the Crown Prince's health okay?

736
00:59:50,345 --> 00:59:55,595
It is nothing serious, and although we finished putting the rice and pearls in the late king's mouth,

737
00:59:55,595 --> 01:00:01,985
the crown prince said he saw purple spots in His Majesty's mouth

738
01:00:01,985 --> 01:00:07,175
and smelled a sweet scent and asked to examine him again.

739
01:00:07,175 --> 01:00:09,215
How preposterous is that?

740
01:00:09,215 --> 01:00:14,185
The queen also sternly rebuked the crown prince after hearing that,

741
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:17,515
and he did not say much more after that.

742
01:00:18,255 --> 01:00:21,685
All right. Go about your business.

743
01:01:09,335 --> 01:01:11,885
F-Father?

744
01:01:40,485 --> 01:01:42,435
My Lady!

745
01:01:55,695 --> 01:02:00,435
Daughter-in-law, are you keeping watch all night here?

746
01:02:00,435 --> 01:02:03,945
My Lady! Hurry!

747
01:02:10,285 --> 01:02:12,575
No! No, no!

748
01:02:15,385 --> 01:02:19,005
Is it all right if I come in for a moment?

749
01:02:33,085 --> 01:02:37,875
[Knight Flower]

750
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:40,695
[Unfinished Story]

751
01:02:40,695 --> 01:02:44,735
Though there is a law that allows husbands to remarry,

752
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:48,555
but there are no provisions allowing a wife to remarry.

753
01:02:48,555 --> 01:02:52,025
He was not even her own family's servant but of another family!

754
01:02:52,025 --> 01:02:54,345
Since when did this start?

755
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:10,505
She did not go to learn "Good Conduct for Women" from the Finance Minister's wife,

756
01:03:10,505 --> 01:03:12,665
but to see Yong Deok?

757
01:03:12,665 --> 01:03:15,305
Why? For what...

758
01:03:15,305 --> 01:03:18,435
did she love him at the risk of losing everything?

759
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:24,705
What are you so preoccupied with?

760
01:03:24,705 --> 01:03:26,035
I am sorry, Mother.

761
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:29,755
I heard the Minister of General Affairs' daughter-in-law is abstaining from food as she misses her husband.

762
01:03:29,755 --> 01:03:33,185
Did you learn anything while you were there?

763
01:03:34,755 --> 01:03:39,185
You should learn from the Minister of General Affairs' daughter-in-law and do likewise—

764
01:03:39,185 --> 01:03:42,895
no, you should go much further than that.

765
01:03:42,895 --> 01:03:45,535
In your conduct,

766
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:47,895
your thoughts,

767
01:03:49,385 --> 01:03:52,705
and your actions, all of it!

768
01:03:53,785 --> 01:03:55,735
Pardon?

769
01:03:55,735 --> 01:03:57,485
Do exactly the same?

770
01:03:57,485 --> 01:03:59,745
♫ Oh, I see the dead people drowning on my way ♫

771
01:03:59,745 --> 01:04:02,285
♫ But there's only one left holding on last bullet ♫

772
01:04:02,285 --> 01:04:05,105
♫ Mm, when I breathe in, I smell the pungent smell of the earth ♫

773
01:04:05,105 --> 01:04:07,505
♫ It digs through my veins, preventing me from breathing ♫

774
01:04:07,505 --> 01:04:10,265
♫ But boy, you gotta wake up, stop the meaningless abstention ♫

775
01:04:10,265 --> 01:04:12,935
♫ That nightmare turns to reality, there is nowhere to run ♫

776
01:04:12,935 --> 01:04:15,395
♫ The parameter gets bigger the moment I realize I slipped ♫

777
01:04:15,395 --> 01:04:17,695
♫ So where do we need to go, just put your chin up ♫

778
01:04:17,695 --> 01:04:20,305
♫ Yeah, I keep runnin', runnin', no time to get low ♫

779
01:04:20,305 --> 01:04:23,015
♫ Set aside the meaningless calculation, 'cause we gotta get dough ♫

780
01:04:24,195 --> 01:04:26,415
Sir, they all died!

781
01:04:26,415 --> 01:04:27,805
This is...

782
01:04:27,805 --> 01:04:30,715
The ring that the servant named Yong Deok held...

783
01:04:30,715 --> 01:04:32,845
Are you sure it is the Finance Minister's?

784
01:04:32,845 --> 01:04:38,035
A captain of the Capital Garrison is taking interest in this matter.

785
01:04:38,035 --> 01:04:39,825
He was only trying to protect his secret lover.

786
01:04:39,825 --> 01:04:41,175
He is not the culprit.

787
01:04:41,175 --> 01:04:42,765
I can testify to that.

788
01:04:42,765 --> 01:04:45,065
If she is that impatient...

789
01:04:45,065 --> 01:04:47,915
The Grand Merchant of Myeongdogak just came out with a woman covering her face

790
01:04:47,915 --> 01:04:49,925
and went to the Criminal Arresting Agency.

791
01:04:49,925 --> 01:04:51,415
Take this right now.

792
01:04:51,415 --> 01:04:54,415
Who let the felon have visitors?

793
01:04:54,415 --> 01:04:57,875
I have come this far. I cannot stop now.

794
01:04:57,875 --> 01:05:00,605
♫ Mm, when I breathe in, I smell the pungent smell of the earth ♫

795
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,815
♫ It digs through my veins, preventing me from breathing ♫
