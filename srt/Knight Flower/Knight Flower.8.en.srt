1
00:00:36,857 --> 00:00:41,057
You never visited me even once in my dreams.

2
00:00:41,057 --> 00:00:44,787
What is the matter that you came to me?

3
00:01:15,527 --> 00:01:17,567
My Lady!

4
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:21,707
I think you need to go to the shrine immediately.

5
00:01:34,197 --> 00:01:37,417
Mother, I am back—

6
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:50,377
What is this?

7
00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:57,857
It is a fan.

8
00:01:57,857 --> 00:02:00,657
Am I asking because I do not know that?

9
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:04,477
Why is there a man's fan in the shrine?

10
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:08,277
I do not know, Mother!

11
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:12,647
All right. If you do not know,

12
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:19,027
I must look into who dared to put such a vulgar thing in my Jeong's shrine.

13
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:21,857
- Bong Mal-daek.
- Yes, Madam.

14
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:25,617
Gather everyone right now and find the owner of this fan.

15
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:28,687
We must find him even if we have to beat them!

16
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:30,907
You cannot!

17
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:36,437
What did you just say?

18
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:38,627
The thing is...

19
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:41,337
- Could it be...
- The thing is...

20
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:44,187
Could it be you really...

21
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:46,347
The thing is...

22
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:50,027
I am the one who hid it!

23
00:02:50,027 --> 00:02:52,047
What are you doing right now?

24
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,597
How dare you interrupt!

25
00:02:53,597 --> 00:02:56,607
Yeon Seon, you stay outside.

26
00:02:58,487 --> 00:03:02,867
My Lady, please have me killed.

27
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:08,057
Madam, My Lady does not know about this.

28
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:12,567
I am the one who hid that fan here.

29
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:17,947
If you are deceiving me with your tongue,

30
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,567
you will not get out of this unscathed.

31
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:25,267
Now, then, whose fan is this?

32
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:33,567
A while ago, I was walking in the mountains alone and

33
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:37,397
ran into bandits and faced some difficulty.

34
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:39,967
Hey!

35
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:41,997
The servants ran off and

36
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:45,407
the scary bandits drew their swords on me.

37
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:49,287
"If you do not hand over your rice, horrible things will happen to you."

38
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:51,967
Step by step...

39
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:54,767
I was too scared to do anything and only went,

40
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:58,317
"Please save me! Please help!"

41
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:00,947
It was at that moment.

42
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:03,847
Halt!

43
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:14,287
A man came out of nowhere and saved me.

44
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:17,887
He only dropped that fan and

45
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:21,967
disappeared without a trace.

46
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:44,797
So you do not know who he is?

47
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:48,057
Must I kick you out of this house to make you speak?

48
00:04:48,057 --> 00:04:50,697
It was the Royal Secretary of Defense!

49
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:52,857
Are you...

50
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:58,787
talking about the Grand Chancellor's second son right now?

51
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:01,147
Yes!

52
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:03,837
How could I dare to give it back to him?

53
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,797
But I could not throw it away, either.

54
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:11,767
That was what happened, huh?

55
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,047
Hurry up and get ready.

56
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:20,357
- Sorry?
- You are still a member of our household.

57
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:23,897
We must at least express our thanks in person.

58
00:05:23,897 --> 00:05:26,187
Follow me.

59
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:44,207
[Knight Flower - Episode 8: Fateful Coincidence]

60
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:52,607
The Head Eunuch found the eunuch who was on duty at the time and confirmed.

61
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:58,837
That Finance Minister's wife herself prepared the tea for Father that night.

62
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:03,807
In that case, could it really be the Honorable Lady's doing?

63
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:07,427
Though she stayed by Mother like a shadow from a long time ago,

64
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:11,757
she was too decent to ever make a personal request.

65
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:16,227
But why did a person like her do that?

66
00:06:16,227 --> 00:06:19,497
It cannot be her sole doing.

67
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:24,517
She had frequented the queen's pavilion freely 15 years ago as well.

68
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:29,607
So she must have known the Left State Minister since back then.

69
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,187
The poison flower petal was made known to the world again.

70
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:42,077
The Left State Minister is sure to eliminate the root cause to prevent the matter from worsening.

71
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:44,907
So the truth will not get buried again,

72
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:50,097
I will tell my younger brother to watch over the Finance Minister's wife.

73
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,507
What are you doing instead of cleaning your stand?

74
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:13,197
They said I am dead,

75
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:15,867
but you can see me, Grand Merchant?

76
00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:21,067
Well, you do not look like a ghost.

77
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:27,477
Grand Merchant, you know everything that goes on in Hanyang. Right?

78
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:32,367
They say rumors in Hanyang flow into Myeongdogak.

79
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:33,797
Ask away.

80
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:37,397
Then, are you familiar with the widow who lives in the Left State Minister's house?

81
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:38,827
I do not know her.

82
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:42,157
- You sounded like you know everything just now—
- Grand Merchant!

83
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:44,507
I have brought him.

84
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:46,667
Have you come?

85
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,117
We meet often lately.

86
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:51,707
I heard it is an urgent matter.

87
00:07:51,707 --> 00:07:54,267
Please come inside right this way.

88
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,357
- I have a question for you.
- I do not know.

89
00:08:04,357 --> 00:08:07,267
About what? About what!

90
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:09,907
What did you think I was going to ask?

91
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:18,807
Is there anything you found out about the Finance Minister's wife?

92
00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:22,237
Yes, I was also quite shocked by this information.

93
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:24,567
What is it?

94
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:28,337
Looks like you forgot I am a merchant.

95
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:37,237
Things like this cannot be sold for a price.

96
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:39,607
What is it you want?

97
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:43,557
Will you promise that you will grant me whatever I want?

98
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,447
As long as it does not violate the laws,

99
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:48,717
I will grant it.

100
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:52,817
I will take that as a yes and tell you.

101
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:58,397
The Finance Minister's wife's mother had secretly abandoned a child

102
00:08:58,397 --> 00:09:00,437
and that child is...

103
00:09:01,337 --> 00:09:03,977
Kang Pil Jik.

104
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,277
Abandon a child?

105
00:09:09,277 --> 00:09:10,487
Why?

106
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:15,027
At the time, the Finance Minister's wife's mother was a secluding widow.

107
00:09:15,027 --> 00:09:17,427
Since a widow gave birth,

108
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:21,517
it is not surprising even if they killed that child.

109
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:26,977
The two of them are siblings?

110
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:31,097
Kang Pil Jik suddenly became the owner of a merchandising company and his power grew.

111
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:36,887
Around that time, Yeom Heung Jib, a nobody, suddenly became the finance minister.

112
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:39,677
They dealt in all kinds of shady business.

113
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:43,907
There is no way the Finance Minister's wife did not know anything.

114
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:48,957
Thank you.

115
00:09:48,957 --> 00:09:51,277
That was great information.

116
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:57,697
Why are you telling me not to tell My Lady about these things?

117
00:09:58,317 --> 00:10:01,147
This is more dangerous than we had thought.

118
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:03,697
It is better for her not to know.

119
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:08,357
You are worried about My Lady again, I see.

120
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:14,127
It is a natural decision as the Capital Garrison's captain.

121
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:23,477
Now, then, let me tell you what I want.

122
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:28,777
I would like you to stop meeting My Lady.

123
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:36,247
What will you do now?

124
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:38,787
This is all your fault, Husband.

125
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:41,927
Yeon Seon is troubled because she was protecting me in your place.

126
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:44,767
If anything happens to Yeon Seon,

127
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:47,837
you will not be getting any more offerings in the future.

128
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:08,057
I was on the way to meet you, Royal Secretary of Defense.

129
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:11,287
To meet me?

130
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:16,547
She resides at my house.

131
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:20,397
Do you happen to know her?

132
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:31,777
I do know her.

133
00:11:39,777 --> 00:11:43,687
She said you lost your fan while you were trying to help her

134
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:46,187
at a time of trouble, Royal Secretary.

135
00:11:46,187 --> 00:11:51,207
So I came to express my thanks and give you your fan back.

136
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:58,447
Oh, this was...

137
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:02,537
my fan, huh?

138
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:07,477
I was wondering where I had lost it.

139
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:11,557
I lost it trying to help that child, huh?

140
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:22,347
Thank you. Since she is a member of my household,

141
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:25,517
I will not forget your mercy and help.

142
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:30,677
Also, you do not need to worry if Your Excellency, a man of the

143
00:12:30,677 --> 00:12:34,347
most prestigious family in this country, will end up in unnecessary rumors

144
00:12:34,347 --> 00:12:36,827
with a lowly commoner girl.

145
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:41,827
I will make sure this matter never happens again.

146
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:46,547
There is no hierarchical law about a person helping another and

147
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:49,667
a person caring for another.

148
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:53,987
If something dangerous were to happen to that child,

149
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:56,797
I will willingly help her again.

150
00:12:57,817 --> 00:13:04,427
Anyhow, I am sorry you had to bring me my fan yourself, Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong.

151
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:06,537
It is my pleasure.

152
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:09,777
Well, then. We will be on our way now.

153
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:11,797
Please get home safely.

154
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,487
Let us go.

155
00:13:38,207 --> 00:13:40,077
Yeon Seon!

156
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,287
You said Royal Secretary of Defense?

157
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:47,297
I have been wondering since our time in the mountains.

158
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:49,617
How do you know him?

159
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:52,477
Is that what matters right now?

160
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:54,957
What are you going to do from now on?

161
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:58,857
We somehow made it through today, but if you get caught by Madam next time,

162
00:13:58,857 --> 00:14:01,707
you and I are both dead, My Lady.

163
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,217
Do not worry.

164
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:08,447
No matter what happens, I will not leave you to die.

165
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:13,337
W-Why are you getting so serious now?

166
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:16,907
Well, let me be serious, too.

167
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:20,057
- I will die with you if you die.
- Do not say such stuff now!

168
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:21,457
Who are you saying will die?

169
00:14:21,457 --> 00:14:25,057
I will never die, never.

170
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:27,507
My Lady.

171
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:32,127
So, Sir Royal Secretary went along and said that fan belongs to him?

172
00:14:32,127 --> 00:14:34,167
Why would he?

173
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:39,407
Y-You need to go to the shrine.

174
00:14:46,897 --> 00:14:49,147
What did you say just now?

175
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:51,827
Park Su Ho is what?

176
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:56,947
They barely brought him back to life when he was brought to the Grand Chancellor's house injured.

177
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:59,537
But that was about...

178
00:14:59,537 --> 00:15:03,857
- 15 years ago.
- Exactly when, 15 years ago?

179
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:05,587
It was exactly when...

180
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:09,507
the late king had passed away.

181
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:11,107
What?

182
00:15:11,107 --> 00:15:13,857
He could not be the child from back then. Right?

183
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:15,617
There is no way.

184
00:15:15,617 --> 00:15:19,117
There is no way Im Kang's son is alive.

185
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:26,937
We found it.

186
00:15:26,937 --> 00:15:28,697
[Life]

187
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:37,097
Let us go.

188
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:48,937
What shall we do now?

189
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:53,587
Park Su Ho clearly does not seem to recognize us.

190
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:58,327
He cannot act so naturally after seeing his parents' killers.

191
00:15:58,327 --> 00:16:00,227
Firstly,

192
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:04,777
we must confirm it to make sure.

193
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:22,937
I would like you to stop meeting My Lady.

194
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:26,547
I will make sure My Lady does not get involved with dangerous matters.

195
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:30,897
So please consider you do not know My Lady, Sir.

196
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:34,547
I already know her, so how can I act like I do not know her?

197
00:16:34,547 --> 00:16:38,107
Ordering her to stay inside the walls because it is dangerous...

198
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:42,247
Do you really not know what kind of pain it is for My Lady?

199
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:45,157
Do you wish her to slowly wither away inside the walls?

200
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:47,357
Or are you...

201
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:52,817
going to take her out of the walls so she can live outside forever?

202
00:16:53,657 --> 00:16:57,997
You cannot do anything for My Lady, Sir.

203
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:05,697
What should I do?

204
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:19,207
Yeon Seon!

205
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,957
Where in the world did she go? Yeon Seon!

206
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,637
- What are you doing here?
- My goodness.

207
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:25,767
Goodness.

208
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,107
I was on the way to the women's quarters to say something to Mother.

209
00:17:29,107 --> 00:17:33,327
Madam went outside early in the morning with Lady Jae Yi.

210
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:35,177
Really?

211
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:38,447
By the way, what are you doing here instead of following Mother?

212
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:41,287
What about Yeon Seon? Have you seen her?

213
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:46,177
Madam told me, from now on,

214
00:17:46,177 --> 00:17:51,757
to stick by your side firmly instead of Yeon Seon.

215
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:53,897
What?

216
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:55,787
What is it?

217
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:57,367
Is Madam inside?

218
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,837
She went outside.

219
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:01,337
The Finance Minister's wife has sent a message.

220
00:18:01,337 --> 00:18:03,637
Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong did?

221
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:07,307
She would like to meet you right now. What shall we do?

222
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:11,957
What else can I do but go meet her when she is waiting for me?

223
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,527
Wait for me. I will get ready right away.

224
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:17,217
Wait a moment! Where are you going without Madam's permission?

225
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:20,217
Did you not hear just now? Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong wants to see me—

226
00:18:20,217 --> 00:18:22,507
Even so, you need to get permission first—

227
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:25,437
If I reject Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong's personal invitation,

228
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,607
she will get angry.

229
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,437
If she gets angry, she will let Her Highness Queen Dowager know.

230
00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:34,657
- If Her Highness Queen Dowager knows—
- I-I got it!

231
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:40,477
You should go. I will escort you there.

232
00:18:46,613 --> 00:18:49,743
[Poetry]

233
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,857
Mister, I am here.

234
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,077
Excuse—

235
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:11,437
W-Wait a moment!

236
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:14,837
A-Are you running away right now?

237
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:16,267
Please do not follow me.

238
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:20,847
You should not act like you know me, Sir Royal Secretary, who is a noble.

239
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:22,967
Stop right there!

240
00:19:27,337 --> 00:19:30,467
You have to explain at least what happened yesterday to me.

241
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:35,667
- Tavern Lady!
- Yes?

242
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:39,847
- Give me your most expensive menu.
- Yes, sir.

243
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,507
All right.

244
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:52,237
What are you doing?

245
00:19:52,237 --> 00:19:54,837
You are quick with calculations, so you would know.

246
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:58,697
But this much is very cheap for yesterday's happening.

247
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,187
O-Oh, yes.

248
00:20:02,187 --> 00:20:04,747
W-Well,

249
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:07,557
thank you for helping me.

250
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:12,617
Also, I apologize for creating an unnecessary misunderstanding.

251
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:18,207
I am the one unnecessarily misunderstanding you right now.

252
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:23,217
Are you in love with my younger brother?

253
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:27,127
Sorry? What on Earth are you talking about?

254
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:31,587
If not, why did you have his fan?

255
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:35,297
That was Sir Captain's fan?

256
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:40,767
I bought it for him as a gift.

257
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:44,397
However, you did not even know who it belonged to?

258
00:20:44,397 --> 00:20:47,607
So, the thing is...

259
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:50,867
In that case,

260
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:54,577
the person who had my younger brother's fan...

261
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:57,957
was not you, huh?

262
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:11,167
The person you are covering for is probably

263
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:15,547
the person my younger brother is covering for.

264
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:17,217
Sorry?

265
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:22,197
I am very curious who this person might be.

266
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,267
Please do not be curious!

267
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:26,597
Never.

268
00:21:26,597 --> 00:21:28,177
Sure.

269
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:35,787
I told you I would look into your brother's whereabouts.

270
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:38,327
Did you find something?

271
00:21:38,327 --> 00:21:41,667
It appears your brother was connected

272
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:48,197
to something secretive in the palace.

273
00:21:48,197 --> 00:21:51,337
What are you talking about?

274
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:56,207
I am sorry. I cannot go into the details.

275
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:58,157
Please tell me a little more.

276
00:21:58,157 --> 00:22:01,577
I promise you I will not tell anyone else.

277
00:22:01,577 --> 00:22:05,647
I could not find anything about him for 15 years.

278
00:22:06,317 --> 00:22:11,057
Whatever it may be, if it could be a clue to find my brother,

279
00:22:11,057 --> 00:22:13,347
I must hear it.

280
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:25,833
A long time ago, on the exact day the late king passed away,

281
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:33,867
a lot of scary and mysterious things happened in the capital.

282
00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:39,277
The Chief Royal Guard's entire family was massacred and a few palace guards disappeared.

283
00:22:39,277 --> 00:22:41,487
I heard there was...

284
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:46,137
a man who received a secret order from the late king among them.

285
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:51,047
Are you saying my brother was one of them?

286
00:22:52,937 --> 00:22:56,467
Exactly what was he ordered to do that he left without even notifying his family

287
00:22:56,467 --> 00:22:59,067
and was not heard from until now?

288
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:01,677
Only a very few know about this,

289
00:23:01,677 --> 00:23:07,667
so it will be difficult to learn about your brother's whereabouts outside.

290
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:09,697
Then what should I do?

291
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:12,007
Who knows about that?

292
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:15,057
Is it Her Highness Queen Dowager? Is it His Majesty?

293
00:23:15,057 --> 00:23:19,817
Those people would not even know about the disappearance of the palace guards.

294
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:22,237
Then who in the world...

295
00:23:22,977 --> 00:23:25,027
At the time,

296
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:29,847
the one who organized the chaotic situation was

297
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:32,507
His Excellency, the Left State Minister.

298
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:37,177
My father-in-law did?

299
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:44,007
Father clearly said he would look into it for me.

300
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:47,507
Since he cherishes you more than anyone else,

301
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:51,537
I am sure he would do his best to look.

302
00:23:51,537 --> 00:23:57,047
The only thing is, even if His Excellency is fully aware of this matter,

303
00:23:57,047 --> 00:24:00,097
due to his duties as this country's Left State Minister,

304
00:24:00,097 --> 00:24:07,677
would he not have a reason he cannot tell you?

305
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:12,007
I am sure he does.

306
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:14,507
I have bothered you too much.

307
00:24:14,507 --> 00:24:17,687
I will take my leave now.

308
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:22,767
This much is all I am aware of...

309
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:26,347
Not at all. You were a great help.

310
00:24:26,347 --> 00:24:28,487
Thank you so much.

311
00:24:44,877 --> 00:24:50,287
Will this be enough to make Elder care?

312
00:24:53,523 --> 00:24:55,943
[Hwang Bookstore]

313
00:24:56,837 --> 00:24:59,887
You want me to protect the Finance Minister's wife?

314
00:24:59,887 --> 00:25:04,837
What would be the most certain way of silencing somebody?

315
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:10,327
I am saying the truth behind this case cannot be gone in vain with her death.

316
00:25:10,327 --> 00:25:15,657
You are saying those people who are trying to harm her

317
00:25:15,657 --> 00:25:18,607
are the ones behind both...

318
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,467
the murder of the late king and

319
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:25,397
what happened to my parents. Right?

320
00:25:25,397 --> 00:25:27,057
You are right.

321
00:25:27,057 --> 00:25:32,617
At least until we find the palace guard who disappeared with the late king's jade pendant,

322
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:35,827
you must protect the Finance Minister's wife.

323
00:25:36,627 --> 00:25:37,577
Yes.

324
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:42,817
This is His Majesty's order, so you must not let your guard down even for a moment.

325
00:25:42,817 --> 00:25:44,877
I understand.

326
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:50,727
There you go. I still have to make my rounds.

327
00:25:50,727 --> 00:25:53,697
Are you feeling better, Mother?

328
00:25:53,697 --> 00:25:56,687
The air is nice, and I got to see some people.

329
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:59,197
I am feeling a lot better.

330
00:25:59,947 --> 00:26:04,897
Should we get some sticky rice cake since we are out?

331
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:09,237
It is because you are reminded of Brother again. Right?

332
00:26:09,237 --> 00:26:10,987
It makes me angrier the more I think about it.

333
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:15,397
How can she put another man's item in Brother's shrine?

334
00:26:15,397 --> 00:26:18,477
How could you let her go, Mother?

335
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:21,387
I would like to stop talking about that.

336
00:26:23,227 --> 00:26:27,257
It is impossible to meet Captain Park Su Ho.

337
00:26:27,257 --> 00:26:29,737
What is he doing, and where?

338
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:33,147
Is he doing a secret investigation to earn some credit for himself?

339
00:26:33,147 --> 00:26:36,337
Gosh, he would not investigate secretly.

340
00:26:36,337 --> 00:26:38,207
He is probably...

341
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:40,037
With his lover?

342
00:26:40,037 --> 00:26:41,327
Lover?

343
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:42,927
Ever since, whenever he got drunk, he says,

344
00:26:42,927 --> 00:26:47,967
"I am also dying to find out exactly what kind of person she is."

345
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:50,967
The rumors were true. The captain found a lover.

346
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:54,337
- Could it be Lady Yi Kyeong?
- Lady Yi Kyeong?

347
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:56,967
No, Lady Yi Kyeong is not the one!

348
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:58,537
I-It is someone else!

349
00:26:58,537 --> 00:27:00,197
Someone else.

350

Captain Park Su Ho would...

351
00:27:08,897 --> 00:27:11,297
not be too bad.

352
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:29,907
How can I lose her?

353
00:27:38,237 --> 00:27:40,967
It is really the most delicious thing!

354
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:44,617
What did I tell you? They are delicious!

00:27:47,997 --> 00:27:50,697
- Give me five more here.
- Oh, yes.

357
00:27:50,697 --> 00:27:54,347
It is okay. This one is enough for me.

358
00:27:54,347 --> 00:27:56,777
Do you think this is just an ordinary sticky rice cake?

359
00:27:56,777 --> 00:27:59,787
I am bribing you to get on your good side.

360
00:27:59,787 --> 00:28:05,157
Oh, can I take the five to go with me, then?

361
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:08,707
My mother is home,

362
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:12,197
but she is unwell.

363
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:18,427
Give me ten more. No, give me 20 to go.

364
00:28:18,427 --> 00:28:20,447
Oh, yes, sure.

365
00:28:21,297 --> 00:28:25,717
My mother also loved the sticky rice cake I would bring her.

366
00:28:25,717 --> 00:28:27,357
Your mother?

367
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:31,617
She was very gorgeous and beautiful.

368
00:28:31,617 --> 00:28:34,727
When I call out to her saying, "Mother,"

369
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:37,937
she would always come to me brightly.

370
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:42,947
Just like that.

371
00:28:43,717 --> 00:28:45,447
Mo—

372
00:28:47,097 --> 00:28:49,517
...ther! Mother.

373
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:52,207
I have an urgent matter, so bye for now!

374
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:54,267
Junior!

375
00:28:57,757 --> 00:29:00,347
T-That is—

376
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:25,267
I do not like it, after all.

377
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:34,247
Young Madam, you have to hurry!

378
00:29:39,557 --> 00:29:41,507
Y-Young M-Master—

379
00:29:41,507 --> 00:29:45,237
Oh, my god.

380
00:29:45,897 --> 00:29:48,787
M-My Lady, one moment.

381
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,867
Please wait here a moment.

382
00:30:05,977 --> 00:30:09,037
Mother, what is the matter?

383
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,477
Mother, are you okay?

384
00:30:22,377 --> 00:30:24,107
Wait, where did my—

385
00:30:24,107 --> 00:30:26,087
Bong Mal-daek!

386
00:30:26,797 --> 00:30:28,967
What are you doing here?

387
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:33,457
O-Oh, t-the thing is...

388
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,117
T-The thing is...

389
00:30:36,177 --> 00:30:41,107
I came outside for a moment, and Young Madam disappeared.

390
00:30:42,927 --> 00:30:45,177
Madam!

391
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,837
What is the matter?

392
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:52,167
Madam.

393
00:31:09,157 --> 00:31:10,337
Are you okay?

394
00:31:10,337 --> 00:31:12,457
What are you doing?

395
00:31:12,457 --> 00:31:14,047
M-My hair! My hair!

396
00:31:14,047 --> 00:31:15,227
- What is the matter?
- My hair! My hair!

397
00:31:15,227 --> 00:31:16,967
Y-Your hair? G-Goodness!

398
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:19,007
Why are you doing this?

399
00:31:22,137 --> 00:31:24,137
Oh, sorry.

400
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:26,177
I apologize—

401
00:31:32,127 --> 00:31:37,607
Beau-ti-ful.

402
00:31:37,607 --> 00:31:39,947
Gosh, what the heck is this now?

403
00:31:39,947 --> 00:31:41,547
Is he ill?

404
00:31:41,547 --> 00:31:43,957
Young Madam!

405
00:31:45,247 --> 00:31:47,467
It is you, Ggot Nim.

406
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:49,707
Is Grand Merchant inside?

407
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,187
Grand Merchant went out already.

408
00:31:52,187 --> 00:31:54,567
Oh, really?

409
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:01,927
There is a suspicious man here.

410
00:32:03,637 --> 00:32:08,157
He is Joo, and he started his business a few days ago.

411
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:13,837
The rumored "Whose Son Could He Be?"

412
00:32:13,837 --> 00:32:15,007
I will officially introduce myself—

413
00:32:15,007 --> 00:32:18,177
Tell Grand Merchant I will come again.

414
00:32:20,537 --> 00:32:22,847
He seems gravely ill, so be careful.

415
00:32:22,847 --> 00:32:24,437
Yes!

416
00:32:27,727 --> 00:32:31,817
I would like to introduce myself officially.

417
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,897
Where are you going?

418
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,147
Tell me your name, at least!

419
00:32:36,147 --> 00:32:40,517
Junior, how could you dare to ask for Young Madam's name?

420
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:42,917
Senior Ggot, who on Earth is that lady?

421
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,627
He is the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law.

422
00:32:44,627 --> 00:32:47,517
Left State- Left—

423
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:51,457
My wife?

424
00:32:51,457 --> 00:32:54,207
Is he really ill?

425
00:32:56,247 --> 00:32:58,897
I could not even meet Grand Merchant.

426
00:32:58,897 --> 00:33:01,787
What a crazy nutcase of a man.

427
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:36,497
Why are you out by yourself in daylight?

428
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:44,247
Do you get into fights dressed like that as well?

429
00:33:44,247 --> 00:33:47,107
I almost did.

430
00:33:47,107 --> 00:33:49,347
The head over here...

431
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:53,267
What about your head?

432
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:55,747
No, not there, but here—

433
00:34:14,907 --> 00:34:18,857
You look like you had a hair-pulling match.

434
00:34:20,117 --> 00:34:24,217
I would grab a sword, not someone's hair.

435
00:34:25,707 --> 00:34:28,167
Why did you call me here?

436
00:34:29,357 --> 00:34:31,657
How is the investigation of the Finance Minister's case going?

437
00:34:31,657 --> 00:34:34,797
Is that why you called for me?

438
00:34:34,797 --> 00:34:37,907
I told you not to concern yourself with that anymore.

439
00:34:37,907 --> 00:34:40,667
I tried not to, but...

440
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:45,457
not too long ago, what the Finance Minister's wife told me...

441
00:34:46,347 --> 00:34:49,627
- Never mind.
- What did she say?

442
00:34:51,247 --> 00:34:56,457
It just seemed like she was intentionally trying to tell me something.

443
00:34:57,877 --> 00:34:59,277
Never mind.

444
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:02,867
You said investigating was your job, right, Captain?

445
00:35:03,577 --> 00:35:06,817
What are you trying to say?

446
00:35:07,507 --> 00:35:09,857
I mean, as a mere woman,

447
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,427
how important could what I found out be,

448
00:35:12,427 --> 00:35:16,647
but recently, she has been seeking me out and telling me all sorts of things,

449
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:21,797
among which there may be things that may be useful for you.

450
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:28,657
I had said you should not get involved in this dangerous matter. That did not change.

451
00:35:28,657 --> 00:35:32,827
I feel that it may be best for you to keep some distance from her.

452
00:35:32,827 --> 00:35:36,907
Is it dangerous to be close to the Finance Minister's wife?

453
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:39,627
By chance, is she the culprit?

454
00:35:39,627 --> 00:35:42,217
Gosh, I mean, well...

455
00:35:42,217 --> 00:35:44,257
The thing is...

456
00:35:44,257 --> 00:35:48,657
I also cannot tell you anything if you do not tell me in detail.

457
00:35:48,657 --> 00:35:51,287
Think about it.

458
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:53,587
Gosh, what...

459
00:35:53,587 --> 00:35:56,357
What am I supposed to do?

460
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:13,837
I wonder what the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law will do.

461
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:16,507
Why are you doing this?

462
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,177
You should look for a way to live, whether in the Qing Dynasty or elsewhere.

463
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,207
So why are you making a bigger mess like this?

464
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:24,927
If Elder gets really angry,

465
00:36:24,927 --> 00:36:27,467
do you think we will both be safe?

466
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:31,477
Why? Are you afraid of dying?

467
00:36:33,197 --> 00:36:38,147
I found that if you want to hide one thing, you have to hide a hundred things

468
00:36:38,147 --> 00:36:41,897
to barely hide that one thing.

469
00:36:41,897 --> 00:36:46,537
But after living a difficult life trying to hide a hundred things,

470
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:50,677
I do not even remember what that one thing is...

471
00:36:51,617 --> 00:36:55,877
that I really needed to keep hiding.

472
00:36:55,877 --> 00:36:59,247
Right now is not the time to be speaking so carefree.

473
00:36:59,247 --> 00:37:01,687
Is that one thing...

474
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:05,057
the fact that...

475
00:37:06,197 --> 00:37:10,827
you are my mother's illegitimate son?

476
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:17,837
Or... is it that I killed my asshole of a husband?

477
00:37:17,837 --> 00:37:20,417
Or if it is not that,

478
00:37:21,247 --> 00:37:24,647
is it that I killed the late king?

479
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:27,767
Have you gone mad?

480
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,587
To think that...

481
00:37:30,257 --> 00:37:35,357
I lived such a difficult life just to hide those things...

482
00:37:58,927 --> 00:38:00,877
Dear Wife?

483
00:38:01,827 --> 00:38:05,207
No, no. Stay lying down.

484
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:09,957
I heard you collapsed on the streets.

485
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:12,387
What is the matter?

486
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:17,857
It is nothing.

487
00:38:18,457 --> 00:38:24,557
Dear Wife, please tell me what the matter is.

488
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:30,147
The thing is... our Jeong...

489
00:38:30,837 --> 00:38:34,097
Were you thinking of Jeong again?

490
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:40,117
I miss... my Jeong so much.

491
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,287
I do, too. I miss him.

492
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:48,357
However, if you keep being so sad, you will hurt your health.

493
00:38:48,357 --> 00:38:53,077
Jeong would not want his mother to suffer like this.

494
00:38:53,077 --> 00:38:58,327
I should have just let him marry that girl he liked back then.

495
00:38:58,327 --> 00:39:04,687
No, I should have never let him go to the Qing Dynasty to roam.

496
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:09,807
Had I known I would not be able to see him again so suddenly like that...

497
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:14,157
I would have at least fed him his favorite taro soup

498
00:39:14,157 --> 00:39:18,997
on the last morning before he left...

499
00:39:18,997 --> 00:39:23,567
It appears your heart has grown weaker because your body is tired.

500
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:26,377
I will get something good for you tomorrow—

501
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:29,497
Your Excellency,

502
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:34,507
can you not look for our Jeong one more time?

503
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:39,657
If we at least found his body, I would not be this upset.

504
00:39:39,657 --> 00:39:41,967
An unexpected death on the mountain roads? There is no way!

505
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:44,637
An unexpected death on the mountain roads? There is no way!

506
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:50,597
By chance, he may somehow be alive somewhere—

507
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:56,067
Dear Wife, you know that I checked several times already!

508
00:39:59,057 --> 00:40:01,957
I went out to Woonjong Street today

509
00:40:01,957 --> 00:40:06,497
and saw someone who looked just like our Jeong.

510
00:40:06,497 --> 00:40:12,057
His shoulders, his back, and even how he walked looked like him.

511
00:40:12,057 --> 00:40:14,897
Even his face, in passing, looked just like Jeong—

512
00:40:14,897 --> 00:40:16,667
There is no way it was our Jeong.

513
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,477
Yes, I know. I know.

514
00:40:19,477 --> 00:40:22,057
How could I not know that?

515
00:40:22,057 --> 00:40:27,657
I am like this because I want to see him again just once, even if it is as a ghost.

516
00:40:27,657 --> 00:40:30,637
Though I live being okay for a while,

517
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:36,197
there are days I miss him so much that I cannot even breathe.

518
00:41:01,437 --> 00:41:04,507
You dare destroy our family's honor that has built up

519
00:41:04,507 --> 00:41:07,047
for several centuries in just one moment?

520
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,377
No matter what you say, Father,

521
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:11,117
I will marry that woman.

522
00:41:11,117 --> 00:41:13,847
Over my dead body,

523
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:17,607
I will never let a woman with blue eyes be my eldest daughter-in-law.

524
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:20,217
She will not be your daughter-in-law but my wife.

525
00:41:20,217 --> 00:41:23,707
She will live with me, so do not get involved.

526
00:41:23,707 --> 00:41:25,437
If that is really your will,

527
00:41:25,437 --> 00:41:28,627
leave this house immediately and never come back.

528
00:41:28,627 --> 00:41:33,817
I will never come back of my own accord, so you do not have to worry.

529
00:41:35,967 --> 00:41:37,857
Do as you will.

530
00:41:37,857 --> 00:41:44,977
However, I cannot ruin our entire family just because of you.

531
00:41:44,977 --> 00:41:47,367
Since you are now a dead son to me,

532
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:52,787
I will personally kill you if you were to ever come back.

533
00:41:53,707 --> 00:41:58,767
Father, you are more than capable of doing that.

534
00:42:09,347 --> 00:42:11,267
Mother...

535
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,547
Goodness. Goodness!

536
00:42:35,047 --> 00:42:37,917
How is Mother?

537
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:42,867
What words could comfort a mother who misses her child?

538
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:45,117
I am sorry.

539
00:42:50,137 --> 00:42:54,617
I heard you are close with the Finance Minister's wife these days.

540
00:42:55,357 --> 00:43:00,757
Yes. She calls for me sometimes, and I spend some time chatting with her.

541
00:43:00,757 --> 00:43:02,797
That is commendable.

542
00:43:03,477 --> 00:43:05,467
However,

543
00:43:06,547 --> 00:43:11,617
I think it is best you do not meet with the Finance Minister's wife often.

544
00:43:13,277 --> 00:43:18,227
I heard the people call the Finance Minister's wife a living "Good Conduct for Women".

545
00:43:18,227 --> 00:43:22,607
If a person like that is found to be personally chatting with someone

546
00:43:22,607 --> 00:43:24,837
despite losing her husband,

547
00:43:24,837 --> 00:43:27,297
no good can come of that.

548
00:43:27,297 --> 00:43:31,057
Not only that, you have not even gone tomb-watching.

549
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:34,297
I am worried you may become the center of gossip.

550
00:43:34,297 --> 00:43:38,777
Yes, Father. I did not think this through.

551
00:43:38,777 --> 00:43:41,637
Okay. Head inside.

552
00:43:41,637 --> 00:43:43,937
Well, Father.

553
00:43:46,647 --> 00:43:49,197
Do you have something you want to say?

554
00:43:49,197 --> 00:43:54,657
I am sorry, but I am curious whether you have heard anything about my brother.

555
00:43:54,657 --> 00:43:56,427
I am sorry.

556
00:43:56,427 --> 00:44:01,357
I looked into it on all fronts, but I have not found anything.

557
00:44:01,357 --> 00:44:07,057
Perhaps something happened to the Royal Guards in the palace that day.

558
00:44:07,057 --> 00:44:09,487
What do you mean by that?

559
00:44:09,487 --> 00:44:11,907
Is there something you have heard?

560
00:44:11,907 --> 00:44:15,507
No. Since there was no news of him at home,

561
00:44:15,507 --> 00:44:19,357
I was wondering if maybe something happened at the palace.

562
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:24,797
Did I not say that I looked in depth at your brother's disappearance in the palace?

563
00:44:24,797 --> 00:44:27,437
- Yes.
- He finished his work as usual

564
00:44:27,437 --> 00:44:31,407
and never heard from him after leaving the palace.

565
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:35,517
You told me this in the year I married into this family.

566
00:44:35,517 --> 00:44:38,937
But now that I think about it after some years,

567
00:44:38,937 --> 00:44:44,307
I wondered if my brother was just an ordinary royal guard.

568
00:44:46,877 --> 00:44:49,427
A royal guard is a royal guard.

569
00:44:49,427 --> 00:44:52,507
What kind of strange thing are you saying?

570
00:44:52,507 --> 00:44:55,187
He often went to the palace even when it was not his shift.

571
00:44:55,187 --> 00:44:58,307
Also, he would be called in the middle of the night and—

572
00:44:58,307 --> 00:45:01,197
You probably did not understand it well since you were young.

573
00:45:01,197 --> 00:45:05,357
Your brother was just an ordinary royal guard.

574
00:45:08,887 --> 00:45:11,657
Do you have anything else to say?

575
00:45:12,157 --> 00:45:13,817
I am sorry.

576
00:45:13,817 --> 00:45:17,447
I guess I was wondering about useless things.

577
00:45:17,447 --> 00:45:19,767
It is late. You should head inside.

578
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:21,907
Yes, Father.

579
00:45:34,087 --> 00:45:39,317
I wonder why things started popping up regarding my brother.

580
00:45:41,707 --> 00:45:43,807
One thing is for sure.

581
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:48,447
My brother's disappearance is tied to something very important.

582
00:45:48,447 --> 00:45:51,967
What if the one who sent this note is dangerous?

583
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:57,917
He probably does not know how dangerous the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law is.

584
00:46:00,097 --> 00:46:04,137
You are not going to tell the captain about it?

585
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:06,497
Gosh, what...

586
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,177
What am I supposed to do?

587
00:46:10,577 --> 00:46:13,177
I told him to think about it,

588
00:46:13,177 --> 00:46:15,697
so he will give me his answer soon.

589
00:46:16,247 --> 00:46:19,157
I need to meet with the Grand Merchant.

590
00:46:52,797 --> 00:46:56,067
If you had given us the note and the pendant,

591
00:46:56,067 --> 00:47:00,577
your sister's life would not have been so messed up.

592
00:47:00,577 --> 00:47:03,007
Close your eyes in peace.

593
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:06,977
I will take good care of your sister.

594
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:45,757
You are not even on duty today.

595
00:47:45,757 --> 00:47:47,317
There is an urgent matter, so I am going to the palace.

596
00:47:47,317 --> 00:47:49,947
I will not be able to come home for a few days.

597
00:48:17,507 --> 00:48:21,627
What is Father doing out at such a late hour?

598
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:47,507
Who is that?

599
00:48:52,747 --> 00:48:56,317
I get to meet Your Excellency in a pavilion with such a great ambiance,

600
00:48:56,317 --> 00:49:01,427
so it is a shame that I cannot offer you some tea.

601
00:49:01,427 --> 00:49:05,287
I knew you were quite a daring person,

602
00:49:05,287 --> 00:49:10,267
but how could a woman who lost her husband come out wearing such colors?

603
00:49:11,597 --> 00:49:15,977
I was tired of only wearing mourning clothes.

604
00:49:15,977 --> 00:49:22,917
I seem to remember you liked the fact that I was so daring.

605
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:26,317
I told you nicely to leave quietly.

606
00:49:26,317 --> 00:49:30,567
Did you decide to stay and make things more complicated?

607
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:37,097
All I did was tell your daughter-in-law a few concerns about her brother.

608
00:49:37,097 --> 00:49:41,627
It appears that made things quite complicated for you.

609
00:49:45,837 --> 00:49:47,637
Gosh.

610
00:49:48,117 --> 00:49:50,637
What are they saying?

611
00:49:50,637 --> 00:49:54,527
You are not thinking you will remain safe?

612
00:49:56,387 --> 00:49:58,997
If I cannot be safe,

613
00:49:59,607 --> 00:50:02,497
then I can just die.

614
00:50:02,497 --> 00:50:05,557
However, after considering it deeply,

615
00:50:05,557 --> 00:50:09,967
what I accomplished 15 years ago was nothing small,

616
00:50:09,967 --> 00:50:14,107
so I feel it is a bit unfair to die by myself.

617
00:50:14,107 --> 00:50:18,487
Did you forget you lived as the Finance Minister's wife because of that single achievement?

618
00:50:18,487 --> 00:50:21,777
You obtained everything because of it, Your Excellency,

619
00:50:21,777 --> 00:50:25,027
but I merely became the Finance Minister's wife.

620
00:50:27,397 --> 00:50:30,017
No matter how much I think about it,

621
00:50:30,017 --> 00:50:34,477
the calculations do not add up.

622
00:50:34,477 --> 00:50:39,017
As the saying goes, a mere mantis tries to stop a chariot.

623
00:50:39,017 --> 00:50:40,937
Someone like you dares to stop me?

624
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:44,667
How could someone like me dare to stop you?

625
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:53,417
All I am saying is that I will not let things end so vainly.

626
00:51:04,197 --> 00:51:07,927
What? The Finance Minister's Wife?

627
00:51:09,047 --> 00:51:12,837
Your daughter-in-law is quite intelligent.

628
00:51:16,077 --> 00:51:20,317
If I am able to do what I do in my house

629
00:51:20,317 --> 00:51:24,147
and live without problems, your intelligent daughter-in-law and her brother...

630
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:25,707
Why is Madam here?

631
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:29,687
will no longer cause any problems, no?

632
00:51:32,377 --> 00:51:36,307
To think that you thought to blackmail me with something like that...

633
00:51:37,687 --> 00:51:40,727
You have become quite vulgar.

634
00:53:01,277 --> 00:53:02,877
Father!

635
00:53:02,877 --> 00:53:04,857
Hyeon Jae.

636
00:53:53,127 --> 00:53:55,087
Sir!

637
00:53:55,087 --> 00:53:57,627
Damn it! Let us go!

638
00:53:57,627 --> 00:53:59,527
Sir! Sir!

639
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,037
Wake up, Sir!

640
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,817
Sir!

641
00:54:02,817 --> 00:54:04,447
Sir!

642
00:54:04,447 --> 00:54:07,977
Wake up, Sir!

643
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,557
How are you feeling?

644
00:54:35,557 --> 00:54:37,507
Are you okay?

645
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,787
What happened?

646
00:54:40,397 --> 00:54:42,777
You passed out.

647
00:54:47,127 --> 00:54:50,787
I almost died bringing you here.

648
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:55,007
I told you there will come a day when you will be indebted to me.

649
00:54:55,007 --> 00:54:59,857
You talked all that when you could not even handle that?

650
00:55:00,527 --> 00:55:04,517
Thank you for saving me.

651
00:55:05,767 --> 00:55:09,907
You also saved me before, Sir.

652
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:15,167
But do you know where they came from?

653
00:55:23,457 --> 00:55:28,857
They were trying to check the scar on my back, so they most definitely knew me.

654
00:55:33,057 --> 00:55:36,437
Since I have your secret as your weakness,

655
00:55:36,437 --> 00:55:41,447
I will tell you a secret of mine as repayment for saving me.

656
00:55:41,447 --> 00:55:43,687
No.

657
00:55:44,657 --> 00:55:49,457
Keeping my own secret is tough enough. Why learn someone else's secret?

658
00:55:50,297 --> 00:55:52,357
Is that so?

659
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:58,877
If you so want,

660
00:55:58,877 --> 00:56:03,557
you can think of me as a wall and talk to yourself about it.

661
00:56:07,957 --> 00:56:12,957
I often sit alone in the shrine and talk to myself, facing the wall.

662
00:56:12,957 --> 00:56:15,987
It is actually quite relieving.

663
00:56:22,897 --> 00:56:24,767
I am...

664
00:56:25,427 --> 00:56:28,787
someone who should not be alive.

665
00:56:30,717 --> 00:56:37,027
My kind mother, father, and nanny...

666
00:56:39,067 --> 00:56:41,777
My family, who loved me...

667
00:56:42,387 --> 00:56:45,437
were all slaughtered in front of me.

668
00:56:47,297 --> 00:56:50,157
Just like that, 15 years ago,

669
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:53,037
one day without warning,

670
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:56,767
I alone survived...

671
00:56:57,427 --> 00:57:00,127
in that bloody mess.

672
00:57:01,687 --> 00:57:04,527
Not only did I survive,

673
00:57:04,527 --> 00:57:07,617
but the horrible memories of that day...

674
00:57:08,817 --> 00:57:11,227
are not clear.

675
00:57:12,457 --> 00:57:14,867
A sinner for being alive...

676
00:57:15,467 --> 00:57:18,477
Is that not what you call people like me?

677
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:21,717
Since I am a sinner just for being alive,

678
00:57:21,717 --> 00:57:26,577
I am doing whatever I can to live on.

679
00:57:26,577 --> 00:57:29,327
- Those words were—
- So,

680
00:57:29,967 --> 00:57:32,617
do not worry too much.

681
00:57:33,407 --> 00:57:36,687
I am not such an honorable man...

682
00:57:37,347 --> 00:57:40,577
that I can hold your secret over your head.

683
00:57:41,507 --> 00:57:43,897
I will be leaving now.

684
00:57:54,157 --> 00:57:57,887
Thank you... for today.

♫ The faraway place where moonlight lives ♫

686
00:58:05,957 --> 00:58:07,647
♫ Shall I confess my feelings there? ♫

00:58:07,647 --> 00:58:09,927

[Capital Garrison]

695
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,647
Garrison Commander...

696
00:59:00,457 --> 00:59:03,357
- You came in early.
- Yeah, that is right.

697
00:59:03,357 --> 00:59:06,867
Where is our Captain Park Su Ho?

698
00:59:06,867 --> 00:59:09,607
Oh, well, the thing is...

699
00:59:09,607 --> 00:59:12,837
Perhaps he caught a cold.

700
00:59:12,837 --> 00:59:14,217
He is not feeling well.

701
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,557
What? Our Captain Park Su Ho?

702
00:59:17,557 --> 00:59:20,777
Gosh, where is he right now?

703
00:59:26,557 --> 00:59:28,757
- Are you very ill?
- Garrison Commander!

704
00:59:28,757 --> 00:59:31,977
Goodness, you are not feeling well. Stay in bed.

705
00:59:31,977 --> 00:59:36,277
Were you going through so much that you got this ill?

706
00:59:36,277 --> 00:59:38,307
Gosh, well, I am fine.

707
00:59:38,307 --> 00:59:39,727
What do you mean, fine?

708
00:59:39,727 --> 00:59:42,887
Your face is so gaunt.

709
00:59:42,887 --> 00:59:46,877
Lovesickness is like that.

710
00:59:46,877 --> 00:59:48,907
It must have been so rough.

711
00:59:48,907 --> 00:59:51,687
It is rough, I know.

712
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:55,097
I will assess the situation and explain things well,

713
00:59:55,097 --> 00:59:59,717
so do not worry and take care of your body first.

714
00:59:59,717 --> 01:00:01,787
What are you talking about?

715
01:00:01,787 --> 01:00:05,717
What is there to be embarrassed about between us?

716
01:00:05,717 --> 01:00:09,877
We will take care of digging up a path for the river to flow,

717
01:00:09,877 --> 01:00:11,907
so you should just rest up today.

718
01:00:11,907 --> 01:00:13,587
Me?

719
01:00:13,587 --> 01:00:15,817
That is right. You will.

720
01:00:16,757 --> 01:00:20,257
- Garrison Commander.
- No, no, rest, rest.

721
01:00:28,307 --> 01:00:30,927
If you want to hear about your brother,

722
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:36,677
give this book to the person who comes to you in five days.

723
01:00:45,057 --> 01:00:47,067
There are lots of pretty things...

724
01:00:47,067 --> 01:00:50,457
What about this fine-toothed comb?

725
01:00:50,457 --> 01:00:54,457
Was the book that I gave you fun?

726
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:58,687
I enjoyed reading it.

727
01:00:58,687 --> 01:01:00,997
Wait here for a bit. I will bring the book out to you.

728
01:01:00,997 --> 01:01:02,347
Wait.

729
01:01:02,347 --> 01:01:08,247
If you come out to this place, the person who is to receive the book will be waiting here.

730
01:01:32,437 --> 01:01:35,697
I am sorry to ask to meet you like this.

731
01:01:35,697 --> 01:01:38,227
Forgive my discourtesy.

732
01:01:38,837 --> 01:01:43,227
You are Cho Yeo Hwa, the sister of Cho Seong Hoo

733
01:01:43,227 --> 01:01:45,967
who was a Royal Guard 15 years ago, and the eldest daughter-in-law of

734
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:48,807
the Left State Minister. Right?

735
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:57,487
Can you promise not to tell anyone about this meeting?

736
01:02:01,247 --> 01:02:08,867
Madam, this is a very important matter pertaining to your brother's life and death.

737
01:02:10,457 --> 01:02:13,507
Can you promise me?

738
01:02:19,717 --> 01:02:22,747
If you cannot promise me,

739
01:02:22,747 --> 01:02:26,687
I cannot tell you anything more.

740
01:02:40,447 --> 01:02:42,397
Who are you?

741
01:02:45,437 --> 01:02:47,547
Do not turn around.

742
01:02:47,547 --> 01:02:50,357
Who are you that you are looking for Cho Seong Hoo?

743
01:02:51,077 --> 01:02:55,917
I am... here to talk with Cho Seong Hoo's sister.

744
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:58,667
What is it that you want to ask her?

745
01:02:59,157 --> 01:03:02,777
Is it all right for me to say it in front of this person?

746
01:03:06,037 --> 01:03:11,467
I am... looking for what Cho Seong Hoo left behind.

747
01:03:11,467 --> 01:03:13,317
What is that?

748
01:03:13,317 --> 01:03:15,127
I cannot tell you that.

749
01:03:15,127 --> 01:03:18,667
I want to know if he left anything behind with his family

750
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:21,047
or heard any news after he disappeared.

751
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:26,037
By chance, do you know why Cho Seong Hoo disappeared?

752
01:03:26,037 --> 01:03:30,087
Do you know... that reason?

753
01:03:30,087 --> 01:03:33,517
Answer my question! Right now!

754
01:03:35,007 --> 01:03:37,287
Step aside.

755
01:03:51,587 --> 01:03:56,157
[Knight Flower]

756
01:03:56,157 --> 01:03:57,487
[Unfinished Story]

757
01:03:57,487 --> 01:03:59,367
Father...

758
01:04:02,837 --> 01:04:13,047
♫ It is still dark outside the window ♫

759
01:04:13,047 --> 01:04:22,867
♫ Why do I keep seeing only you? ♫

760
01:04:22,867 --> 01:04:28,077
♫ I don't even know where to go ♫

761
01:04:28,077 --> 01:04:33,667
♫ I don't even know the reason ♫

762
01:04:33,667 --> 01:04:43,067
♫ Now, all of my footsteps are moving toward you ♫

763
01:04:43,067 --> 01:04:48,657
♫ The one who made me live ♫

764
01:04:48,657 --> 01:04:54,247
♫ The one who made me cry ♫

765
01:04:54,247 --> 01:05:03,717
♫ This time that is like eternity feels like a moment ♫

766
01:05:03,717 --> 01:05:15,617
♫ Since yesterday was a chilly, windy day of missing you ♫

767
01:05:15,617 --> 01:05:23,757
♫ I hope that I will be next to my lover tomorrow ♫

768
01:05:25,097 --> 01:05:35,407
♫ I stay still with my ears attentive ♫

769
01:05:35,407 --> 01:05:45,247
♫ Your voice that I am always able to hear ♫

770
01:05:45,247 --> 01:05:53,337
♫ Waiting for just one day is a struggle ♫

771
01:05:53,337 --> 01:05:54,857
Have we not seen each other before?

772
01:05:54,857 --> 01:05:57,217
No, we have not.

773
01:05:57,217 --> 01:05:58,577
I do not know her.

774
01:05:58,577 --> 01:06:00,097
I remembered.

775
01:06:00,097 --> 01:06:03,977
Have you forgotten what I said I would do if you returned?

776
01:06:03,977 --> 01:06:07,197
My brother and I are seeking the truth of that day.

777
01:06:07,197 --> 01:06:10,907
If so, I guess I should meet with the Royal Secretary of Defense again.

778
01:06:10,907 --> 01:06:13,117
There is something you cannot tell me. Right?

779
01:06:13,117 --> 01:06:17,347
I believe all of this was the work of the Left State Minister.

780
01:06:17,347 --> 01:06:20,287
You are one of the corroborative evidences.

781
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:24,797
It appears I need to wrap things up before things get more complicated.

782
01:06:24,797 --> 01:06:28,907
Were you searching for my brother from the beginning?

783
01:06:28,907 --> 01:06:33,007
♫ Since yesterday was a chilly, windy day of missing you ♫
