00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:45,211
My Lady, Ggot Nim was taken away for her father's gambling debts!

2
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:52,831
What? You are going back there?

3
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:55,701
It is dangerous, so I will go and bring her back.

4
00:00:56,231 --> 00:01:00,461
What would happen if you appeared at a merchant's lodge run by Kang Pil Jik?

5
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:04,391
It might complicate things between your businesses, so I will go rescue the child.

6
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:07,481
If you must go in person, take Hwal Yoo with you.

7
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:11,871
Also, I did not know it would get used this soon.

8
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:50,661
All the clothes in Myeongdogak were colorful clothes.

9
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:53,461
I am sorry that I could not prepare fitting clothes for her.

10
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:57,671
Since she is only able to wear mourning clothes, so do not worry.

11
00:01:57,671 --> 00:02:02,491
Next time, I will prepare clothes you can wear.

12
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:07,441
To Pil's Lodge?

13
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:13,321
I just do not feel safe sending My Lady alone.

14
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:15,411
My goodness, Grand Merchant.

15
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:19,141
Her Lady would easily beat up all of Kang Pil Jik's henchmen.

16
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:21,011
What are you worried about?

17
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:26,061
What would happen if her identity gets exposed in a crowded place?

18
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:27,221
You are not bad.

19
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:29,151
You should be able to protect yourself now.

20
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:34,271
I still have a long way to go to be like you, Brother.

21
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,091
You are already good enough. Why try to be like me?

22
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:45,301
I also want to protect other people like you.

23
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:55,881
You cannot use a real sword now.

24
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:58,301
You cheated.

25
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:01,261
Will you say the same thing to your enemies?

26
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:06,791
I do not have my own sword, though.

27
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,937
I will craft you an Acorus sword fitting for you.

[Acorus sword: A sword resembling a perennial aquatic plant with sword-like leaves]

I cannot believe you are so pretty and have such a talent for this.

30
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:22,001
I am sad I cannot let the world know.

31
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:27,191
However, there must be something you can do on your own.

32
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:31,111
Once you find it, you must do it willingly.

33
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,801
You are not even on duty today.

34
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,621
There is an urgent matter, so I am going to the palace.

35
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:41,681
I will not be able to come home for a few days.

36
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:45,891
Do not worry about me, and please come back safe.

37
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:47,311
Keep the house safe.

38
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:50,801
- Make sure not to skip any meals.
- Yes.

She lost her parents and became completely alone after losing her brother.

40
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:59,541
Should the Left State Minister's family find out, gosh, it will be terrible.

41
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:05,131
By the way, how did Her Lady end up marrying the Left State Minister's son?

42
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:08,681
[Marriage Acceptance Letter]
Uncle, how can I marry when my brother is not even here?

43
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,231
I did not even hear anything about an engagement.

44
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,721
It is the Left State Minister's family.

45
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:17,171
Would you even deserve it when you are an orphan?

46
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:19,881
It has already been months since your brother has not—

47
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:22,021
Uncle!

48
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:38,141
You never know what life will bring you.

On top of being the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law,

50
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:47,261
she became a widow on the day of her wedding.

51
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:50,681
I am sure even Her Lady would not have expected it.

52
00:04:54,181 --> 00:04:57,471
I heard the groom was attacked by a suspicious assailant on the way.

53
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,191
How terrible is her fate that even her groom was killed?

54
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:03,921
Even so, she still looks after other people before herself.<

55
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:05,581
So how can I stop her?

56
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:08,301
They do not even know if he is dead or alive.

57
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:28,281
Let us go.

[Knight Flower - Episode 2: The faceless woman]

60
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:51,791
and either sold as a mistress to a nobleman or handed over to a courtesan house.

61
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:57,981
You should not do this, Sir.

62
00:05:57,981 --> 00:05:59,791
Come with me.

63
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:04,891
What is this? Did she already get sold to that man?

64
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:11,481
Let go of her hand.

65
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:14,351
I will buy this child.

66

I do not know how much you paid for her,

67
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:25,771

Who are you?

69

Whatever the price, I will pay double.

70

Tell me who you are first.

71
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:39,101
You do not need to know that, Sir.

That is also not my business.

Who are you, and why are you trying to buy this child?

76
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:59,551
Sorry for not recognizing you, a great captain who uses his authority for something as petty as this!

77

00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:49,321
You turned the entire place upside down to catch a mere fraud.

I will let you off this time since it must be your first time in Hanyang.

He is my younger brother.

130
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:40,721
I made you come here and hear unnecessary things.

131
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:46,271
Are you His Excellency Royal Secretary's younger brother?

132
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:52,411
I do not know what trouble my younger brother caused here,

133
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:54,141
but you can tell me.

134
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:56,461
I will compensate.

135
00:10:57,081 --> 00:11:01,041
Not at all. They were the thoughtless words of an ignorant merchant.

136
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,551
So please forgive me.

137
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:06,371
Let us go, Su Ho.

138
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:08,121
Yes, Brother.

Her fever is high, so keep a close look at her for about four hours.

140
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:24,481
Yes.

141
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:28,491
I am counting on you.

Is Ggot Nim okay?

143
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:41,581
She must have been frightened. She has a fever, so I gave her medicine and put her to sleep.

144
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:47,021
Her father might sell her off to the gambling den again.

145
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:50,511
So, I am thinking of letting her work at Myeongdogak starting tomorrow.

146
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:52,231
What do you think, My Lady?

147
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:54,091
It is a great idea.

148
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:58,151
Keeping her close by and watching her would be better.

149
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:02,081
Ggot Nim is a clever child, so she will be good at anything.

150
00:12:04,471 --> 00:12:09,161
Taking into account the money used today, there is no dividend for you this month.

151
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,791
Would that be okay?

152
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,281
Wait! Your business is doing so well.

153
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:15,211
Did you use it up already?

154
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:20,001
You cannot be saying that when you spent 500 nyang in one night.

155
00:12:26,971 --> 00:12:32,071
By the way, according to Hwal Yoo, a man followed after you.

156
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:34,461
Was he someone you know?

157
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:36,551
Oh, my, my. There is no way.

158
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:39,661
I know not a single man in all of Joseon.

159
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:43,171
I have absolutely no idea who he is.

160
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:51,091
I was only worried your identity might have been exposed.

161
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:54,791
I was never caught by anyone for several years.

162
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,161
And that will be the case in the future, too.

163
00:12:57,871 --> 00:13:00,791
Did you like your clothes?

164
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:07,951
They are quite beautiful, but they are not for me.

165
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:12,691
The clothes and the shoes alike...

166
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:17,501
In the end, I lost one of the shoes on the way back.

167
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:21,611
I am thankful to you for caring for me

168
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:27,371
but I should not have to dress up like today again.

169
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:41,201
Kang Pil Jik is not just an everyday merchant.

170
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:43,631
He does not hesitate to deal in filthy dealings.

171
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:45,851
So do not get involved with him from now on.

Thank you.

174
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:57,901
I did not do it to get your thanks.

175
00:13:59,551 --> 00:14:03,531
The night is late. Hurry up and return to the Capital Garrison.

176
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,841
- Wait, this is—
- It is evidence.

177
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:50,151
Put it right there.

178
00:14:50,151 --> 00:14:51,741
An evidence?

179
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:54,231
Is it evidence of love?

180
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,611
Bi Chan.

181
00:14:58,171 --> 00:14:59,291
Yes?

182
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,091
How much money do you have?

183
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:03,051
Well, why do you ask?

184
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:09,321
My mother said never to get money involved, not even with my closest friend.

185
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:14,461
There is a woman who spent 500 nyang like it was nothing in one day.

186
00:15:15,091 --> 00:15:18,321
Could you introduce her to me?

187
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:25,871
So, who is this woman you speak of?

188
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:29,911
I do not know her name or her face.

189
00:15:29,911 --> 00:15:32,291
Could she be the owner of this shoe?

190
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,981
Your acumen is something I must acknowledge.

191
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:38,381
- Then, I will be sure to find its owner—
- Leave it right where it is.

192
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:26,051
I had a bad feeling from the beginning.

193
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,051
He was persistent and...

194
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:48,781
his skills were formidable.

195
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:50,901
Who are you and why are you trying to buy this child?

196
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:54,031
He had an unnecessary sense of duty, too.

197
00:16:57,341 --> 00:17:00,051
What are you doing!

198
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,431
I have to confirm something.

199
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:03,431
You cannot do this!

200
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:14,541
If I get involved with him further, it will be dangerous!

201
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:40,131
My Lady!

202
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:00,421
Hello.

203
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:05,241
Skip the greetings and take a look at this.

204
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:14,371
It is an amount to be deducted from your pay.

205
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:16,551
You will have nothing to receive this month. Right?

206
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:19,551
You will probably have nothing for a few months.

207
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:24,381
You caused trouble at Pil's Lodge on your first day of work.

208
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:26,471
Including the Finance Minister's lost golden toad,

209
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:31,421
just what did you break for them to charge 150 nyang?

210
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,111
Who knew I would meet you like this?

211
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:42,071
Do you know a man named Kang Pil Jik?

212
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:43,681
What if I do?

213
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:46,811
Are you going to go and beg him for a discount?

214
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:51,291
Do not even try. He is a man possessed by money.

215
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:55,181
I am sure I saw him somewhere. But I cannot remember.

216
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:59,341
I am sure you did since he is connected to all sorts of shady dealings.

217
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:01,421
I am sure you saw him somewhere.

218
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:05,751
However, you are just letting him be, even though you know all this?

219
00:19:05,751 --> 00:19:06,791
What?

220
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,811
He seems to be close with high-ranking officials.

221
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:14,101
Though he knew I was a captain, he did not even flinch.

222
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:16,501
In addition, it was an incident that happened during an investigation.

223
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:20,761
But seeing how he requested compensation directly to the Garrison Commander,

224
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:23,461
he must have quite the sponsor behind him.

225
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:27,531
Gosh, t-there is no need to go that far.

226
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:30,751
Why would we not want to arrest him?

227
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:34,441
There was no cause for Capital Garrison to step in so far.

228
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,831
Also, you were the one who said it.

229
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,911
Investigations are the Criminal Arresting Agency's job!

230
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:43,961
In that case, I will keep a close watch on him from now on.

231
00:19:57,051 --> 00:19:59,521
Are you the new captain?

232
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:01,341
Who might you be?

233
00:20:01,341 --> 00:20:04,181
My name is Hwang Yi Kyeong.

234
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:07,751
I am 17 years old now and have five older brothers.

235
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:08,801
I see...

236
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:12,857
My father is the current Garrison Commander.

237
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:17,781
She is my youngest daughter.

238
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:20,711
Honey, when did you come?

239
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:23,761
Oh, this way, please.

240
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:29,071
My name is Hwang Yi Kyeong.

241
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:32,451
I heard you earlier.

242
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,011
Why...

243
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:44,961
She is at it again, is she not?

244
00:20:45,521 --> 00:20:48,791
All right, this is...

245
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,991
that Captain Park Su Ho.

246
00:20:52,861 --> 00:20:55,011
Let us leave for now.

247
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:56,821
Even your name is perfect.

248
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:59,871
This must be fate. Our destiny!

249
00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:02,961
You met your fated one last month, too.

250
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,871
Since you know his name now, get out of here.

251
00:21:05,871 --> 00:21:08,991
Young Master, starting tomorrow—

252
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,481
H-Have you finished all the work I assigned you?

253
00:21:11,481 --> 00:21:12,841
Sorry?

254
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:16,391
You know, the work I assigned you.

255
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:19,591
- O-Oh, yes! I will visit the Finance Minister right now.
- Yes, yes.

256
00:21:19,591 --> 00:21:22,341
Yes, that job! Hurry up and go.

257
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:25,841
Run like the wind! Right now!

258
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:27,991
Father, enjoy.

259
00:21:27,991 --> 00:21:31,161
Young Master, I hope to see you often!

260
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:33,831
[Chanhab: Lunchbox used in Joseon]

261
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:39,691
Your future and mine, how could it be so...

262
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,821
Young Madam!

263
00:22:07,371 --> 00:22:09,341
Ggot Nim.

264
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:12,161
Are you unwell?

265
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:14,831
What do you mean? I am totally fine.

266
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:16,651
How fortunate.

267
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:20,631
Right, I also started working today at Myeongdogak.

268
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,121
Really? That is great.

269
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:27,141
Someone saved me yesterday and entrusted me at Myeongdogak.

270
00:22:27,141 --> 00:22:29,731
I thought she was a heavenly maiden who came down from the sky.

271
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:31,241
Just like you, Young Madam.

272
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:33,841
Is that so?

273
00:22:33,841 --> 00:22:38,791
Ggot Nim, you have to stay even stronger from now on. Do you understand?

274
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,741
Yes, Young Madam.

275
00:22:42,651 --> 00:22:46,991
Young Madam, you left this behind.

276
00:22:49,421 --> 00:22:51,701
Let go of me!

277
00:22:56,321 --> 00:23:00,311
I washed it clean and ironed it, too.

278
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:04,771
Young Madam, thank you...

279
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:08,311
Thank you for everything!

280
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:21,651
Some of the province's school books have worn out.

281
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:25,541
So, the young scholars are having a hard time.

282
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:32,571
Therefore, I think it would be good to send them new books.

283
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:34,861
Permitted.

284
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:42,571
They are nominees for Pyeonganbu's inspector.

285
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:48,461
In this humble one's opinion, the most qualifying one is

286
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:51,381
the oldest son of the previous chancellor, Son Min—

287
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:53,851
Permitted.

288
00:23:56,111 --> 00:24:01,421
This is a status report from Hamgyeong-do's first sergeant.

289
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:07,781
He says the memorial monument on the northern border is severely damaged.

290
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,981
- So gather your people quickly and—
- Wait.

291
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:16,091
The drought is already bad enough, so is this that urgent...

292
00:24:19,531 --> 00:24:22,901
Permitted urgently.

293
00:24:24,817 --> 00:24:26,367
Your Majesty,

294
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:32,091
it is a memorial monument for the lives of hundreds of people who fought to protect our border.

295
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:35,841
How can it not be an urgent matter?

296
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:39,921
I was thoughtless on this matter.

297
00:24:45,491 --> 00:24:47,571
Your Majesty.

298
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:53,851
Even though you skip assemblies sometimes,

299
00:24:53,851 --> 00:24:56,901
what do you think about attending competitions?

300
00:24:56,901 --> 00:25:00,221
Since you do not attend competitions and miss out on assemblies often,

301
00:25:00,221 --> 00:25:04,431
your humble one is quite concerned.

302
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:09,601
What use is it for me to learn more of Confucius's teachings?

303
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:15,301
You are always by my side and giving me the right teachings.

304
00:25:15,301 --> 00:25:19,591
Your Majesty, I am undeserving of such praise.

305
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:25,261
Your lacking humble one is only doing his best for Your Majesty's sake.

306
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:28,991
I am always thankful, Left State Minister.

307
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:35,701
- Oh no!
- Goodness, he might really die!

308
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:40,607
That little punk. Beat him until his life ends!

309
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,217
Yes.

310
00:25:44,831 --> 00:25:48,921
Your Excellency, must you see him dead?

311
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:53,861
Alas, how dare you, a mere woman, speak up to me?

312
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:58,091
He only wastes my food. Whether I beat him to death or crush him to death,

313
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:01,361
I am doing what I want with my property!

314
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:04,561
What are you all doing? Beat him more!

315
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:06,371
Y-Yes

316
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:21,381
Oh, you have arrived?

317
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:30,741
Mine was a bit more...

318
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:41,381
I knew you would find it for me!

319
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:47,741
Is it the golden toad you are looking for?

320
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:50,451
O-Of course, my precious golden toad.

321
00:26:50,451 --> 00:26:54,581
It is my big golden toad. It would not even hurt to put it in my eye.

322
00:26:55,401 --> 00:26:59,331
By the way, what is going on outside?

323
00:27:00,591 --> 00:27:03,891
Since we are on the topic, gosh...

324
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:07,151
why is everything making me mad these days?

325
00:27:07,151 --> 00:27:09,681
That good-for-nothing servant of mine

326
00:27:09,681 --> 00:27:13,801
spilled water on my precious drawing.

327
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:16,261
D-Do you see it there?

328
00:27:17,711 --> 00:27:21,861
Do you not feel the divine energy coming out of it?

329
00:27:21,861 --> 00:27:27,431
I was able to be as successful as today, thanks to this sacred tiger's energy.

330
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:32,211
Where is the damage?

331
00:27:32,211 --> 00:27:35,661
Huh? O-Oh, right here.

332
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:39,091
The top of his tail, right here. Do you not see it?

333
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:48,471
My goodness, you need to work less.

334
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:53,721
You are so young, but your eyes must already be dimming.

335
00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:58,911
Anyhow, that servant who only wastes my food has been gotten rid of.

336
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:02,411
So this is for the better, is it not?

337
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:17,091
He threw out a dying old man outside his gate.

338
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:20,081
Let us go.

339
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:28,451
Goodness! Goodness, Ma'am, did you hear the news?

340
00:28:28,451 --> 00:28:32,171
Gosh, what news are you so overreacting about?

341
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:35,891
You know, Gramps Kwak, who works for the Minister of Finance...

342
00:28:35,891 --> 00:28:40,591
My goodness, he was beaten almost to death and is about to die now!

343
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:46,311
Wait! How bad of a thing could an old fart commit to be beaten to death?

344
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:48,321
That is what I am saying!

345
00:28:48,321 --> 00:28:54,381
He spilled a drop of water on the drawing the Minister of Finance cherishes.

346
00:28:54,381 --> 00:28:59,721
My goodness, they beat him up like a dog and threw him out on the street!

347
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:03,341
Goodness, dear heavens.

348
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:07,011
I hope he does not end up dead for real.

349
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:11,531
His son died early, and he was living alone with his young grandson.

350
00:29:11,531 --> 00:29:14,091
Gosh, what a terrible fate is this?

351
00:29:14,091 --> 00:29:18,421
People come before drawings, not the other way around!

352
00:29:19,811 --> 00:29:22,311
Who is there?

353
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:26,801
W-What is all this?

354
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:30,901
Someone told me to deliver this to you.

355
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:36,311
This is more than I can ever repay.

356
00:29:36,311 --> 00:29:39,131
Is it the one who sent me the physician?

357
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:41,511
Did a physician stop by?

358
00:29:41,511 --> 00:29:46,371
The physician had come by earlier with medicinal herbs.

359
00:29:46,371 --> 00:29:48,341
Who did such a great thing?

360
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:52,711
This is unjust. I did not even go near the tiger drawing.

361
00:29:52,711 --> 00:29:58,451
How come I have to be treated worse than a mere drawing and get kicked out?

362
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:04,351
I want to rip apart that drawing to calm my anger,

363
00:30:04,351 --> 00:30:10,021
but how will I feed that young child after that?

364
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:13,611
Grandpa, what is that?

365
00:30:22,351 --> 00:30:27,791
The laws say even a slave cannot be beaten to death without evidence, do they not?

366
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:30,311
I heard he is a servant who served him for life.

367
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:33,481
They are people who are above the law.

368
00:30:33,481 --> 00:30:36,641
This is beyond our jurisdiction.

369
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:40,301
Is that why you sent him a physician?

370
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:44,181
We are within the boundaries of law, so I only helped him according to the law.

371
00:30:44,181 --> 00:30:45,871
[Guyul: The law that gives out food to the poor or victims]

372
00:30:45,871 --> 00:30:50,121
Oh, right. Remember the child you bought dried persimmon from that day?

373
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:53,621
I hear the dried persimmon girl is at Myeongdogak now.

374
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:54,691
Myeongdogak?

375
00:30:54,691 --> 00:30:56,761
It is a bit of a long story.

376
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:59,261
You know the legendary Midam. Right? I looked into it a bit.

377
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:02,251
Recently, there was a man who lost his home's title deed at the merchant's lodge.

378
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:04,281
So I asked around and went to him to ask a question. He said a masked person came to the gambling den and...

379
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,091
So I asked around and went to him to ask a question. He said a masked person came to the gambling den and...

380
00:31:06,091 --> 00:31:11,821
If you come here one more time, you will need to give up your life, not just your home's title deed.

381
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:15,381
What does that have to do with the child who sells dried persimmon?

382
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:17,601
You need to hear me out to the end.

383
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:22,121
The one who lost the title deed is the dried persimmon child's father.

384
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:26,421
Was it all to help that child in the end?

385
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:31,101
From what I found out, he had a gambling addiction and even sold his daughter!

386
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:34,451
That is when I knew this was the legendary Midam.

387
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:36,391
And I just felt—

388
00:31:36,391 --> 00:31:40,281
So what is the conclusion? Say it in three words.

389
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:44,441
Legendary, Midam,

390
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:46,071
how cool.

391
00:31:48,961 --> 00:31:50,981
Whoa! Whoa!

392
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:03,767
How pretty.

393
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:07,591
Whoa, this is so fine.

394
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:18,901
Do not run away. I only came to ask you something.

395
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:23,631
Are you working at this place?

396
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:30,971
The one who took you that day. Is it someone you know?

397
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:35,441
I do not know! I swear!

398
00:32:40,941 --> 00:32:43,811
Okay, I understand.

399
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:46,841
You do not need to tell me if you do not want to say.

400
00:32:48,751 --> 00:32:52,301
You do your best to protect your secret.

401
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:14,561
What brings you all the way here from the Capital Garrison?

402
00:33:17,441 --> 00:33:21,151
Why is the child I saw earlier here?

403
00:33:21,151 --> 00:33:26,101
She is a child we have hired as a worker for pay.

404
00:33:26,101 --> 00:33:29,121
Who brought her here?

405
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:35,481
Captain, you are not curious about the child,

406
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:39,281
but you were curious about the person who brought the child, I see.

407
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:45,291
Grand Merchant, is it someone you know?

408
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:55,761
In some ways, I do,

409
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,411
and in other ways, I do not.

410
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:03,001
I have done deals with her in the past,

411
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:06,391
but she is someone with no face and name,

412
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:12,061
and she asked me to take care of that child because she could not keep her.

413
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:17,851
She bought her for a high price at Pil's Lodge.

414
00:34:17,851 --> 00:34:20,971
But she just entrusted her to you?

415
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:23,601
This is what she said.

416
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:28,741
"Meeting a foolish father is her misfortune,

417
00:34:28,741 --> 00:34:33,621
but a world where a ten-year-old girl is sold off for her father's gambling debts

418
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:38,991
and the national law not only cannot protect her but condones it,

419
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:41,931
how wretched is that?"

420
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:43,961
She spoke thus,

421
00:34:45,271 --> 00:34:47,961
so even I, a merchant, was moved,

422
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:51,441
so I took the child in without asking any questions.

423
00:34:55,651 --> 00:34:57,851
If I can get the chance,

424
00:34:58,321 --> 00:35:02,491
I would like to see her face for myself.

425
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:06,691
I also...

426
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:10,301
do not know when I will meet her again.

427
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:38,741
He did that to Grandpa for a measly painting?

428
00:35:47,501 --> 00:35:49,621
[I like being single]

429
00:35:51,921 --> 00:35:54,941
This looks like quite an interesting book.

430
00:35:54,941 --> 00:35:57,531
I will buy this one.

431
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:01,561
Yes, Sir. Great choice.

432
00:36:46,611 --> 00:36:48,811
I will only be out for a moment!

433
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:50,501
You cannot tonight.

434
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:53,411
I am going out like other times, so what is wrong with you?

435
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:56,251
My dreams were very disturbing. I have got a feeling about this.

436
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:58,611
Why would you believe in dreams?

437
00:36:58,611 --> 00:37:00,691
It will be fine, so hand it over.

438
00:37:00,691 --> 00:37:05,131
I have got a bad feeling about this. What if something happens when you go out tonight?

439
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,461
Okay, okay.

440
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:11,471
I will not fall for it this time.

441
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:17,161
Oh, you are quite good.

442
00:37:18,421 --> 00:37:21,351
Never! I cannot let you!

443
00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:24,321
There is no such thing as never in life.

444
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:26,571
My Lady! Gosh!

445
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:29,451
No! I cannot let you!

446
00:37:29,451 --> 00:37:31,591
You are making me use my strength today.

447
00:37:31,591 --> 00:37:34,731
My Lady! I said, you must not!

448
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:37,311
My Lady!

449
00:37:37,311 --> 00:37:39,891
Fine. I lost, I lost.

450
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:42,751
How could I win against you?

451
00:37:43,601 --> 00:37:45,881
You cannot go tonight.

452
00:37:45,881 --> 00:37:48,881
How are you getting stronger by the day?

453
00:38:05,521 --> 00:38:07,871
Are you going somewhere?

454
00:38:08,321 --> 00:38:10,511
I think I will patrol around the city.

455
00:38:10,511 --> 00:38:15,201
There are hundreds of patrolmen, so why would you go yourself, Sir?

456
00:38:18,351 --> 00:38:20,171
You are right.

457
00:38:22,061 --> 00:38:23,761
Are you all right?

458
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,911
I am fine.

459
00:38:25,911 --> 00:38:30,431
Well, is the old man that we sent the physician to doing all right?

460
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:34,911
Yes. From what I heard, there was a bag of rice in his front yard.

461
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:41,011
My thoughts are that our legendary Midam came by.

462
00:38:41,011 --> 00:38:43,051
Midam?

463
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:48,211
Come on! The one who appears on moonlit nights wearing a mask, bringing rice, flying across roofs. Midam!

464
00:38:48,211 --> 00:38:51,481
I should have stayed watch at that house. Then, I would have seen Midam in person.

465
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:56,211
Why would they fly across roofs when there are perfectly fine roads?

466
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:59,651
So, where did you say they usually appear?

467
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:03,291
How would I know that?

468
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:06,371
What about the usual time they appear?

469
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:10,031
Probably at night?

470
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:19,411
Sir, where are you going?

471
00:39:20,711 --> 00:39:22,541
Sir!

472
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:28,951
Your Majesty, the Royal Secretary is here.

473
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:32,681
You are here.

474
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:38,261
You should take a seat.

475
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:40,121
Yes, Your Majesty.

476
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:46,941
This is the new book I brought you today.

477
00:39:56,461 --> 00:40:00,501
There were no traces in the Jeolla-do region.

478
00:40:01,111 --> 00:40:06,791
I did not have high hopes, but they were not able to find anything as expected.

479
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:12,671
Please do not be too impatient, and let us wait for next month.

480
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:14,201
Yes.

481
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:22,121
What is this?

482
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:26,391
I found this erotic novel to be quite entertaining when I read it,

483
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:29,741
so I brought it, thinking it would be good for you to read, Your Majesty.
[My sister turns out to be the Royal Secretary's wife]

484
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:33,411
I am already upset from just reading the title.

485
00:40:33,411 --> 00:40:37,911
It appears my popularity these days cannot keep up with your own.

486
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:43,631
I mean, you have your queen and royal concubines, Your Majesty.

487
00:40:43,631 --> 00:40:46,681
- But I am widowed—
- Geez!

488
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:51,911
You should start a family now, too!

489
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:55,671
It has already been 10 years since you have become widowed.

490
00:40:55,671 --> 00:41:00,721
In the future, if I can leave Your Majesty's side without having to worry,

491
00:41:00,721 --> 00:41:03,601
then I will consider it.

492
00:41:03,601 --> 00:41:07,281
It appears that you will end up dying alone.

493
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:09,261
Gosh.

494
00:41:15,107 --> 00:41:19,221
Who dares to touch this nation's Finance Minister's property?

495
00:41:19,221 --> 00:41:22,341
Who is it? Who is it!

496
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:27,481
Oh, my, you are here!

497
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:33,951
Hurry up and come in.

498
00:41:34,901 --> 00:41:37,021
You were the only one I could trust,

499
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:40,391
so I specially asked the Garrison Commander for you.

500
00:41:40,391 --> 00:41:43,941
This! This!

501
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:45,411
You saw it yourself.

502
00:41:45,411 --> 00:41:48,791
Some crazy bastard stole my painting of a white tiger in the mountains!

503
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:53,171
He switched out my extremely valuable painting for this!

504
00:41:53,171 --> 00:41:55,201
Do you have anyone you are suspicious of?

505
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:59,931
Who in Joseon would dare come against me, Yeom Heung Jib?

506
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:06,661
Wait! One of my servants said they saw someone in black jump over the wall last night.

507
00:42:06,661 --> 00:42:10,121
By chance, did that person have a black mask on?

508
00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:13,711
Oh! That is right, a black mask!

509
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:17,111
It will not be enough for me to chew him up into pieces!

510
00:42:17,111 --> 00:42:19,311
When I catch that guy, I will...

511
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:23,121
Is this also the work of that woman?

512
00:42:30,401 --> 00:42:36,601
What... is this... magnificent tiger?

513
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:40,341
It is the price of someone's beating.

514
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:52,511
First, could you tell me what happened?

515
00:42:52,511 --> 00:42:55,821
So what happened was...

516
00:42:57,171 --> 00:43:00,831
Grandpa said he wanted to rip that drawing to shreds,

517
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:03,651
and I just got so mad.

518
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:07,521
Since it was a drawing that His so-called Excellency valued so much,

519
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:10,361
I thought I should go and take a look for myself.

520
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:14,491
I was curious what kind of drawing it was that he would treat a man like that.

521
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:18,351
The drawing was already paid for by his beatings. Yeom Heung Jib does not have to have it anymore.

522
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:20,351
Yeon Seon, you try doing the math.

523
00:43:20,351 --> 00:43:22,651
The calculations line up perfectly. Right?

524
00:43:42,441 --> 00:43:48,861
I thought the wall would look too bare, so I replaced it with a brand-new drawing.

525
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:53,621
That is why I brought it.

526
00:44:01,761 --> 00:44:04,361
My Lady!

527
00:44:07,231 --> 00:44:09,421
Try some udon!

528
00:44:09,421 --> 00:44:13,571
Goodness, goodness, goodness. Merchant, have you come?

529
00:44:13,571 --> 00:44:15,431
Is your business doing well?

530
00:44:15,431 --> 00:44:18,941
Thanks to you giving us a space to hold shop, I am barely getting by.

531
00:44:18,941 --> 00:44:21,651
I will not forget your kindness.

532
00:44:22,261 --> 00:44:27,261
They are Cheonan walnuts. They are really tasty!

533
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:28,841
What did you say?

534
00:44:28,841 --> 00:44:31,451
Cheonan walnuts!

535
00:44:31,451 --> 00:44:34,391
[Lowly Walnuts]
(Sounds like Cheonan)

536
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:41,891
How dare you use the word 'lowly' in front of me!

537
00:44:42,411 --> 00:44:44,121
You!

538
00:44:44,121 --> 00:44:45,921
Lowly?

539
00:44:46,781 --> 00:44:50,881
- Lowly, lowly!
- What are you doing right now, Merchant Kang!

540
00:44:57,081 --> 00:44:58,831
It is fine.

541
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:06,141
Look who is here.

542
00:45:06,141 --> 00:45:10,671
If you are passing by, you should just keep moving.

543
00:45:10,671 --> 00:45:13,851
I thought about tasting some Cheonan walnuts.

544
00:45:13,851 --> 00:45:18,031
But I guess you hate lowly things, Merchant Kang.

545
00:45:19,331 --> 00:45:22,631
I should have killed you back then.

546
00:45:22,631 --> 00:45:26,111
If I did, would you even be able to eat walnuts, wench?

547
00:45:26,111 --> 00:45:27,931
What a relief, is it not?

548
00:45:27,931 --> 00:45:32,861
I barely managed to survive and am fulfilling my responsibilities as the Grand Merchant.

549
00:45:32,861 --> 00:45:40,021
We came so close to losing our centuries-old tradition to some nobody gangster.

550
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:42,321
Gangster? How dare you!

551
00:45:42,321 --> 00:45:45,861
Though you may not see it, in my body, there is—

552
00:46:03,701 --> 00:46:07,191
How long do you think you will be able to keep your position?

553
00:46:07,191 --> 00:46:10,411
Are you worried about my position?

554
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:14,671
Even so, that will not become yours, Merchant Kang.

555
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:40,711
Is it a dog?

556
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:42,691
Or is it a bear?

557
00:46:42,691 --> 00:46:45,261
Oh, one thing is for sure.

558
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:46,501
What are you talking about?

559
00:46:46,501 --> 00:46:51,091
That our Midam is really bad at drawing.

560
00:46:52,531 --> 00:46:56,611
Honestly, I am happy that guy's drawing got stolen.

561
00:46:56,611 --> 00:46:59,711
Did you forget your position?

562
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:03,831
Still, whenever I think about that old man who got beaten...

563
00:47:03,831 --> 00:47:07,741
Bringing rice to the old man can be thought of as a good deed,

564
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,751
but this is theft.

565
00:47:12,451 --> 00:47:14,311
Hello.

566
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:16,211
Why did the Minister of Finance ask for you?

567
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:19,251
He asked for you to do something burdensome. Right?

568
00:47:19,251 --> 00:47:23,021
Try to understand. That guy does not know how to distinguish between private and public matters,

569
00:47:23,021 --> 00:47:26,571
and uses public authority for personal purposes.

570
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:33,211
What is this?

571
00:47:33,211 --> 00:47:36,771
The original drawing of a white tiger in the mountains was stolen by a thief in the night,

572
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:41,401
and this doodling of a drawing was left behind.

573
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:43,171
What?

574
00:47:43,171 --> 00:47:46,431
It is a drawing that was left behind at the Minister of Finance's house,

575
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:49,211
so there is no way it is just any drawing.

576
00:47:49,941 --> 00:47:54,151
It may be a warning from a group of rebels...

577
00:47:54,151 --> 00:47:59,011
I think it may just be a mere thief.

578
00:48:08,331 --> 00:48:10,791
Something feels off.

579
00:48:12,171 --> 00:48:17,441
Do you know the four-word idiom Maeng Ho Wi Seo?

580
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:20,021
[Maeng Ho Wi Seo: 'Fierce Tiger Becomes Rat,' meaning a king that loses authority is overwhelmed by his subjects]

581
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:24,831
Does it not mean that a tiger that loses its authority becomes a rat?

582
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:28,101
Do you not know what that means?

583
00:48:28,101 --> 00:48:33,391
It means that a king who loses his authority becomes overwhelmed by his subjects.

584
00:48:33,391 --> 00:48:35,251
This—

585
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:41,031
smells of treason!

586
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:42,381
Love?
(Sounds like the word 'treason')

587
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:46,037
[Yeokmo: treason—>Yeonmo: Loving or missing a person/being]

588
00:48:46,037 --> 00:48:47,921
Whether it is a rebel or a thief,

589
00:48:47,921 --> 00:48:50,171
make sure you catch this guy!

590
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:54,931
The Capital Garrison's honor is in your hands.

591
00:48:56,311 --> 00:48:57,881
Yes...

592
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:02,011
I understand.

593
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:17,301
I will take the one remaining Myeongdogak

594
00:49:17,301 --> 00:49:22,911
and see the expression on that bitch's face.

595
00:49:24,891 --> 00:49:26,791
What about the boat going to the Qing Dynasty?

596
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:29,431
I have prepared everything with no issues.

597
00:49:32,421 --> 00:49:35,811
Do you know how much money I gave Yeom Heung Jib?

598
00:49:35,811 --> 00:49:41,171
I worked hard to open up this sea route to send these goods, so there must never be any mistakes.

599
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:43,211
Do not worry.

600
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:48,691
There is one more thing you need to take care of quickly.

601
00:49:48,691 --> 00:49:51,951
Whom shall I kill?

602
00:49:54,861 --> 00:49:57,261
Find me a drawing.

603
00:49:58,671 --> 00:50:03,541
It is an urgent task, so take care of it quietly.

604
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:05,601
Yes, Hyungnim.

605
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:31,881
You need to stir with constant care for a long time to produce grain syrup.

606
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:33,931
Yes, Mother.

607
00:50:35,411 --> 00:50:40,071
Without rush, but also not too slowly.

608
00:50:40,731 --> 00:50:45,081
You have to stir at a constant pace so it does not stick and burn at the bottom.

609
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:46,281
Yes.

610
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:49,181
- I will stir now.
- How dare you

611
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:52,561
lay your hands on the grain syrup that His Excellency will eat!

612
00:50:53,281 --> 00:50:55,381
I am sorry.

613
00:50:57,661 --> 00:51:00,771
But, Mother, tomorrow, I—

614
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:04,791
You can only do tomorrow's tasks after today's work is over.

615
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:08,051
Keep stirring slowly.

616
00:51:08,051 --> 00:51:09,751
Okay...

617
00:51:18,481 --> 00:51:24,431
Yeon Seon, for some reason, my eyes sting so much today.

618
00:52:03,211 --> 00:52:07,531
Will the grain syrup be done by tonight?

619
00:52:09,881 --> 00:52:14,681
I need to finish making this tonight to go to the temple tomorrow.

620
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,431
You can do it, Cho Yeo Hwa!

621
00:52:24,151 --> 00:52:27,531
Young Madam! Young Madam!

622
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:31,131
His Excellency is calling for you.

623
00:52:41,841 --> 00:52:43,931
Have you called for me, Father?

624
00:52:43,931 --> 00:52:49,071
Did I call you too late at night when you have to go to the temple tomorrow?

625
00:52:49,071 --> 00:52:53,151
You knew it was tomorrow?

626
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:57,721
How would I not know?

627
00:52:57,721 --> 00:53:02,771
I will give you two sacks of rice, so make a good offering with them.

628
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:04,791
Thank you, Father.

629
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:06,841
Since you are my daughter-in-law,

630
00:53:06,841 --> 00:53:10,811
your brother, Seong Woo, is also our family.

631
00:53:10,811 --> 00:53:14,061
If our utmost sincere offerings will have him return,

632
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:17,701
a few sacks of rice is nothing in comparison.

633
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:24,331
I know you have endured all this time through your hope

634
00:53:24,331 --> 00:53:27,041
that your brother may return.

635
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,881
Father...

636
00:53:30,971 --> 00:53:36,821
Still, what a relief it is that you have such a hope.

637
00:53:44,451 --> 00:53:48,921
You must be tired. You should hurry up and go rest.

638
00:53:48,921 --> 00:53:51,001
Yes, Father.

639
00:54:36,671 --> 00:54:40,491
[Dear Brother, I believe you are still alive somewhere out there...]

640
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:47,111
Brother... I may be getting married.

641
00:54:47,111 --> 00:54:51,711
Please... Please take me with you.

642
00:55:19,091 --> 00:55:21,581
This is an Acorus sword?

643
00:55:21,581 --> 00:55:24,981
[Acorus sword: A Joseon-era sword resembling a perennial aquatic plant with sword-like leaves]

644
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:33,141
I will craft you an Acorus sword fitting for you.

645
00:55:33,141 --> 00:55:34,991
Brother...

646
00:55:36,921 --> 00:55:39,541
Are you alive?

647
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:45,221
Where are you that you have not come back?

648
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:08,961
It has... already been 15 years...

649
00:56:31,591 --> 00:56:34,961
[Su Ho's father, Su Ho's mother]

650
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,281
Father!

651
00:56:55,281 --> 00:56:58,581
Hyeon Jae! You bastards!

652
00:57:01,841 --> 00:57:03,881
No!

653
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:20,781
Stay alive...

654
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:54,441
Thank you for coming with me.

655
00:57:54,441 --> 00:57:57,101
If I do not come with you for your parents' memorial day,

656
00:57:57,101 --> 00:58:01,841
Father would nag me for at least three days, saying how I am such an indifferent brother.

657
00:58:01,841 --> 00:58:06,121
It was my first time in three years visiting them, so it took a bit longer to greet them.

658
00:58:06,121 --> 00:58:08,321
Let us go down now.

659
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:09,891
Okay.

660
00:58:19,311 --> 00:58:21,391
You came last year even in the midst of all the rain,

661
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:25,341
and you came this year as well, without forgetting.

662
00:58:34,461 --> 00:58:38,901
Is he not an older brother who cares a lot about his younger brother?

663
00:59:06,241 --> 00:59:09,131
My Lady, how much more do we have to go?

664
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:10,421
We are almost there.

665
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:15,711
You said we were almost there an hour ago!

666
00:59:15,711 --> 00:59:19,021
Okay, you must be tired. Let us take a break here for a moment.

667
00:59:19,021 --> 00:59:20,351
Let us take a break.

668
00:59:20,351 --> 00:59:22,381
Yes, Madam.

669
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:35,601
Hyungnim, you have to steel yourself.

670
00:59:35,601 --> 00:59:37,901
You see that carrier on his shoulders?

671
00:59:37,901 --> 00:59:39,051
There are two sacks of rice.

672
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:42,661
Goodness. W-What if we end up getting struck down by divine punishment?

673
00:59:42,661 --> 00:59:46,941
Our children are about to die from starvation before we receive divine punishment,

674
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:48,921
so, who cares?

675
00:59:48,921 --> 00:59:52,221
Goodness, you should be careful.

676
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:54,651
- We have to be careful not to harm anybody.
- Yes, yes.

677
00:59:54,651 --> 00:59:59,841
T-Then, we will move out when we count, one, two, three!

678
00:59:59,841 --> 01:00:01,871
One, two!

679
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:04,321
How about we go out then?

680
01:00:07,751 --> 01:00:09,571
The sun will set at this rate.

681
01:00:09,571 --> 01:00:13,721
Put on as scary of a face as you can.

682
01:00:16,061 --> 01:00:19,301
One, two...

683
01:00:20,571 --> 01:00:22,621
three!

684
01:00:34,621 --> 01:00:37,491
What are you doing?

685
01:00:37,491 --> 01:00:41,111
I-If you care for your life, hand over the rice!

686
01:00:41,111 --> 01:00:44,621
H-Hand it over! If you do not, we will not let you be!

687
01:00:44,621 --> 01:00:46,771
We will not let you be!

688
01:00:47,761 --> 01:00:49,811
- I mean it.
- Yes.

689
01:00:49,811 --> 01:00:52,721
Is that rice what you want?

690
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:55,191
What else would it be?

691
01:00:56,551 --> 01:01:00,341
Do not harm anyone, and just take the rice.

692
01:01:00,341 --> 01:01:01,551
What is this?

693
01:01:01,551 --> 01:01:03,691
R-Really?

694
01:01:03,691 --> 01:01:07,531
I-It is really okay for us to take all of this?

695
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:09,641
Yes, take it.

696
01:01:09,641 --> 01:01:11,081
What is going on?

697
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:12,921
No takebacks.

698
01:01:12,921 --> 01:01:14,351
Hurry up and take it already!

699
01:01:14,351 --> 01:01:17,031
Oh, all right, go, go!

700
01:01:17,031 --> 01:01:18,641
Brother.

701
01:01:19,981 --> 01:01:21,251
Hurry, before the sun sets.

702
01:01:21,251 --> 01:01:23,261
Stay here for a moment.

703
01:01:23,261 --> 01:01:24,831
Why?

704
01:01:29,161 --> 01:01:31,111
Grand Merchant.

705
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:34,791
A letter has come from the Capital Garrison.

706
01:01:39,361 --> 01:01:42,731
I am letting you know as Captain of the Capital Garrison.

707
01:01:43,811 --> 01:01:46,701
- Gosh, goodness.
- Stop right there!

708
01:01:50,611 --> 01:01:52,031
Gosh.

709
01:01:52,031 --> 01:01:53,831
Gosh, why is that guy here?

710
01:01:53,831 --> 01:01:57,341
Who is he? Is he someone you know, My Lady?

711
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:04,201
Sir, I am in danger. Help me.

712
01:02:04,201 --> 01:02:06,491
I will help you, so stand aside here for now.

713
01:02:06,491 --> 01:02:09,711
No, Sir. I am the one in danger.

714
01:02:09,711 --> 01:02:10,931
Do not worry.

715
01:02:10,931 --> 01:02:13,571
No, that is not what I am worried about...

716
01:02:22,031 --> 01:02:23,841
Come here for a moment.

717
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:27,691
Sir, I am in danger right now, so help me first!

718
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:30,291
- Why are you doing this?
- Hold on tight.

719
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:32,811
Not over there, but me!

720
01:02:51,671 --> 01:02:54,561
I am letting you know as Captain of the Capital Garrison.

721
01:02:54,561 --> 01:02:57,511
I will make sure to catch you,

722
01:02:57,511 --> 01:03:03,241
so please do not appear before me.

723
01:03:07,341 --> 01:03:12,031
[Knight Flower]

724
01:03:12,031 --> 01:03:16,421
[Unfinished story]

725
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:32,161
♫ The one who made me live ♫

726
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:37,761
♫ The one who made me cry ♫

727
01:04:37,761 --> 01:04:47,151
♫ This time that is like eternity feels like a moment ♫

728
01:04:47,151 --> 01:04:52,801
♫ The cold day of being battered by snow and wind ♫

729
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:55,501
♫ I miss yesterday ♫

730
01:04:55,501 --> 01:04:59,161
I heard your younger brother is in charge of investigating the theft of the Finance Minister's drawing.

731
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:00,531
Did you catch the thief?

732
01:05:00,531 --> 01:05:02,921
I was unable to see his face.

733
01:05:02,921 --> 01:05:04,421
Who is out there?

734
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:06,781
I am sure I told you not to appear before me.

735
01:05:06,781 --> 01:05:10,111
Let us simply say you never saw me.

736
01:05:10,111 --> 01:05:13,571
Dangsanggwan ladies are going out to Sugumun.

737
01:05:13,571 --> 01:05:16,571
You all went through a lot to come here.

738
01:05:16,571 --> 01:05:20,641
What is your opinion on that lady wearing mourning clothes?

739
01:05:20,641 --> 01:05:24,161
Gosh, she is someone you should never get close to.

740
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:26,041
I must go out.

741
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:29,201
That poor grandmother weighs on my heart.

742
01:05:29,831 --> 01:05:31,591
Grandmother!

743
01:05:33,511 --> 01:05:38,991
♫ I am okay with whenever and wherever ♫
