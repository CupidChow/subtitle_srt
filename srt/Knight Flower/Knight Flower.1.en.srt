[Pil's Lodge: A lodge owned by Pil's Merchandising, the largest merchandising business on Woonjong Street.]

2
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:50,657
Did you bring enough money?

3
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:52,917
Of course, I did.

4
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:57,287
All right, let us begin now.

5
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:01,517
Yes, I won!

6
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:02,777
Hurray!

7
00:01:02,777 --> 00:01:04,887
Here!

8
00:01:07,557 --> 00:01:10,067
Goodness, you are back again, Mr. Kim.

9
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:12,017
I brought my home's title deed this time.

10
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:14,887
Take this and let me play just one round, please.

11
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:17,517
Of course, you will play.

12
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:20,877
- You will win some this time. Right?
- Of course!

13
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:25,517
- Who the heck is this?
- My deed...

14
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:37,947
Children who starve every day and a wife who is beaten every day.

15
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:40,567
How dare you mess with me?

16
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,357
Do you want to die?

17
00:01:42,357 --> 00:01:44,797
- Not our home's title deed!
- I need to go make money!

18
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:48,807
On top of that, you just had to make me follow you here.

19
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:51,367
If you come here one more time,

20
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:55,487
you will need to give up your life, not just your home's title deed.

21
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:57,267
- Y-Yes...
- Who is it?

22
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:59,637
Get that bastard!

23
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:06,177
Here goes 100 nyang.

24
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:08,667
Follow me if you want.

25
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,757
I call.

26
00:02:13,347 --> 00:02:17,220
I think I won this round.

27
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,567
Oh, my Gu-ttaeng?

28
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:23,777
My goodness, seriously.
[Gu-ttaeng: A pair of nines.]

29
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:29,447
I get to make money for free while sitting and doing nothing?

30
00:02:31,207 --> 00:02:34,217
It is too fun, is it not?

31
00:02:34,217 --> 00:02:36,777
Get that bastard!

32
00:02:36,777 --> 00:02:39,777
Who is it? Stop the thief!

33
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:42,617
After him!

34
00:02:43,307 --> 00:02:45,157
There!

35
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:48,517
Hold on.

36
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:51,347
Nothing is free in this world.

[Jang-ttaeng: A pair of tens, the highest hand in tujeon.]

40
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:10,227
There are only supposed to be two tens in a game. Right?

41
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:16,027
Wait, no way!

42
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:18,777
This is my first game in Hanyang.

43
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:25,187
W-What is this maniac saying right now? Who are you?

44
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:29,817
How dare you!

45
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:31,417

46
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:34,747
You damned fraud!

47
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:54,377
Do not mind me, and continue what you were doing.

48
00:03:59,997 --> 00:04:03,997
You little rat.

49
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:06,517
Whoa—

50
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:07,687
Stand back!

51
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:09,667
Otherwise, I will cut open his throat!

52
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,927
Calm down! Why are you doing this?

53
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:24,707
My money. M-My money.

54
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:32,927
Look at me. Pull yourself together. Look!

55
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:35,577
You should all calm down.

56
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:47,997
- Now, now. What is the matter?
- Go!

57
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:04,067
Why you little...

58
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:22,917
- What are you doing?
- A woman?

59
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:24,687
Get him!

60
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:35,387
Wait, paru is ringing already?

There.

Mother!

73
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:51,317
Did you stay up all night here?

74
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:57,177
I dare not compare my loss to yours, but thinking of my husband, who died in vain,

75
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:02,767
how can I rest my body in a warm room?

76
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:15,787
It is said neat and modest behavior is the beginning of virtue.

77
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:16,797
I am sorry.

78
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:21,307
How are you still lacking after spending more than a decade in the shrine?

79
00:08:21,307 --> 00:08:24,257
I will train my mind with even more effort.

80
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:25,927

Sorry?

Starting today, eat only one meal a day again,

90
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:05,187
stay away from meat and avoid sweets.

I—

92
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:14,457
I understand.

93
00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:29,067
Seriously. If I eat only greens once a day, I will be even less modest

94
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,747
because I cannot go to the bathroom.

95
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:34,047
Gosh, seriously.

96
00:09:34,647 --> 00:09:36,817
I think I am hungry even now.

97
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:40,177
What do I do now, Yeon Seon?

98
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,727
What is it? You are scaring me.

99
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:49,417
Are you not curious why I got hurt?

100
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:52,527
How can I dare to ask you such a thing?

101
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:55,037
Whether the day is at its end or its peak,

102
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:57,667
it is fine as long as Madam does not find out.

103
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:00,817
I can sense something between the lines here.

104
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:05,457
No way. Whether I wither to death or vomit blood to death from worrying about you,

105
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:08,827
please do not even worry about me. I am nothing.

106
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:12,227
I really only headed outside to check if Ggot Nim is doing well.

107
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:14,987
I have not seen her for days, and she used to come every day to get sewing work.

108
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:17,077
Yes, I am sure you were curious.

109
00:10:17,077 --> 00:10:21,497
I also wonder if you broke your bones jumping over the fence when I hear a loud thud outside.

110
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:27,307
I also get curious if you were caught by the guardian patrols when the neighbor's dog barks.

111
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:30,177
- But you still came back safely today—
- Yes!

112
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:35,057
Your one and only lady came back safely today as well.

113
00:10:35,057 --> 00:10:36,977
Please be careful, seriously.

114
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:40,307
What will you say if you come home with a broken arm or something?

115
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,807
It was really close today.

116
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:44,777
There were swords flying everywhere,

117
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:48,037
they rang paru, but I was still at Woonjong Steet—

118
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:49,247
Swords?

119
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:51,807
Did you have a swordfight today?

120
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:54,097
Did I say swords?

121
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:56,647
No, not at all. That is not true, Yeon Seon.

122
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:59,127
That is such nonsense.

123
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,497
Anyhow, I finally realized it today.

124
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,647
That I can take on 17 people alone in a fight.

125
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,647
My Lady!

126
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:14,327
Gosh, you startled me.

[Capital Garrison: A central military camp built to protect the king and the capital.]

128
00:11:17,397 --> 00:11:20,207
All right, Captain Park Su Ho.

129
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:23,417
You took first place in the military exam and came from a great family, too.

130
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:27,787
I also heard you took care of the Jo Sae Mi incident in Jeolla-do.

131
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:31,127
So I was assured and trusted you.

132
00:11:31,127 --> 00:11:34,540
I only performed the duty entrusted to me.

133
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:38,507
Yes, your entrusted duty.

134
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:43,417
I gave you your first mission, which was to arrest a scammer.

135
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:44,587
And what did you do?

136
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:48,677
As you ordered, I arrested the one disturbing the peace and

137
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:51,707
since investigations are Criminal Arresting Agency's job, I handed him over to them.

138
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:54,657
Each province's government agency is after him.

139
00:11:54,657 --> 00:11:57,227
We, the Capital Garrison, made the arrest,

140
00:11:57,227 --> 00:12:01,387
but Criminal Arresting Agency took the score in the end, huh?

141
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:05,547
They said he would be punished according to the law, so do not worry.

142
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:08,867
Is Confucius your younger brother?

143
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:11,447
Because it is someone else's meal prepared on your table,

144
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:13,617
you will not eat even if you were to die?

145
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:16,187
Gosh, you are great!

146
00:12:16,187 --> 00:12:18,907
I am so proud of you!

147
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:22,327
Damn it!

148
00:12:23,017 --> 00:12:24,987
There was trouble at the gambling den.

149
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:28,947
Since the size of the gambling den was not small and a suspicious person intervened,

150
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:31,727
it seems we must strengthen the security of the capital.

151
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:33,457
Why are you telling me that?

152
00:12:33,457 --> 00:12:35,567
Make a report at the Criminal Arresting Agency.

153
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:40,497
Or you can arrest them instead and deliver them to the Criminal Arresting Agency!

154
00:12:40,497 --> 00:12:44,747
I will report to you again if there is progress in the investigation.

155
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:52,507
I have no luck with people.

156
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:54,137
Did you get scolded a lot?

157
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:56,147
Only if you had brought that punk,

158
00:12:56,147 --> 00:12:58,817
your presence at Capital Garrison would have gone off the charts.

159
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:01,007
First, the case of Jo Sae Mi in Jeolla-do!

160
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:02,657
Second, the swindler at the gambling den!

161
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,667
Lastly, get favored by the Garrison Commander!

162
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:09,897
And my future would have also blossomed.

163
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:15,067
Right, there is something you must look into.

164
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:18,617
Last night, a person in a black mask caused trouble at Pil's Lodge.

165
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:20,167
A mask?

166
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,907
An assassin or a thief?

167
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:25,867
Could it be a killer?

168
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:29,737
I am not sure, but her skills were above average.

169
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:34,077
She has caused a disturbance to the peace, so find out who she is and how she started

170
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:36,167
as much detail as possible.

171
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:37,527
Yes.

172
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:49,137
Your Majesty, everyone was worried because you did not come to today's assembly, either.

173
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:53,537
It is an illness that would get cured automatically after assembly.

174
00:13:53,537 --> 00:13:58,390
Right, I heard your younger brother joined the Capital Garrison.

175
00:13:59,677 --> 00:14:01,487
Looks like he got busy as soon as he came.

176
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,307
I did not get to meet him yet, either.

177
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:08,917
Everyone said your family's adopted son will do many great things in the future.

178
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:11,787
That is why I am even more concerned.

179
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:13,437
If he ends up catching people's attention—

180
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,407
It has been 15 years already.

181
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:20,187
Who would ever realize he is In Kang's son?

182
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:24,077
Even you have interest in him right now, Your Majesty.

183
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:27,877
I must not forget the son of a loyal subject

184
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:30,557
who served my father until the end.

185
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:35,787
Also, he is your younger brother right now.

186
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:42,077
Gosh, that felt good.

187
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:47,727
Check!

188
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:50,547
It is your turn.

189
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:54,737
If I win, you will attend tomorrow's assembly.

190
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:58,977
Guess I will have one more reason to miss the assembly.

191
00:14:58,977 --> 00:15:00,927
Please do not lower your guard.

192
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:06,177
I will protect my king to the end.

193
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,317
He said he had a fever all night.

194
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:22,567
But he is playing chess with the Third Rank Royal Secretary over there.

195
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:25,897
It is not the first time. Did you not realize he was only pretending?

196
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:27,297
I can understand His Majesty.

197
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:30,087
But the Royal Secretary gets to do nothing and gets paid to this day

198
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:33,237
just because he was His Majesty's childhood friend.

199
00:15:34,737 --> 00:15:37,947
Left State Minister works so hard for this country day and night.

200
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:40,977
This is too harsh, really.

201
00:15:46,297 --> 00:15:50,287
Your Majesty's chariot seems to be in danger.

202
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:53,747
Hurry up and order the Royal Secretary to

203
00:15:53,747 --> 00:15:57,417
take back a move by Your Majesty's name.

204
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:04,817
What brings you all the way here, Left State Minister?

205
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:10,717
I heard you could not sleep last night, so I was coming to see you.

206
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:14,157
I felt better once morning came.

207
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:19,137
Are you having a hard time because of the drought that has continued for three months?

208
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:50,757
How can it be your fault that we are not getting rain?

209
00:16:50,757 --> 00:16:53,817
It is all because I lack virtue.

210
00:16:53,817 --> 00:17:00,457
Your Majesty frequently suffered from fevers when your heart was troubled.

211
00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:04,037
Please do not let the weight of governing bother you too much.

212
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:09,627
Your humble one and Royal Court's officials will always be there to help you.

213
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,677
Thank you, Left State Minister.

214
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:19,057
It also relieves my heart that you are by His Majesty's side.

215
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:22,907
Tend to his needs, so nothing inconveniences him.

216
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:26,557
Yes, Left State Minister, I will devote my body and mind.

217
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:28,487
I will now take my leave.

218
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:31,037
You may go ahead.

219
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:45,637
"A loyal subject does not serve two kings

220
00:17:45,637 --> 00:17:50,397
and a woman of virtue does not serve two husbands," according to the literature.

221
00:17:50,397 --> 00:17:53,997
Madam Yoon of Sooncheon lived by

222
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:59,247
her husband's grave for seven years after he passed away.

223
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:01,507
I am not scared.

224
00:18:01,507 --> 00:18:03,217
I am scared.

225
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:05,197
I am not scared. I am scared.

226
00:18:05,197 --> 00:18:06,897
I am not scared.

227
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:09,107
I am scared!

228
00:18:09,107 --> 00:18:11,097
Oh my god!

229
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:16,117
Madam Ko of Danyang stopped eating

230
00:18:16,117 --> 00:18:19,837
and followed her husband after 10 days.

231
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:24,567
Just... Just one spoon.

232
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,387
Okay.

233
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:37,187
Madam Kwak of Haejoo, right after her husband died,

234
00:18:37,187 --> 00:18:42,317
succumbed to the sorrow and threw herself down a cliff.

235
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,337
Gosh, I cannot do this.

236
00:18:56,337 --> 00:18:57,657
A virtuous woman is...

237
00:18:57,657 --> 00:19:00,067
Follow your husband.

238
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:02,927
You must die!

239
00:19:16,347 --> 00:19:21,827
In this case, you, who let a man embrace you,

240
00:19:24,277 --> 00:19:27,157
will have your arms cut off and

241
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:29,247
both of your eyes...

242
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:32,777
will be plucked out.

243
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:35,247
No!

244
00:19:35,247 --> 00:19:40,937
[Virtuous Woman: A woman who kills herself for her husband and to protect her chastity]

245
00:19:42,957 --> 00:19:45,207
Gosh, my arm...

246
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:48,487
I thought they were cut off for real.

247
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,417
Were your arms cut off this time?

248
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:54,047
My eyes were about to be plucked out, too.

249
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:58,077
What are you so anxious about that you have a dream like that?

250
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:01,217
Gosh, I am not anxious.

251
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:04,597
Yeon Seon.

252
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,207
I am absolutely not talking about myself here.

253
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:12,497
A widow ended up in a hustler's arms by pure accident.

254
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:14,377
I mean, she was pushed.

255
00:20:14,377 --> 00:20:16,207
Did she die?

256
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:21,167
Right, most end up dead because they cannot endure the shame.

257
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:23,547
They cut off the parts of their body that were in contact.

258
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:26,207
Otherwise, they take their own life.

259
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:29,217
So, who is this widow you speak of?

260
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:33,747
Oh, there is a widow I know. A friend of a friend.

261
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:38,887
The widow I know, if she does not finish transcribing by today...

262
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:40,857
Will die, huh?

263
00:20:42,797 --> 00:20:45,287
Why is transcribing so hard for me?

264
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:48,317
How can the brush feel heavier than a sword?

265
00:20:48,317 --> 00:20:51,127
Instead, you are good at martial arts.

266
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:57,347
True. My brother said this when he taught me martial arts.

267
00:20:57,347 --> 00:21:00,557
"You are so pretty, but you have such a talent.

268
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:04,807
I am sad I cannot let the world know."

269
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:10,637
And I am worried the whole world might find out.

270
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:12,787
How much longer do I have?

271
00:21:20,717 --> 00:21:24,147
I knew this would happen and did one extra in advance.

272
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:30,047
Yeon Seon.

273
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:33,277
Wipe your cheek first.

274
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:37,767
I will charge only two nyang this time.

275
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:38,697
Two nyang?

276
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,757
I gave you a lot of discount.

277
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,677
I mean, you said you wanted to buy a good house in Hanyang.

278
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:47,027
Do you not have enough money saved already?

279
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:50,767
I still have a long way to go.

280
00:21:54,197 --> 00:21:56,997
Oh, right. Bong Mal-daek told me this earlier.

281
00:21:56,997 --> 00:21:58,917
Madam is meeting her in-law today.

282
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,637
Really?

283
00:22:00,637 --> 00:22:04,497
Does that mean she is going out today?

284
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:10,297
You just need the Memorial Gate for Virtuous Women for this perfect family.

285
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:16,077
Gosh, your family would be the most prestigious family in all of Joseon.

286
00:22:16,077 --> 00:22:20,007
Minister of General Affairs' daughter-in-law is about to get it, though.

287
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:25,537
What do you mean by that?

288
00:22:25,537 --> 00:22:30,070
- Well—
- They say it is tough for any ordinary widow to receive it these days.

289
00:22:30,937 --> 00:22:33,387
That is right.

290
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:37,677
The rumors say the General Affairs Minister's family will get it only because

291
00:22:37,677 --> 00:22:42,687
the Minister of Finance's wife, who is the queen dowager's niece, is close to her.

292
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:46,787
From old times, the Memorial Gate for Virtuous Women is said to have been given by the heavens.

293
00:22:46,787 --> 00:22:48,537
I mean, of course!

294
00:22:48,537 --> 00:22:51,447
A person's influence is never enough to receive it.

295
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:54,227
I am reluctant to say it because it sounds like I am boasting,

296
00:22:54,227 --> 00:23:00,127
but my eldest daughter-in-law does not come out of the shrine for 100 days, eating only one meal a day.

297
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:02,257
Being more devoted will not be enough,

298
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:05,937
yet they are lining up with people to receive the Memorial Gate.

299
00:23:05,937 --> 00:23:09,887
I feel sorry for the General Affairs Minister's family, too.

300
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:12,907
That is what I am saying.

301
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:21,037
Looking for something to eat in the kitchen in broad daylight?

302
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:26,457
Why is the sister-in-law who got married come home so often?

303
00:23:26,457 --> 00:23:29,677
I was going to get some sweets secretly.

304
00:23:31,207 --> 00:23:33,737
This is why they say the ignorant show themselves.

305
00:23:33,737 --> 00:23:37,117
You could not even skip a meal, and now you are roaming around here.

306
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:39,397
Only one meal a day at the shrine for 100 days, huh?

307
00:23:39,397 --> 00:23:42,417
- I am polite.
- What a shame to the family.

308
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:45,337
I do not get angry even when looked down on.

309
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:46,647
Be graceful.

310
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:49,557
How can you keep your head up like you are proud?

311
00:23:49,557 --> 00:23:51,647
Gosh, I am hungry.

312
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:54,257
Gosh, I cannot stand you!

313
00:24:00,027 --> 00:24:03,987
You should have died when my brother died!

314
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:06,437
Gosh, I cannot stand you!

315
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:26,827
Young Madam!

316
00:24:29,087 --> 00:24:31,187
Have you been doing well?

317
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:35,407
Ggot Nim, I was worried because you did not come for a while.

318
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,747
It was not because something happened. Right?

319
00:24:37,747 --> 00:24:41,107
It looks like my father has straightened up.

320
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:43,797
He left with our home's title deed for gambling.

321
00:24:43,797 --> 00:24:45,787
But he brought it back home and left it on the floor.

322
00:24:45,787 --> 00:24:48,127
Really?

323
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:52,427
How fortunate.

324
00:24:59,587 --> 00:25:01,587
Is it dried persimmons?

325
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:02,887
Thank you.

326
00:25:02,887 --> 00:25:07,167
You look the prettiest when you smile, Young Madam.

327
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:09,537
I will head back now.

328
00:25:09,537 --> 00:25:11,397
Yes.

329
00:25:11,397 --> 00:25:13,737
Unni, I will get going now.

330
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:32,207
Who the hell did this to my lodge?

331
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:35,137
I am sorry. A masked man showed up out of nowhere.

332
00:25:35,137 --> 00:25:36,277
Masked?

333
00:25:36,277 --> 00:25:38,997
What were you doing while that bastard wreaked this havoc?

334
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:42,767
- His speed was to be reckoned with—
- You lost him.

335
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:44,237
Could it be...

336
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:48,737
the one from seven years ago?

337
00:25:48,737 --> 00:25:49,847
I would not know.

338
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:52,347
What the hell do you even know, then?

339
00:25:52,347 --> 00:25:54,367
There was a high roller at the gambling den.

340
00:25:54,367 --> 00:25:57,667
Matters got worse because Capital Garrison's captain snuck in to catch him.

341
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:59,197
What now?

342
00:25:59,197 --> 00:26:03,087
How could you let a cheat and the captain join when you know what this table means?

343
00:26:03,087 --> 00:26:05,507
If the higher-ups find out after all this,

344
00:26:05,507 --> 00:26:08,117
are you trying to ruin all the work I have done so far?

345
00:26:08,117 --> 00:26:10,697
Please forgive me, Sir.

346
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:19,707
How dare a mere captain barge into my lodge?

347
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,557
Quite skilled at martial arts...

348
00:26:36,557 --> 00:26:38,747
What are you doing?

349
00:26:40,457 --> 00:26:42,427
And a woman, huh?

350
00:26:55,507 --> 00:27:00,547
As expected, he showed his humane side at the end.

Our in-laws allowed Jae Yi to come today.

359

She has flu symptoms, so she is to rest for a few days.

- I am sorry.
- How can you be so clumsy?

366
00:28:22,477 --> 00:28:26,717
Is that so? Be careful not to make it worse.

367

371
00:28:53,217 --> 00:28:57,257
Of course, I want to tell her to stay.

372
00:28:57,257 --> 00:29:01,907
But think about how our daughter-in-law would feel since she is without her own family.

373
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:06,147
If Jae Yi comes home too often, she would feel too sad. Right?

374

Must we account for her when she just sits still like a painting?

00:41:02,387 --> 00:41:06,627
It is a basic thing for one's clothes to be clean,

526
00:41:06,627 --> 00:41:11,047
but the sleeves of her widow's clothes are so dirty.

527
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:20,467
My second daughter-in-law has never had dust on her mourning clothes

528
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:24,127
though she has been wearing it for five years.

529
00:41:24,127 --> 00:41:27,727
I have heard much about your second daughter-in-law.

530
00:41:27,727 --> 00:41:30,897
You should bring her with you sometime.

531
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:37,927
It would just be a matter of time for her to sin with her eyes and her heart if she came out.

532
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:43,227
She has made up her mind, and her heart resides in one place,

533
00:41:43,227 --> 00:41:47,837
so how could she look elsewhere?

534
00:41:47,837 --> 00:41:50,327
What one holds onto in her heart is her will,

535
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:52,997
and what one speaks is her words,

536
00:41:52,997 --> 00:41:56,407
so all one can do is to be careful of that.

537
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:06,467
The quiet night on Woonjong Street was better...

538
00:42:07,397 --> 00:42:09,067
Gosh, Peonies Meeting?

539
00:42:09,067 --> 00:42:12,127
I only heard about it before, but their aura is no joke.

540
00:42:12,127 --> 00:42:14,867
We got to see it with our own eyes.

541
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:18,687
You were with me in Jeolla-do, so how do you know about that meeting?

542
00:42:18,687 --> 00:42:21,287
Who does not know about the Peonies Meeting in Hanyang?

543
00:42:21,287 --> 00:42:24,617
You did not know about it since you are not interested in that, Sir.

544
00:42:24,617 --> 00:42:26,007
The one who dropped the dasik before

545
00:42:26,007 --> 00:42:29,207
seemed to be the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law, who is mourning her husband's death.

546
00:42:29,207 --> 00:42:30,997
She is the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law?

547
00:42:30,997 --> 00:42:34,197
Yes. From what I hear, her looks and her personality

548
00:42:34,197 --> 00:42:37,887
are known to be graceful and classy.

549
00:42:42,747 --> 00:42:44,997
Classy...

550
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:59,707
You heard about it, right? The mistress he took in recently was a gisaeng!
(Courtesan)

551
00:42:59,707 --> 00:43:01,307
Tell me about it.

552
00:43:01,307 --> 00:43:03,677
I heard the Minister of Finance's Wife gave her some money before sending her away,

553
00:43:03,677 --> 00:43:05,417
so how could that news not spread?

554
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:11,007
It would not be strange if he brought many kids, saying they were his sons.

555
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:16,187
The wife, who is alive and well, would have a tough time enduring that.

556
00:43:16,187 --> 00:43:20,147
Do you think it is better to live as a widow than to live like that?

557
00:43:20,147 --> 00:43:23,767
If her only husband acts so trashy like that...

558
00:43:25,317 --> 00:43:28,397
Is that not so?

559
00:43:33,907 --> 00:43:39,227
Regardless of whether one is in mourning or not, the life of a woman is the same.

560
00:43:39,227 --> 00:43:44,277
Since it is not up to people for the skies to be cloudy or sunny,

561
00:43:45,227 --> 00:43:48,947
so all I want is to tidy up my lacking heart

562
00:43:48,947 --> 00:43:52,427
and not be a detriment to my family.

563
00:43:55,927 --> 00:43:58,907
The Minister of Finance's wife is here.

564
00:44:01,177 --> 00:44:03,497
Welcome.

565
00:44:05,137 --> 00:44:07,637
Have you come?

566
00:44:07,637 --> 00:44:09,817
I am a bit late.

567
00:44:09,817 --> 00:44:12,647
- Please take a seat.
- Yes.

568
00:44:14,387 --> 00:44:19,187
But what entertaining conversation were you having?

569
00:44:19,187 --> 00:44:24,337
W-Well, you have become even prettier since last time.

570
00:44:24,337 --> 00:44:27,307
No, she has always been pretty.

571
00:44:27,307 --> 00:44:30,237
Yes, she was always pretty.

572
00:44:34,387 --> 00:44:36,107
This is it.

573
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:38,197
It looks great!

574
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:41,857
I can sense the spirit of an artistic master.

575
00:44:41,857 --> 00:44:43,307
This is why it needs to be imported.

576
00:44:43,307 --> 00:44:45,187
Look at it. It is different. It is different!

577
00:44:45,187 --> 00:44:49,137
It is not imported. It is the work of a Cheongsong master potter.

578
00:44:49,137 --> 00:44:53,947
Even the Qing Dynasty is full of people lining up to buy this pottery.

579
00:44:53,947 --> 00:44:55,427
- Really?
- Yes.

580
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:59,687
I knew there was something different about this!

581
00:44:59,687 --> 00:45:05,157
It is a valuable pottery that I managed to procure through bribery.

582
00:45:05,157 --> 00:45:08,787
As expected of Pil's Merchandising!

583
00:45:08,787 --> 00:45:11,287
This is why I like you.

584
00:45:11,287 --> 00:45:13,457
Please take a seat.

585
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:25,487
But you say you want me to open the sea route to the Qing Dynasty again?

586
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:30,957
Yes, an item is to be transported through Former Qin to Beijing in three days.

587
00:45:33,257 --> 00:45:38,827
Well, all I have to do is just stamp a seal for you.

588
00:45:41,997 --> 00:45:47,717
However, you will have to compensate me generously for this.

589
00:45:47,717 --> 00:45:50,267
Of course.

590
00:45:50,977 --> 00:45:55,117
I will have this delivered to your house tomorrow.

591
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,290
Yes.

592
00:46:04,077 --> 00:46:05,827
It is so nice.

593
00:46:05,827 --> 00:46:12,337
From what I hear, your daughter-in-law is skilled at painting orchids.

594
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:14,237
What? Who?

595
00:46:14,237 --> 00:46:16,037
Me?

596
00:46:19,327 --> 00:46:22,997
It is just to the extent that she will not be an embarrassment.

597
00:46:22,997 --> 00:46:26,867
I am embarrassed because it seems like I am bragging about my daughter-in-law,

598
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:33,027
but each leaf of the orchid is vibrant, and the petals of the orchid look like they give off a scent.

599
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:36,127
It is quite classy.

600
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,260
- Gosh!
- Fascinating!

601
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,587
Since you are bragging so much about your daughter-in-law's orchid painting skills,

602
00:46:41,587 --> 00:46:43,737
I want to see it for myself once.

603
00:46:43,737 --> 00:46:45,407
No way...

604
00:46:45,407 --> 00:46:47,707
This cannot be happening.

605
00:46:50,627 --> 00:46:55,917
Since you say so, it will not be modest of me not to show you.

606
00:46:57,737 --> 00:47:00,107
Right, Daughter-in-law?

607
00:47:00,107 --> 00:47:02,597
M-Mother-in-law...

608
00:47:18,307 --> 00:47:22,077
I really hope she does not have to hold a paintbrush anywhere...

609
00:47:50,207 --> 00:47:52,827
Look at that vibrant paintstroke!

610
00:47:52,827 --> 00:47:55,077
As expected.

611
00:47:55,077 --> 00:47:58,517
As expected, it is beautiful.

612
00:48:08,787 --> 00:48:10,597
Oh, my...

613
00:48:25,617 --> 00:48:27,947
Gosh, this is...

614
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,877
This is a bit...

615
00:48:29,877 --> 00:48:33,967
It looks a bit off...

616
00:48:33,967 --> 00:48:35,017
What is that?

617
00:48:35,017 --> 00:48:37,527
I guess that's an orchid...

618
00:49:04,267 --> 00:49:08,937
I am sorry! My hand just slipped...

619
00:49:11,147 --> 00:49:13,697
Oh, no!

620
00:49:16,697 --> 00:49:18,737
I am sorry.

621
00:49:19,537 --> 00:49:22,537
I prepared a little something as a token of my apology

622
00:49:22,537 --> 00:49:24,827
for what happened today.

623
00:49:24,827 --> 00:49:28,187
Next time, make sure something like this does not happen again.

624
00:49:28,187 --> 00:49:30,697
Yes, I understand.

625
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:34,287
I am sorry.

626
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:39,977
All the clothes in Myeongdogak were colorful clothes.

627
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,597
I am sorry that I could not prepare fitting clothes for her.

628
00:49:43,597 --> 00:49:48,447
Since she is only able to wear mourning clothes, so do not worry.

629
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:56,017
Next time, I will prepare clothes you can wear.

630
00:49:56,017 --> 00:49:58,097
Let us go first.

631
00:49:58,097 --> 00:50:00,717
- How did it taste?
- I really liked it.

632
00:50:00,717 --> 00:50:02,617
We should go now.

633
00:50:02,617 --> 00:50:04,667
- Thank you.
- You have a glow.

634
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,727
Bye now.

635
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:16,567
There was no way she could paint the Four Noble Ones when she learned nothing.

636
00:50:16,567 --> 00:50:19,437
I thought it was suspicious that she was only good at painting orchids.

637
00:50:19,437 --> 00:50:21,027
Stop it.

638
00:50:21,027 --> 00:50:23,437
Maybe she is hiding something else from us.

639
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,587
Shall I go and dig around?

640
00:50:24,587 --> 00:50:25,747
What do I do?

641
00:50:25,747 --> 00:50:28,757
First, let me see if there is anything that may get caught.

642
00:50:28,757 --> 00:50:32,687
Then again, all she does is embroider and count numbers,

643
00:50:32,687 --> 00:50:35,007
so what more could she deceive us about?

644
00:50:37,927 --> 00:50:40,397
What could a widow do when she cannot even jump the walls?

645
00:50:40,397 --> 00:50:44,127
You are so noisy. You are making me even more upset.

646
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:46,277
I probably can jump the walls way better than you.

647
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:50,157
- My Lady, this is not the time to say that!
- Right, right.

648
00:50:50,157 --> 00:50:52,737
It is because you are too nice, Mom.

649
00:50:52,737 --> 00:50:57,717
You should have cut her off when she brought in some nobody.

650
00:50:58,967 --> 00:51:03,267
How dare someone like her act like she is a noblewoman and paints orchids?

651
00:51:03,267 --> 00:51:05,917
You cannot go easy on her.

652
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:09,307
I am sorry you have to go through this because of me.

653
00:51:09,307 --> 00:51:14,907
No, it is my fault for painting orchids so well.

654
00:51:14,907 --> 00:51:17,197
It is really heavy, right?

655
00:51:17,817 --> 00:51:20,177
This will not do.

656
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:25,237
Mother, I deserve to die for deceiving you and embarrassing you.

657
00:51:25,237 --> 00:51:29,127
It is said that even if one's mother-in-law hits or rebukes you,

658
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,197
you should accept it wholeheartedly.

659
00:51:31,197 --> 00:51:34,997
So, as much as you care about me, for the next five days, no...

660
00:51:35,627 --> 00:51:39,067
I will not eat for 10 days and take care of the family shrine.

661
00:51:39,067 --> 00:51:42,547
My Lady, you cannot do this! You will really die like that!

662
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:46,487
She will not ease up if I do not go this far. She is furious this time.

663
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:53,177
Do not leave the family shrine until I give you the word.

664
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:55,057
Okay.

665
00:52:07,827 --> 00:52:10,207
It was really heavy. Right?

666
00:52:10,207 --> 00:52:12,397
- Goodness...
- It is all right.

667
00:52:12,397 --> 00:52:15,747
But will you really not eat?

668
00:52:15,747 --> 00:52:17,887
I need to.

669
00:52:22,177 --> 00:52:24,117
Let us go.

670
00:52:25,337 --> 00:52:29,017
Give me back my legs, give me back my legs.

671
00:52:46,167 --> 00:52:49,447
- You are home late.
- The work was dismissed late.

672
00:52:49,477 --> 00:52:52,367
You must be tired. Please go in and rest.

673
00:52:52,367 --> 00:52:54,187
Thank you.

674
00:52:54,887 --> 00:52:58,497
So, what did you learn in school today?

675
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:15,517
I am back.

676
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:22,187
Sir, it is me, Bi Chan.

677
00:53:24,497 --> 00:53:26,027
What are you doing here?

678
00:53:26,027 --> 00:53:30,387
What do you mean? I was going around doing what you told me to do, Sir.

679
00:53:30,387 --> 00:53:35,207
But then I saw someone with unusually great proportions and thought it was you,

680
00:53:35,207 --> 00:53:37,197
so I followed you.

681
00:53:39,177 --> 00:53:42,357
But whose house is this?

682
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:47,137
Did you look into what I told you about?

683
00:53:47,137 --> 00:53:49,497
The rumors about that masked person.

684
00:53:49,497 --> 00:53:52,577
Gosh, it is incredible.

685
00:53:54,587 --> 00:54:00,957
On a night filled with moonlight, a masked person appears out of nowhere...

686
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,427
Help us!

687
00:54:03,427 --> 00:54:05,727
and leaves food at a household starving for three days!

688
00:54:05,727 --> 00:54:07,757
Shi Woo...

689
00:54:07,757 --> 00:54:10,967
Gosh, it is rice!

690
00:54:10,967 --> 00:54:13,257
We can eat now!

691
00:54:13,257 --> 00:54:17,697
For a slave who was beaten up, he leaves medicine or takes him to a physician.

692
00:54:17,697 --> 00:54:23,277
He is like the wind, faster than light, and runs across roofs like a flying squirrel!

693
00:54:35,767 --> 00:54:37,937
They are like a legendary Midam.

694
00:54:37,937 --> 00:54:39,257
A legendary Midam?

695
00:54:39,257 --> 00:54:41,137
That is just a nickname I came up with.

696
00:54:41,137 --> 00:54:44,547
The moment that the people are in distress and need help,
