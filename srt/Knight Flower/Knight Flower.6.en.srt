1
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:57,892
My Lady!

2
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:09,882
Daughter-in-law, are you keeping watch all night here?

3
00:01:09,882 --> 00:01:11,382
My Lady!

4
00:01:11,382 --> 00:01:13,622
Hurry!

5
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:20,932
No! No, no!

6
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:27,092
Is it all right if I come in for a moment?

7
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,642
W-What is the matter?

8
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:42,912
I beg your pardon, Father. There was a rat in the shrine.

9
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,292
I will light the candles again.

10
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:46,172
You must have been startled.

11
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,972
You did not get hurt anywhere?

12
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:49,572
I am fine.

13
00:01:49,572 --> 00:01:51,902
By the way, what brings you here at this hour?

14
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:54,042
The light was still on inside the shrine,

15
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:56,702
so I came for a moment to check.

16
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:59,272
- Oh, my, Father!
- D-Daugther-in-law!

17
00:01:59,272 --> 00:02:01,222
I am okay.

18
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:02,852
I got dizzy for a moment.

19
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:05,472
It must be because you sit inside the shrine all day.

20
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:08,862
Would you like to take a short walk and get some air?

21
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,992
Yes, Father.

22
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:25,722
[Knight Flower - Episode 6: While you were sleeping]

23
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:28,302
Is it not too hard on you?

24
00:02:28,302 --> 00:02:30,232
Not at all.

25
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:33,822
How can I dare say it is hard on me?

26
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:36,352
You and Mother take care of me,

27
00:02:36,352 --> 00:02:39,302
so I am always thankful.

28
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:46,082
Thank you for thinking that.

29
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,482
The days have gotten warmer,

30
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:51,422
but the coldness still rises from the ground at night.

31
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:54,782
So go down and sleep comfortably.

32
00:02:55,582 --> 00:02:59,662
Father, I always feel bad toward you.

33
00:02:59,662 --> 00:03:02,782
You took me in when I had no kin, and

34
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:06,902
you let me visit the temple for my brother when necessary.

35
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:11,002
One day, if my brother comes back,

36
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:15,592
everything would be thanks to your merciful grace.

37
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:19,462
Are you still waiting for your brother?

38
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:25,832
I am cautious, for this might be hurtful to you,

39
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:29,732
but should you not let go of him now?

40
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:33,092
Fifteen years have passed now.

41
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:36,062
I am sure...

42
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:39,882
Brother is alive.

43
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:44,072
If something had happened to my brother,

44
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:49,222
I will find out what it is for sure, whatever it is.

45
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:54,082
I apologize. I spoke needlessly about myself and

46
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:57,572
made you upset, Father.

47
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:00,322
Not at all.

48
00:04:00,322 --> 00:04:05,072
I will also remember to look into your brother's whereabouts.

49
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:19,462
Find the man named Cho Seong Hoo by all means and

50
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:22,162
get rid of him without leaving any trace.

51
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,822
Yes.

52
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:48,712
Sir!

53
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:51,922
Did you find anything?

54
00:04:51,922 --> 00:04:56,952
I looked at the flowers owned by pharmacies at Woonjong Street and Hwayeon Merchandising,

55
00:04:56,952 --> 00:04:58,982
but none of them had the flower.

56
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:00,422
Really?

57
00:05:00,422 --> 00:05:04,942
Did the corpse's mouth really smell like a flower?

58
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:07,202
It was the same scent, for sure.

59
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:09,912
Much like the scent of wisteria flowers.

60
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:11,552
Gosh.

61
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:17,342
Sir, they all died!

62
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:23,932
This is...

63
00:05:24,842 --> 00:05:26,602
poison.

64
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:32,452
But the Finance Minister's cause of death was a head trauma. Right?

65
00:05:32,452 --> 00:05:36,832
Since we found out this is a poison, we cannot rule out death by poison.

66
00:05:36,832 --> 00:05:42,742
- Why was this dangerous poison inside the fillet?
- So this means

67
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,992
the man named Yong Deok was not the real culprit.

68
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:50,082
How on Earth would he have fed this to the Finance Minister?

69
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:53,942
I told you, right? I said there must be a heartbreaking story

70
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:58,442
behind this case of a man sacrificing his life for his love!

71
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:03,512
Did you not say someone saw him meeting a woman in a mourning dress?

72
00:06:03,512 --> 00:06:05,942
I heard he fell in love with some family's widow.

73
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:08,562
That ring is mine.

74
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,332
Madam, please look at it closely!

75
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:14,362
Probably not.

76
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:16,232
You think so, too, Sir?

77
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:17,652
This must be a love—

78
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:22,032
Bi Chan, find out when and how the Finance Minister's drawing ended up in his house.

79
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:23,702
Yes!

80
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,312
If that man is not the culprit,

81
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:32,912
then who is?

82
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:53,262
Was Madam Baek sent off safely?

83
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:55,212
- She said she would not go.
- Wait, why?

84
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:56,802
Because of her servant, Yong Deok.

85
00:06:56,802 --> 00:07:00,102
I was scolded by Mother, could not sleep, and almost got caught by Father.

86
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:02,942
I spent all night awake for her, but what is this now?

87
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:05,892
The heavenly maiden was given her wings, and now she wants to take the lumberjack, too.
(Reference to Korean folklore)

88
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:11,045
But the lumberjack is locked behind bars, so what do I do?

89
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:14,162
This is tiring, Yeon Seon.

90
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:17,952
For now, get some sleep until Madam summons you.

91
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:22,952
Young Madam, Madam wants to see you.

92
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:37,942
What do you plan to do?

93
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:40,162
Sorry?

94
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:43,722
The Minister of General Affairs' daughter-in-law stopped eating.

95
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:47,462
So you cannot be doing nothing. Right?

96
00:07:53,412 --> 00:07:57,352
I intend to visit the Finance Minister's wife with some milk porridge.

97
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,722
The Finance Minister's wife?

98
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:01,102
No matter how small, good deeds cannot fail to produce good results.

99
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:03,432
Evil deeds, no matter how small, cannot fail to produce harmful results.

100
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:05,482
That is what you always told me, Mother.

101
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:08,072
So, doing good deeds instead of being attached to

102
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:11,802
such trivial matter seems better.

103
00:08:11,802 --> 00:08:16,622
I will go and console Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong, who must be devastated.

104
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:23,752
I did not teach you in vain.

105
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:28,682
I will console her sincerely and keep her company.

106
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:36,452
After visiting the Finance Minister's home, I need to go see Madam Baek as well. Let us hurry.

107
00:08:36,452 --> 00:08:38,142
Yes!

108
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:52,352
Are all these appeals requesting the immediate execution of the slave who killed the Finance Minister?

109
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:57,962
Since our country was founded, was there ever a case where an official was murdered by his slave?

110
00:08:57,962 --> 00:09:01,152
If you do not take care of this case sternly,

111
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:03,672
in addition to the Royal Court's authority plummeting to the ground,

112
00:09:03,672 --> 00:09:07,442
the Royal Family could be subject to danger as well.

113
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:11,182
I heard it was the result of a simple burglary.

114
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:15,142
So, would it really threaten the Royal Court and the Royal Family?

115
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:17,942
If children were to disrespect their parents, subjects the king,

116
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:21,162
and slaves their masters in this world,

117
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:24,802
what exactly do you consider dangerous, Your Majesty?

118
00:09:24,802 --> 00:09:29,332
Oh, I did not think this was such a grave matter.

119
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:32,662
It looks like he must be beheaded, as you said, Left State Minister.

120
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:37,272
By the way, it would be difficult for now, would it not?

121
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:42,562
I reckon I can allow it only after one is tried three times by the court, regardless of his class.

122
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:45,202
What process are you referring to?

123
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:48,302
His crime is on the same level as treason.

124
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:51,042
Truly, there would be no difficulty.

125
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:53,712
It is only a slave getting beheaded.

126
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:55,422
Do as you say, Left State Minister.

127
00:09:55,422 --> 00:10:00,352
In that case, he will be punished so, Your Majesty.

128
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:11,972
Who am I for you to visit, even bringing porridge?

129
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:14,282
I came because I was worried.

130
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:17,872
Even though you do not have an appetite, you need to eat.

131
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:21,282
How can a sinner who let her husband pass before her

132
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:24,582
have the right to put food in her mouth?

133
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:28,972
I am thankful for your consideration, but I have no appetite right now.

134
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:32,632
But you do have to eat it later. All right?

135
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:48,512
Are you really going to reside by his grave?

136
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:54,702
There are many eyes watching, so I cannot help but go.

137
00:10:54,702 --> 00:10:58,412
You have affairs of your household to take care of and duties at the Peonies Club, so if you go like this—

138
00:10:58,412 --> 00:11:03,702
I have done many things so far.

139
00:11:03,702 --> 00:11:07,162
So, it would be okay to rest now. Right?

140
00:11:07,162 --> 00:11:09,852
Were you exhausted?

141
00:11:11,022 --> 00:11:13,662
I was indeed exhausted,

142
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:16,582
sometimes sorrowful,

143
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:19,432
and pitiful as well.

144
00:11:22,552 --> 00:11:26,472
But it was also fun sometimes.

145
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:30,392
Could I dare to ask you a question?

146
00:11:30,392 --> 00:11:32,992
Go ahead and ask.

147
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:36,922
Is it more unfortunate for you to have

148
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:41,132
the Finance Minister end up that way, Honorable Lady?

149
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:49,592
Please lower your voice.

150
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:52,102
What if someone hears you?

151
00:11:58,122 --> 00:12:03,962
I knew you were an honest person from the beginning,

152
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:09,602
but I did not think you would ask me this quickly.

153
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:12,002
I apologize.

154
00:12:12,992 --> 00:12:17,062
Am I supposed to be more unfortunate or

155
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:20,502
am I not supposed to be?

156
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:25,372
What is your opinion?

157
00:12:25,372 --> 00:12:28,202
How can I dare think such a thing?

158
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:34,532
People talk about you and me as often as they eat their snacks.

159
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:40,682
The widow remaining faithful for life to a husband she has not even met

160
00:12:40,682 --> 00:12:45,462
and Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong, who takes care of her crappy husband.

161
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:50,842
Who do you think has it better?

162
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:57,482
I would live on as myself by any means.

163
00:12:58,702 --> 00:13:07,482
I should have been closer to you sooner.

164
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:10,972
I will visit and keep you company more often from now on.

165
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:13,402
Please do not come.

166
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:22,232
I am leaving to reside by the grave, so it will be hard to treat my guests properly.

167
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:24,152
That is...

168
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:28,142
what the traditions would say is proper.

169
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:30,742
Yes.

170
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:50,822
My Lady, you were seriously awkward just now.

171
00:13:50,822 --> 00:13:53,112
I know it, too.

172
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:06,842
I must head to Myeongdogak after visiting the Finance Minister's home.

173
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:08,092
Why to Myeongdogak?

174
00:14:08,092 --> 00:14:11,602
We must find substantial evidence that man Yong Deok is not the culprit!

175
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:14,352
Why go to Myeongdogak when the evidence is not like a pendant?

176
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:16,692
If you happen to find the evidence, he is not the culprit!

177
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:18,752
Who are you talking to right now?

178
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:20,842
- Let us hurry along.
- Yes.

179
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:24,502
I am going to go there, so make sure to be there!

180
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:27,442
Be where?

181
00:14:27,442 --> 00:14:29,815
[Myeongdogak]

182
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,242
I will meet her and try to convince her.

183
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:43,602
Where is she right now?

184
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:46,402
It is the last room on the left side.

185
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:48,852
If she is doing that because of her lover,

186
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:53,272
it would be better not to tell her he was arrested.

187
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:59,602
I received word he was already sentenced to beheading.

188
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:01,582
Already?

189
00:15:01,582 --> 00:15:04,252
Because it is a grave crime of murdering the Finance Minister,

190
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:07,852
he might be executed as soon as tomorrow.

191
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:10,822
I believe it will be difficult to get him out.

192
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:17,942
Yeon Seon, go buy the sticky rice cake Mother likes.

193
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:19,552
Yes.

194
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:31,622
What are you going to tell me, even making Yeon Seon leave?

195
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:33,672
That is not it.

196
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:35,692
The captain will be coming here.

197
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:39,822
I am going to meet him when he arrives, so please set up a room.

198
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:42,472
Yes.

199
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:56,712
I found a way for you to live, but I heard you refused to leave.

200
00:15:56,712 --> 00:16:00,772
Do you know me?

201
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:02,782
I do not.

202
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:09,752
How did you know to save me, then?

203
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:13,302
I am only doing small deeds as I encounter them.

204
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:16,392
So, you do not need to place much meaning.

205
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:19,522
First of all,

206
00:16:19,522 --> 00:16:22,402
find a way for you to live, Madam.

207
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:30,032
Is running away a way for me to live?

208
00:16:30,862 --> 00:16:34,052
Hiding in a place where no one knows in order to prolong my life.

209
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:36,532
Is that really living?

210
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:41,092
If I leave my house, who can I live as?

211
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:43,962
Will I have a face?

212
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:47,222
Will I have a name?

213
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:51,612
It is not like I do not understand you,

214
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:54,882
but are you saying you will give up your life?

215
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:57,632
I was meant to die anyway.

216
00:16:57,632 --> 00:16:59,592
A widow who devoured her husband

217
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:03,722
wanted to live on normally like other people, dreaming in vain.

218
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:07,022
So, I must accept the consequences.

219
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:09,262
How is anyone in this world meant to die?

220
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:12,462
What on Earth did we do wrong to deserve death?

221
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:15,612
Say, did we kill our husbands?

222
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:18,562
Are you also a widow?

223
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:26,012
So, what are you going to do?

224
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:33,652
I have a request.

225
00:17:35,352 --> 00:17:39,612
If you would grant this request, I would not care even if I die right now.

226
00:17:39,612 --> 00:17:44,912
There is a man called Yong Deok in the Finance Minister's household.

227
00:17:48,362 --> 00:17:51,922
Please deliver this ring to him.

228
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:57,592
My mother-in-law is already aware of this matter anyway.

229
00:17:57,592 --> 00:18:01,752
So, he might not be all right, either.

230
00:18:01,752 --> 00:18:05,752
Please tell him I will live on.

231
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:12,812
So, tell him to live the rest of his life happily to its end, please.

232
00:18:13,662 --> 00:18:18,272
If you show him that, he will understand, too.

233
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:24,922
The ring that the servant named Yong Deok held.

234
00:18:24,922 --> 00:18:27,352
Are you sure it is the Finance Minister's?

235
00:18:27,352 --> 00:18:30,382
You visited out of nowhere, and

236
00:18:30,382 --> 00:18:34,622
now you are asking such a ridiculous question.

237
00:18:34,622 --> 00:18:38,762
I am asking because I need substantial evidence to prove he is guilty.

238
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:40,992
So, please answer.

239
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:48,022
Was he not already determined the culprit by the Criminal Arresting Agency?

240
00:18:50,352 --> 00:18:56,162
There is not much I, a woman, can say in addition.

241
00:18:57,572 --> 00:19:03,672
But how can a servant do such a cruel thing to his master?

242
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:07,432
Are you not able to comprehend my feelings of

243
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:13,282
resentment and devastation, Sir Captain?

244
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:15,502
I apologize.

245
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:22,672
I trust you will resolve this matter wisely, Captain.

246
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:27,762
His Excellency's resentful spirit should be consoled,

247
00:19:27,762 --> 00:19:31,742
even if it will be only a little bit, does it not?

248
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:34,122
I will do that.

249
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:45,562
Do you mind...

250
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:53,052
telling me the last thing His Excellency ate the night he passed away?

251
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:56,742
For example,

252
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:59,962
the tea he drank before going to bed.

253
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:03,772
I am not sure.

254
00:20:03,772 --> 00:20:07,132
Just like any other days...

255
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:11,772
Your Excellency, I will leave you jariggi.
(Bedside water)

256
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:25,532
Who prepared his jariggi?

257
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:30,812
I prepared and gave it to him myself.

258
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:37,442
Understood. I will come to visit you again.

259
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:46,702
I won't see you off from here.

260
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:06,882
[The Cloud Dream of the Nine]

261
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,092
[The Cloud Dream of the Nine]

262
00:21:22,462 --> 00:21:25,162
Say, by the way,

263
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:28,712
did Yeon Seon that girl not come today?

264
00:21:28,712 --> 00:21:31,922
No, she has not come yet today.

265
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:35,002
But why are you looking for her?

266
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,232
Oh, it is nothing.

267
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:46,182
I was just going to ask her for a transcription.

268
00:22:07,252 --> 00:22:11,262
Why did I hide just now?

269
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:29,962
Whoa!

270
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:31,652
Gosh, you surprised me.

271
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:33,622
Where is Young Master?

272
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:35,632
Is he inside?

273
00:22:35,632 --> 00:22:37,682
No, I came alone.

274
00:22:37,682 --> 00:22:39,312
Really?

275
00:22:39,312 --> 00:22:41,522
Did you really come alone?

276
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:43,792
I absolutely cannot tell you.

277
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:46,282
So, please go about your business.

278
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,852
Look me in the eye and speak.

279
00:22:48,852 --> 00:22:52,842
I hate men who lie the most in the world.

280
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:04,772
Follow me if you think I am lying!

281
00:23:04,772 --> 00:23:06,802
Hey!

282
00:23:24,692 --> 00:23:26,682
I see you often these days, Sir.

283
00:23:26,682 --> 00:23:28,162
Oh, the thing is...

284
00:23:28,162 --> 00:23:32,792
People would think you are frequenting Myeongdogak to meet your lover.

285
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:36,522
A lover? What a crude thing to say!

286
00:23:36,522 --> 00:23:38,992
- I am not.
- It was a joke.

287
00:23:38,992 --> 00:23:40,822
I was joking, but you are getting serious.

288
00:23:40,822 --> 00:23:44,402
One might believe the joke to be true, after all.

289
00:23:45,142 --> 00:23:50,142
Grand Merchant, do you not think you went too far? I am a captain of this country, after all.

290
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:52,092
I apologize.

291
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:56,742
Nevertheless, what business are you here for?

292
00:23:57,722 --> 00:23:59,202
I came to meet her.

293
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:01,722
- Your lover?
- Grand Merchant!

294
00:24:02,452 --> 00:24:04,682
Please come inside.

295
00:24:11,812 --> 00:24:15,682
My, what on Earth are you here for?

296
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:20,312
Looks like you did not know I would be here.

297
00:24:20,312 --> 00:24:22,502
I stay inside Myeongdogak all day.

298
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,842
How would I know what you do and where you are?

299
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:30,722
We will just let that go.

300
00:24:32,562 --> 00:24:35,422
Please get straight to the point.

301
00:24:35,422 --> 00:24:40,372
It is not a fitting question to ask someone who was in here all day.

302
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:43,382
But I hope you will answer me.

303
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,612
What is his problem? This is scary.

304
00:24:45,612 --> 00:24:48,902
Could he have come to check who I am?

305
00:24:48,902 --> 00:24:52,192
I thought you were coming to talk about the culprit!

306
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:54,162
Could you be...

307
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:59,592
Could you be Yong Deok's lover?

308
00:24:59,592 --> 00:25:02,232
No, there is no way he would know.

309
00:25:02,232 --> 00:25:06,002
You seem to know a man named Yong Deok.

310
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:16,452
Did you know that man has a lover?

311
00:25:16,452 --> 00:25:20,252
Did you come, knowing everything already?

312
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,522
- So, that's—
- He was only trying to protect his secret lover.

313
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:26,872
He is not the culprit.

314
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:29,272
I can testify to that.

315
00:25:29,272 --> 00:25:31,712
What in the world!
(He uses a word that describes a good world without any darkness or secrets)

316
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:35,222
How and why on Earth could such a thing happen?

317
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:38,362
I mean, it is against the customs, but getting this mad...

318
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:41,432
It is still not a crime punishable by death, is it?

319
00:25:41,432 --> 00:25:45,952
Though against the customs, just wear the mask at night, why go to Seonghwangdang?
(Place where a village's patron is worshipped)

320
00:25:45,952 --> 00:25:48,662
It was at the watermill.

321
00:25:51,532 --> 00:25:52,962
What?

322
00:25:52,962 --> 00:25:54,592
At the watermill?

323
00:25:54,592 --> 00:25:57,312
I saw them together at the watermill.

324
00:25:57,312 --> 00:25:59,642
Not at the Seonghwangdang.

325
00:26:00,652 --> 00:26:02,632
What do you mean, "them"?

326
00:26:02,632 --> 00:26:07,682
The night I was saving the children with you, I saw him meeting his lover.

327
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:16,482
His lover's circumstances do not allow her to identify herself—

328
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:18,382
I am glad.

329
00:26:19,932 --> 00:26:23,492
What are you glad about?

330
00:26:24,732 --> 00:26:28,122
It looks like my business here is a success, so I will leave now.

331
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:31,152
Wait! How can you just leave like this?

332
00:26:36,222 --> 00:26:39,342
Instead of a lover who cannot identify herself,

333
00:26:39,342 --> 00:26:44,472
are you going to take off your mask and be a witness?

334
00:26:48,652 --> 00:26:51,312
At this point, there is nothing you can do.

335
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:53,832
If someone else is the real culprit, I will investigate and

336
00:26:53,832 --> 00:26:56,432
look for the real culprit.

337
00:26:58,382 --> 00:27:00,892
What if you fail to catch the real culprit?

338
00:27:00,892 --> 00:27:04,522
Does that servant have to accept an unjust death?

339
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:08,222
I am asking if you can catch the real culprit by the end of tonight!

340
00:27:22,322 --> 00:27:24,312
What in the world!

341
00:27:24,312 --> 00:27:28,812
How and why on Earth could such a thing happen?

342
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:32,902
What in the world!

343
00:27:41,212 --> 00:27:43,662
Here is your share for this month.

344
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:51,022
Even during the mourning period, you clearly remember each and every date,

345
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:53,492
which is seriously surprising.

346
00:27:53,492 --> 00:27:57,872
Is there anything you heard from the elder?

347
00:27:57,872 --> 00:27:59,712
About what?

348
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:00,832
The thing is...

349
00:28:00,832 --> 00:28:06,052
Are you afraid the elder will find out how the Finance Minister died?

350
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:08,252
So, why did you do such a thing?

351
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:11,832
I obtained it to use it on His Excellency in the first place.

352
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:13,412
Did you forget that?

353
00:28:13,412 --> 00:28:15,392
It was used for its intended purpose.

354
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:18,792
What did I do so wrong?

355
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:21,942
You used it for something much greater than killing the Finance Minister,

356
00:28:21,942 --> 00:28:27,122
which is why you are living comfortably in wealth right now, is it not?

357
00:28:35,592 --> 00:28:41,342
A captain of the Capital Garrison is taking an interest in this matter.

358
00:28:41,342 --> 00:28:43,372
By chance,

359
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:47,012
is the captain's name Park Su Ho?

360
00:28:48,632 --> 00:28:51,512
Is it someone you know as well?

361
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:56,712
If it was him, things would get quite troublesome.

362
00:28:56,712 --> 00:29:01,172
A mere captain will not be able to catch me.

363
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:06,992
Even the one lying in his grave would not know what killed him.

364
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:16,192
The only thing is that he better not unnecessarily poke around and upset the elder.

365
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:18,982
I will take care of everything on my end.

366
00:29:18,982 --> 00:29:25,032
However, you will have to be more careful from now on, Sister.

367
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:29,002
"Sister," you say?

368
00:29:30,992 --> 00:29:34,792
They said lowly blood shows itself.

369
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:39,622
I treated you like a human a few times, and

370
00:29:39,622 --> 00:29:44,552
now, do you really think you are my younger brother or something?

371
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:49,382
Would it not be problematic for you to treat me like this?

372
00:29:49,382 --> 00:29:55,272
If I am to be troubled, do you reckon you will be unharmed?

373
00:29:55,902 --> 00:29:59,952
I will take care of this matter neatly, so you will not have a thing

374
00:29:59,952 --> 00:30:03,462
to worry about, Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong.

375
00:30:39,562 --> 00:30:41,542
How could you come so late?

376
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:43,812
It is already almost time for supper.

377
00:30:43,812 --> 00:30:46,052
Were you really at the Finance Minister's house all this time?

378
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,752
Please forgive me, Mother.

379
00:30:47,752 --> 00:30:50,802
On the way back from consoling Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong...

380
00:30:56,212 --> 00:31:01,362
I heard my husband always brought this snack for you whenever he visited Woonjong Street.

381
00:31:01,362 --> 00:31:04,042
I could not just pass by since I was already there.

382
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:07,952
Have you no fear walking around Woonjong Street in broad daylight?

383
00:31:07,952 --> 00:31:11,132
Go kneel at the shrine until I tell you to stop.

384
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:13,102
Yes, Mother.

385
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:31,172
My Jeong would buy and bring home for me...

386
00:31:31,842 --> 00:31:36,242
his favorite sticky rice cake every time.

387
00:31:38,082 --> 00:31:41,652
Oh, my. Sticky rice cakes!

388
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:47,632
How much is this?

389
00:31:47,632 --> 00:31:50,602
They are 10 for five poon.
(1 nyang = 100 poon)

390
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:53,502
Good! Give me 20.

391
00:31:53,502 --> 00:31:55,492
Never mind, give me 30.

392
00:31:55,492 --> 00:31:56,892
Goodness, yes!

393
00:31:56,892 --> 00:32:00,012
It has been a while since I had sticky rice cake.

394
00:32:06,012 --> 00:32:08,882
Where do most women gather around here?

395
00:32:08,882 --> 00:32:11,292
The place where most women gather would have to be

396
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:16,532
[Durae Rice Cake]
Myeongdogak at the end of Woonjong Street over there.

397
00:32:19,082 --> 00:32:20,632
I said I was fine!

398
00:32:20,632 --> 00:32:21,862
Do not be like that, now!

399
00:32:21,862 --> 00:32:23,962
Myeongdogak?

400
00:32:35,592 --> 00:32:37,462
Madam is so mean.

401
00:32:37,462 --> 00:32:39,732
We bought it to give to her.

402
00:32:40,362 --> 00:32:44,802
I am the one in the wrong, so how could I blame Mother?

403
00:32:44,802 --> 00:32:48,172
I mean, it is not like anyone is listening, so why—

404
00:32:50,212 --> 00:32:52,042
Yeon Seon.

405
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:58,992
At least my mother-in-law does not lock me up in the shed to die.

406
00:32:58,992 --> 00:33:02,132
Also, if I really think about it,

407
00:33:02,132 --> 00:33:04,652
nothing Mother said was wrong.

408
00:33:04,652 --> 00:33:08,232
At this rate, you will really receive a memorial gate.

409
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:17,652
I will go down and bring back something.

410
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:32,272
I thought I should end my life when I lost my husband.

411
00:33:32,272 --> 00:33:34,802
I heard that was the natural thing to do

412
00:33:34,802 --> 00:33:37,082
and that was what she wanted.

413
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,422
One day, it was a silver dagger.

414
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:43,212
And another day, silk fabric was brought to me...

415
00:33:43,212 --> 00:33:45,312
every morning.

416
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:50,982
However, it was difficult to end my life that easily.

417
00:33:52,122 --> 00:33:54,202
So, you should find a way to live.

418
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:58,792
Should you not look for a way for you to live?

419
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:03,042
I will help you.

420
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:16,245
[Seok Jeong Ji]

421
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:18,982
I am asking only because I am really curious.

422
00:34:18,982 --> 00:34:24,452
Do you not like me looking for a way to live, Husband?

423
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:29,132
By chance, will you be happy only if I follow you to death?

424
00:34:30,222 --> 00:34:34,552
Living instead of dying.

425
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:40,442
For now, I will first save someone's life.

426
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:03,722
- Where were you—
- Sir, you really need to thank me.

427
00:35:03,722 --> 00:35:09,072
I ran a full round around the city in your place, Sir.

428
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:12,362
How could you talk like that when you ran away in the middle of work!

429
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:16,272
Then, what could I do when Lady Yi Kyeong was searching for you fervently?

430
00:35:17,102 --> 00:35:19,242
Good job.

431
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:23,702
Did I just get praised?

432
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:27,882
- Bi Chan.
- Yes?

433
00:35:27,882 --> 00:35:32,152
Who do you think killed the Finance Minister?

434
00:35:32,982 --> 00:35:36,072
It is probably faster to find people who have no grudges.

435
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:42,202
Then, who do you think had access to the Finance Minister's drawing and could kill him with that poison?

436
00:35:43,062 --> 00:35:44,862
Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong?

437
00:35:46,162 --> 00:35:47,842
Gosh, what did I just say?

438
00:35:47,842 --> 00:35:50,302
How dare I say that about the relative of the Queen Dowager?

439
00:35:50,302 --> 00:35:55,112
In any case, it does not seem like it will be easy to catch the real culprit.

440
00:35:55,732 --> 00:36:00,912
Then, are you saying that servants should die unfairly if we cannot find the real culprit?

441
00:36:00,912 --> 00:36:04,652
I am asking if you are able to catch the culprit by tonight!

442
00:36:05,402 --> 00:36:08,302
If she is that impatient...

443
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:13,232
Bi Chan, go immediately to Myeongdogak and track their movement.

444
00:36:13,232 --> 00:36:15,902
Why do you want me to watch Myeongdogak instead of Pil's Lodge?

445
00:36:15,902 --> 00:36:18,822
- It is an urgent matter, so hurry!
- Yes, Sir!

446
00:36:25,862 --> 00:36:27,462
Will it be all right?

447
00:36:27,462 --> 00:36:30,822
It is not like we are breaking down the prison, so do not worry.

448
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,572
Still, it is the Criminal Arresting Agency.

449
00:36:32,572 --> 00:36:35,912
The beheading has already been decided. We have no more time to waste.

450
00:36:35,912 --> 00:36:37,632
And the drug?

451
00:36:45,802 --> 00:36:47,152
It will work for sure. Right?

452
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:49,602
It is a drug with proven efficacy.

453
00:36:49,602 --> 00:36:52,312
I also hired a physician.

454
00:36:53,102 --> 00:36:56,982
But will you go dressed like that?

455
00:36:58,632 --> 00:37:00,432
Sir!

456
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:06,592
The Grand Merchant of Myeongdogak just came out with a woman covering her face

457
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:08,422
and went toward the Criminal Arresting Agency.

458
00:37:08,422 --> 00:37:11,572
- Are you sure they are headed to the Criminal Arresting Agency?
- Yes.

459
00:37:11,572 --> 00:37:14,822
I will go to the Criminal Arresting Agency. Go back to Myeongdogak.

460
00:37:14,822 --> 00:37:18,222
- Pardon?
- Let me know immediately if there are any other movements.

461
00:37:24,765 --> 00:37:31,275
[Criminal Arresting Agency]

462
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:40,242
Grand Merchant.

463
00:37:40,242 --> 00:37:42,632
Have you been well?

464
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:46,332
I came because I have a small favor to ask.

465
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:48,112
Like what?

466
00:37:49,632 --> 00:37:53,202
Is there a man named Yong Deok who was brought in today?

467
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:57,842
Let me just talk with him for a moment.

468
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:01,142
His elderly mother is sick and is close to death.

469
00:38:01,142 --> 00:38:04,172
Should I not at least let him know?

470
00:38:04,172 --> 00:38:07,872
It is suspicious how she is covering her face.

471
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:11,322
Please understand, as she has a big scar on her face.

472
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:14,742
Gosh, I really should not...

473
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:23,522
- It is only for a brief moment.
- Of course.

474
00:38:34,332 --> 00:38:35,942
Who are you?

475
00:38:35,942 --> 00:38:38,762
Why are you giving me this?

476
00:38:38,762 --> 00:38:40,842
What about My Lady?

477
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,522
She is safe.

478
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:50,912
You have to do what I tell you from now on in order to meet her again.

479
00:38:54,162 --> 00:38:56,372
Take this right now.

480
00:38:56,372 --> 00:39:00,612
And do not be shocked no matter what happens.

481
00:39:00,612 --> 00:39:03,722
- Pardon?
- Are you still not done talking?

482
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:05,762
We are nearly done now.

483
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:09,442
You must take it right now, got it?

484
00:39:14,022 --> 00:39:15,362
All right, hurry up and leave.

485
00:39:15,362 --> 00:39:19,292
Who let the felon have visitors?

486
00:39:20,312 --> 00:39:21,822
Well...

487
00:39:21,822 --> 00:39:25,552
So what happened was...

488
00:39:25,552 --> 00:39:28,192
My Lady, stay here for a moment.

489
00:39:34,192 --> 00:39:35,632
It has been a while.

490
00:39:35,632 --> 00:39:37,292
Are you not the Grand Merchant?

491
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,212
What brings you here?

492
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:41,612
I will tell you outside.

493
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,742
Let us go that way for a bit.

494
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,372
Wait.

495
00:40:10,552 --> 00:40:12,272
- Take off your face covering.
- Pardon?

496
00:40:12,272 --> 00:40:15,472
I must check your face before any issues arise.

497
00:40:15,472 --> 00:40:17,392
I have a big scar on my face, so—

498
00:40:17,392 --> 00:40:20,142
Show your face right now. Right now!

499
00:40:23,192 --> 00:40:25,052
You little...

500
00:40:27,122 --> 00:40:28,872
What are you all doing?

501
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:40,662
What is this discourteous behavior toward this woman?

502
00:40:42,252 --> 00:40:43,882
Who are you?

503
00:40:52,322 --> 00:40:55,002
I am a captain of the Capital Garrison.

504
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:57,392
She is someone I know, so just let her go.

505
00:40:57,392 --> 00:41:00,402
Still, I must record who she is, at least.

506
00:41:00,402 --> 00:41:05,322
She comes to pick up needlework at the Capital Garrison, so you do not have to worry about her.

507
00:41:05,322 --> 00:41:06,812
Okay.

508
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:10,092
You should go now.

509
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:14,362
The night is late, so you head home straight.

510
00:41:14,362 --> 00:41:17,482
Yes. Thank you.

511
00:41:24,702 --> 00:41:26,592
Did Officer Kim go somewhere?

512
00:41:26,592 --> 00:41:30,892
I think he went that way for a moment because he had business to tend to.

513
00:41:32,522 --> 00:41:34,742
Then I guess it will take some time.

514
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,162
I will be leaving now, then. Let him know that I came by.

515
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:37,872
I will be leaving now, then. Let him know that I came by.

516
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:39,432
Okay.

517
00:42:21,952 --> 00:42:25,192
What are you up to?

518
00:42:52,062 --> 00:42:54,132
Gosh, the smell...

519
00:42:54,902 --> 00:42:57,282
What is the problem?

520
00:42:57,282 --> 00:42:59,632
Save me...

521
00:42:59,632 --> 00:43:03,222
I feel like I will die like this...

522
00:43:03,222 --> 00:43:08,112
He has been throwing up and having diarrhea like a waterfall since four hours ago.

523
00:43:08,112 --> 00:43:10,892
Perhaps he has the plague!

524
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:13,062
Officer sir!

525
00:43:13,062 --> 00:43:15,312
Officer sir! Officer sir!

526
00:43:15,312 --> 00:43:17,042
Officer sir!

527
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:19,002
Officer sir!

528
00:43:28,432 --> 00:43:31,372
Gosh, that was close.

529
00:43:31,372 --> 00:43:34,042
I cannot believe he had the plague.

530
00:43:42,382 --> 00:43:44,032
Gosh.

531
00:43:51,782 --> 00:43:55,292
Goodness, seriously. Let us go quickly.

532
00:44:04,012 --> 00:44:05,862
Look!

533
00:44:07,072 --> 00:44:09,052
Are you all right?

534
00:44:12,682 --> 00:44:15,522
My Lady! My Lady!

535
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:18,532
He did not die for real. Right?

536
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:20,642
Gosh, people do not die that easily.

537
00:44:20,642 --> 00:44:22,452
Hey! Hey!

538
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:26,032
Wake up! Wake up!

539
00:44:27,222 --> 00:44:29,842
You see? He is alive.

540
00:44:39,612 --> 00:44:42,392
You should cross the line no further.

541
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:56,322
I have come this far. I cannot stop now.

542
00:45:04,562 --> 00:45:07,532
I will distract him, so take this man to safety.

543
00:45:07,532 --> 00:45:09,662
Yes, My Lady.

544
00:45:13,942 --> 00:45:15,342
Chase the body.

545
00:45:15,342 --> 00:45:17,392
Is she not our Midam?

546
00:45:17,392 --> 00:45:19,462
Hurry up and chase it!

547
00:45:27,162 --> 00:45:29,302
Have you all gone mad?

548
00:45:29,302 --> 00:45:32,102
How could you get rid of a major felon's body like that?

549
00:45:32,102 --> 00:45:35,572
I called for a physician when he collapsed after throwing up and having diarrhea all night,

550
00:45:35,572 --> 00:45:38,442
and he said he already died from the plague.

551
00:45:38,442 --> 00:45:42,482
We had no choice because we were afraid it might spread to other prisoners.

552
00:45:42,482 --> 00:45:45,932
Are you sure you were not afraid to catch it?

553
00:45:45,932 --> 00:45:47,032
I am sorry.

554
00:45:47,032 --> 00:45:52,022
Both you and I are about to lose our heads right now! Is that the issue?

555
00:45:52,022 --> 00:45:54,002
Geez!

556
00:46:03,132 --> 00:46:05,412
Stop right there!

557
00:46:09,492 --> 00:46:12,202
I told you to stop.

558
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:17,602
Stop your horse!

559
00:46:18,892 --> 00:46:21,312
Stop right now!

560
00:46:23,012 --> 00:46:25,362
Stop, Madam!

561
00:46:34,932 --> 00:46:36,592
What did you just say?

562
00:46:36,592 --> 00:46:38,282
I said you should stop.

563
00:46:38,282 --> 00:46:39,852
After that.

564
00:46:39,852 --> 00:46:42,852
I am sure I gave you multiple chances.

565
00:46:43,402 --> 00:46:47,772
As someone who does all this, are you that unaware?

566
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:51,892
This man knows exactly who I am.

567
00:46:55,832 --> 00:46:59,842
I use my sword better than my bow.

568
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:06,422
I do not know what you know, but all of it is a misunderstanding.

569
00:47:06,422 --> 00:47:08,992
You know everything incorrectly.

570
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:13,512
Must I discuss this with the Left State Minister tomorrow?

571
00:47:16,882 --> 00:47:18,462
What do you want?

572
00:47:18,462 --> 00:47:21,282
Do you know what a serious crime you are committing?

573
00:47:21,282 --> 00:47:24,322
Have you not thought about what would happen if this were to come to light?

574
00:47:24,322 --> 00:47:26,142
Two innocent lives are on the line!

575
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:28,442
What about your own life, Madam?

576
00:47:30,502 --> 00:47:35,202
Are you... worried about me right now?

577
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:39,682
It is because things have gotten complicated.

578
00:47:39,682 --> 00:47:42,352
I was coming up with a plan, but you stole the body without a plan,

579
00:47:42,352 --> 00:47:43,902
so my plan became useless.

580
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,352
And if that plan goes wrong...

581
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:50,342
All this is because you were so reckless, Madam!

582
00:47:51,462 --> 00:47:54,322
You have been much help to me.

583
00:47:54,322 --> 00:48:00,502
So, I ask you to take care of everything well according to the national law.

584
00:48:05,392 --> 00:48:07,772
Gosh, seriously!

585
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:11,722
I will see you tomorrow night at Myeongdogak.

586
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,832
Hey! Hey!

587
00:48:16,302 --> 00:48:20,752
♫ The sword you hold in your hand ♫

588
00:48:20,752 --> 00:48:25,632
♫ The moment white moonlight shines ♫

589
00:48:25,632 --> 00:48:30,142
♫ I threw all of me away, baby, I'm ready ♫

590
00:48:30,142 --> 00:48:33,442
♫ I can't be reckless, come on ♫

591
00:48:33,442 --> 00:48:35,892
♫ Come on ♫

592
00:48:35,892 --> 00:48:39,502
Hurry up and bring the body!

593
00:48:41,202 --> 00:48:42,232
It is not here!

594
00:48:42,232 --> 00:48:45,822
What do we do now! The body is not here!

595
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:48,882
♫ Baby! ♫

596
00:48:48,882 --> 00:48:54,172
♫ I don't know if the sun will come up tomorrow ♫

597
00:48:54,172 --> 00:48:59,562
♫ But I will keep on walking ♫

598
00:49:05,752 --> 00:49:09,372
Brother, is it all right if I come in?

599
00:49:11,162 --> 00:49:13,272
Come in.

600
00:49:23,882 --> 00:49:27,492
Why do you look like that from the morning?

601
00:49:31,252 --> 00:49:34,702
I have something to discuss with you urgently.

602
00:49:34,702 --> 00:49:36,762
Sit down for now.

603
00:49:40,992 --> 00:49:44,462
Someone was arrested as the murderer of the Finance Minister.

604
00:49:44,462 --> 00:49:45,892
I know. I heard he was a servant of his house.

605
00:49:45,892 --> 00:49:49,532
I heard a testimony saying that he was not the culprit.

606
00:49:49,532 --> 00:49:51,562
What do you mean?

607
00:49:51,562 --> 00:49:53,162
If he is not the real culprit,

608
00:49:53,162 --> 00:49:55,992
just tell the Criminal Arresting Agency and reinvestigate the case.

609
00:49:55,992 --> 00:50:00,442
That witness cannot reveal her identity for personal reasons.

610
00:50:00,442 --> 00:50:02,212
Who is she?

611
00:50:02,212 --> 00:50:04,042
That is...

612
00:50:04,792 --> 00:50:07,262
something I cannot tell you.

613
00:50:07,262 --> 00:50:12,252
By chance, is it the one whose identity you were so curious about?

614
00:50:13,132 --> 00:50:17,822
So? Did you come to me because you want me to pardon him?

615
00:50:17,822 --> 00:50:20,432
Or to help you catch the real culprit?

616
00:50:20,432 --> 00:50:21,892
It is not that.

617
00:50:21,892 --> 00:50:26,342
The man who was in prison last night at the Criminal Arresting Agency suddenly died.

618
00:50:26,342 --> 00:50:28,072
How did that happen?

619
00:50:28,072 --> 00:50:31,272
More importantly, the body disappeared.

620
00:50:31,272 --> 00:50:33,762
What are you saying right now?

621
00:50:33,762 --> 00:50:35,702
And why are you talking about this—

622
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:40,722
I want you to help me so the missing body does not become a problem.

623
00:50:40,722 --> 00:50:42,762
What did you say?

624
00:50:44,372 --> 00:50:47,592
Your Excellency! Left State Minister!

625
00:50:50,962 --> 00:50:52,292
What is the matter?

626
00:50:52,292 --> 00:50:55,142
I have something I must tell you.

627
00:50:55,142 --> 00:50:57,502
You know that slave who killed the Finance Minister?

628
00:50:57,502 --> 00:51:00,022
Supposedly, he caught the plague and died last night.

629
00:51:00,022 --> 00:51:04,322
A criminal who was facing beheading suddenly caught the plague?

630
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:07,722
But something more strange took place.

631
00:51:07,722 --> 00:51:09,762
The body disappeared without a trace!

632
00:51:09,762 --> 00:51:12,892
As a result, the Criminal Arresting Agency is frantic.

633
00:51:16,102 --> 00:51:18,752
- Come inside.
- Yes.

634
00:51:21,242 --> 00:51:24,672
You are paid by the government, yet you want to ignore the national law

635
00:51:24,672 --> 00:51:26,702
and are trying to decide government matters,

636
00:51:26,702 --> 00:51:28,722
because of that one person you are curious about?

637
00:51:28,722 --> 00:51:30,082
That is not the only reason.

638
00:51:30,082 --> 00:51:31,712
Though you are my family,

639
00:51:31,712 --> 00:51:34,732
do you have a good reason for asking such a

640
00:51:34,732 --> 00:51:37,332
ridiculous request of me, a servant of the court?

641
00:51:37,332 --> 00:51:41,172
Brother, the Finance Minister's case is suspicious.

642
00:51:41,172 --> 00:51:43,242
Suspicious?

643
00:51:45,062 --> 00:51:47,702
Look at this autopsy chart.

644
00:51:53,312 --> 00:51:55,372
His cause of death is trauma to the head,

645
00:51:55,372 --> 00:51:59,442
but I saw purple spots on his gums and in his mouth.

646
00:51:59,442 --> 00:52:05,272
Not only that, but I smelled a sweet floral scent coming from his mouth that I had never smelled before.

647
00:52:06,452 --> 00:52:10,042
Did you just say a sweet scent?

648
00:52:13,432 --> 00:52:17,002
This came out from the fillet of the Finance Minister's drawing.

649
00:52:17,002 --> 00:52:20,022
When this melts in water, it gives off that scent.

650
00:52:20,022 --> 00:52:22,622
- The flower petals melted?
- Yes.

651
00:52:22,622 --> 00:52:27,642
Also, the water with the melted petals seems to be poisonous.

652
00:52:29,712 --> 00:52:33,762
First, do not talk about this with anyone else.

653
00:52:33,762 --> 00:52:36,872
I will try to come up with a plan, so wait.

654
00:52:36,872 --> 00:52:38,732
Yes, Brother.

655
00:52:38,732 --> 00:52:42,072
No matter how much they looked, there was not even a trace of him.

656
00:52:42,072 --> 00:52:47,082
Someone took the body of the Finance Minister's murderer?

657
00:52:47,082 --> 00:52:48,752
But why?

658
00:52:48,752 --> 00:52:50,872
I will ask the chief to take responsibility,

659
00:52:50,872 --> 00:52:53,852
and I will make sure to resolve this.

660
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:56,842
No, no.

661
00:52:57,322 --> 00:53:02,062
Wrap this up with just a rebuke of the officers.

662
00:53:02,062 --> 00:53:03,252
Pardon?

663
00:53:03,252 --> 00:53:05,692
In any case, he was to be executed.

664
00:53:05,692 --> 00:53:08,602
So what if something happened to him?

665
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:12,092
More importantly, if the Criminal Arresting Agency lost a body,

666
00:53:12,092 --> 00:53:16,042
there will only be panic-stricken rumors spreading among the people.

667
00:53:16,632 --> 00:53:18,992
Now that I think about it, you are right.

668
00:53:18,992 --> 00:53:22,432
Then, I will wrap it up like that.

669
00:53:29,422 --> 00:53:33,692
To think they would lay their hands on the body of someone to be executed...

670
00:53:34,652 --> 00:53:39,052
I wonder who was so daring to do such a thing?

671
00:53:46,612 --> 00:53:48,672
At this rate, everyone will find out except you!

672
00:53:48,672 --> 00:53:51,292
I know I did wrong, too.

673
00:53:51,292 --> 00:53:52,612
He is a captain!

674
00:53:52,612 --> 00:53:54,822
Not just anyone, but a captain of the Capital Garrison.

675
00:53:54,822 --> 00:53:59,402
Do not worry. I will come up with a plan to fix this and shut him up.

676
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,372
Will you eliminate him without a trace or something?

677
00:54:01,372 --> 00:54:02,722
I already failed at that.

678
00:54:02,722 --> 00:54:05,372
- Did you find out his weakness?
- It could not be worse than my weakness.

679
00:54:05,372 --> 00:54:08,742
Then, how will you shut him up?

680
00:54:08,742 --> 00:54:12,492
I plan to approach him with...

681
00:54:12,492 --> 00:54:15,662
truth, faith, and pity.

682
00:54:15,662 --> 00:54:20,062
Goodness. What quality of his can you trust?

683
00:54:20,952 --> 00:54:24,682
He does not seem completely untrustworthy...

684
00:54:25,172 --> 00:54:27,262
But something is weird.

685
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:29,252
What do you mean?

686
00:54:32,082 --> 00:54:36,162
Why did he pretend not to know when he knew all along?

687
00:54:40,432 --> 00:54:42,422
And he helped me hide my face...

688
00:54:42,422 --> 00:54:44,342
Stop right there!

689
00:54:49,482 --> 00:54:50,452
He also helped me, too.

690
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:54,232
Are you, by chance, taking his side?

691
00:54:54,982 --> 00:54:58,382
"Eliminate him without a trace." It appears that the method will be the best.

692
00:54:58,382 --> 00:55:01,312
So, what are you planning to do?

693
00:55:03,162 --> 00:55:05,922
Do I look like I know what to do?

694
00:55:05,922 --> 00:55:09,962
All I was trying to do was help someone in need.

695
00:55:09,962 --> 00:55:14,592
But I got a strange feeling that something immense would come my way.

696
00:55:15,272 --> 00:55:19,102
Did I mess with something I should not have?

697
00:55:46,762 --> 00:55:48,482
Your Majesty!

698
00:55:53,602 --> 00:55:55,832
It is this scent.

699
00:55:55,832 --> 00:55:58,892
The scent that I smelled that day.

700
00:56:00,722 --> 00:56:03,932
This came from the fillet of the Finance Minister's drawing?

701
00:56:03,932 --> 00:56:05,462
Yes, Your Majesty.

702
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:09,692
It appears the Finance Minister died after drinking this.

703
00:56:12,012 --> 00:56:14,612
Back then, nobody believed me.

704
00:56:14,612 --> 00:56:16,742
Nobody listened to me.

705
00:56:16,742 --> 00:56:19,102
You must stay strong.

706
00:56:19,102 --> 00:56:21,192
Now that we finally found a clue,

707
00:56:21,192 --> 00:56:24,682
we will soon be able to catch those who were linked to this.

708
00:56:27,062 --> 00:56:30,612
Since you and your younger brother are the ones who have discovered all this,

709
00:56:30,612 --> 00:56:34,282
now, I have no choice but to meet him in person.

710
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:39,972
Also, I have one thing to ask of you.

711
00:56:39,972 --> 00:56:41,292
What is it?

712
00:56:41,292 --> 00:56:45,212
The servant who was accused of being the culprit seems to be innocent,

713
00:56:45,212 --> 00:56:50,842
so the fact that the body disappeared should be wrapped up without much noise.

714
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:52,082
You are right.

715
00:56:52,082 --> 00:56:55,462
Would they not want things to get noisy, either?

716
00:56:55,462 --> 00:56:59,992
I am sure they will move first to wrap this up with no issues.

717
00:57:03,502 --> 00:57:09,272
From now on, we will have a lot to do.

718
00:57:09,272 --> 00:57:11,532
Both you and me...

719
00:57:13,442 --> 00:57:16,002
and your younger brother.

720
00:57:42,652 --> 00:57:43,842
What is the matter now?

721
00:57:43,842 --> 00:57:46,592
What did you do with our Midam?

722
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:47,912
Where did they take the body?

723
00:57:47,912 --> 00:57:50,662
I asked what you did with Midam!

724
00:57:50,662 --> 00:57:54,282
Your Midam used a cheap trick to escape.

725
00:57:54,282 --> 00:57:57,982
There is no way our Midam used a cheap trick!

726
00:57:57,982 --> 00:58:00,642
Because of your Midam...

727
00:58:01,122 --> 00:58:05,922
I lost my horse and had to walk all the way here from there.

728
00:58:05,922 --> 00:58:09,032
Do you know how tiring that was?

729
00:58:09,762 --> 00:58:14,002
As long as our Midam is safe, I am relieved.

730
00:58:15,652 --> 00:58:18,622
Did they take the body to Myeongdogak?

731
00:58:19,382 --> 00:58:21,052
How did you know that?

732
00:58:21,052 --> 00:58:22,802
Bi Chan.

733
00:58:27,122 --> 00:58:30,652
No matter what I do from here on, if it is the right thing,

734
00:58:30,652 --> 00:58:36,092
will you keep my secrets and follow me, despite whatever risk you may face?

735
00:58:36,802 --> 00:58:39,622
Well, no matter how close friends I am with someone,

736
00:58:39,622 --> 00:58:45,592
my mother always told me not to get involved with monetary or dangerous things.

737
00:58:45,592 --> 00:58:49,102
- It is to help your Midam.
- I, Bi Chan,

738
00:58:49,102 --> 00:58:51,742
will follow you to the end...

739
00:58:55,042 --> 00:58:57,152
even to death.

740
00:58:57,932 --> 00:58:59,512
Sir.

741
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:01,942
You still have not caught the masked man?

742
00:59:01,942 --> 00:59:04,052
I am searching for him, but I have not yet—

743
00:59:04,052 --> 00:59:05,742
Last night,

744
00:59:06,382 --> 00:59:11,452
the body of the Finance Minister's murderer, who was taken to the Criminal Arresting Agency, disappeared.

745
00:59:11,452 --> 00:59:15,732
- What?
- As a result, the Criminal Arresting Agency was in chaos.

746
00:59:15,732 --> 00:59:21,302
Thankfully, the court said to wrap up the case because he was to be executed anyway.

747
00:59:21,302 --> 00:59:25,452
What do you mean the body disappeared? This is ridiculous.

748
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:29,282
First, I should find out who took the body.

749
00:59:29,282 --> 00:59:32,462
Yes, Sir. I will look into it.

750
00:59:38,092 --> 00:59:40,892
The Commander of the Criminal Arresting Agency got called into the palace

751
00:59:40,892 --> 00:59:45,692
and was greatly praised for resolving the murder case

752
00:59:45,692 --> 00:59:48,752
of the Finance Minister with no issues.

753
00:59:49,302 --> 00:59:56,192
I just cannot understand why the Criminal Arresting Agency received praise!

754
00:59:56,192 --> 01:00:01,322
How is this any different from the culprit stupidly telling people where he is?

755
01:00:01,322 --> 01:00:03,442
What exactly did the Criminal Arresting Agency do anyway?

756
01:00:03,442 --> 01:00:08,242
What did they do that they went into the palace and received praise?

757
01:00:10,702 --> 01:00:12,972
Did you hear the news?

758
01:00:12,972 --> 01:00:17,372
The second daughter-in-law of the Minister of General Affairs who is in mourning.

759
01:00:17,372 --> 01:00:20,802
Supposedly, she ran away in the middle of the night.

760
01:00:20,802 --> 01:00:25,322
You mean, how in the watermill, they...

761
01:00:26,172 --> 01:00:28,982
What about their hands? What?

762
01:00:33,462 --> 01:00:39,062
In any case, the rumors say they were caught red-handed by the Minister of General Affairs' wife.

763
01:00:39,062 --> 01:00:42,062
How could you talk of such vulgar things?

764
01:00:42,062 --> 01:00:46,062
Gosh, it is just a rumor.

765
01:00:46,062 --> 01:00:50,992
In any case, the Minister of General Affairs' family was in chaos because of that.

766
01:00:50,992 --> 01:00:56,242
Goodness, I do not think she will be showing her face at the Peonies Meeting any time soon.

767
01:00:56,242 --> 01:00:58,472
Do you know how modest my daughter-in-law is?

768
01:00:58,472 --> 01:01:01,862
How could you make her listen to such dirty talk?

769
01:01:03,492 --> 01:01:06,062
You should not listen to such things,

770
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:09,192
and go to the shrine and gather your feelings.

771
01:01:09,192 --> 01:01:11,172
Yes, Mother.

772
01:01:18,882 --> 01:01:20,562
Yes, I am coming.
[Myeongdogak]

773
01:01:20,562 --> 01:01:22,132
Hurry.

774
01:01:22,132 --> 01:01:24,282
I will see you next time.

775
01:01:24,282 --> 01:01:27,202
Yes. What are you doing?

776
01:01:47,242 --> 01:01:51,012
Is this what you want, Sir?

777
01:01:52,052 --> 01:01:55,352
I have no intention to have you die.

778
01:01:56,182 --> 01:01:59,122
But you are thinking of reporting me?

779
01:02:00,602 --> 01:02:03,612
What is this? It did not work?

780
01:02:04,902 --> 01:02:06,992
Since I will die anyway,

781
01:02:06,992 --> 01:02:10,272
I will end my life cleanly in front of you...

782
01:02:10,272 --> 01:02:12,022
You are not stopping me?

783
01:02:13,052 --> 01:02:14,992
Seriously? Say something!

784
01:02:14,992 --> 01:02:17,122
I will end my life...

785
01:02:17,852 --> 01:02:19,852
Excuse me.

786
01:02:21,692 --> 01:02:24,122
Dying is your choice,

787
01:02:24,122 --> 01:02:27,542
but someone dying in front of me is a different matter.

788
01:02:30,802 --> 01:02:33,532
Then, what how about this?

789
01:02:37,292 --> 01:02:40,082
Do you think I will not be able to do it?

790
01:02:40,852 --> 01:02:43,512
I had no intention to die today,

791
01:02:43,512 --> 01:02:45,702
but it cannot be helped.

792
01:02:48,312 --> 01:02:50,162
What is the reason?

793
01:02:50,162 --> 01:02:53,562
Why are you going so far as this?

794
01:03:12,692 --> 01:03:16,732
[In the end, it was her]

795
01:03:23,402 --> 01:03:26,032
Cho Seong Hoo's only family was a younger sister.

796
01:03:26,032 --> 01:03:28,082
After Cho Seong Hoo disappeared, she married

797
01:03:28,082 --> 01:03:32,212
and became the eldest daughter-in-law of the Left State Minister Seok Ji Seong.

798
01:03:32,212 --> 01:03:36,012
Her name is Cho Yeo Hwa.

799
01:03:54,992 --> 01:03:57,502
I am the eldest daughter-in-law of the Left State Minister,

800
01:03:57,502 --> 01:04:01,212
Cho Yeo Hwa.

801
01:04:16,802 --> 01:04:21,652
[Knight Flower]

802
01:04:21,652 --> 01:04:25,512
[Unfinished Story]

803
01:04:25,512 --> 01:04:26,952
Thank you.

804
01:04:26,952 --> 01:04:28,722
Thank you.

805
01:04:29,522 --> 01:04:31,732
Be safe on your journey.

806
01:04:31,732 --> 01:04:33,622
All right, let us go.

807
01:04:33,622 --> 01:04:36,282
- Let us go.
- Yes.

808
01:04:38,492 --> 01:04:41,642
It looks like you also have your own story.

809
01:04:41,642 --> 01:04:46,562
Please survive and live the life you want to live.

810
01:04:53,832 --> 01:04:55,282
Our next destination is over there.

811
01:04:55,282 --> 01:04:57,602
All right, let us go.

812
01:04:59,732 --> 01:05:06,222
There is a man and a woman who are spending a night together in a warm room for the first time.

813
01:05:06,222 --> 01:05:10,182
I heard that all of Myeongdogak was quite hot.

814
01:05:10,182 --> 01:05:12,602
Did you heat up their room in this weather?

815
01:05:12,602 --> 01:05:14,332
Shall I tell you in detail?

816
01:05:14,332 --> 01:05:17,622
How a man and a woman in love secretly come together—

817
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:20,712
No! S-Stop it!

818
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:24,932
I am sure they must be exhausted from such a fuss throughout the night.

819
01:05:28,032 --> 01:05:31,972
I guess Madam Baek is just like you and is different in the day and at night.

820
01:05:31,972 --> 01:05:35,532
"Confident at night, modest during the day," if you will.
[Confident at night, modest during the day]

821
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:39,722
Confident at night, modest during the day?
[Confident at night, modest during the day]

822
01:05:44,322 --> 01:05:46,892
♫ Oh, I see the dead people drowning on my way ♫

823
01:05:46,892 --> 01:05:49,512
♫ But there's only one left holding on the last bullet ♫

824
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:52,092
♫ when I breathe in, I smell the pungent smell of the earth ♫

825
01:05:52,092 --> 01:05:54,552
♫ It digs through my veins, preventing me from breathing ♫

826
01:05:54,552 --> 01:05:57,272
♫ But boy, you gotta wake up, stop the meaningless abstention ♫

827
01:05:57,272 --> 01:06:00,132
♫ That nightmare turns to reality, there is nowhere to run ♫

828
01:06:00,132 --> 01:06:02,412
♫ The parameter gets bigger the moment I realize I slipped ♫

829
01:06:02,412 --> 01:06:04,702
♫ So where do we need to go, just put your chin up ♫

830
01:06:04,702 --> 01:06:07,332
♫ Yeah, I keep runnin', runnin', no time to get low ♫

831
01:06:07,332 --> 01:06:08,602
♫ Set aside the meaningless calculation ♫

832
01:06:08,602 --> 01:06:10,162
Not too long ago at Myeongdogak,

833
01:06:10,162 --> 01:06:15,262
a good-looking merchant with a silver tongue appeared.

834
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:18,982
He said there would be a major problem if you find out who he is!

835
01:06:18,982 --> 01:06:21,672
I know you have helped me every time, Sir.

836
01:06:21,672 --> 01:06:23,242
I got involved by coincidence.

837
01:06:23,242 --> 01:06:26,782
All of it were things you helped me with.

838
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:28,922
My name is Joo Yo Seop.

839
01:06:28,922 --> 01:06:32,622
Do not leave my sight, so you will not do anything reckless again.

840
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:34,212
How will he keep watch over me?

841
01:06:34,212 --> 01:06:36,262
Will he barge into my house or what?

842
01:06:36,262 --> 01:06:39,392
Oh, it so happens you are here!

843
01:06:39,392 --> 01:06:41,532
I have also wanted to meet you.

844
01:06:41,532 --> 01:06:43,772
Why did he come here?

845
01:06:45,072 --> 01:06:48,092
♫ When I breathe in, I smell the pungent smell of the earth ♫
