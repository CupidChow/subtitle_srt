00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:40,325
How much did he drink?

2
00:00:55,165 --> 00:01:00,355
I am seeing hallucinations now.

3
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:03,505
Madam...

4
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:06,715
The wife of another.

5
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:08,535
Madam.

6
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:29,805
- Sorry—
- I am sorry—

7
00:01:29,805 --> 00:01:31,865
I am sorry.

8
00:01:33,215 --> 00:01:35,735
It looks like you were upset about something.

9
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:39,295
Just shake it off and forget about it.

10
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:43,395
Once time passes, everything will be okay.

11
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:47,535
Are you okay?

12
00:01:49,335 --> 00:01:54,215
I did hear the Left State Minister's oldest son came back.

13
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:58,545
I am okay.

14
00:01:58,545 --> 00:02:02,845
I... am worried.

15
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:07,495
You might be tied to

16
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:10,715
the Left State Minister because that man came back or

17
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:13,475
if you will be forced to live and fulfill...

18
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:17,035
your duties as that man's wife.

19
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,485
You do not need to worry about such things.

20
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:27,875
It was not my choice to live as a faithful widow thus far,

21
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:32,965
but my life going forward will not be forced upon me by anyone.

27
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:19,025
Madam.

28
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:24,695
The wife of another.

29
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:26,475
Madam.

30
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:32,265
Gosh, you are mad, Cho Yeo Hwa.

31
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:35,725
Get yourself together, get yourself together!

32
00:03:37,995 --> 00:03:39,785
My Lady!

33
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:44,725
A lowly-looking man just entered the men's quarters.

34
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,285
But he looks really suspicious.

35
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:48,365
At this hour?

36
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:52,185
I must check who it is.

37
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:57,995
You are looking wretched.

38
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:03,125
Looking at you now reminds me of when I first took you in.

39
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:09,375
This lowly one never once forgot Your Excellency's grace.

40
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:13,675
You have such thoughts, yet you ran away?

41
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:16,655
Not at all. I absolutely did not try to run away.

42
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:21,075
Who could possibly hide from Your Excellency's eyes and survive in Joseon?

43
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:25,445
It is just that I have a job I must finish before I die,

44
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:28,015
so it could not be helped.

45
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:34,525
A job you must finish?

46
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:38,905
The late Head of the Royal Guards' son is still alive.

47
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:42,235
What did you say?

48
00:04:42,235 --> 00:04:44,755
Who did you say is alive?

49
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,295
The son of Im Kang.

50
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:50,585
No way!

51
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:54,345
It was Park Yoon Hak.

52
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:59,485
Park Yoon Hak took away the child who nearly died and saved him that day.

53
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:03,875
Park Su Ho, the younger brother of Park Yoon Hak, is the son of Im Kang.

54
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,405
What did you say?

55
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:12,845
Those two knew everything from the beginning and mocked me, huh?

56
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:17,015
They hid their claws and were waiting for the right time.

57
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:19,825
Park Su Ho is chasing the incident from 15 years ago.

58
00:05:19,825 --> 00:05:24,875
Your Excellency, I will take down Park Su Ho and Park Yoon Hak without fail.

59
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:32,725
After I get rid of them, I will offer you my life, Your Excellency.

60
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,165
[If you want to know what happened to your brother...]

61
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:48,735
It might have been Park Yoon Hak's doing

62
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:52,515
and not the Finance Minister's wife.

63
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:57,685
How dare he throw such a shallow bait at me?

64
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:09,045
Take this opportunity to eliminate the root of trouble.

65
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:15,185
Who goes there?

66
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:20,145
There is an intruder.

67
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:21,755
Find him without fail!

68
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:23,635
- Yes!
- Yes!

69
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:26,155
You go check the shrine!

70
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:27,215
- Yes!
- Okay!

71
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:30,435
Where is this bastard?

72
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:32,555
Hurry up and come.

73
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:07,915
What is the matter?

74
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,545
There was a suspicious intruder, so we are looking.

75
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:15,085
What?

76
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,815
What is the matter?

77
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,075
Why are you cleaning the discarded memorial tablet?

78
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:53,145
Oh, it is because...

79
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:56,245
I always did this before going to sleep.

80
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:03,865
Young Master!

81
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:12,875
Is it yours, Wife?

82
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:18,075
it seems nothing is wrong here, so you may go now.

83
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:19,625
Yes.

84
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:37,915
Sir! Sir!

85
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:40,045
Sir, this is bad.

86
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:40,835
What is wrong?

87
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:44,495
Kang Pil Jik entered the Left State Minister's house, so I stood guard at the gates.

88
00:08:44,495 --> 00:08:46,315
Kang Pil Jik entered the Left State Minister's house?

89
00:08:46,315 --> 00:08:48,015
That is not important right now.

90
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:52,045
Their house was turned upside down because of an intruder!

91
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:55,035
I will go there, so keep tracking Kang Pil Jik for now.

92
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,705
Yes.

93
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:03,405
What on Earth are you here for?

94
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:09,205
I heard we had a suspicious intruder.

95
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:11,355
Are you all right?

96
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:18,285
A suspicious person?

97
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:20,661
It looks like the person escaped.

98
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:23,415
I see.

99
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:35,435
You can head down first. I will follow soon after.

100
00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:39,445
By the way, what is going on with your clothing?

101
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:42,675
Is it not weird?

102
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:45,975
- The thing is...
- Why did you wear mourning clothes again?

103
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,255
Gosh, I just cannot get used to this.

104
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:51,775
Why did it have to be...

105
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:54,475
I see you are wearing mourning clothes

106
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:57,125
and cleaning the memorial tablet.

107
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,575
- Are you unhappy I came back?
- Not at all.

108
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:01,545
Are you happy, then?

109
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:09,535
I think it will be better for you to change your clothes before you come out.

110
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,825
Once Mother finds out, she will scold you.

111
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:15,275
Yes.

112
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:25,155
I think you are really

113
00:10:25,155 --> 00:10:28,115
full of secrets, Wife.

114
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:37,785
S-Secret?

115
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,405
What is he saying?

116
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:15,935
Captain Park Su Ho!

117
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:21,125
Kang Pil Jik, that bastard did this to them!

118
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,235
Did you get badly injured?

119
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:23,765
I am sorry, Sir.

120
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:27,445
Some men appeared out of nowhere.

121
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:28,885
We lost Kang Pil Jik.

122
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:31,895
They dared to attack the Capital Garrison's officers?

123
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:34,295
I will not let them be!

124
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:36,565
Did you see those men's faces?

125
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:40,605
You know, those men who locked up Kang Pil Jik.

126
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:43,165
It was those men.

127
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:46,655
I must check how much the Left State Minister knows.

128
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:49,485
- Garrison Commander.
- Yes?

129
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:51,875
I have something to tell you.

130
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:59,785
Those punks from the Capital Garrison kept following us.

131
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,435
I feel so much better.

132
00:12:01,435 --> 00:12:04,165
Should we just get rid of them altogether?

133
00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:07,345
We must.

134
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:11,215
Should we track down Park Su Ho like last time?

135
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:15,125
Park Su Ho will be caught with the masked one at once.

136
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,845
The masked one and Park Su Ho.

137
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:31,875
Your Excellency, should we not notify the Capital Garrison

138
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,325
or Criminal Arresting Agency and have him arrested?

139
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:38,495
You told me not to tell anyone, and it worries me.

140
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:42,115
We did not lose anything and no one got hurt.

141
00:12:42,115 --> 00:12:44,245
So I will look into it quietly.

142
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:49,535
What if the rumors grow for no reason, making the people anxious?

143
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,715
But still...

144
00:12:57,295 --> 00:12:58,985
Do not worry, Dear Wife.

145
00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:01,445
I will take care of it all.

146
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:07,605
He dared to jump the walls of this country's left state minister. How could I let him be?

147
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:15,695
I will be back, Dear Wife.

148
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:18,405
Your Excellency!

149
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:22,885
I came because I heard a masked assailant broke into your house last night.

150
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:29,445
I told them not to let the Capital Garrison know for fear of rumors spreading inside the capital.

151
00:13:29,445 --> 00:13:32,195
So how did you know that?

152
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:35,515
Just who are we? We are the Capital Garrison!

153
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:39,875
We do our best day and night without a break for the security of the capital.

154
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:44,465
O-Our patrols saw a masked assailant jump the walls of your house.

155
00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:46,965
Were there any valuables you lost?

156
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:49,035
There was no loss.

157
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:51,165
Did anyone inside see him?

158
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:56,605
He tried to enter the men's quarters and ran off as soon as I came out...

159
00:13:56,605 --> 00:14:00,255
How could he dare to go for His Excellency?

160
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:01,795
I will have this bastard—

161
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:04,995
Were you with His Excellency, Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong?

162
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:08,355
I was not. I fell asleep early in the women's quarters.

163
00:14:08,355 --> 00:14:11,585
So, I only found out a lot later.

164
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:15,425
In that case, were you the only one who saw him?

165
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:20,445
Look here, Garrison Commander.

166
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:22,095
Yes!

167
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,935
Since the Capital Garrison is so interested in the masked one,

168
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:29,425
I will entrust this matter to you.

169
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:34,485
However, my family and servants only saw him run away.

170
00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:38,265
So you will not be able to find any evidence inside my house.

171
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:41,985
Y-Yes, we will search the entire capital if we have to

172
00:14:41,985 --> 00:14:44,875
and make sure to catch that bastard.

173
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:48,045
By the way,

174
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:54,165
do you think this masked one is the one who stole the Finance Minister's drawing?

175
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:56,635
It is hard to come to that conclusion.

176
00:14:56,635 --> 00:15:02,825
However, could I ask you why you had such a thought?

177
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:07,375
Are you asking me that question right now?

178
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,445
The masked one has been stirring up the capital for ages.

179
00:15:10,445 --> 00:15:14,635
But how can you know nothing about him?

180
00:15:16,235 --> 00:15:19,425
Unless you are intentionally not catching him,

181
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:22,385
it must mean the Capital Garrison is very incompetent.

182
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:25,645
I apologize. We will make sure to get him and

183
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:30,725
find out the reason he broke into your house.

184
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:33,585
Since you made a promise before me,

185
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:37,115
you will have to fulfill it.

186
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:38,675
Yes.

187
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:49,355
Now, then.

188
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:08,345
- Gosh, are you okay?
- Yes.

189
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:12,825
Captain Park Su Ho!

190
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:18,545
I am helping you because you said this is His Majesty's order.

191
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,345
But the Left State Minister is scary.

192
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:24,535
He is just way too scary.

193
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:29,035
Did you see his e-eyes of a tiger?

194
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,135
What brings you here?

195
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:34,005
We came for business.

196
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:36,635
What brings you here?

197
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,171
This is my house.

198
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:45,375
Could you be the Left State Minister's oldest son who came back alive?

199
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,065
Oh, my.

200
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:51,765
It was not intentional, but I revealed my identity too late.

201
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:54,095
Let me introduce myself formally.

202
00:16:55,165 --> 00:16:57,315
My name is Seok Jeong.

203
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,895
Are you saying you are—

204
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:06,075
I happen to have something to tell you, Captain.

205
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,431
But my wife is waiting.

206
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,275
How happy you must be.

207
00:17:11,275 --> 00:17:13,625
Please go ahead inside.

208
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:16,535
I will head over to Myeongdogak shortly.

209
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,595
I will meet you there.

210
00:17:23,415 --> 00:17:27,435
Her handsome husband came back alive,

211
00:17:27,435 --> 00:17:31,995
so the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law must be so happy.

212
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:36,635
My Lady!

213
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:40,305
Sir Captain was here just now.

214
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:42,075
Is that so?

215
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:45,171
Captain is not totally clueless.

216
00:17:45,755 --> 00:17:47,525
Madam.

217
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:51,785
The wife of another.

218
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:54,565
- Madam.
- Madam.

219
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:58,275
Madam, Madam, Madam— Just stop calling me!

220
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,195
If you tell me not to call you "Madam,"

221
00:18:06,195 --> 00:18:09,095
then what should I call you?

222
00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:10,745
Darling?

223
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,095
Honey?

224
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:17,405
Honey, please go ahead.

225
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:19,185
That is nice to hear.

226
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:21,045
Honey?

227
00:18:22,055 --> 00:18:26,565
Mother gave me permission for us to have a day out.

228
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:30,415
I do not know how to enjoy a time outside because I always stayed home.

229
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:34,455
Honey, I will keep doing embroidery as I have been all this time.

230
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:36,685
Oh, my goodness.

231
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,375
I got the permission to go outside with you,

232
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:42,185
buy you pretty ornaments, and spend all the time we want.

233
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:44,415
How unfortunate.

234
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,915
I will just go to Myeongdogak and—

235
00:18:46,915 --> 00:18:50,615
If I do not go, Mother will be upset.

236
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:53,155
I will get ready, so please wait a moment.

237
00:18:53,155 --> 00:18:55,395
- Yeon Seon?
- Yes.

238
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,605
How could he be...

239
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:11,125
By the way, why did he want to see me?

240
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:14,835
Is the Grand Merchant inside?

241
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:17,375
- You are so rude!
- Oh, sorry.

242
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,985
Sorry. I am sorry.

243
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:24,245
Could it be he saw her face back then?

244
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,535
Brother.

245
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:31,125
I had sent word to the Capital Garrison, telling you to come here.

246
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,915
How did you know in advance to come?

247
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:35,185
I came to meet someone.

248
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:38,395
My Lady said she would come tonight.

249
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:40,935
But the two of you are already here.

250
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:44,195
Grand Merchant, great timing.

251
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:46,405
About Joo who works here—

252
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:50,595
Grand Merchant, long time no see.

253
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:01,205
Welcome.

254
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:02,765
We meet again.

255
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:05,215
I did not even know you were the Left State Minister's son, and

256
00:20:05,215 --> 00:20:08,125
I treated you rudely all this time.

257
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,755
Not at all. I am sorry I could not tell you sooner.

258
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:13,195
Thank you for everything.

259
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:15,575
What is that situation?

260
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:20,065
Could that man be the Left State Minister's oldest son?

261
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:24,085
Oh, Su Ho, wait—

262
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:33,835
What is the reason you called me out to this place?

263
00:20:35,365 --> 00:20:37,605
It is not right to talk about it here.

264
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:39,715
Let us go somewhere else.

265
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:49,575
We just got a pretty nice coral hairpin.

266
00:20:49,575 --> 00:20:51,825
Would you like to take a look?

267
00:20:58,145 --> 00:20:59,895
This way.

268
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:05,545
What do you plan to do?

269
00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:13,925
Wait! Did everyone just leave me behind?

270
00:21:21,545 --> 00:21:26,585
I was curious about something, so I asked to see you despite the rudeness.

271
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:30,205
Well, it is not like I can talk about this elsewhere.

272
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:35,285
Since investigating is your job, I reckoned you would know well.

273
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:37,605
What are you talking about?

274
00:21:37,605 --> 00:21:39,261
My wife...

275
00:21:39,951 --> 00:21:41,841
is suspicious.

276
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:44,145
Suspicious?

277
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:47,485
The Left State Minister's daughter-in-law is reputable and wise.

278
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:50,745
I heard no one dares to badmouth her.

279
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:55,505
I do not think "suspicious" is the right word to describe her.

280
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:58,225
Do you know my wife well?

281
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,775
Since you came back to the capital after 15 years and met your wife for the first time,

282
00:22:03,775 --> 00:22:06,615
I would know her better than you do.

283
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:11,055
Okay. Fine.

284
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,705
Will you tell me about my wife, then?

285
00:22:19,135 --> 00:22:24,585
Kang Pil Jik said he would get the Royal Secretary of Defense and the Captain.

286
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:27,565
He uses whatever means he can find.

287
00:22:27,565 --> 00:22:31,455
He can charge at you whenever he intends to kill you, so you must be careful.

288
00:22:31,455 --> 00:22:35,555
It will be hard for him to kill me, the Royal Secretary of Defense.

289
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:42,515
However, I think Su Ho might become a target.

290
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:44,675
After seeing the fake letter,

291
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:49,475
Father seemed to try to hide something that I absolutely should not know.

292
00:22:49,475 --> 00:22:53,145
I am sure he will silence the Finance Minister's wife, who knows about it and

293
00:22:53,145 --> 00:22:58,295
make a move first so you cannot pursue him anymore, Royal Secretary.

294
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:01,945
Since I know the situation now, I will prepare a countermeasure.

295
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:03,235
Also, the Captain is—

296
00:23:03,235 --> 00:23:07,325
He will be able to protect himself.

297
00:23:07,325 --> 00:23:10,985
You never know what underhanded trick Kang Pil Jik will pull.

298
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:14,415
Are you worried about Su Ho?

299
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:21,675
I am only worried something will happen to the Captain, and our entire plan will fail.

300
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,845
I have nothing more to say.

301
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:30,315
Let me ask you this one thing.

302
00:23:33,515 --> 00:23:37,165
Is it better that my wife is your secret lover...

303
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:40,195
or a masked assailant?

304
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,915
I thought about it all night.

305
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:48,535
But I just could not find the answer.

306
00:23:50,885 --> 00:23:55,425
If she is my secret lover or an assailant, what will you do?

307
00:23:57,175 --> 00:24:00,145
I am not exactly saying I will do something.

308
00:24:00,145 --> 00:24:06,035
I am letting you know I am thinking about what to do in advance.

309
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:09,985
Before asking me this kind of question,

310
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:13,805
should you not first consider her feelings?

311
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:17,855
Once you know what kind of a person she is and how she feels every day,

312
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:22,595
you will not be able to assume things about her like you did just now.

313
00:24:36,695 --> 00:24:39,745
I have something to discuss with Madam for a moment.

314
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:57,395
What is the matter?

315
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,685
Are you really okay?

316
00:24:59,685 --> 00:25:03,485
The Left State Minister's son asked me about your identity.

317
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:05,815
He had caught on, I see.

318
00:25:05,815 --> 00:25:08,315
I could not change my clothes last night because I was too rushed.

319
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:10,915
Should you be so calm about this?

320
00:25:12,675 --> 00:25:15,065
I was worried the entire time.

321
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:17,105
What if he is scum like the Finance Minister or

322
00:25:17,105 --> 00:25:20,125
what if he is a terrible man like the Left State Minister?

323
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:22,215
You worry too much.

324
00:25:22,215 --> 00:25:25,325
If he were such a man, would I just let him have his way?

325
00:25:25,325 --> 00:25:28,855
Even worse, what if he is the type all the women in the capital lust after?

326
00:25:28,855 --> 00:25:31,575
I even worried about such things.

327
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:37,925
What you need to worry about right now is your safety.

328
00:25:37,925 --> 00:25:40,695
Kang Pil Jik will try to kill you, Sir.

329
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:44,175
The Royal Secretary of Defense told me not to worry.

330
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:48,095
But you even passed out in front of Kang Pil Jik once.

331
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:51,135
It was because I had a sudden headache back then.

332
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:53,715
You must be careful.

333
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:59,955
Are you worried about me?

334
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:04,765
Is that not a natural thing?

335
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:06,475
We are...

336
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:10,055
on the same side.

337
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:14,725
I may not be the best swordsman in Joseon,

338
00:26:14,725 --> 00:26:19,185
but they say I am at least the third best, so do not worry.

339
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:22,425
I will trust you.

340
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,995
Have an apple.

341
00:26:39,935 --> 00:26:42,315
I missed this flavor so much.

342
00:26:42,315 --> 00:26:44,735
The Qing Dynasty does not have apples like this.

343
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:48,275
These are precious apples sent from Cheongsong for the Peonies Club.

344
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:51,175
The Grand Merchant let us have some on a special note.

345
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:53,995
Only the king would get to eat these.

346
00:26:53,995 --> 00:26:56,375
So, Senior Ggot, you are saying,

347
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:59,575
the masked one is not an assailant but a good person.

348
00:26:59,575 --> 00:27:02,895
She brings rice and other kinds of food to starving families, too.

349
00:27:02,895 --> 00:27:07,175
That is not all. She brought rice to an old man beaten up unjustly the last time.

350
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:10,805
She punished the nobleman properly.

351
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:12,975
She is a great person.

352
00:27:12,975 --> 00:27:16,475
We should have punished him more back then.

353
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:20,075
- These days, some call My Lady the Midam—
- Brother Hwal Yoo!

354
00:27:20,075 --> 00:27:21,905
Have this one, too.

355
00:27:21,905 --> 00:27:24,855
The apple is so red.

356
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:32,885
She spent a long time like that, huh?

357
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:37,271
Anyhow, Junior, I heard you lost your memories.

358
00:27:39,145 --> 00:27:40,415
That is right.

359
00:27:40,415 --> 00:27:42,295
That was the case, but—

360
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:45,015
I must go now.

361
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:48,165
I will tell you the details at a later time.

362
00:27:48,765 --> 00:27:52,335
Hwal Yoo, you can have this one, too.

363
00:27:56,555 --> 00:28:00,365
Well, did you like the hairpin?

364
00:28:00,365 --> 00:28:02,225
Yes.

365
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:04,735
Let us go.

366
00:28:15,885 --> 00:28:19,375
A masked one who helps the poor inside the capital.

367
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:25,755
On top of that, jumping walls at night for years. The legendary Midam.

368
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:30,225
They said there was an intruder at home yesterday, so I thought he was really an intruder.

369
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:34,725
But you never know. It might have been the legendary Midam.

370
00:28:38,145 --> 00:28:43,305
Wait! Are you saying he is allowed to jump the Left State Minister's walls?

371
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,355
You never know what he would have done.

372
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:49,135
I heard he is a righteous man, so he would not have tried to harm anyone.

373
00:28:49,135 --> 00:28:52,035
He must have had his reasons.

374
00:28:52,035 --> 00:28:55,675
I heard you wandered around after losing your memories.

375
00:28:55,675 --> 00:28:58,965
But it looks like you still do not know how to fear the world.

376
00:28:59,715 --> 00:29:06,955
You talk as if you know to fear the world when you only stayed inside as the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law.

377
00:29:11,905 --> 00:29:14,545
I like great people.

378
00:29:15,935 --> 00:29:20,325
So I hope the masked one or Midam

379
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,095
does not get caught.

380
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:38,705
Oh, I see.

381
00:29:38,705 --> 00:29:41,315
Here comes the Royal Secretary.

382
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,015
I heard your family has something to celebrate.

383
00:29:50,015 --> 00:29:51,985
Congratulations, Your Excellency.

384
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:53,395
Thank you.

385
00:29:53,395 --> 00:29:57,035
I am thinking of having a small party with refreshments in two days.

386
00:29:57,035 --> 00:29:58,925
A small party with refreshments?

387
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:02,635
Since the Left State Minister's son, who was thought to be dead, came back alive,

388
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:06,115
I would like to share the joy with the Left State Minister.

389
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:09,155
That is a truly great order.

390
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:10,895
Well...

391
00:30:10,895 --> 00:30:14,555
Your Majesty, since the times are difficult,

392
00:30:14,555 --> 00:30:19,055
there is no need to care for even my personal family matters.

393
00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:22,505
Truly, the capital is tumultuous.

394
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:27,535
But still, would it not be too disappointing to let it just pass?

395
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:31,155
We will only gather and simply have some tea.

396
00:30:31,155 --> 00:30:37,175
Please bring in Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong, your son, and your daughter-in-law with you.

397
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:40,625
Yes, Your Majesty.

398
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:55,341
[Capital Garrison]

399
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:04,335
Are you okay?

400
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:06,695
Did you get hit a lot?

401
00:31:06,695 --> 00:31:09,325
How did this happen?

402
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,305
What brings you here today?

403
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:14,825
A man can get injured while doing important work.

404
00:31:14,825 --> 00:31:17,415
So why the long face?

405
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:22,945
It is because my pride as a military officer was scarred.

406
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:29,165
Eat this and cheer up to pay them back.

407
00:31:29,165 --> 00:31:32,535
You will not recover just by staring blankly.

408
00:31:33,415 --> 00:31:35,335
My Lady.

409
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:38,995
Is Garrison Commander skipping his meal today, then?

410
00:31:38,995 --> 00:31:40,765
Gosh!

411
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:46,265
Did I not sound like a really good wife just now?

412
00:31:46,265 --> 00:31:50,315
I was the prime example of a woman any man would fall for.

413
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:53,755
Were you? I guess you were.

414
00:31:53,755 --> 00:31:55,765
Bi Chan!

415
00:31:55,765 --> 00:31:58,235
Yes, Garrison Commander.

416
00:31:58,235 --> 00:32:02,585
You really have a lot on your plate.

417
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:05,525
Hurry up and go inside.

418
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:09,655
Captain Park is waiting for you.

419
00:32:09,655 --> 00:32:11,275
Yes.

420
00:32:14,255 --> 00:32:19,035
Why did you come so late? I was starving to death here.

421
00:32:20,285 --> 00:32:23,285
You cannot have it. This is for Bi Chan.

422
00:32:23,285 --> 00:32:25,635
B-Bi Chan?

423
00:32:30,895 --> 00:32:33,115
You are heading home already?

424
00:32:33,895 --> 00:32:37,375
I am tired today, so I should head home early and rest.

425
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,925
Okay. Have a good rest.

426
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:42,021
Great work today.

427
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:00,665
Who are you?

428
00:33:17,215 --> 00:33:19,775
What is it now? You are scaring me.

429
00:33:19,775 --> 00:33:25,321
So, the Memorial Tablet who came back alive said to you...

430
00:33:26,025 --> 00:33:30,595
Dear Wife, I cannot fall asleep because I want to eat Ggot Nim's dried persimmons.

431
00:33:30,595 --> 00:33:33,495
Please get me some of those dried persimmons.

432
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:36,135
I will get in trouble for ordering you around,

433
00:33:36,135 --> 00:33:39,735
so please do so secretly without getting caught.

434
00:33:42,275 --> 00:33:46,575
...and made such a ridiculous request of you? Why?

435
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:50,065
He probably realized that I had things to do at night.

436
00:33:50,065 --> 00:33:52,665
How did he find that out?

437
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:54,605
No way...

438
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:58,735
Do not tell me that Memorial Tablet discovered your identity, too.

439
00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:02,445
If the Finance Minister's wife tells me about Brother tonight,

440
00:34:02,445 --> 00:34:05,675
I am planning on leaving right away. Like tomorrow.

441
00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:12,755
What if Kang Pil Jik tries to kill the Finance Minister's wife again?

442
00:34:12,755 --> 00:34:16,805
That is why I am going out prepared like this.

443
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:22,155
Do not worry.

444
00:34:22,155 --> 00:34:24,455
Be careful.

445
00:34:25,665 --> 00:34:27,615
I cannot fall asleep because I am so curious as to who Midam is!

446
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:29,505
Just tell me that!

447
00:34:29,505 --> 00:34:31,525
Come on, Sir!

448
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:33,485
- Tell me!
- I said no!

449
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:35,985
Honestly, I should know, too—

450
00:34:40,565 --> 00:34:42,765
- Give it to me.
- Yes.

451
00:34:46,445 --> 00:34:49,685
[If you want to save the Grand Merchant, come by yourself.]

452
00:34:49,685 --> 00:34:52,295
Sir, what will you do?

453
00:34:52,985 --> 00:34:56,445
Go to the Garrison Commander quickly and ask him to send military officers to Pil's Lodge.

454
00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:57,685
Yes, sir!

455
00:34:57,685 --> 00:35:00,135
Bi Chan, check if everything is okay at the Finance Minister's house.

456
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:03,415
Sir, are you saying you will go to Pil's Lodge alone?

457
00:35:03,415 --> 00:35:05,585
I will go with you!

458
00:35:05,585 --> 00:35:07,745
We do not know what tricks Kang Pil Jik will use.

459
00:35:07,745 --> 00:35:10,125
The Finance Minister's wife's safety comes first.

460
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,955
Yes, Sir!

461
00:35:19,085 --> 00:35:20,575
Hello, Sir.

462
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:22,785
Please come this way.

463
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:58,385
- Are you all right?
- Sir!

464
00:35:58,385 --> 00:36:00,675
Let us leave right away.

465
00:36:06,045 --> 00:36:09,285
Have you come, Captain?

466
00:36:16,365 --> 00:36:18,835
The Capital Garrison will be here soon.

467
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:21,225
You will be arrested anyway,

468
00:36:21,225 --> 00:36:23,905
so it would be better not to get hurt.

469
00:36:23,905 --> 00:36:26,585
Even if I were to get arrested,

470
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:31,315
I have to kill you and the masked one personally.

471
00:36:32,465 --> 00:36:34,645
Where is the masked one?

472
00:36:34,645 --> 00:36:38,445
You will never see him until the day you die.

473
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:44,825
I am just so curious about his identity.

474
00:36:44,825 --> 00:36:50,775
Speaking of things right under your nose. I just thought of kidnapping the Grand Merchant.

475
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,565
Let the Grand Merchant go.

476
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:14,615
If you want to save the Grand Merchant,

477
00:37:15,335 --> 00:37:17,895
lay down your sword first.

478
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:49,025
I should have killed you then.

479
00:37:55,785 --> 00:37:58,455
- Grand Merchant, are you all right?
- Yes...

480
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:04,855
Stop!

481
00:38:05,465 --> 00:38:10,075
Im Hyeon Jae, is this not the same situation as 15 years ago?

482
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:12,725
Your father, supposedly the best swordsman in Joseon,

483
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:17,595
died without properly fighting because of you.

484
00:38:20,075 --> 00:38:22,855
Drop your sword.

485
00:38:22,855 --> 00:38:25,195
He has nothing to do with me.

486
00:38:25,195 --> 00:38:27,105
So kill me!

487
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:30,085
What are you doing not dropping your sword?

488
00:38:32,695 --> 00:38:34,795
You must not!

489
00:38:35,675 --> 00:38:41,075
All of you will die anyway, so why are you so desperate?

490
00:38:44,985 --> 00:38:48,065
Do you remember when we first met?

491
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:51,045
I remember everything from that day clearly.

492
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:52,915
I hope you remember it, too.

493
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:56,875
- What are you saying out of the blue?
- Remember how you acted

494
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,925
and how you saw me!

495
00:38:58,925 --> 00:39:00,995
Stop the nonsense!

496
00:39:00,995 --> 00:39:02,105
Drop your sword!

497
00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:05,215
I will. I will drop my sword.

498
00:39:34,395 --> 00:39:38,395
The Capital Garrison is here! Stop right there!

499
00:39:41,655 --> 00:39:42,915
Arrest them all!

500
00:39:42,915 --> 00:39:44,915
Yes, sir!

501
00:39:47,905 --> 00:39:50,345
Sir!

502
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:54,335
But where is our Midam—

503
00:39:54,335 --> 00:39:56,375
Lower your voice.

504
00:39:57,025 --> 00:39:58,905
Come with me!

505
00:39:58,905 --> 00:40:02,465
Geez, these bastards!

506
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:08,435
- Take them away!
- Yes!

507
00:40:21,005 --> 00:40:22,295
What happened?

508
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,315
Oh, so what happened was,

509
00:40:24,315 --> 00:40:29,385
I was about to enter the Finance Minister's house...

510
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,435
Are you not the Captain's subordinate?

511
00:40:32,435 --> 00:40:34,315
Midam?

512
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:37,665
So why did you come here by yourself?

513
00:40:39,245 --> 00:40:43,025
By chance, did something happen to the Captain?

514
00:40:44,785 --> 00:40:46,525
Midam...

515
00:40:46,525 --> 00:40:49,235
We're in big trouble!

516
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:52,745
You are lucky I met Midam and delivered the news.

517
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:54,215
It could have been bad for you!

518
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:56,405
Why did you do something I did not tell you to do?

519
00:40:56,405 --> 00:40:58,275
Do you know how dangerous it could have been?

520
00:40:58,275 --> 00:41:02,095
Gosh, you are safe, thanks to our Midam.

521
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:03,895
I realized it now...

522
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:09,375
that our Midam is a bit stronger than you, Sir.

523
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:11,635
That bastard...

524
00:41:18,845 --> 00:41:23,515
Your Excellency, Kang Pil Jik was arrested by the Capital Garrison.

525
00:41:24,175 --> 00:41:27,345
- You may leave.
- Yes.

526
00:41:38,115 --> 00:41:43,475
Go and immediately arrest Madam Oh, the late Finance Minister's wife.

527
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:49,015
Oh Nan Kyeong, the late Finance Minister's wife, come out! You are under arrest!

528
00:41:49,015 --> 00:41:50,795
Oh no! Goodness!

529
00:41:50,795 --> 00:41:52,365
Search everywhere for her!

530
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:54,305
Yes, sir!

531
00:42:30,655 --> 00:42:32,215
Your Majesty.

532
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:37,785
Is it true you ordered the Criminal Arresting Agency to arrest the Finance Minister's wife?

533
00:42:39,245 --> 00:42:41,205
That is right.

534
00:42:41,205 --> 00:42:45,755
It was too early in the morning, and I was afraid I might disturb your sleep,

535
00:42:45,755 --> 00:42:48,595
so I made the decision by myself.

536
00:42:48,595 --> 00:42:52,335
How could you make such an important decision by yourself, Your Majesty!

537
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:56,905
You said there is conclusive circumstantial evidence of stealing charity rice.

538
00:42:56,905 --> 00:43:01,435
So, I wanted to interrogate her personally and expose all of her crimes.

539
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:05,905
I told you the Queen Dowager may be connected to the case.

540
00:43:05,905 --> 00:43:08,905
If anyone has committed a crime,

541
00:43:08,905 --> 00:43:12,875
even my mother cannot be exempt from punishment.

542
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:18,705
However, if you dared to slander my innocent mother,

543
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:23,485
is that also something I should just sit back and watch?

544
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:29,065
By chance, did you think you could do that by yourself, Your Majesty?

545
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,415
Left State Minister.

546
00:43:32,395 --> 00:43:36,475
Despite what you may think, I am the king of this country.

547
00:43:36,475 --> 00:43:42,625
Are you rebuking me right now for giving an order that is only natural for a king to do?

548
00:43:46,555 --> 00:43:50,505
You gave a royal command by yourself for once,

549
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:54,375
but the Finance Minister's wife has escaped already.

550
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,625
You finally revealed your claws

551
00:43:56,625 --> 00:44:00,265
and yet you have ended up looking like a cat.

552
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:04,855
You have lost quite a bit of face, Your Majesty.

553
00:44:20,535 --> 00:44:23,995
He is quite stubborn. So stubborn.

554
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,635
He refuses to say anything.

555
00:44:26,635 --> 00:44:28,745
I will go and see him.

556
00:44:28,745 --> 00:44:34,515
No, I have seen many guys like him over my ten years at the Capital Garrison.

557
00:44:34,515 --> 00:44:39,455
Those guys never confess if you keep telling them to confess.

558
00:44:39,455 --> 00:44:43,945
No one should see him today. Just leave him be.

559
00:44:43,945 --> 00:44:48,095
Any news on the Finance Minister's wife yet?

560
00:44:48,095 --> 00:44:51,295
Did she not almost die last time, too?

561
00:44:51,295 --> 00:44:55,795
I wonder if she got killed somewhere

562
00:44:55,795 --> 00:44:58,665
without anyone knowing.

563
00:44:59,675 --> 00:45:03,325
I am worried because we have not found anything

564
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,505
about the Finance Minister's wife.

565
00:45:06,205 --> 00:45:09,605
We still have Kang Pil Jik left.

566
00:45:09,605 --> 00:45:14,995
There is one thing that would make Kang Pil Jik open his mouth.

567
00:45:29,355 --> 00:45:33,375
Sir, did you come after hearing the news, too?

568
00:45:38,525 --> 00:45:40,405
What happened?

569
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,565
Now that the Finance Minister's wife disappeared,

570
00:45:42,565 --> 00:45:47,515
we lost our chance to hear about my brother forever.

571
00:45:48,865 --> 00:45:51,115
I will personally ask Father about it.

572
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,095
I must hear it even if I have to threaten him!

573
00:45:53,095 --> 00:45:56,545
You must not act rashly.

574
00:45:56,545 --> 00:46:00,515
His Majesty will host a party with refreshments tomorrow.

575
00:46:00,515 --> 00:46:04,455
He invited the Left State Minister and his family, including you.

576
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,105
Even if something happens between His Majesty and the Left State Minister,

577
00:46:08,105 --> 00:46:11,595
you must not get involved, nor must you act like you know anything.

578
00:46:11,595 --> 00:46:14,875
Also, you must not go against the will of His Majesty.

579
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:17,415
What do you mean by that?

580
00:46:17,415 --> 00:46:19,855
I cannot tell you everything right now,

581
00:46:19,855 --> 00:46:22,115
but please do as I say.

582
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:50,075
I am happy to gather with you for such a great occasion as this.

583
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:54,445
The Royal Secretary of Defense was very curious about the Left State Minister's son,

584
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:57,375
so I invited him here.

585
00:47:02,145 --> 00:47:05,795
This is my inadequate son.

586
00:47:06,795 --> 00:47:09,655
It is my first time meeting you, Your Majesty.

587
00:47:14,255 --> 00:47:16,985
You take after the Left State Minister very much.

588
00:47:16,985 --> 00:47:20,895
By chance, does your character take after his as well?

589
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:23,295
No.

590
00:47:23,295 --> 00:47:28,045
I believe I am more similar to my gentle mother.

591
00:47:32,295 --> 00:47:35,065
The son you believed was dead came back alive.

592
00:47:35,065 --> 00:47:37,895
You must be so happy.

593
00:47:37,895 --> 00:47:39,925
Yes, Your Majesty.

594
00:47:39,925 --> 00:47:43,015
Even now, it feels like I am dreaming.

595
00:47:43,015 --> 00:47:46,095
Seeing such a happy reunion,

596
00:47:46,095 --> 00:47:51,065
I suddenly remember my father, who passed away 15 years ago.

597
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:56,995
If only my father could come back to life like this, too...

598
00:48:02,225 --> 00:48:05,165
The husband whom you have longed for came back alive.

599
00:48:05,165 --> 00:48:08,175
You must have no more worries now.

600
00:48:08,925 --> 00:48:16,045
Your Majesty, I have waited for my brother to come home alive for 15 years.

601
00:48:16,045 --> 00:48:18,355
Oh, is that so?

602
00:48:18,355 --> 00:48:22,575
How could you bring up personal matters before His Majesty?

603
00:48:22,575 --> 00:48:25,065
Do not speak thus.

604
00:48:25,065 --> 00:48:29,325
That breaks my heart as if it were my own matter.

605
00:48:29,325 --> 00:48:33,195
Left State Minister, I will help you in any way possible,

606
00:48:33,195 --> 00:48:37,015
so make sure to find your daughter-in-law's brother.

607
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:39,145
Yes, Your Majesty.

608
00:48:39,145 --> 00:48:42,855
I will search for him everywhere.

609
00:48:45,815 --> 00:48:48,255
Human trafficking.

610
00:48:49,505 --> 00:48:54,555
The piles of documents showing how you have stolen charity rice are here.

611
00:48:55,745 --> 00:49:00,025
And this is the evidence you gave to the Finance Minister's wife.

612
00:49:03,255 --> 00:49:07,185
You kidnapped and tried to murder the Grand Merchant before my eyes.

613
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:09,685
Oh, and you tried to kill me as well.

614
00:49:09,685 --> 00:49:11,895
Yes, yes.

615
00:49:12,805 --> 00:49:14,915
Kang Pil Jik,

616
00:49:15,945 --> 00:49:22,215
it will not be easy to punish you legally as the Captain of the Capital Garrison.

617
00:49:22,215 --> 00:49:26,365
That is why I must use a different method.

618
00:49:33,545 --> 00:49:35,545
What are you doing right now?

619
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:38,775
Are you about to strike my neck for personal reasons in the Capital Garrison?

620
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:43,595
I do not need to be Park Su Ho when I am dealing with you.

621
00:49:43,595 --> 00:49:46,275
I need to act as Im Hyeon Jae.

622
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,845
- Stay outside!
- Yes, Sir!

623
00:49:48,845 --> 00:49:50,925
What is this! Where are you going!

624
00:49:50,925 --> 00:49:53,675
Garrison Commander! Call the Garrison Commander! Garrison Commander!

625
00:49:53,675 --> 00:49:57,505
Let us just end this here.

626
00:49:59,155 --> 00:50:02,455
Wait! Wait a moment!

627
00:50:02,455 --> 00:50:04,175
I mean...

628
00:50:06,515 --> 00:50:11,695
I invited one more special guest to this happy occasion.

629
00:50:11,695 --> 00:50:13,615
A special guest?

630
00:50:13,615 --> 00:50:18,165
You will be quite glad to see her as well, Left State Minister.

631
00:50:19,355 --> 00:50:20,765
Have her come in.

632
00:50:20,765 --> 00:50:22,735
Yes.

633
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:13,515
Your Majesty! What is this!

634
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:16,295
I guess you are quite shocked.

635
00:51:16,295 --> 00:51:18,785
I am sorry for not telling you in advance.

636
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:24,085
Your Majesty, I am sorry that my carelessness

637
00:51:24,085 --> 00:51:30,405
has led to concern for the Queen Dowager.

638
00:51:30,405 --> 00:51:36,415
I am also at fault for not knowing properly what kind of person you were.

639
00:51:36,415 --> 00:51:40,255
In order to ask for your forgiveness, Your Majesty...

640
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,695
and...

641
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:47,445
to congratulate...

642
00:51:51,255 --> 00:51:55,515
the Left State Minister for his joyous occasion,

643
00:51:55,515 --> 00:51:59,425
I prepared some tea for you to enjoy.

644
00:52:24,855 --> 00:52:30,695
It is the tea that I offered up to the late king on the night he passed away.

645
00:52:31,765 --> 00:52:34,695
Do you remember it?

646
00:52:36,585 --> 00:52:39,725
How would I know that?

647
00:52:54,295 --> 00:52:59,225
It was direct orders from you, Left State Minister.

648
00:52:59,225 --> 00:53:04,445
To think you have already forgotten all about it. I am disappointed.

649
00:53:04,445 --> 00:53:10,345
Are you saying the Left State Minister told you to offer up this tea to Father?

650
00:53:10,345 --> 00:53:12,805
Yes, Your Majesty.

651
00:53:13,505 --> 00:53:19,045
Perhaps if he tries the tea, he may remember.

652
00:53:26,345 --> 00:53:30,125
I am curious. Please go ahead and prepare it for us.

653
00:54:59,275 --> 00:55:01,195
I am the Captain of the Capital Garrison, Park Su Ho.

654
00:55:01,195 --> 00:55:03,875
I have something to tell His Majesty urgently.

655
00:55:10,555 --> 00:55:13,015
What is the matter?

656
00:55:58,365 --> 00:56:00,775
This tea has such a distinct scent.

657
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:04,055
Do you still not remember, Left State Minister?

658
00:56:04,055 --> 00:56:07,641
I do not remember at all.

659
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,585
Goodness, I guess I have no choice

660
00:56:12,585 --> 00:56:17,235
but to give this first cup to the main reason for this celebration,

661
00:56:17,235 --> 00:56:20,265
your son, Left State Minister.

662
00:56:46,515 --> 00:56:48,755
Drink first.

663
00:56:52,925 --> 00:56:54,615
Your Majesty,

664
00:56:55,265 --> 00:56:58,485
this is our only method left.

665
00:57:00,955 --> 00:57:03,915
Your Majesty's grace knows no bounds.

666
00:57:03,915 --> 00:57:06,135
All right.

667
00:57:06,135 --> 00:57:10,725
In order to prove that the Left State Minister assassinated Father,

668
00:57:10,725 --> 00:57:14,285
I should resort to something cowardly, too.

669
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:19,645
No father would just watch as his son dies.

670
00:57:41,105 --> 00:57:43,065
Your Majesty!

671
00:57:44,955 --> 00:57:49,895
How could my husband, the son, drink such a precious tea first?

672
00:57:49,895 --> 00:57:53,235
This is not the place for you to step forward!

673
00:57:55,425 --> 00:57:58,435
Your daughter-in-law must be quite nervous

674
00:57:58,435 --> 00:58:00,585
since it is her first time in the palace.

675
00:58:00,585 --> 00:58:02,485
I am sorry.

676
00:58:02,485 --> 00:58:06,735
My daughter-in-law only learned about household manners and respecting one's elders.

677
00:58:06,735 --> 00:58:09,155
She only acted thus because she does not know about palace manners,

678
00:58:09,155 --> 00:58:11,555
so please forgive her graciously.

679
00:58:11,555 --> 00:58:13,985
Do not worry.

680
00:58:14,505 --> 00:58:18,185
I am doing this today because I have my reasons.

681
00:58:18,185 --> 00:58:19,925
So, Left State Minister,

682
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:24,605
it is all right for me to offer the tea

683
00:58:24,605 --> 00:58:27,165
to your son first. Right?

684
00:58:28,495 --> 00:58:33,565
How could I go against your wishes, Your Majesty?

685
00:58:33,565 --> 00:58:36,685
Do as you desire, Your Majesty.

686
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:51,215
Then I will drink the tea first.

687
00:59:04,535 --> 00:59:06,475
- Wait!
- Stop right there!

688
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:15,005
Forget it.

689
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:21,005
That is enough.

690
00:59:28,745 --> 00:59:31,145
You are quite...

691
00:59:31,145 --> 00:59:33,805
incredible.

692
00:59:34,695 --> 00:59:39,995
I did not know you would be this heartless even toward your son.

693
00:59:40,805 --> 00:59:47,025
Your Majesty, the Finance Minister's wife is a criminal who should be at the interrogation site, not here!

694
00:59:47,025 --> 00:59:52,975
How could you invite a criminal deserving of death here and listen to such deceitful lies?

695
00:59:52,975 --> 00:59:57,645
You outside, drag away the Finance Minister's wife immediately!

696
00:59:57,645 --> 01:00:01,625
Yes! I am a criminal!

697
01:00:01,625 --> 01:00:04,045
Fifteen years ago,

698
01:00:05,345 --> 01:00:07,855
under the Left State Minister's orders,

699
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:12,855
I offered this tea to the late king,

700
01:00:15,585 --> 01:00:18,165
and poisoned him to death.

701
01:00:19,235 --> 01:00:20,365
[Poisoned to death]

702
01:00:20,365 --> 01:00:23,165
Inside this tea...

703
01:00:23,895 --> 01:00:26,605
are poisonous flower petals.

704
01:00:30,965 --> 01:00:35,895
Did you just say you offered up poison to His Majesty?

705
01:00:35,895 --> 01:00:37,625
What are you all doing!

706
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:40,905
Drag away the Finance Minister's wife this instant!

707
01:00:40,905 --> 01:00:44,055
Left State Minister, be still!

708
01:00:45,455 --> 01:00:49,435
Since you did not even value your own son's life,

709
01:00:50,255 --> 01:00:52,725
I have no choice...

710
01:00:53,955 --> 01:00:57,915
but to prove it myself.

711
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,175
No, you must not!

712
01:01:16,645 --> 01:01:19,035
Your Majesty...

713
01:01:19,035 --> 01:01:21,725
Before I came here,

714
01:01:21,725 --> 01:01:24,525
I already drank...

715
01:01:29,115 --> 01:01:31,125
this tea...

716
01:01:33,795 --> 01:01:34,985
Goodness, Madam!

717
01:01:34,985 --> 01:01:37,995
You out there, call the physician! Hurry!

718
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:39,445
Madam!

719
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:42,535
Call the physician! The physician!

720
01:01:43,435 --> 01:01:44,765
Madam...

721
01:01:44,765 --> 01:01:46,975
Left State Minister's daughter-in-law...

722
01:01:47,915 --> 01:01:51,095
Poor daughter-in-law...

723
01:01:51,095 --> 01:01:55,385
I really thought I would live a privileged life.

724
01:01:55,385 --> 01:02:01,845
I thought it was unfair that my life was messed up, thinking it was not my fault.

725
01:02:01,845 --> 01:02:05,725
But now that I look back on it,

726
01:02:05,725 --> 01:02:10,595
I'm the one who messed all of it up.

727
01:02:10,595 --> 01:02:11,915
Stay still.

728
01:02:11,915 --> 01:02:14,725
The poison is spreading.

729
01:02:15,855 --> 01:02:18,035
Madam...

730
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:26,555
Your brother...

731
01:02:26,555 --> 01:02:33,065
already died at the Left State Minister's hands.

732
01:02:57,585 --> 01:03:02,725
[Knight Flower]

733
01:03:02,725 --> 01:03:04,845
[Unfinished Story]

734
01:03:04,845 --> 01:03:07,025
Stop right there!

735
01:03:09,735 --> 01:03:12,085
I looked all over for you.

736
01:03:12,085 --> 01:03:14,755
I have something I want to ask you.

737
01:03:17,495 --> 01:03:19,785
Once you find out your brother's whereabouts

738
01:03:19,785 --> 01:03:22,065
and expose all of the Left State Minister's crimes,

739
01:03:22,065 --> 01:03:23,815
how will you...

740
01:03:24,345 --> 01:03:27,065
live after that?

741
01:03:29,015 --> 01:03:31,115
I never thought about it.

742
01:03:31,115 --> 01:03:32,935
Then...

743
01:03:33,545 --> 01:03:36,545
could you please think about it?

744
01:03:37,425 --> 01:03:39,325
And...

745
01:03:40,295 --> 01:03:42,465
could you tell me about it?

746
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:45,955
Why are you asking that of me?

747
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:47,765
I...

748
01:03:48,755 --> 01:03:51,375
have thought about it.

749
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:53,385
After getting revenge for my parents

750
01:03:53,385 --> 01:03:56,235
and completing His Majesty's mission,

751
01:03:58,355 --> 01:04:00,165
I thought...

752
01:04:01,965 --> 01:04:05,165
it would be good to live...

753
01:04:06,015 --> 01:04:08,625
just for you, then.

754
01:04:11,545 --> 01:04:15,085
I will do my best to finish this mission,

755
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:21,675
so please do not get hurt

756
01:04:21,675 --> 01:04:24,675
in the very least...

757
01:04:25,705 --> 01:04:27,785
until that day comes.

758
01:04:27,785 --> 01:04:34,615
♫ It was love from the beginning ♫

759
01:04:34,615 --> 01:04:40,845
♫ It was fate from the start ♫

760
01:04:40,845 --> 01:04:49,045
♫ All of my feelings for you ♫

761
01:04:49,045 --> 01:04:59,545
♫ They were all for you from the start ♫

762
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:04,835
I will make sure to find out the truth about what happened today!

763
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:07,675
Until then, none of you

764
01:05:07,675 --> 01:05:09,815
better make a move.

765
01:05:09,815 --> 01:05:12,655
Did I not say I know nothing of it?

766
01:05:12,655 --> 01:05:15,325
Did you kill Cho Seong Hoo?

767
01:05:15,325 --> 01:05:18,995
If you leave like this, will you never come back to this house?

768
01:05:18,995 --> 01:05:20,425
What do you mean, the Madam disappeared?

769
01:05:20,425 --> 01:05:24,575
I will make sure to see Father pay for his crime.

770
01:05:24,575 --> 01:05:26,765
There is someone who came to see you, Your Excellency.

771
01:05:26,765 --> 01:05:32,235
I will be sure to send him to hell with my hands.
