1
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:42,722
My Lady.

2
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:45,702
Even still, this is a bit...

3
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:49,862
I will take care of the rest, so you only need to sit still.

4
00:00:49,862 --> 00:00:53,362
As long as he has eyes, he will realize it right away.

5
00:00:53,362 --> 00:00:56,762
What do you think about just talking to him honestly?

6
00:00:56,762 --> 00:00:59,482
He must be a sketchy man since he wanted to meet secretly.

7
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:01,922
I will find out who it is at the right time,

8
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:05,422
so do not forget to pretend to be surprised to see me and run away when I show up.

9
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:10,832
You are a natural-born widow.

10
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:12,962
Let us go.

11
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:19,772
Is the man called Cho Seong Hoo

12
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:23,232
the one you and His Majesty are looking for?

13
00:01:23,232 --> 00:01:25,542
I cannot be sure.

14
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:29,682
Even His Majesty, who was the crown prince at the time, did not know the late king

15
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:32,782
had a shadow soldier disguised as a Royal Guard.

16
00:01:32,782 --> 00:01:36,022
In that case, his younger sister, who was his only family

17
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:38,732
might not know anything, either. Right?

18
00:01:39,672 --> 00:01:42,112
She might not know what happened that day,

19
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:45,352
but she might have heard about his whereabouts after the matter.

20
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:50,392
He might even have delivered something to the remaining family members.

21
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:55,992
If Cho Seong Hoo's sister is not a trustworthy person...

22
00:01:57,932 --> 00:02:01,952
Where did you leave the fan I gave you last time?

23
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:03,832
Oh, the thing is...

24
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,912
I-I left it in the night-duty room.

25
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:08,832
Oh, the night-duty room?

26
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:12,252
You are even lying to me now.

27
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:14,522
W-Wait, Brother—

28
00:02:14,522 --> 00:02:16,792
Where did you find this?

29
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,532
While I meet his sister,

30
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:27,602
you just stand guard outside properly.

31
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,912
Wait, Brother, this fan was...

32
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:48,532
Wait a moment here.

33
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:50,012
Okay.

34
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:12,252
Is there anyone who knows you came here today?

35
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:20,102
Can you promise not to tell anyone about this meeting?

36
00:03:24,352 --> 00:03:31,402
Madam, this is a very important matter pertaining to your brother's life or death.

37
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:34,182
Can you promise me?

38
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:40,182
If you cannot promise me,

39
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:44,052
I cannot tell you anything more.

40
00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:58,992
Who are you?

41
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:01,562
Do not turn around.

42
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:05,212
Answer my question right now! Right now!

43
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:12,032
Step back.

44
00:04:15,962 --> 00:04:17,702
Sir?

45
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,942
Madam?

46
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:21,762
Wait, no!

47
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:31,492
- Wait, Brother—
- Sir Royal Secretary of Defense?

48
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:33,362
Do you know me?

49
00:04:33,362 --> 00:04:34,542
I do not!

50
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:37,442
Oh, my! Oh, no!

51
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:47,642
The woman who left just now...

52
00:04:47,642 --> 00:04:49,522
Is she the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law?

53
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,302
W-Well...

54
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,242
Do not dare!

55
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:55,812
Brother!

56
00:04:57,592 --> 00:05:01,292
Stop right there!

57
00:05:08,802 --> 00:05:10,822
- What on Earth are you doing?
- Brother.

58
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:13,322
You should have gotten him, not me!

59
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:17,982
I have my reasons, so go back first, and I will come to you.

60
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:20,052
Hey, Su Ho!

61
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:25,352
He...

62
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:28,282
pushed me.

63
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:42,242
[Knight Flower - Episode 9: Truth or Falsehood]

64
00:05:44,232 --> 00:05:47,622
You should have talked to him properly in the first place.

65
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:49,032
Why take out your sword first?

66
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:53,432
If he said he was the Royal Secretary of Defense, I would not have drawn my sword.

67
00:05:53,432 --> 00:05:57,472
Anyhow, what could have happened to your brother?

68
00:05:57,472 --> 00:06:01,392
The Finance Minister's wife and even the Royal Secretary now.

69
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:04,542
The Captain is probably headed this way.

70
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:07,292
I will ask him once he is here.

71
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:12,182
I told the Captain not to even come near Myeongdogak.

72
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:14,662
What? Why did you?

73
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:17,792
You kept getting involved with the Captain,

74
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:21,942
so I was worried you would get into big trouble one day.

75
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:24,682
Because you are still a widow and

76
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:27,282
the Captain is clearly a healthy young man.

77
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:30,192
Wait! Why discuss a widow and a man here?

78
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:32,132
This matter has to do with my brother and—

79
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:35,552
What are you going to do if you start growing feelings?

80
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:36,892
Yong Deok and Madam Baek—

81
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:40,092
Gosh, seriously, have you gone mad?

82
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:43,462
Grand Merchant, are you inside?

83
00:06:55,672 --> 00:06:56,772
You are here.

84
00:06:56,772 --> 00:07:00,552
I came to discuss a matter with Madam for a moment.

85
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:04,432
Now, then. You can have your talk.

86
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:12,092
Please remember that what I told you is still in effect.

87
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:52,522
You should get rid of any possible trouble now.

88
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:55,792
Elder and that brat do not seem to know anything about that matter.

89
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:58,552
So, if we move unprepared, we will be asking for trouble.

90
00:07:58,552 --> 00:08:00,672
They might have pretended not to know on purpose.

91
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:03,362
I am going to wait for the best time to get rid of him for good.

92
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:05,122
So, do not act thoughtlessly.

93
00:08:05,122 --> 00:08:06,732
Yes.

94
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:15,572
You are saying you cannot tell me why the Royal Secretary of Defense is looking for my brother?

95
00:08:15,572 --> 00:08:20,092
On that matter, I cannot tell you anything.

96
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:21,922
Please go back now, then.

97
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:24,642
I have nothing more to say, either.

98
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,512
Grand Merchant asked me

99
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:32,962
if I planned to wither you to death by confining you within the walls.

100
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:41,692
I do not intend to wither you to death,

101
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:44,462
but I do not want you in danger, either.

102
00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:47,182
So I wished for you to do nothing and

103
00:08:47,182 --> 00:08:49,962
I had no idea of what I should do.

104
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:54,062
So, did you find an answer?

105
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:57,772
That answer was not for me to find.

106
00:08:57,772 --> 00:09:00,822
It might have already been decided.

107
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:05,042
Why do you have to be the one Brother is looking for and

108
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:09,222
why are you always there wherever I go?

109
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:15,282
Now, I see you and I were subject to the same fate.

110
00:09:16,902 --> 00:09:20,652
My original name is Im Hyeon Jae.

111
00:09:20,652 --> 00:09:25,202
Im Kang, the last Chief Royal Guard of the late king,

112
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:27,442
was my father.

113
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:31,062
The Chief Royal Guard's entire family was massacred, and

114
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:33,282
a few palace guards disappeared.

115
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:36,802
So, the massacre that happened

116
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:39,072
on the day Brother disappeared...

117
00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:42,652
My current Brother rescued me out of

118
00:09:42,652 --> 00:09:45,302
the pool of blood where I was dying.

119
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:50,422
And I have been living, hiding who my parents are.

120
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:54,642
What on Earth had happened back then?

121
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:58,512
My brother and I are seeking the truth of that day.

122
00:09:58,512 --> 00:10:02,412
If so, I guess I should meet with the Royal Secretary of Defense again.

123
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:04,072
It will be a dangerous endeavor.

124
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:06,312
Stop worrying about me now.

125
00:10:06,312 --> 00:10:10,642
Also, I am stronger than the Royal Secretary of Defense.

126
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:15,192
We must find them.

127
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:20,232
My brother and your name as well.

128
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:41,612
Madam?

129
00:10:41,612 --> 00:10:43,902
Stop right there!

130
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:50,012
That was Sir Captain's fan?

131
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:53,652
The one Yeon Seon was trying to protect.

132
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:58,252
That witness cannot reveal her identity for personal reasons.

133
00:10:58,252 --> 00:11:00,082
Cannot reveal her identity.

134
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:01,722
Royal Secretary of Defense?

135
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:03,062
The masked one.

136
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,122
So, who is this person you are talking about?

137
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,262
I am not telling you, Brother.

138
00:11:08,262 --> 00:11:09,892
The one he needs to protect.

139
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:11,812
You are even lying to me now.

140
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:14,302
The owner of the fan.

141
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:22,542
What could the Royal Secretary of Defense be looking for?

142
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:25,842
He is looking for my brother's belongings.

143
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:30,522
But the only thing Brother left behind is this sword.

144
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:33,202
He could not be looking for that. Right?

145
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:36,772
I even aimed this sword at his neck,

146
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:40,682
so he would have recognized it if he was looking for it.

147
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:44,012
Gosh, what could he be looking for, then?

148
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:47,262
Whatever it is,

149
00:11:47,262 --> 00:11:50,322
I reckon I must be the one to find it.

150
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:55,552
There is a person who even experienced the unthinkable.

151
00:11:55,552 --> 00:11:58,182
Just like that, 15 years ago,

152
00:11:58,182 --> 00:12:03,912
I alone survived in that bloody mess.

153
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:34,352
You said you will come soon, but what took you so long?

154
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:36,192
Brother.

155
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:45,962
I could not even sleep at all because I waited for you all night.

156
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:48,632
Why not just come tomorrow?

157
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:52,822
I am sorry. I feared I would wake you up, for it was too late.

158
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:55,382
The Left State Minister's daughter-in-law is...

159
00:12:56,062 --> 00:12:58,432
- the masked one. Right?
- Sorry?

160
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:02,992
Well, the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law cannot even leave her home.

161
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:06,882
So how could she be the masked one who is seen everywhere in the capital?

162
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:08,832
Absolutely not.

163
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:16,262
I only asked if the masked one from yesterday was the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law.

164
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:21,292
I mean, it did not look like it was her first time doing that.

165
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:24,172
- Brother—
- And from what I surmised,

166
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:28,092
that madam also had your fan in her possession.

167
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:30,672
Why?

168
00:13:30,672 --> 00:13:34,852
Must I go to the Left State Minister's house to confirm?

169
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:42,512
There is no need.

170
00:13:42,512 --> 00:13:47,602
The Left State Minister's daughter-in-law wishes to meet you again.

171
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:54,982
Please have just one bite, Mother.

172
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:04,702
No matter how much I think about it, my Jeong must be

173
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:08,362
appearing in my dreams because he resents me.

174
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:11,662
Since his corpse could not be recovered,

175
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:14,252
he probably cannot even rest in peace in the afterlife.

176
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:16,882
Please do not say such things, Mother.

177
00:14:16,882 --> 00:14:20,682
It is all because my efforts are lacking.

178
00:14:21,642 --> 00:14:25,002
I must go to the temple to pray.

179
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:26,602
I will escort you.

180
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:30,982
How can I have you leave the house when I am going to be absent, too?

181
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:35,482
I will go there with Jae Yi, so you can stay home.

182
00:14:35,992 --> 00:14:38,302
[Madam...]

183
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:48,132
You seem quite busy these days.

184
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:49,692
What is it you want to say?

185
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:52,932
There is a lot I want to say to you, Sir.

186
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:57,642
You said it was for Midam, but you just made me go to Myeongdogak many times.

187
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:59,612
Bi Chan.

188
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:03,042
Deliver this to your Midam.

189
00:15:04,092 --> 00:15:06,562
By the way, how do I do that?

190
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:10,662
If you go to Myeongdogak, there will be a person who will deliver this letter.

191
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:14,012
Yes, I will accomplish my mission!

192
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:15,802
And also,

193
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:18,752
I plan to investigate Kang Pil Jik again.

194
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,392
What?

195
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:24,222
But the Garrison Commander told you not to even go near him.

196
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:29,232
That is why I am especially letting you know only.

197
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:32,702
Well, in that case—

198
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:35,522
For now, I will take on the Garrison Commander.

199
00:15:35,522 --> 00:15:40,222
Go find the transaction history of the Finance Minister's trades with Kang Pil Jik's merchandising.

200
00:15:40,222 --> 00:15:41,852
Yes, Sir!

201
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:46,672
Where the heck did Bong Mal-daek go?

202
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:49,082
No one knows where she went first thing in the morning?

203
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:52,122
- Well, the thing is...
- Mother said she was going to the temple.

204
00:15:52,122 --> 00:15:54,352
Someone needs to make the preparations!

205
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:58,482
- I am sorry.
- Stop raising your voice. Come inside and prepare.

206
00:15:59,982 --> 00:16:02,902
My, do you know where she went?

207
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:11,542
Young Master!

208
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:13,792
- What is it?
- I apologize.

209
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:19,672
- Young Master!
- What is it?

210
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:23,122
I am sorry, I apologize.

211
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:27,252
I am counting on you.

212
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:35,922
Young man, have you seen a handsome and tall man around here?

213
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:39,402
That would be me. How could I help you?

214
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:44,902
Young Master—

215
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,682
Whoa, look who we have here.

216
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:51,512
Long time no see! Long time no see!

217
00:16:52,182 --> 00:16:53,662
Long time?

218
00:16:53,662 --> 00:16:55,802
No's family?

219
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:04,342
Stop crying.

220
00:17:04,342 --> 00:17:06,002
I am sorry.

221
00:17:06,002 --> 00:17:08,872
I have been thinking if I should visit today

222
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:10,802
or that I should go visit tomorrow?

223
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:14,742
How in this good world can this be?

224
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:19,452
You have been alive and well like this!

225
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:23,142
Why did you not come back home?

226
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,882
Just like a wandering ghost—

227
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:30,902
Bong Mal-daek, relax. Relax, Bong Mal-daek.

228
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:32,762
Relax. You have to calm down.

229
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:35,122
Take a deep breath.

230
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:47,572
There, there. Did you also think I really died, Bong Mal-daek?

231
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:50,882
It was not that I was said to be dead?

232
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,562
You passed away on your wedding day, and

233
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:58,432
we could not even find the corpse.

234
00:17:58,432 --> 00:18:03,712
So, Madam was bedridden for more than a year.

235
00:18:03,712 --> 00:18:08,602
Did Father really tell Mother that I died?

236
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,992
Was he so cruel like that?

237
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:14,392
Let us not do this here.

238
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:16,992
Hurry up and go home.

239
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:23,142
Bong Mal-daek, things might become more complicated if I go back now.

240
00:18:23,142 --> 00:18:25,622
As soon as my business is done, I will come back.

241
00:18:25,622 --> 00:18:28,712
So I am leaving Mother in your care until then.

242
00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:32,812
You are the only one I can count on, Bong Mal-daek.

243
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,442
That is true, for sure.

244
00:18:35,442 --> 00:18:38,892
Do not worry about that.

245
00:18:40,832 --> 00:18:42,422
Give it!

246
00:18:51,952 --> 00:18:55,942
Why are you bothering to send me off?

247
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:58,392
You will be late for work because of me.

248
00:18:58,392 --> 00:19:03,532
No, I already told them I would be late.

249
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:09,392
Also, your husband is this country's left-state minister.

250
00:19:09,392 --> 00:19:13,912
I am going to be a bit late to send off my precious wife on a long journey.

251
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:16,682
So, who would dare to criticize me?

252
00:19:16,682 --> 00:19:21,072
Father, you only care about Mother all the time.

253
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:24,392
You better take excellent care of Mother.

254
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:25,982
Yes.

255
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:29,442
Do not worry about the house chores, and have a peaceful time.

256
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:32,822
I will be back safely, so do not worry.

257
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:37,172
There shall not be even an ounce of lacking in serving your madam!

258
00:19:37,172 --> 00:19:39,392
Yes!

259
00:19:39,392 --> 00:19:42,492
Please have a safe trip, Mother.

260
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:52,032
Let us go.

261
00:20:25,552 --> 00:20:27,062
Daughter-in-Law.

262
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:28,262
Yes, Father.

263
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:30,192
You can tend to your business now.

264
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:31,872
Yes.

265
00:20:40,892 --> 00:20:43,962
- Hear ye!
- Yes, Your Excellency.

266
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:51,712
Yes, Your Excellency.

267
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:00,332
My Lady!

268
00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:03,612
You got a letter from Myeongdogak.

269
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:05,272
Is that so?

270
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:09,842
[Please think carefully over what we discussed and let me know, Madam]

271
00:21:09,842 --> 00:21:11,822
I must leave right away.

272
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:16,232
- Tell the servants I will be praying at the shrine all day.
- Yes.

273
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:20,582
Since Mother is not home, they probably will not come looking for me.

274
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:31,122
My, is it not funnier the more you think about it?

275
00:21:31,822 --> 00:21:34,452
- Your Majesty—
- The one who shows up on moonlit nights

276
00:21:34,452 --> 00:21:38,772
to help the poor and the troubled, ever so thankfully,

277
00:21:38,772 --> 00:21:41,572
is the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law?

278
00:21:42,412 --> 00:21:45,062
The first time you told me this story,

279
00:21:45,062 --> 00:21:50,422
I was not comfortable sitting here, thinking how desperate my people were

280
00:21:50,422 --> 00:21:54,192
to come up with such an imagination.

281
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:57,862
The Left State Minister dreams of a country only for the nobles and

282
00:21:57,862 --> 00:22:02,062
his daughter-in-law wears a mask for the people, huh?

283
00:22:02,062 --> 00:22:07,922
I am so curious what the Left State Minister would do if he were to find out about this.

284
00:22:08,552 --> 00:22:15,522
Your Majesty, could I dare request of you as your old friend?

285
00:22:15,522 --> 00:22:17,022
Go ahead.

286
00:22:17,022 --> 00:22:22,092
Would you leave the matter of the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law to me for a while?

287
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:24,062
For what reason?

288
00:22:24,062 --> 00:22:27,082
There are people who are worried about her.

289
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:29,362
Could it be...

290
00:22:30,662 --> 00:22:32,102
you are talking about yourself?

291
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:35,282
G-Gosh, I am not.

292
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:39,312
I seek to protect the people who are

293
00:22:39,312 --> 00:22:41,802
worried about her.

294
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:45,332
Do not worry.

295
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:48,012
She is no one other than Cho Seong Hoo's sister.

296
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:50,932
Of course, we should protect her.

297
00:22:50,932 --> 00:22:53,232
Thank you, Your Majesty.

298
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:55,262
Really, though?

299
00:22:55,262 --> 00:22:57,302
I am not.

300
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:13,342
It has been a long time.

301
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:22,202
You have not changed at all.

302
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:25,352
And you aged a lot, Father.

303
00:23:25,352 --> 00:23:29,192
Have you forgotten what I said I would do if you returned?

304
00:23:29,192 --> 00:23:31,612
I did not even return, but you already had me dead.

305
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:34,422
It was the best way for everyone.

306
00:23:34,422 --> 00:23:36,652
Who is included in "everyone"?

307
00:23:37,892 --> 00:23:39,292
Even if you treat me a dead son—

308
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,592
No, even if you will kill me here, I do not mind.

309
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:46,012
However, how can you tell Mother her alive son is dead?

310
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:48,042
You should have said she should just consider me dead.

311
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:50,542
How heartbroken must she have been for all those years?

312
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:55,202
A son who abandoned his parents dares to worry about his parents?

313
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:57,492
When you said I should consider you a dead child,

314
00:23:57,492 --> 00:24:01,132
did you think you would ever get to see your mother?

315
00:24:01,662 --> 00:24:03,732
It was my fault.

316
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:06,882
If you know, go back now.

317
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:11,602
Do not even think about coming back to Joseon ever again.

318
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:15,102
No.

319
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:21,442
Now that I realize my mistake, I must correct myself.

320
00:24:21,442 --> 00:24:27,462
I will seek forgiveness from Mother and my wife, who is living as a widow because of me.

321
00:24:27,462 --> 00:24:29,782
So you take responsibility for your mistake, Father.

322
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:32,502
- How dare you—
- I was already considered dead.

323
00:24:32,502 --> 00:24:36,092
I will do my best to atone as I live and consider it given to me for free.

324
00:24:36,092 --> 00:24:37,622
Is that so?

325
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:40,282
In that case, leave the capital first thing tomorrow.

326
00:24:40,282 --> 00:24:43,362
- Father.
- That is how

327
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:47,792
you can atone for your sins for this family's sake.

328
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:50,262
You are already a dead man.

329
00:24:50,262 --> 00:24:53,352
The dead cannot come back to life.

330
00:24:53,352 --> 00:24:58,062
Do not make your mother lose her son twice.

331
00:25:19,682 --> 00:25:21,502
Junior Joo!

332
00:25:21,502 --> 00:25:24,302
Senior Ggot, why are you outside?

333
00:25:24,302 --> 00:25:28,312
The sun is high up. Where have you been without even opening up your stand?

334
00:25:28,312 --> 00:25:31,192
How will you make a living doing a shabby job like this?

335
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:33,452
You are so right.

336
00:25:34,762 --> 00:25:36,552
Living is so hard.

337
00:25:36,552 --> 00:25:38,652
Well, of course, living is hard.

338
00:25:38,652 --> 00:25:41,422
Is there anything that is easy in this world?

339
00:25:45,492 --> 00:25:49,472
Still, you should cheer up.

340
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,662
It is a dried persimmon.

341
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:59,932
This lady I know said she feels better eating dried persimmon

342
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:02,662
while looking outside the walls and sighing.

343
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:05,112
Whoa, it is delicious.

344
00:26:05,112 --> 00:26:07,412
I am really feeling better.

345
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:11,842
But that lady must have had a hard life, too.

346
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:14,352
I do not really know because I am young.

347
00:26:14,352 --> 00:26:18,292
But they said a widow cannot go past the walls.

348
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:25,282
By chance, could the lady you know be the Left State—

349
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:33,952
She is my favorite person in this world.

350
00:26:33,952 --> 00:26:37,572
But she seemed sad, sitting alone in the annex,

351
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:39,732
which made me upset.

352
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,842
I see.

353
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,192
I feel really sorry for her.

354
00:26:55,192 --> 00:26:57,292
Why would you be sorry, Junior?

355
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:58,732
Oh, it is nothing.

356
00:26:58,732 --> 00:27:01,852
Do you have more dried persimmons? It is really delicious.

357
00:27:01,852 --> 00:27:05,322
If you cheered up now, hurry up and open your business.

358
00:27:05,322 --> 00:27:07,412
Yes, Senior Ggot.

359
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:18,262
Kang Pil Jik and the Finance Minister's wife are step-siblings?

360
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:21,742
I could not tell you because I was told to keep it a secret.

361
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:23,922
Whose side are you on, Grand Merchant?

362
00:27:23,922 --> 00:27:26,462
In my opinion, you two are on the same side and

363
00:27:26,462 --> 00:27:29,342
I am the only one on my side.

364
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:33,842
I wondered why the Finance Minister's wife's family,

365
00:27:33,842 --> 00:27:37,402
the Royal Family's in-laws, had to marry someone like Yeom Heung Jib.

366
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:43,062
In the end, she lived through all that shame because of her family's shame.

367
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:46,022
Are you pitying the Finance Minister's wife right now?

368
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:47,472
No, I am not.

369
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:51,712
I would not have let the Finance Minister's wife have her way with me if I had known.

370
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,752
Why are there so many people who hide their true faces?

371
00:27:56,522 --> 00:28:00,372
I do not think it is something you should say.

372
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:09,912
Could you find out how the Finance Minister's wife and Father are connected?

373
00:28:09,912 --> 00:28:13,252
Their meeting a few days ago keeps bothering me.

374
00:28:13,252 --> 00:28:16,032
It will not be so easy.

375
00:28:17,082 --> 00:28:19,212
Should I find out more about Kang Pil Jik?

376
00:28:19,212 --> 00:28:25,102
If Kang Pil Jik is also linked to the Finance Minister's wife and the Left State Minister...

377
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:27,492
Although Father kept things hidden from me,

378
00:28:27,492 --> 00:28:30,252
he still spent his whole life for this country.

379
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:35,062
I do not wish to think that he is linked to a wretched man like him.

380
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:37,882
The Captain will be here soon,

381
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,952
so I will prepare some tea.

[Myeongdogak]

383
00:28:49,802 --> 00:28:52,072
Oh, is Grand Merchant inside?

384
00:28:52,072 --> 00:28:53,612
She is probably in her office.

385
00:28:53,612 --> 00:28:55,502
Thank you, it is appreciated.

386
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:56,992
"Thank"?

387
00:29:00,052 --> 00:29:02,372
Thank you.

388
00:29:02,372 --> 00:29:04,632
"Thank" you.

389
00:29:04,632 --> 00:29:06,602
That is what it means.

390
00:29:09,242 --> 00:29:12,322
Thank you.

391
00:29:12,322 --> 00:29:14,632
Grand Merchant, are you inside?

392
00:29:18,312 --> 00:29:20,232
Grand Merchant.

393
00:29:22,622 --> 00:29:24,692
Grand—

394
00:29:24,692 --> 00:29:26,742
Grand Merchant—

395
00:29:32,082 --> 00:29:34,082
Grand Merchant!

396
00:29:36,372 --> 00:29:38,062
Uh-oh.

397
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:42,622
I apologize.

398
00:29:42,622 --> 00:29:46,022
By the way, have we not seen each other before?

399
00:29:46,022 --> 00:29:47,452
No, we have not.

400
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,822
I am sure I know you.

401
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:50,642
Could you tell me where you live?

402
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:52,862
I reckon we might have passed by on the streets.

403
00:29:52,862 --> 00:29:55,722
- I do not have a home!
- Sorry?

404
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:58,652
What is the matter?

405
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,582
Oh.

406
00:30:02,102 --> 00:30:04,692
I came to meet Grand Merchant, but someone else was inside.

407
00:30:04,692 --> 00:30:08,682
But she is definitely someone I know.

408
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:18,112
You do not know her.

409
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:22,342
Wait. I said I know her, so why are you telling me I do not?

410
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:24,272
There is no way you would know her.

411
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:26,262
Go find Grand Merchant elsewhere.

412
00:30:26,262 --> 00:30:27,762
Wait—

413
00:30:31,772 --> 00:30:33,872
I remembered.

414
00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:42,232
She is your lover.

415
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:43,932
Am I right?

416
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:46,302
It is not like that, so hurry up and leave!

417
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:50,542
Okay, I will go away for a beautiful couple.

418
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:57,452
Have a good time.

419
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,752
Goodness, goodness.

420
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:06,382
Gosh.

421
00:31:11,552 --> 00:31:13,472
Why are you so careless?

422
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:16,212
You might as well let everyone see your face.

423
00:31:16,212 --> 00:31:18,232
I do not like him for some reason.

424
00:31:18,232 --> 00:31:21,682
He says weird things, and I get a bad feeling whenever I see him.

425
00:31:21,682 --> 00:31:23,292
I am sure we are ill-fated.

426
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:24,802
What did that man do wrong?

427
00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:29,122
That man only believes you are my lover.

428
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,022
N-No, that is not what I meant—

429
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:35,222
Grand Merchant says weird things because you say such things too easily.

430
00:31:35,222 --> 00:31:37,742
What did Grand Merchant say?

431
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:42,692
What are you going to do if you start growing feelings?

432
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,212
Yong Deok and Madam Baek—

433
00:31:44,212 --> 00:31:47,322
Gosh, seriously, have you gone mad?

434
00:31:49,072 --> 00:31:51,942
Anyhow, did the Royal Secretary not come with you?

00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:55,082
You can come with me to the bookstore now.

436
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:58,122
- I understand.
- Also...

437
00:31:58,122 --> 00:32:01,822
Brother knows your identity, Madam.

438
00:32:02,772 --> 00:32:04,982
He catches on fast.

439
00:32:04,982 --> 00:32:07,932
I did think he might catch on.

440

In addition,

441
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:15,502
please think of yourself first in whatever matter comes up.

442
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:25,502
The finance minister's position has been vacant for a long time.

443
00:32:25,502 --> 00:32:27,932
Have you not found a suitable person yet?

444
00:32:27,932 --> 00:32:30,902
I am looking for a suitable individual,

so I will give you sammang soon.

If you really cannot find a person,

00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:40,132
what do you think about Park Yoon Hak?

448
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:44,182
Are you suggesting appointing someone who has been the royal secretary of defense

449
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:48,322
for the last ten years to the minister of finance position?

450
00:32:48,322 --> 00:32:51,122
There is always a first for everything,

451
00:32:51,122 --> 00:32:56,162
so I am sure you can lead him well since you are full of experience.

452
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:01,882
Your Majesty,

453
00:33:01,882 --> 00:33:07,472
do you know why I thought you were fit to be a monarch?

454
00:33:08,122 --> 00:33:10,392
I am not sure.

455
00:33:10,392 --> 00:33:13,892
I was always curious about that...

456
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:18,622
I wondered why you told me then that I could become a benevolent king.

457
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:22,862
It was because you knew how to fear.

458
00:33:22,862 --> 00:33:26,172
While I was your master in your youthful crown prince days,

459
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:29,992
you told me you were afraid to become a king who has to carry a heavy burden

460
00:33:29,992 --> 00:33:36,292
and it would have been better to have been born as the Grand Prince instead of the Crown Prince.

461
00:33:36,292 --> 00:33:38,462
I do remember that.

462
00:33:38,462 --> 00:33:41,922
I liked that about you.

463
00:33:41,922 --> 00:33:46,512
You do not dream of anything dangerous, and even if you do dream up something small,

464
00:33:46,512 --> 00:33:49,312
you do not get overly ambitious to achieve that dream.

465
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:53,152
I liked that humility about you, Your Majesty.

466
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:57,442
Is that why you placed me on this throne?

467
00:33:57,442 --> 00:34:00,592
Because I knew my place?

468
00:34:02,382 --> 00:34:09,582
Finding the right person to appoint as the finance minister is my job.

469
00:34:10,992 --> 00:34:16,782
You need to discern well what you can and should not do.

470
00:34:16,782 --> 00:34:21,382
That is the basics of humility, so if you do not lose that attitude,

471
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:25,702
your reign will not be short.

472
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:37,002
Your Majesty, the Queen Dowager is here.

473
00:34:42,942 --> 00:34:46,232
What brings you here, Mother?

474
00:34:48,362 --> 00:34:54,092
I brought her here to comfort her after her major heartbreak.

475
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:58,832
It so happened that Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong entered the palace with some good tea.

476
00:34:58,832 --> 00:35:01,602
How about you join us, Left State Minister?

477
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:07,002
I am sorry, but I have some urgent matters to take care of,

478
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:09,032
so I will be on my way.

479
00:35:09,032 --> 00:35:11,302
What a shame.

480
00:35:12,282 --> 00:35:16,942
I heard a lot about your daughter-in-law from Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong.

481
00:35:16,942 --> 00:35:20,722
You have quite a commendable daughter-in-law.

482
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:31,682
I heard that Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong's teachings were of great help.

483
00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:34,482
You should bring her to the palace sometime.

484
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:37,902
I want to converse with her in person.

485
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:41,862
Yes, I shall do so.

[Hwang Bookstore]

487
00:36:41,502 --> 00:36:44,212
I apologize for my discourteous behavior last time.

488
00:36:44,212 --> 00:36:47,902
It was my fault for asking to meet with you without any explanation.

489
00:36:47,902 --> 00:36:49,952
Please take a seat.

490
00:36:57,332 --> 00:37:00,382
I want to hear your answer, which I was unable to hear last time.

491
00:37:00,382 --> 00:37:03,422
By chance, after your brother disappeared,

492
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:06,002
have you not from him, not even once?

493
00:37:06,002 --> 00:37:10,492
I did not come here to answer that.

494
00:37:11,962 --> 00:37:17,052
I heard that my brother disappeared after receiving a secret mission from the late king.

495
00:37:17,052 --> 00:37:19,232
Is that true?

496
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:22,452
How do you know that?

497
00:37:22,452 --> 00:37:25,302
I heard it from the Finance Minister's wife.

498
00:37:25,302 --> 00:37:31,302
I do not know why she told me that, but she would not have made it up.

499
00:37:35,972 --> 00:37:40,532
What happened 15 years ago that led to the slaughter of the

500
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:44,382
Head of the Royal Guards' entire family and my brother's disappearance?

501
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:46,962
You already know a lot, I see.

502
00:37:46,962 --> 00:37:50,782
How much and what else do you know?

503
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:54,292
Please tell me what happened that day first.

504
00:37:56,402 --> 00:38:01,182
That day, the late king passed away.

505
00:38:01,182 --> 00:38:05,782
And... we believe that the late king

506
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:09,232
was poisoned.

507
00:38:09,232 --> 00:38:12,292
Are you saying there was treason?

508
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:15,072
On the exterior, nothing happened.

509
00:38:15,072 --> 00:38:20,392
So, we cannot conclude for sure whether it was treason or not.

510
00:38:21,972 --> 00:38:24,432
The poison that was used to kill the late king

511
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:27,532
was the same one as the one taken by the Finance Minister.

512
00:38:29,062 --> 00:38:31,302
Seeing how she told her about Cho Seong Hoo,

513
00:38:31,302 --> 00:38:37,022
is it not logical to think that the Finance Minister's wife knows everything already?

514
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:38,502
Probably.

515
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,462
That is how it seems.

516
00:38:43,092 --> 00:38:46,632
Who is the person behind the Finance Minister's wife?

517
00:38:53,512 --> 00:38:57,142
Your daughter-in-law is quite intelligent.

518
00:39:01,962 --> 00:39:05,282
There must be something you are not telling me. Right?

519
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:08,702
The one who can act as the support behind the Finance Minister's wife,

520
00:39:08,702 --> 00:39:12,422
has the power to plot treason and, most importantly,

521
00:39:12,422 --> 00:39:18,682
the one behind all this is someone you, Royal Secretary of Defense, are hiding from me.

522
00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:22,732
You are right.

523
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:31,182
His Majesty and I believe all of this was the work of the Left State Minister.

524
00:39:33,712 --> 00:39:36,302
Do you have corroborative evidence?

525
00:39:36,302 --> 00:39:40,862
You are one of the corroborative evidence.

526
00:39:41,702 --> 00:39:44,662
Why do you think the Left State Minister would propose your marriage to his son

527
00:39:44,662 --> 00:39:49,802
when your family is lower in class and have no connection to him?

528
00:39:49,802 --> 00:39:57,722
The Left State Minister probably had to find the man who received the late king's secret mission at all costs.

529
00:39:58,472 --> 00:40:03,212
The reason why Father took me in...

530
00:40:04,642 --> 00:40:07,582
was because of my brother?

531
00:40:07,582 --> 00:40:09,522
We believe so.

532
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:11,842
It has been 15 years.

533
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:17,882
I lived obeying him as my parent for the last 15 years.

534
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:22,862
We have not found out everything yet.

535
00:40:23,982 --> 00:40:27,582
Of course, this is not easy for you to believe.

536
00:40:28,612 --> 00:40:32,092
This is enough for today. I will be going.

537
00:40:32,812 --> 00:40:34,982
Are you all right?

538
00:40:36,022 --> 00:40:38,122
I am all right.

539
00:40:38,122 --> 00:40:40,792
I will contact you again.

540
00:41:07,502 --> 00:41:10,412
Can I come in?

541
00:41:15,992 --> 00:41:20,662
You are going through a lot because of my son, who passed away first.

542
00:41:21,332 --> 00:41:23,242
No, it is all right.

543
00:41:23,242 --> 00:41:26,922
I guess you miss your brother a lot.

544
00:41:27,992 --> 00:41:30,632
I am searching for him on all fronts,

545
00:41:30,632 --> 00:41:36,452
so if you hear from him privately or remember anything, let me know.

546
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,092
Thank you.

547
00:41:38,092 --> 00:41:40,482
Thank you, Father.

548
00:41:41,112 --> 00:41:43,092
Father.

549
00:41:44,472 --> 00:41:48,772
Daughter, do you know where your brother used to go often?

550
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,582
I think it would be useful in finding him.

551
00:41:51,582 --> 00:41:56,022
By chance, did your brother leave anything with you before he left?

552
00:41:56,022 --> 00:41:58,602
- He left in such a rush, so no...
- Goodness...

553
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:01,892
How inconsiderate of him.

554
00:42:02,442 --> 00:42:07,302
By chance, have you heard any news of my brother?

555
00:42:07,302 --> 00:42:11,582
I am searching for him everywhere, so I should hear some news soon.

556
00:42:12,422 --> 00:42:15,392
Let us wait for the news together.

557
00:42:16,632 --> 00:42:22,782
Your intelligent daughter-in-law and her brother will no longer cause any problems, no?

558
00:42:22,782 --> 00:42:26,692
To think that you thought to blackmail me with something like that...

559
00:42:26,692 --> 00:42:29,642
You have become quite vulgar.

560
00:42:32,532 --> 00:42:34,802
Were you...

561
00:42:35,532 --> 00:42:39,112
searching for my brother from the beginning?

562
00:42:45,952 --> 00:42:48,512
I did not know you were already here waiting.

563
00:42:48,512 --> 00:42:52,372
- I am sorry for my unforgivable sin!
- No, do not worry.

564
00:42:52,372 --> 00:42:56,072
I just came a bit earlier because I had something to think about.

565
00:42:57,012 --> 00:43:01,062
I heard that I have grown old.

566
00:43:01,062 --> 00:43:04,552
Who dares to say such impudent things?

567
00:43:04,552 --> 00:43:06,732
I will go immediately and—

568
00:43:07,972 --> 00:43:11,222
A lot of time has passed,

569
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:14,712
yet I have not tied the loose ends for too long.

570
00:43:14,712 --> 00:43:19,632
It appears I need to wrap it up before things get more complicated.

571
00:43:19,632 --> 00:43:22,042
Just give me your order.

572
00:43:23,512 --> 00:43:26,932
In the end, I feel that the Finance Minister's wife

573
00:43:26,932 --> 00:43:31,022
needs to follow her husband in death and commit suicide.

574
00:43:31,022 --> 00:43:32,762
Pardon?

575
00:43:32,762 --> 00:43:35,402
Though you two are in completely different social classes,

576
00:43:35,402 --> 00:43:38,392
is she not your blood-related sister?

577
00:43:38,392 --> 00:43:43,962
It would be a better end than to go to prison as a murderer and face a pathetic death,

578
00:43:43,962 --> 00:43:47,402
so this is for your sister's good in the end.

579
00:43:48,602 --> 00:43:51,892
Your Excellency, how could you ask this of me?

580
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:56,682
Having her hang herself to look nice would be good,

581
00:43:56,682 --> 00:44:04,782
or commit suicide by throwing herself off a cliff so her body cannot be found is not bad, either.

582
00:44:05,582 --> 00:44:10,012
Whichever method you choose, do not take too long.

583
00:44:10,722 --> 00:44:15,752
The older I get, the more impatient I am becoming.

584
00:44:20,912 --> 00:44:23,362
Why did you not tell me sooner?

585
00:44:23,362 --> 00:44:25,712
If you knew sooner, what would you have done?

586
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:27,912
If the Left State Minister was behind all of this,

587
00:44:27,912 --> 00:44:31,002
was it not the Left State Minister who killed my parents that day?

588
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:34,802
That is right. So, what would you have done then?

589
00:44:34,802 --> 00:44:38,502
At least, I would not have drunk with him.

590
00:44:38,502 --> 00:44:41,502
Would you have taken out your sword and avenged your parents?

591
00:44:41,502 --> 00:44:42,922
Would that have been wrong to do?

592
00:44:42,922 --> 00:44:44,982
If you had killed the Left State Minister,

593
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:51,032
everything would have ended vainly without any truth being exposed and with you in danger.

594
00:44:51,032 --> 00:44:52,912
My life already ended 15 years ago!

595
00:44:52,912 --> 00:44:58,372
His Majesty also waited a long time of 15 years calmly

596
00:44:58,372 --> 00:45:02,362
enduring all sorts of humiliation for the right time.

597
00:45:03,092 --> 00:45:05,912
If killing the Left State Minister was our only goal,

598
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:09,022
it would not have taken this long.

599
00:45:14,192 --> 00:45:16,082
What...

600
00:45:17,152 --> 00:45:19,472
do I need to do?

601
00:45:19,472 --> 00:45:22,302
The evidence that the Left State Minister plotted treason.

602
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,632
I am sure Cho Seong Hoo was holding that.

603
00:45:24,632 --> 00:45:28,002
What if we cannot find that?

604
00:45:28,002 --> 00:45:32,342
Then perhaps there may be another way.

605
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:38,732
By chance, are you thinking of his daughter-in-law as the other way?

606
00:45:38,732 --> 00:45:41,752
That is not something for me to decide.

607
00:45:42,942 --> 00:45:44,672
Brother...

608
00:45:45,432 --> 00:45:47,132
I will...

609
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:55,852
make sure the people around me no longer get hurt.

610
00:45:55,852 --> 00:45:57,812
Is that Madam...

611
00:45:58,532 --> 00:46:01,472
that important to you?

612
00:46:06,122 --> 00:46:08,962
I will protect her...

613
00:46:09,552 --> 00:46:12,102
so she does not face danger.

614
00:46:25,662 --> 00:46:29,772
However, there will surely be something you can do within your own power.

615
00:46:29,772 --> 00:46:33,422
When you find what that is, you must do it readily. Okay?

616
00:46:33,422 --> 00:46:37,822
I should do it readily, right, Brother?

617
00:46:56,442 --> 00:46:59,972
Could you come out for a moment?

618
00:47:05,512 --> 00:47:07,672
Are you all right?

619
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:10,712
I am all right.

620
00:47:10,712 --> 00:47:13,712
Are you all right, Sir?

621
00:47:16,252 --> 00:47:19,432
If what your brother says is true,

622
00:47:19,432 --> 00:47:24,362
your family and my family are enemies.

623
00:47:24,362 --> 00:47:28,212
Even if that is true, I will not take revenge on you, Madam,

624
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:30,302
so do not worry.

625
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:36,432
Also, there is no guarantee that I can beat you in a sword fight.

626
00:47:40,072 --> 00:47:42,282
I remembered.

627
00:47:43,192 --> 00:47:46,502
That day, the one who checked your scar that day...

628
00:47:46,502 --> 00:47:48,402
I had fought him before.

629
00:47:48,402 --> 00:47:50,232
Who is he?

630
00:47:50,232 --> 00:47:52,622
I should have killed him already.

631
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:54,232
Madam.

632
00:47:54,892 --> 00:47:59,312
He was definitely Kang Pil Jik.

633
00:48:00,212 --> 00:48:02,312
Are you sure?

634
00:48:03,562 --> 00:48:06,562
I remember him because he used a very distinctive type of blade.

635
00:48:06,562 --> 00:48:10,922
That day, I was in disarray because you fainted.

636
00:48:16,002 --> 00:48:20,552
I remembered the pain of that day when I saw that blade.

637
00:48:21,692 --> 00:48:24,982
I will look into this matter.

638
00:48:24,982 --> 00:48:28,952
No. I should be the one to catch Kang Pil Jik.

639
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:32,742
If you so wish, I will let you handle it.

640
00:48:32,742 --> 00:48:35,122
He has a bad history with me, too,

641
00:48:35,122 --> 00:48:37,322
so please be rough with him when you catch him.

642
00:48:37,322 --> 00:48:39,572
I will do so.

643
00:48:39,572 --> 00:48:42,972
Then, I will be heading inside first.

644
00:48:43,592 --> 00:48:45,582
Please be careful.

645
00:48:54,062 --> 00:48:56,322
Please be careful.

646
00:49:03,832 --> 00:49:08,692
Go to Myeongdogak and secretly find out if the guy named Joo left.

647
00:49:08,692 --> 00:49:10,912
Yes, Your Excellency.

648
00:49:25,042 --> 00:49:27,412
Have you finished preparing to head to work, Father?

649
00:49:27,412 --> 00:49:32,552
Yes, it must be quite hard for you to take care of all the housework by yourself.

650
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,812
No, it is all right.

651
00:49:34,812 --> 00:49:37,642
There is something I would like to speak to you about.

652
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:40,672
Okay, what is it?

653
00:49:42,222 --> 00:49:45,732
I received a strange note like this yesterday.

654
00:49:51,882 --> 00:49:54,402
"If you want to know what happened to your brother,

655
00:49:54,402 --> 00:49:58,682
come to Sugumun at the hour of the pig in ten days."
(Between 9:00 - 11:00 p.m.)

656
00:50:00,992 --> 00:50:03,682
Where did you get this?

657
00:50:03,682 --> 00:50:07,822
I found it in the front yard of the annex last night.

658
00:50:08,962 --> 00:50:12,802
It appears someone was playing tricks on you.

659
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:16,712
I will look into who did such a foul thing.

660
00:50:16,712 --> 00:50:20,662
But still, could I go and meet them in person, just in case?

661
00:50:20,662 --> 00:50:24,342
How could a widow in mourning get involved in something like this?

662
00:50:24,342 --> 00:50:26,192
I am sorry...

663
00:50:26,192 --> 00:50:30,702
but what if they are really trying to deliver news about my brother?

664
00:50:30,702 --> 00:50:33,182
Please, Father.

665
00:50:35,512 --> 00:50:41,572
All right. However, you must not act rashly.

666
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:43,252
Okay.

667
00:50:55,342 --> 00:50:57,522
Garrison Commander.

668
00:50:57,522 --> 00:51:00,722
What is it, Captain Park Su Ho?

669
00:51:00,722 --> 00:51:04,252
Allow me to investigate Kang Pil Jik.

670
00:51:04,252 --> 00:51:05,742
What...

671
00:51:05,742 --> 00:51:07,382
What?

672
00:51:07,902 --> 00:51:10,952
Kang Pil Jik?

673
00:51:15,712 --> 00:51:18,352
Goodness... Oh my goodness.

674
00:51:18,352 --> 00:51:21,372
What brings you here, Royal Secretary of Defense?

675
00:51:21,372 --> 00:51:24,132
I dropped by because I have an important request.

676
00:51:24,132 --> 00:51:28,042
Gosh, you have something to request of me?

677
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:35,732
It is a secret mission from my superior.

678
00:51:35,732 --> 00:51:39,522
By chance, are you referring to him?

679
00:51:39,522 --> 00:51:41,462
That is right. It is the His Majesty's-

680
00:51:41,462 --> 00:51:43,252
Just say the word!

681
00:51:43,252 --> 00:51:47,742
I am ready to do anything if it is his command!

682
00:51:47,742 --> 00:51:50,852
He says to investigate Kang Pil Jik.

683
00:51:50,852 --> 00:51:53,142
Kang Pil Jik?

684
00:51:56,642 --> 00:51:58,622
Do not worry!

685
00:51:58,622 --> 00:52:02,792
I will find every speck of dust on him and offer it up to him!

686
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:08,042
Sir! I brought every file on Kang Pil Jik...

687
00:52:15,642 --> 00:52:18,392
Come again! Thank you!

688
00:52:18,392 --> 00:52:20,352
Hey, you.

689
00:52:20,352 --> 00:52:22,092
What is it?

690
00:52:22,092 --> 00:52:25,752
I heard there is a merchant from the Qing Dynasty here.

691
00:52:25,752 --> 00:52:27,142
His name is Joo.

692
00:52:27,142 --> 00:52:28,812
Joo?

693
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:33,072
I came because I have some business with him. Is he inside by chance?

694
00:52:35,602 --> 00:52:38,222
I do not know him. There is nobody like that here.

695
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:40,282
Really?

696
00:52:41,332 --> 00:52:42,322
I said he is not here!

697
00:52:42,322 --> 00:52:44,662
I will just go in for a moment to check, so move!

698
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,452
Who are you!

699
00:52:47,862 --> 00:52:50,842
Who are you that you are causing a scene here?

700
00:52:50,842 --> 00:52:54,342
Gosh, a scene? I was just looking for someone.

701
00:52:54,342 --> 00:52:56,612
- Geez, go away, go away.
- I heard he was definitely here...

702
00:52:56,612 --> 00:52:59,432
- Nobody like that is here. Go away.
- Geez...

703
00:52:59,432 --> 00:53:01,282
Go away, leave.

704
00:53:01,282 --> 00:53:04,352
Senior Ggot, you can stop now.

705
00:53:04,352 --> 00:53:07,362
By chance, are you in debt?

706
00:53:07,362 --> 00:53:09,042
How much? Is it a lot?

707
00:53:09,042 --> 00:53:11,152
This is not the time to be idling around!

708
00:53:11,152 --> 00:53:13,022
You have to hide right away!

709
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:14,462
Hey, Senior.

710
00:53:14,462 --> 00:53:16,532
My goodness.

711
00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:25,192
What do we do now?

712
00:53:25,192 --> 00:53:28,552
What do you mean? I showed him the letter,

713
00:53:28,552 --> 00:53:29,992
so we will have to wait and see.

714
00:53:29,992 --> 00:53:34,992
Do you really believe that His Excellency is the one behind all of this?

715
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:44,162
Even if Father really did plot treason, there would be no hope for me.

716
00:53:44,162 --> 00:53:46,532
If he receives the death sentence for his entire family line,

717
00:53:46,532 --> 00:53:49,892
I will have no choice but to be put to death as well.

718
00:53:49,892 --> 00:53:52,442
Why should you die, My Lady?

719
00:53:52,442 --> 00:53:57,722
It is the law of this country that children are punished for the sins of their parents.

720
00:53:57,722 --> 00:54:01,512
However, if he used me for whatever reason

721
00:54:01,512 --> 00:54:06,092
and caused harm to my brother, that would be a different story.

722
00:54:07,082 --> 00:54:12,532
It must be my imagination that you seem scarier than His Excellency, right, My Lady?

723
00:54:12,532 --> 00:54:15,032
Even if I become a ghost in this house,

724
00:54:15,032 --> 00:54:18,472
I will find out Father's true intentions for sure.

725
00:54:39,952 --> 00:54:42,262
Junior Joo.

726
00:54:43,432 --> 00:54:46,042
Must you leave?

727
00:54:46,652 --> 00:54:50,282
If I stay here longer, I think I will only cause harm.

728
00:54:51,042 --> 00:54:55,062
Senior Ggot, stay well and healthy.

729
00:54:55,572 --> 00:54:56,872
You stay well, too.

730
00:54:56,872 --> 00:54:58,712
Do you even have a place to go?

731
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,952
It would be better to talk to the Grand Merchant and pay off your debt.

732
00:55:02,952 --> 00:55:08,842
In this world, there are more problems that cannot be solved by money.

733
00:55:08,842 --> 00:55:12,382
Well then, I will see you again someday.

734
00:55:20,672 --> 00:55:22,732
See you!

735
00:55:22,732 --> 00:55:25,232
See you.

736
00:55:28,502 --> 00:55:30,662
Junior Joo!

737
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:32,292
Bye!

738
00:55:32,292 --> 00:55:34,252
Thank you!

739
00:55:34,252 --> 00:55:36,642
"Thank" you.

740
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:50,322
[Capital Garrison]

741
00:55:51,962 --> 00:55:55,292
[Under repair, do not enter - Garrison Commander]

742
00:55:57,072 --> 00:56:02,162
Pil's Merchandising has so many things that are suspicious.

743
00:56:02,702 --> 00:56:08,012
The problem is that there is no end to it, even if we dig things up.

744
00:56:09,162 --> 00:56:11,002
Garrison Commander, take a look at this.

745
00:56:11,002 --> 00:56:13,992
Is this not a bit suspicious?

746
00:56:16,002 --> 00:56:21,752
Is this not a charity rice inventory the Finance Minister's wife left with Pil's Merchandising?

747
00:56:21,752 --> 00:56:24,432
What is strange about it?

748
00:56:24,432 --> 00:56:29,752
The amount of rice that the Queen Dowager granted last year was 100,000 seok.

749
00:56:29,752 --> 00:56:34,092
But the actual amount of distribution was only about 10,000 seok.

750
00:56:34,092 --> 00:56:37,012
Pardon? What about the 90,000 seok?

751
00:56:38,202 --> 00:56:42,342
it is not like the rice had legs to run away.

752
00:56:43,482 --> 00:56:46,782
Something does smell fishy...

753
00:56:47,902 --> 00:56:50,232
Captain Park Su Ho.

754
00:56:50,812 --> 00:56:55,132
This is a big deal, even if we look at it with cloudy eyes.

755
00:56:55,132 --> 00:56:58,442
Do you have a plan?

756
00:57:00,052 --> 00:57:02,342
My plan...

757
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:05,982
is to come up with one now.

758
00:57:11,212 --> 00:57:14,622
Must I give up on my dream

759
00:57:14,622 --> 00:57:18,952
of entering the palace here?

760
00:57:23,032 --> 00:57:26,772
I confirmed that the man you asked me to look into has indeed left.

761
00:57:26,772 --> 00:57:29,492
- You may leave.
- Okay.

762
00:57:35,432 --> 00:57:40,362
But still, could I go and meet them in person, just in case?

763
00:57:42,662 --> 00:57:45,032
Eldest daughter-in-law,

764
00:57:45,642 --> 00:57:50,182
it would have been good if you had just lived as a member of my family.

765
00:57:50,182 --> 00:57:55,982
You still have not been able to let go of your lingering feelings.

766
00:58:14,352 --> 00:58:17,102
Mother... Mother...

767
00:58:17,752 --> 00:58:20,622
I still hear hallucinations like this...

768
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:24,932
What am I to do, Jeong?

769
00:58:26,452 --> 00:58:28,302
Mother.

770
00:58:31,442 --> 00:58:33,802
Brother?

771
00:58:37,492 --> 00:58:40,082
Brother!

772
00:58:40,082 --> 00:58:41,662
J-Jeong...

773
00:58:41,662 --> 00:58:44,082
Mother, I am sorry.

774
00:58:44,082 --> 00:58:48,432
I have managed to come back only now.

775
00:58:49,982 --> 00:58:51,462
Jeo—

776
00:58:51,462 --> 00:58:53,402
Jeong...

777
00:58:54,202 --> 00:58:57,202
Are you really my son, Jeong?

778
00:58:59,212 --> 00:59:01,562
Goodness, my son was alive!

779
00:59:01,562 --> 00:59:05,452
Jeong... Jeong...

780
00:59:06,192 --> 00:59:07,972
Jeong.

781
00:59:09,722 --> 00:59:12,552
Jeong, what—

782
00:59:12,552 --> 00:59:17,742
W-What happened, Jeong?

783
00:59:20,342 --> 00:59:22,362
Jeong...

784
00:59:26,682 --> 00:59:29,192
He started making his moves.

785
00:59:40,502 --> 00:59:44,192
What is your reason for suddenly showing up like this?

786
00:59:45,202 --> 00:59:48,952
I came because of an urgent message from Elder.

787
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:55,052
It appears you have deeply upset him, Sister.

788
00:59:56,362 --> 01:00:00,952
So he should have just left me alone.

789
01:00:00,952 --> 01:00:05,662
What? Did he tell you to kill me right now and shut me up?

790
01:00:05,662 --> 01:00:08,682
Should you not look for a way for you to live?

791
01:00:08,682 --> 01:00:14,882
Do you think I will beg for my pathetic life to someone lowly like you?

792
01:00:14,882 --> 01:00:18,442
They say this life is better even if you are rolling in a dung field.

793
01:00:18,442 --> 01:00:23,692
It may be better to choose to live, even as a person of low status.

794
01:00:23,692 --> 01:00:29,092
Someone like you does not need to understand me.

795
01:00:30,882 --> 01:00:35,952
I only said this because I was worried about you even though you are my half-sister.

796
01:00:35,952 --> 01:00:38,542
How dare you!

797
01:00:38,542 --> 01:00:43,502
How could someone like you think you are on the same level as me?

798
01:00:53,852 --> 01:00:56,902
Father, were you looking for me?

799
01:00:56,902 --> 01:00:59,242
Come in.

800
01:01:14,982 --> 01:01:17,302
Were you at the shrine all this time?

801
01:01:17,302 --> 01:01:18,822
Yes.

802
01:01:18,822 --> 01:01:22,542
But why were you looking for me?

803
01:01:22,542 --> 01:01:24,322
Take a seat.

804
01:01:24,322 --> 01:01:26,152
Okay.

805
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:37,602
I do not know much about the statutes and customs of women,

806
01:01:37,602 --> 01:01:42,322
but I do know that you have been keeping it well better than anyone.

807
01:01:42,322 --> 01:01:47,262
Even the Queen Dowager praised you highly as a woman with great virtue

808
01:01:47,262 --> 01:01:50,622
deserving of a Memorial Gate.

809
01:01:50,622 --> 01:01:54,062
That is all thanks to you and Mother.

810
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:04,892
And so, you should repay our kindness now.

811
01:02:12,502 --> 01:02:16,432
I am sorry, Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong.

812
01:02:17,132 --> 01:02:19,612
Get out!

813
01:02:19,612 --> 01:02:24,452
Though you may be fine with living your entire life as the Left State Minister's dog,

814
01:02:24,452 --> 01:02:28,962
I will do as I will.

815
01:02:38,852 --> 01:02:43,722
Since I have confirmed you never thought of me as your younger brother,

816
01:02:46,242 --> 01:02:50,722
I feel so much at ease now.

817
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:04,072

What is this?

822
01:03:49,872 --> 01:03:54,162
This is something that no one in this household knows about.

823
01:03:54,162 --> 01:03:58,492
Are you telling me something that no one knows about right now?

824
01:03:59,762 --> 01:04:04,212
I am telling you so you do not throw rocks at someone else's house.
