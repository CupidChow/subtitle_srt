[Episode 6]

33
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,760
What a sudden power cut.

34
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:06,199
The ginger tea is getting cold.

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,400
What are you rushing for?

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,759
I haven't worn my shirt properly.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,320
I'm anxious for sure, President Jiao.

38
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,720
You walked from the room to outside.

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,600
The bathroom is full of water.

40
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,000
I must clean it up immediately.

41
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,039
President Jiao. You and Assistant Lin

42
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,919
came out from the room with messy looks.

43
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,399
I...

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,600
What nonsense.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,320
Mr. Sui is staying next door, right?

46
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,279
The power cut has frightened

47
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,119
Assistant Lin just now.

48
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,199
I came here to comfort her.

49
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:27,880
President Jiao.

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,479
I've called to ask just now.

51
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,160
The power cut was due to the

52
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,039
test of the electrical grid in this area.

53
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,720
I've checked with them.

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,360
It won't happen again tomorrow.

55
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,839
Please take this opportunity

56
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,399
to check the emergency power system

57
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:39,000
at every floor of the hotel now.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,240
Please fix it if it's not working.

59
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,399
Especially the floors
where the officers going to stay.

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,440
Right, President Jiao?

61
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,759
Mhm, yes.

62
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,520
Besides, the water flowing rate of

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,919
the hot shower of Mr. Sui's room

64
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,639
is more than 15 seconds.

65
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,919
Get a technician to adjust it.

66
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,479
Okay, President Jiao. I'll do it now.

67
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,279
Impossible.

68
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,919
President Jiao and Assistant Lin.

69
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,440
What are you doing, Xin?

70
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,160
I'm telling you,

71
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,399
if you spill the ginger tea on me,

72
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,559
I won't forgive you!

73
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,000
Sorry, Director Zhao.

74
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,399
President told me that

75
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,919
the shower head of Mr. Sui's room has malfunctioned.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,399
I'm getting a technician to fix it.

77
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,199
You are...

78
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,600
I'm going to give ginger tea to President Jiao.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,520
No, you can't go.

80
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,119
Why can't I?

81
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,440
Jiao Yang fell into the pool just now.

82
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,800
He'll catch a cold if he doesn't drink ginger tea.

83
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,919
That...

84
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,279
I gave ginger tea to President Jiao just now.

85
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,639
Look at this. President Jiao didn't want to drink it.

86
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,039
It's because you made it.

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,440
Mine is full of love.

88
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,600
He'll drink it.

89
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,000
Lucky!

90
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,720
Where is it?

91
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,960
I saw Lucky running there.

92
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,240
Director Zhao. Did you forget

93
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,679
to lock the garage today?

94
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,600
I fed Lucky once today.

95
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,399
The door should have been locked.

96
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,399
Should be?

97
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,240
It means uncertainty.

98
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,520
Think again, Director Zhao.

99
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,759
President Jiao must have fallen asleep.

100
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,240
It's more important to look for Lucky.

101
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,320
But Jiao Yang hasn't...

102
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,479
Don't worry about it.

103
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:12,479
If President Jiao knows that

104
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,320
you brought a stray cat into the hotel,

105
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:15,679
you'll get into trouble.

106
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:16,279
Let's go.

107
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,399
What are you looking at?

108
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,720
Your serious look

109
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,480
is weird.

110
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,200
I'm only serious about the things I like.

111
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,640
Alright, Assistant Lin.

112
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,799
Good luck in cleaning the toilet bowl.

113
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:40,959
I'm going to sleep.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,559
Welcome, everyone.

115
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,519
I hope that you all will enjoy yourselves

116
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,399
at our hotel for the next two days and one night.

117
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,040
I'll be in the dining hall at 6 p.m. today.

118
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,600
I hope to have a great night with everyone.

119
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,279
Why is there a missing one?

120
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:08,480
President Jiao.

121
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,480
Mr. Sui said that he doesn't like a huge crowd.

122
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:12,239
So, he'll arrive 15 minutes later.

123
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,839
Alright, please lead them there, Yan.

124
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,959
Alright, this way, please.

125
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,200
Let's bet, Xin.

126
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:31,399
Mr. Sui is, at least, 50 years old.

127
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,480
Moreover, he must be a fat man.

128
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,600
How do you know it, President Jiao?

129
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,399
Based on his voice over the phone

130
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,119
and his manner,

131
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,279
he must be harsher than my dad.

132
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,000
Look. Am I right?

133
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Hello, Mr. Sui. I'm Jiao Yang.

134
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,799
Nice to meet you, President Jiao.

135
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:53,480
Nice to meet you.

136
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,279
Mr. Sui. He's President Jiao.

137
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,040
President Jiao. He's Mr. Sui.

138
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:04,799
Hello.

139
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,720
Hello.

140
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,920
I'm Sui Yi.

141
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:11,320
Thank you for the invitation.

142
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,480
Mr. Sui.

143
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:15,200
Lin Miao will be your personal butler.

144
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,239
You can look for her if you need any assistance.

145
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,959
Hello, Mr. Sui.

146
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,519
I'm Lin Miao, your personal butler.

147
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,440
I'll take your luggage, Mr. Sui.

148
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,320
It's okay.

149
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,799
It's alright. Just let her do it.

150
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,040
You're meticulous.

151
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:32,040
It's my responsibility.

152
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,880
Your room is ready, Mr. Sui.

153
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,959
I'll bring you there.

154
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,799
Whatever.

155
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,279
Here, please.

156
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,119
Even a fussy person can be a writer.

157
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,239
However, his name is Sui Yi (Whatever).

158
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,519
It's really interesting, President Jiao.

159
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,440
President Jiao.

160
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,600
Let me ask you, Xin.

161
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,760
Must a personal butler be so dedicated?

162
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,000
Is it?

163
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:00,600
When she was my assistant,

164
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,839
she didn't even carry my bag.

165
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,399
President Jiao. Now, you should

166
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,600
meet the other four customer experience officers.

167
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:07,880
I don't care.

168
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,119
You follow her.

169
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:11,480
You do all the tasks.

170
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,600
President Jiao.

171
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,559
What's wrong?

172
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,119
My assistant.

173
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,440
has to serve the others.

174
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,959
Don't you think that it's embarrassing me?

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,519
Go.

176
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes, got it, President Jiao.

177
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,519
She's my assistant,

178
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,640
but she serves the other with dedication.

179
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,119
This is your room, Mr. Sui.

180
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:37,679
Please.

181
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,079
It's fine. Please come in.

182
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,959
The room is nice.

183
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,720
I'm glad that you're satisfied with it.

184
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,799
The room has been sanitized
using negative ionic air purification.

185
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
The towel is made in Netherland.

186
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,160
You can use it without worries.

187
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,760
I'll wait for you outside.

188
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,640
Please call me if you need anything.

189
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,440
By the way, do you want to swim now?

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,720
Whatever.

191
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,200
Please get changed.

192
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,119
I'll wait for you outside.
Let me know if you're ready.

193
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,320
I'll bring you there.

194
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,719
Thank God I have watched Downton Abbey.

195
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,919
The facility and the service of Leisure

196
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,840
are excellent.

197
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,520
President Jiao,

198
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,359
you really never disappoint your dad.

199
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:48,520
I think that we can talk about

200
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,840
our collaboration in future.

201
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,119
Thank you for your acknowledgement.

202
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,919
We won't disappoint you.

203
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,719
I heard that this event

204
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,719
is handled by President Jiao
and Director Zhao together.

205
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,760
Director Zhao studied abroad.

206
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,200
Her mindset and vision are really different.

207
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,599
What a perfect match

208
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,640
when she's next to you, President Jiao.

209
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:09,080
Yes, yes, yes.

210
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,520
Mr. Sui.

211
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,320
Your pear lemon juice is ready.

212
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,280
The ratio is three to seven.
Three and a half ice cubes.

213
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,119
Thank you.

214
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:30,400
Do you want me to wipe your hair?

215
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:31,200
Whatever.

216
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,919
Miss Lin.

217
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
I remember that

218
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,559
I faxed my habits to you yesterday, right?

219
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,520
Yes.

220
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,919
You're from Butler University?

221
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,719
I didn't take up any formal training as a butler.

222
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,159
Honestly, it's my first time being a personal butler.

223
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,640
Really?

224
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,840
My boss is the same as you

225
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,080
in the aspect of quality of living.

226
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,119
That's why I could learn fast.

227
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,119
Your boss?

228
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,119
I was President Jiao's assistant.

229
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,119
And now.

230
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:34,159
Mr. Sui and I have something to discuss.

231
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,039
Please bring some desserts here.

232
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,200
Okay.

233
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,400
Cat. Cat.

234
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:47,280
-Cat. Cat.
-Mew.

235
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,799
You don't...

236
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,119
No...

237
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,880
I... I... I...

238
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,359
Mr. Sui.

239
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:02,039
Assistant Lin is my personal assistant.

240
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,400
Since you're the guest,

241
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,599
I requested her to serve you.

242
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,719
Stop talking. Catch...Catch the cat.

243
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:07,039
Mr. Sui.

244
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,520
Can you release my assistant, please?

245
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:10,400
I'm scared.

246
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,039
-Mr. Sui.
-Please catch the cat.

247
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,119
Are you alright, Assistant Lin?

248
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,919
Director Zhao studied abroad.

249
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,200
Her mindset and vision are really different.

250
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,520
What a perfect match

251
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,640
when she's next to President Jiao.

252
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:33,719
A perfect match?

253
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,479
Please catch the cat at the pool, everyone!

254
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:40,840
Catch the cat?

255
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:43,200
Lucky.

256
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,320
Give me the cat, Manager Su.

257
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:47,640
I'm sorry, Director Zhao.

258
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,080
I didn't know that it's yours.

259
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm afraid that it will hurt people.

260
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Keep calm, Lucky.

261
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,599
I'm really sorry, Mr. Sui.

262
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:02,799
Sorry for the disturbance.

263
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,599
Are you afraid of cats?

264
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,719
Why did you hide behind Assistant Lin?

265
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,719
I'm allergic to cat fur.

266
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,799
Sorry, Mr. Sui.

267
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,080
It's my mistake.

268
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,640
Are you okay,

269
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,200
Mr. Sui?

270
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,599
I'm really sorry.

271
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:31,599
Yuan, you missed out my allergy to cat fur

272
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,799
in the information for Leisure.

273
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:36,440
You're fired.

274
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,520
Mr. Sui. what about

275
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,039
I send you back to your room now?

276
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,520
President Jiao.

277
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,200
What's it?

278
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:10,880
Nothing, President Jiao. I'm leaving now.

279
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,119
Finally, I found you, Director Zhao.

280
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:19,919
What's wrong?

281
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:20,719
Jiang Rou is waiting for you

282
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:22,320
to decide the menu for dinner tonight.

283
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Isn't it Lucky?

284
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,119
How did it come out?

285
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:28,880
Perhaps somebody entered the garage

286
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,640
and forgot to lock it.

287
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,960
So, it came out.

288
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,359
Sorry, Jiao Yang.

289
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,119
Xin.

290
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,520
Didn't you know that Mr. Sui is allergic to cat fur?

291
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,760
Luckily, nothing bad happened.

292
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,200
Send Director Zhao

293
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,400
and her cat back. Hurry up.

294
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:53,039
President Jiao. President Jiao.

295
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,239
What has happened, President Jiao?

296
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Look at you.

297
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,520
You've made big trouble.

298
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,440
Okay. Okay. Okay.

299
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,479
I won't scold you any more.

300
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,159
Xin. I asked you to assist Assistant Lin.

301
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,359
You ignored me, right?

302
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,400
Yes.

303
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,359
What did you say?

304
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,400
President Jiao.

305
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,679
According to your instruction,

306
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,440
I must ignore

307
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,000
all your requests to help Assistant Lin.

308
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:18,840
Secretary Yan.

309
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:20,760
Tell you something.

310
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,640
When a man is angry,

311
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,200
his words can't be trusted.

312
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,080
Then... Then...

313
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,719
You follow both of them.

314
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:28,760
Tell me

315
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,520
their schedule today.

316
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:30,679
Yes, President Jiao.

317
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,900
[Leisure Hotel]

318
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:39,039
After spa, Assistant Lin

319
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,200
accompanied Mr. Sui for a golf game.

320
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,479
Then, she accompanied him
for a hair treatment

321
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:43,599
Now, she's helping Mr. Sui

322
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,239
choose his suit in the room for tonight.

323
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,119
She helps him choose a suit?

324
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:50,400
And I have to pay for her salary?

325
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,559
What's the logic?

326
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,719
Has she eaten?

327
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:57,320
This...

328
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,599
Stop it. She must haven't eaten.

329
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,520
Alright. Get her some food before the banquet.

330
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,400
Alright, President Jiao.

331
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,239
I'll pack some food at the cafeteria later.

332
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,880
It's time to go, Mr. Sui.

333
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,760
Shall we?

334
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,400
Okay.

335
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,200
Please.

336
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,520
They're coming. Coming. Coming.

337
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,479
Hurry up.

338
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,119
Please, President Jiao.

339
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,000
What a coincidence, Mr. Sui.

340
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:32,320
Are you going to the dining hall?

341
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,119
Let's go together.

342
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,919
Sure.

343
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,400
Xin. You didn't bring
a bottle of red wine, right?

344
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,080
Yes, Assistant Lin.

345
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,000
President Jiao heard that Mr. Sui

346
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,320
would drink a glass of red wine before going to bed.

347
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,599
He's prepared a bottle
of red wine for Mr. Sui.

348
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,760
Please go with me to take it in the room

349
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,119
and give it to Mr. Sui.

350
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:51,599
Thank you, President Jiao.

351
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,440
You're welcome. Go.

352
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,039
This way, please.

353
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,599
Please have a seat, Assistant Lin.

354
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,880
Not here for the red wine?

355
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,039
I'll send the bottle of
red wine to Mr. Sui's room later.

356
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,000
Assistant Lin. Please eat first

357
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,960
before going to the dining hall?

358
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:11,919
Eat first?

359
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,520
President Jiao asked me to tell you that

360
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,799
a personal butler cannot eat

361
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,919
at the banquet.

362
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,599
If your stomach growls,

363
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:19,799
he'll feel embarrassed.

364
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,320
But it doesn't look like a meal for a worker.

365
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,840
See you later, Assistant Lin.

366
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,720
[Don't misunderstand. Dishes
on the banquet shouldn't be wasted.]

367
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,039
Okay, Doraemon.

368
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,880
I'll eat for ten minutes.

369
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,760
The banquet is about to start, Jiao Yang.

370
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,520
Are you ready?

371
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,040
Jiao Yang?

372
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,839
Jiao...

373
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,719
Where is Jiao Yang?

374
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:14,959
President Jiao has gone
to the dining hall, Director Zhao.

375
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,199
You can go there directly.

376
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,400
He's gone to the dining hall.
What are you doing here?

377
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,680
I...

378
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,760
Assistant Lin.

379
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,439
What's your relationship with Jiao Yang?

380
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,839
Just a normal employer-employee relationship.

381
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,839
A normal employer-employee relationship?

382
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,719
How can an employee eat in the employer's room?

383
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:48,119
I know what you're thinking, Director Zhao.

384
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,239
However, it's not what you're thinking.

385
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,800
President Jiao,

386
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,079
who is a Virgo with blood type A,

387
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,079
won't be

388
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,839
interested in someone like me.

389
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,880
I just want a job.

390
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,239
That's why I became his assistant.

391
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,040
Nothing more than that.

392
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:01,800
Don't worry.

393
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,000
Then, what kind of woman

394
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,599
is the favorite of a Virgo with blood type A?

395
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,160
It's easy actually.

396
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,560
You just need to act accordingly.

397
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:24,439
Normally, a Virgo with blood type A

398
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,680
will scold people without feeling guilty.

399
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,280
Moreover,

400
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,479
he won't realize that he's a sharp-tongued man.

401
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,199
When he meets someone he likes,

402
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,800
he won't admit it.

403
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,560
Instead, he'll keep hide it,

404
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,079
until his beloved gives up.

405
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,239
Yes. Yes. Yes. That's right.

406
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:39,680
Then...

407
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:47,640
Assistant Lin! Assistant Lin!

408
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,439
Assistant Lin.

409
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,800
President Jiao. The Chinese rose wine
and soy poached chicken

410
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,239
is as good as that of Guangzhou Restaurant.

411
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:00,839
I'm glad that you're satisfied with it.

412
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:06,400
President Jiao.

413
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:08,640
Excuse me.

414
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:12,880
How's it?

415
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,119
Did she faint because of feeling touched?

416
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,160
President Jiao.

417
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,560
It's worse than that.

418
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:20,040
Director Zhao called me just now.

419
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,640
She said that Assistant Lin
had difficulty in breathing.

420
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,239
She was about to faint.

421
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:25,000
Please dial 120 now!

422
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:28,719
Assistant Lin.

423
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,719
Assistant Lin.

424
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:34,719
You're awake, Assistant Lin.

425
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,040
What's wrong with Assistant Lin, Doctor?

426
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:43,000
Assistant Lin got asthma because of allergy,

427
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,599
but the allergen was unknown.

428
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:47,920
As the medical officer of the hotel,

429
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I suggest you send her
to the hospital immediately.

430
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,400
It's weird. During the day,

431
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,560
I didn't touch the cat.

432
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,520
Oh, no!

433
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,400
Where are you going, Assistant Lin?

434
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,359
What's wrong?

435
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,319
How did it happen?

436
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,640
You must go to the hospital, Assistant Lin.

437
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,199
How did it happen?

438
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:16,719
Go to the dining hall.

439
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:17,839
What dining hall?

440
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,119
I'm calling an ambulance
to send you to the hospital.

441
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,800
It's too late. Go to the dining hall.

442
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,079
Wait.

443
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:27,400
Are you sure?

444
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:28,719
Yes.

445
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,199
Alright.

Why are you going to the dining hall?

461

Call and ask why 120 hasn't arrived yet.

467
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,599
Alright.

468
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,199
Ying Jun. Ask the doctor of the hotel

469
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:36,280
to come over. Hurry up.

470
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,239
I go with him.

471
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:39,079
Wake up. Wake up, Mr. Sui.

472
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:39,959
Excuse me!

473
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,160
Put me down.

474
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:42,119
Be careful.

475
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,199
Assistant Lin. Don't you...

476
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,839
Get him up.

477
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:06,439
He's fine now.

478
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,599
Lin Miao. Lin Miao.

479
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:23,079
Director Zhao. It's morning now.

480
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,239
After admitting Assistant Lin and Mr. Sui

481
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,239
in hospital last night,

482
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:28,359
you've been checking everything the whole night.

483
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,040
Why don't you rest for a while?

484
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:32,119
I'm not sleepy.

485
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,199
You've checked from the room to the dining hall,

486
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,599
as well as the cutlery and ingredients

487
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,000
for the whole night.

488
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,920
However, you didn't find out

489
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,160
anything that has

490
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,520
made Mr. Sui faint.

491
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,000
Why don't you rest first?

492
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,000
We'll know the problem

493
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,040
after getting the medical reports.

494
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:54,920
Xin. I suggested this customer experience event

495
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,439
to Jiao Yang.

496
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,479
I didn't expect that there would be such a flaw.

497
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,199
I...

498
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,239
Mr. Sui and Assistant Lin

499
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:05,160
are allergic to cat fur.

500
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,199
Is it because of my...

501
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,760
Director Zhao. It was just an accident.

502
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,199
No one would expect it.

503
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,560
Moreover, you did

504
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,920
your job well.

505
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:14,400
Regarding the allergy,

506
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,400
we'll know it

507
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,199
after Mr. Sui and Assistant Lin wake up.

508
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,280

00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,239
for the inspection of cat fur.

679
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:45,280
I'll give an explanation to everyone after that.

680
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:46,599
Three days?

681
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,680
Hong Yu's reputation would
have been the worst after that!

682
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,880
Then, what do you want, President Li?

683
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:50,599
One day.

684
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,479
If President Jiao can't solve it,

685
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,000
please resign.

686
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:58,800
Li.

687
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:04,800
Everyone. The case is still under inspection.

688
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,479
All the napkins were sanitized.

689
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:09,560
The source of cat fur hasn't been verified.

690
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,760
President Jiao is just a commander.

691
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,319
He isn't an executor.

692
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,640
We can't blame him for everything.

693
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,520
I agree with you, President Zhao.

694
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,000
All the shareholders here

695
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,040
know President Jiao for a long time.

696
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:24,239
If he resigns,

697
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,359
everyone will be upset.

698
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,920
However, it's not a petty issue.

699
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,599
We have to take care of all the shareholders.

700
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,760
We must have a decision today.

701
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,959
If we aren't going to punish Jiao Yang,

702
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,520
then his subordinates

703
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,199
who were involved in the event have to be punished.

704
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:44,839
They didn't put the effort in their work.

705
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,800
They didn't even understand

706
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:48,560
the guest's habits and diet,

707
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:51,319
which shows their
irresponsible working attitude.

708
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:54,160
So, I suggest the chairman

709
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:56,000
to fire all the workers.

710
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:57,599
Okay!

711
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,920
I agree with one day.

712
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,160
Shareholders,

713
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,079
the aim of this board meeting

714
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:05,000
is to get an explanation from me.

715
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,920
Okay. I announce that

716
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,760
I'll be fully responsible for this case.

717
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,400
If I can't solve it

718
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,000
by tomorrow,

719
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,000
I'll resign from Hong Yu.

720
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:20,839
However, before that,

721
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,319
nobody can decide on my workers' future.

722
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,839
Are you satisfied with it?

723
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,100
[Outpatient Dept]

724
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,319
It's a complicated case.

725
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:47,520
It can't be solved

726
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,959
even one month is given.

727
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:50,760
It needs to be solved within one day?

728
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,479
Unless someone bears the responsibility,

729
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,520
or Mr. Sui gives a statement that

730
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,079
this incident has nothing to do with

731
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,160
the service given by Leisure Hotel.

732
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,560
However, it's impossible.

733
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,599
So...

734
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,199
So, President Jiao has been
waiting outside Mr. Sui's ward

735
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,959
for more than two hours.

736
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,280
The hygiene of cutlery

737
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,599
is of the utmost importance in the hotel industry.

738
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,680
Moreover, we got this kind of customer.

739
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,760
An apology is useless.

740
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,520
He too.

741
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,880
Why didn't he keep calm?

742
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,800
He was just criticized in the board meeting, then...

743
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:24,439
Assistant Lin.

744
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:26,560
President Jiao did it for us.

745
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:27,760
What?

746
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,760
President Li requested

747
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,839
to fire all the workers
involved in this case, including

748
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,520
Ding Ding who was in charge of data statistics,

749
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,800
Jiang Rou who was in charge
of the menu and tableware,

750
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Ying Jun who communicated
with the manager of the food department,

751
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,599
me as President Jiao's assistant

752
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,640
as well as Assistant Lin as the personal butler.

753
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,400
So, President Jiao

754
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:47,000
argued with President Li for us.

755
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,839
However, one day

756
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,439
is really insufficient for the investigation.

757
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:56,439
It's my mistake.

758
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:58,680
I should have overseen the venue.

759
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,920
However, President Jiao kept
asking me to help Assistant Lin.

760
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,560
I really...

761
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,319
Wait.

762
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:08,360
What did you mean by helping me?

763
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,760
Were you saying that you checked my works?

764
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,040
That's because

765
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,399
President Jiao didn't want
you to be aware of it.

766
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,080
That's why I said that.

767
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,679
You get me a map of this hospital.

768
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:34,679
Dad. Please beg Uncle Jiao on behalf of me.

769
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
It's impossible

770
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,719
for us to make a mistake
in such an important event.

771
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,600
You think that we aren't anxious, Yan?

772
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,280
The problem is that
the medical report stating that

773
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,479
the napkin contained

774
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:46,000
cat fur which caused
the respiratory allergy of Mr. Sui.

775
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,320
It means that the napkin wasn't clean.

776
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,719
No matter how you claim
about the sanitation of napkins,

777
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,959
people will still put the blame on Leisure.

778
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,120
However, we were cautious at every step.

779
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,000
Lin Miao passed the information to Ding Ding.

780
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,800
Ding Ding passed it to Ying Jun after collecting it.

781
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:01,320
Ying Jun modified the menu

782
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,600
and selected the brand of napkins
before handing over to Jiang Rou.

783
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,439
Jiang Rou and I verified it repeatedly.

784
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,479
After Ying Jun confirmed with the food department,

785
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:09,280
he oversaw the venue himself.

786
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,800
See. You all have done everything.

787
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,719
No direct person in charge could be found.

788
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,080
At last, Jiao Yang

789
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,679
has to be responsible for this.

790
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:26,719
Are you alright, Uncle Jiao?

791
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm fine.

792
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:31,639
My blood pressure is increasing.

793
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Alright. Please go out first, Yan.

794
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,639
I'll discuss with Uncle Jiao again.

795
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,080
Chairman.

796
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,600
Keep calm.

797
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:55,320
It's not the first time

798
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,639
the board trying to put
Jiao Yang in an awkward position.

799
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,439
You're old. Health is important.

800
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:01,199
How am I supposed not to be angry?

801
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,719
Last time,

802
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,080
You, Li and I were in a team.

803
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,159
Li has passed away.

804
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,719
Li Dong Qiang is his only son.

805
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,840
Jiao Yang is too young.

806
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,000
He can't take criticism easily.

807
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,879
Don't ask for mercy for your boss anymore.

808
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,639
The careless issue of tableware

809
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:49,959
is the biggest mistake for a hotel manager.

810
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,879
If I forgive him,

811
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,120
it means that I disrespect the industry.

812
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,840
Mr. Sui.

813
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:03,320
So, I'm not here to beg you to forgive him.

814
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:04,719
Really?

815
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,840
I'm here to apologize to you.

816
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,399
I'm really sorry.

817
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,159
I didn't inform my colleagues

818
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,320
about your allergy to car fur.

819
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,879
That's why the accident happened.

820
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:26,360
You aren't someone who would make this mistake.

821
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:28,320
I'm your personal butler.

822
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,760
I feel sorry about what has happened to you.

823
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,439
However, it's really my mistake.

824
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,040
I'm really curious.

825
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,719
Why would you

826
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:43,159
defend your unprofessional boss?

827
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,919
Actually, when I was President Jiao's assistant,

828
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:52,120
I also thought that he had
no experience and was not serious at all.

829
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,919
He was certainly not

830
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:55,199
a qualified boss.

831
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,280
However, I realized that

832
00:37:58,399 --> 00:38:00,159
he's a potential man.

833
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,159
Besides being friendly with the workers,

834
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,479
he also helps his staff who suffer
from bread-and-butter issues.

835
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,239
He did everything himself
in this experience event.

836
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,560
The water temperature
of the pool was tested by him.

837
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,719
The shower head of your room

838
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,000
was also modified by him.

839
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,120
Although the case of allergy

840
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,719
won't affect him,

841
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,919
he still decided to stand outside your room

842
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:24,919
to give you a sincere apology,

843
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:26,040
so as to protect his workers.

844
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,399
So for such a

845
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:29,800
responsible boss,

846
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:32,479
I sincerely request you

847
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:34,600
to give him and Hong Yu
a chance to apologize to you.

848
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:41,639
Did your boss know that you met me?

849
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:43,520
Of course not.

850
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,280
Or else,

851
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,159
he would have fired such a worker.

852
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,600
Sorry, Mr. Sui.

853
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,879
Sorry for taking your time.

854
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,399
I'm really sorry about yesterday's incident.

855
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,520
Please give me three minutes.

856
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:07,000
I would like to apologize
to you on behalf of Hong Yu

857
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,919
and myself.

858
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,280
Why are you here, President Jiao?

859
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,600
Please drink, Mr. Sui.

860
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,919
Under the normal temperature,

861
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:26,439
the taste of a drink
will change within five minutes.

862
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:27,719
Based on your requirement,

863
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:30,000
the ratio is three to seven.
Three and a half ice cubes.

864
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,800
You don't have to say anything, Mr. Jiao.

865
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:34,679
My lawyer is drafting a legal letter.

866
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,320
You've misunderstood, Mr. Sui.

867
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,399
I'm not here to stop you from filing a case.

868
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,760
Then, why are you here?

869
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:52,239
I hope that you will lay the blame on me only.

870
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,560
Please don't blame Hong Yu and Leisure.

871
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,120
Because I'm fully responsible for it.

872
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,040
She said that it was her responsibility.

873
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,439
You said that it was your responsibility.

874
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,320
You are an elite in this industry, Mr. Sui.

875
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
You know it.

876
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,399
This kind of customer experience event

877
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:13,560
requires at least half a month

878
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,239
to one month of preparation.

879
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,239
However, because of my stubbornness,

880
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,520
the duration of preparation was reduced.

881
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:22,120
That's why the mistake happened.

882
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,639
However, it's my responsibility.

883
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,840
My subordinates

884
00:40:28,919 --> 00:40:30,719
have put so much effort

885
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,760
in this customer experience event.

886
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,280
So, they shouldn't be blamed.

887
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,000
Besides, my father's business

888
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,639
shouldn't

889
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,600
pay the price because of my eagerness.

890
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,760
So, I beg you, Mr. Sui.

891
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:44,560
Please lay the blame on me only.

892
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,120
I'll do anything

893
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,439
you want

894
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,399
to compensate your loss.

895
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:54,439
Mr. Sui. I've told you

896
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,120
the incident

897
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,719
was due to my carelessness.

898
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:59,560
I instruct you to return
to your ward now, Assistant Lin.

899
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,040
I came here before you, President Jiao.

900
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,040
A first come, first served basis?

901
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,760
I was standing outside Mr. Sui's room

902
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,959
while you were still in your ward.

903
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,439
It's because you're not smart enough

904
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:10,639
to know where Mr. Sui is.

905
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:11,399
Enough.

906
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,959
You two are here to argue?

907
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:20,639
I don't mean to offend you, Mr. Jiao.

908
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,479
You aren't really

909
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:24,399
a qualified hotel manager.

910
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,520
However,

911
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,600
you're a great leader.

912
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:34,800
Your workers have been
annoying me for the whole afternoon.

913
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,560
I...

914
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,159
Not Miss Lin.

915
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,000
Mr. Sui.

916
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,879
You can't blame President Jiao.

917
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,080
I didn't collect the information well.

918
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,679
No, no, no.

919
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:47,199
I didn't pick the right napkin.

920
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:48,199
And me.

921
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,840
I didn't oversee the venue.

922
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,479
Please blame me.

923
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:52,639
I didn't communicate well
with the manager of the food department.

924
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,600
These people

925
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,520
really like to take the blame.

926
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,879
Mr. Jiao. These workers

927
00:42:05,879 --> 00:42:07,399
are your best fortune.

928
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,040
I hope that you don't disappoint them.

929
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:12,959
What did you mean, Mr. Sui?

930
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:15,879
Whatever.

931
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,439
I'll send you off, Mr. Sui.
