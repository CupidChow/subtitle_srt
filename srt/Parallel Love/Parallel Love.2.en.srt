You can sleep here.

34
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,800
What are you looking at?
Aren't you going to leave?

35
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,399
I just want to see if there's anything else you need.

36
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,759
Why are you looking at me like that?

37
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:46,679
Are you going to watch me sleep?

38
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:48,279
I'm not going to take my clothes off.

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,520
It's quite late.

40
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,240
You should get some rest now, President Jiao.

41
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,360
I'm going to sleep.

42
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,800
Lady, you order me around in my own house.

43
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,119
Is that how you repay my kindness?

44

President Jiao, we're going to be late to work.

President Jiao. We're going to be late. Wake up now.

54
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:00,839
Wait a minute.

I'm waking up now, am I not?

63
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,160
Get out first. I want to get changed.

64
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,640
Okay.

65
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,160
Be quick. Be quick.

66
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,320
Why are you urging me?

67
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,200
I'll wake up if I want to.

68
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,679
I won't if I don't feel like it.

69
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,760
I don't feel like getting up now. I'm sleeping in.

What can you do? Hit me?

It's early in the morning.

00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,440
Sure.

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,239
No, ma'am.

This way.

Okay. Be quick.

81
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:46,239
President Jiao, those clothes for me
are not bad. Thanks a lot.

82
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,040
What's with her attitude?

83
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,640
Isn't that an electric toothbrush?

00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,079
It has run out of power. Mind your own business.

85
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,119
President Jiao, we're going to be late.

86
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,320
Can you be quick?

87
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:48,920
President Jiao.

88
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,760
President Jiao, we're really going to be late.

89
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,760
Which suit should I wear?

90

00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:01,920
I would've smacked you in the head.

92
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:06,279
One, two, sky blue, all out except you.

93
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,799
President Jiao, how is it possible that

94
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,480
you ake a longer time than women to get ready?

95
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,119
Which shoes do you think I should wear?

96
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,119
It doesn't matter.

97
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,480
There's no need to panic.

98
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,959
I have a routine to follow before I head out.

99
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,239
Wait somewhere else.

100
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,799
Such a troublesome person. Who is he trying to fool?

101
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,960
Have you seen someone
this handsome before?

102
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:49,400
I've never seen such a narcissistic man.

103
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,159
Yikes.

104
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,039
I'm ready.

105
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:58,159
Let's head out.

106
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,559
Xin, why are you at the reception?

107
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,000
President Jiao, there has been an issue at the hotel.

108
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,159
What?

109
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,239
The wedding venue is double-booked.

110
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,159
What's going on?

111
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,200
That's what I was told.

112
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,599
Besides, one of the couples' parent is

113
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:23,000
a friend of the chairman.

114
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,840
So they didn't book the venue

115
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,719
following Leisure Hotel's standard
booking procedure.

116
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,559
But they said they had called you on the phone.

117
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,919
Didn't you receive the phone call?

118
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:36,239
Probably not.

119
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,159
Hello?

120
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:46,840
Who is this?

121
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,719
Speak.

122
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:58,159
Besides, many people contact me every day.

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,119
I might have received that call,

124
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,640
maybe, probably.

125
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,960
Did you say "yes" then, President Jiao?

126
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:11,400
It's just a wedding.

127
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,719
It should be your job.

128
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,640
Do I have to deal with it myself?

129
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,159
As if

130
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,960
you can fix everything on your own.

131
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,799
We've already decorated the first couple's

132
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,119
wedding venue.

133
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,640
But given that the wedding date
falls on Chinese Valentine's Day,

134
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,440
I've already checked with all our hotels

135
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,359
and found out that

136
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,039
there is no

137
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,440
more vacancy.

138
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,919
If that's the case... Alright.

139
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:36,719
Xin,

140
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,919
contact all the hotels in the city right now.

141
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,320
Tell them that we're willing

142
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,119
to rent their venue tomorrow, and we'll

143
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,400
pay double the rent.

144
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,640
As for the issue with money,

145
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,400
pay for the rent with the credit card

146
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,239
my dad gave me.

147
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:49,760
Also, inform all the wedding planning companies

148
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
to work overtime.

149
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,880
Tomorrow, within a day,

150
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,880
they have to finish decorating the wedding venue.

151
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,119
Again, pay them with my credit card.

152
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,520
But remember that

153
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,400
the most important thing is

154
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,000
my father must not learn about it,

155
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,400
before we fix this disaster.

156
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,119
President Jiao, I have to tell you...

157
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:08,119
President Jiao, the wedding is tomorrow.

158
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,359
The couple has booked the venue.

159
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,520
You can't simply change the venue.

160
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,880
Besides, even if the couple
agrees to this arrangement,

161
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,559
how do we find somewhere as good as

162
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:16,000
Leisure within a day?

163
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,760
Assistant Lin, I must remind you that

164
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,640
you're my assistant and I'm your boss.

165
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,339
From now on, if you wish to speak to
me, you should give me a heads-up.

166
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,679
President Jiao,

167
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,280
I have something to tell you...

168
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,960
I have something to tell you, President Jiao.

169
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,479
I must also remind you that

170
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,719
your plan should be applicable.

171
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,159
Xin, don't listen to her nonsense.

172
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,080
Do as I say now.

173
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:36,760
President Jiao,

174
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,280
I need to tell you about something.

175
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,239
This situation might be a little tricky.

176
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,239
Tricky how?

177
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,080
The parents of the couple

178
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,119
are the chairman and Director Zhao's friends.

179
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:46,200
They specifically requested

180
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,840
to hold the wedding at Leisure Hotel.

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,080
Besides, the chairman and Director Zhao

182
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,119
have received the wedding invitation a while ago.

183
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:55,039
That's why the chairman is furious now.

184
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:58,000
He wants to see you in his office immediately.

185
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:58,840
Huh?

186
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,679
Xin.

187
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,440
President Jiao.

188
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,640
How do I look?

189
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,119
President Jiao, it's perfect.

190
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:18,799
What, President Jiao?

191
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,520
Also, my name is not "eh".

192
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,159
I know that.

193
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:24,440
When we enter the room, don't speak a word.

194
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,280
Or else you'll end up on the street tonight.

195
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,359
If it weren't for the mission,

196
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:30,440
I wouldn't want to waste my time

197
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,960
helping fix a narcissistic and useless

198
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
president's mess, okay?

199
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,039
Xin. Go ahead.

200
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,119
Wait a minute.

201
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,239
I'd better go to the washroom first.

202
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:39,320
I suddenly feel like going.

203
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,479
Come in.

204
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,000
You win.

205
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,559
Dad. Uncle Zhao. Director Li.

206
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:06,320
Why is the atmosphere so tense?

207
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,159
I'm already trying to fix this problem.

208
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,479
Jiao Yang.

209
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,159
I readily handed over Leisure Hotel to you.

210
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:14,400
How do you repay me?

211
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,359
If it weren't for the couple's parents

212
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:18,760
who tried to skip the hotel's
standard booking procedure

213
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:21,239
because of your connections,

214
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:22,760
we wouldn't have this problem.

215
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,640
Just an excuse.

216
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,760
Just an excuse!

217
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,479
The couple's parents are

218
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,840
close friends with your Uncle Zhao and me.

219
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,919
If you're friends, you can negotiate with them.

220
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:33,640
Nonsense.

221
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,640
Nonsense.

222
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,840
When you get married,

223
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,919
I'll see if you're willing to 'negotiate'.

224
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:40,799
See that?

225
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,039
I asked someone to pull the phone record

226
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,119
in the vice president's office.

227
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,440
The couple and the hotel

228
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,880
kept calling you on the phone yesterday,

229
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,200
but they couldn't reach you.

230
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,159
I... I didn't receive that call yesterday.

231
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:51,919
You're still trying to push the blame?

232
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,039
You're still trying to push the blame?

233
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:56,080
The phone record is right there.

234
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,799
At 4:30 in the afternoon yesterday,

235
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,640
what were you doing?

236
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,359
Dad, I definitely didn't receive a call

237
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,679
at 4:30 yesterday.

238
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:03,760
Xin.

239
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,799
Why didn't you tell me about the phone call?

240
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,200
Take that.

241
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,760
Wait a minute. At 4:30 in the afternoon?

242
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,119
Assistant Lin.

243
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:12,919
President Jiao wants to see you in his office.

244
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,200
Your phone is ringing.

245
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,640
How did it go with the
double-booked wedding venue?

246
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,960
Cheng Jun, you're here.

247
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,919
President Jiao has not yet given us

248
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,599
an applicable backup plan.

249
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,919
Director Wu asks us

250
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,760
to help the president office solve this crisis.

251
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,080
The board of directors are urging me

252
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,080
to send them the project plan
that I made a while ago.

253
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,599
My works are piling up.

254
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,880
I'm dying.

255
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:38,919
Stop chatting, Li.

256
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,080
The chairman is waiting to
see the document in your hand.

257
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,119
If you don't bring it over now,

258
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:44,039
you'll be the one getting scolded.

259
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,719
Li.

260
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,400
You should focus on other tasks at hand.

261
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,359
I'll deliver this document to you.

262
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,559
Thank you so much.

263
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:58,960
Hi.

264
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,159
I have a document for the chairman.

265
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,159
I'm afraid it's not the right time.

266
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:07,559
Have they resolved the wedding venue crisis?

267
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:09,119
Not yet.

268
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,640
The wedding is tomorrow.

269
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,320
We haven't found a new venue yet.

270
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,960
The chairman is furious.

271
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,640
I don't dare to enter the office now.

272
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,400
Tell you what.

273
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,640
You can put the document here for now.

274
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,559
I'll hand it over to him for you later.

275
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,220
[Itinerary for the backup wedding]

276
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,280
Okay.

277
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,960
Thank you for that.

278
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,919
It's nothing.

279
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,919
Due to your mistake,

280
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,719
the company's reputation has taken a big hit

281
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,400
that might lead to huge losses.

282
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,320
I'm very disappointed in you.

283
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:51,840
But it isn't that serious yet, right?

284
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,520
Besides, I'm already trying to resolve the issue.

285
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,679
Why are you overreacting?

286
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,119
If you go on like this...

287
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:00,880
No. I can't let the situation worsen.

288
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,559
I want to go home.

289
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,200
I...

290
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,960
Chairman. Director Zhao. President Li.

291
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,919
I think you've misunderstood
what President Jiao meant.

292
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,200
He means rather than issuing an apology,

293
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,359
he prefers to come up with a way

294
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,960
to make sure the wedding proceeds as planned.

295
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,359
Proceeds as planned?

296
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,840
This is a wedding, not a mass blind date.

297
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,719
On our way to the office, President Jiao

298
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:29,760
told me that

299
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,719
he wanted to plan a spectacular

300
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:35,039
and memorable wedding for the couple.

301
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,640
That way, they will ignore that fact that

302
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,559
their wedding venue is double-booked.

303
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,080
We don't even have a wedding venue.

304
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,359
Where are they going to hold their wedding?

305
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Actually, what does couples

306
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,320
care the most?

307
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,159
They care whether their wedding

308
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,520
is unique or

309
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,919
dreamy enough.

310
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,520
As long as we fulfill that desire,

311
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,640
the wedding location

312
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,239
isn't that big of a deal.

313
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,320
President Jiao is confident

314
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,840
that we can find a spot in Leisure Hotel

315
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,200
and decorate it tomorrow.

316
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,599
We'll give this couple a perfect wedding.

317
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:09,560
Jiao Yang.

318
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,199
Are you planning to do that?

319
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,560
Yes.

320
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,239
We won't let this crisis ruin

321
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,479
such an auspicious occasion for the couple.

322
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,000
Before the wedding tomorrow,

323
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,880
we'll surely come up with a plan.

324
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:26,719
Alright.

325
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,160
We shall look forward to

326
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,479
a spectacular and memorable wedding tomorrow.

327
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,119
Chairman.

328
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,319
Half the guests at tomorrow's wedding

329
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:37,520
are people who are acquainted with the company.

330
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:38,719
So what?

331
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,560
It's him, not me, who will be

332
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,119
embarrassed if things go wrong.

333
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:44,160
If he messes this up again this time,

334
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,359
I'll follow your advice and

335
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,839
demote him to an entry-level position.

336
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,119
Let him start from the bottom.

337
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,760
Okay.

338
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,760
We shall give Jiao Yang another chance.

339
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,719
You must work hard, Jiao Yang.

340
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:06,760
Yes.

341
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,239
I will.

342
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,760
Since Assistant Lin is the one who

343
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,880
made such a big promise
in front of the board of directors,

344
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,640
I'll assign this matter to you.

345
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,359
I... I made a big promise?

346
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,959
Hey, the chairman just said

347
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,119
he gave you a chance.

348
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,560
So you do know your place.

349
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,800
You practically did all the talking
in front of the board.

350
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,400
I thought I was an assistant.

351
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,160
It's decided.

352
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:39,680
I'm telling you, Lin San Shui.

353
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,959
If the wedding isn't as "spectacular"

354
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,959
and "memorable" as you promised,

355
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:45,479
That's on you.

356
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,920
Hey, Tang,

357
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:50,959
I'm getting off work.

358
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,359
Save the best computer for me.

359
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,520
I'm heading over...

360
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,199
Hello.

361
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,280
I'm President Jiao's assistant.

362
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,400
President Jiao asked me to inform you

363
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,319
that he can't come over.

364
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,640
Sorry about that. Thanks and bye.

365
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Hey, Lin San Shui. What's the meaning?

366
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,479
Are you trying to get me involved
in the wedding planning?

367
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:04,280
Hand over the phone.

368
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,199
No, President Jiao.

369
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,239
As the person in charge of Leisure Hotel,

370
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,920
how can you leave at this moment?

371
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,760
Where's your conscience?

372
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:11,319
Hold your heart and ask if it's aching

373
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,079
with guilt.

374
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,280
My conscience, my heart is lively as usual.

375
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:14,839
I'm telling you.

376
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,719
You're not in the position to lecture me.

377
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,760
It was you who made a big promise to the directors.

378
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,280
Get the job done if you're so great.

379
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:22,599
No, President Jiao.

380
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,040
We have such a limited time.

381
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,920
I can't plan an entirely new

382
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,839
wedding on my own.

383
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,359
You have to stay here to

384
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,319
make sure all the departments cooperate with us.

385
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,719
I don't care what you're up to.

386
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:34,079
President Jiao. President Jiao.

387
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,560
I have limited ability and resources on my own.

388
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,719
You have to oversee the work.

389
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,680
Or else I... I can't make this happen.

390
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:43,839
Alright. I'll stay here and see what you can do.

391
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,160
Hello.

392
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:58,560
President Jiao, I just want to tell you

393
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:01,000
that I've faxed the couple's info to you.

394
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,199
Anything else you want me to do?

395
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,040
You can talk to her.

396
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:03,920
Take the phone.

397
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:07,839
Hello.

398
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,560
If it isn't much of a hassle,

399
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,119
can you forward to me some pictures of

400
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:14,040
Leisure Hotel's outdoor and indoor areas ?

401
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,000
Sure.

402
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,359
I have nothing else to do.

403
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,640
Why can't I play a game?

404
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,400
Of course, you have work to do.

405
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,040
Here.

406
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,400
This is the latest info we've got.

407
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:35,760
I want to fill out this form.

408
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,719
Answer the questions I ask.

409
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:43,880
The company already has a decent backup plan.

410
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,280
You're just doing extra work.

411
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,719
Isn't that a waste of company resources?

412
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,040
There has been a change in the wedding location.

413
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,640
Of course, we need to re-plan everything.

414
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,959
Don't you know that?

415
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,359
Okay. Answer all these questions.

416
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:55,040
Assistant Lin.

417
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,959
I hope you'll mind the way you address me.

418
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:01,839
President Jiao.

419
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:02,560
Ask away.

420
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:06,199
How old is the bride?

421
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:06,920
22 years old.

422
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,439
22.

423
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,040
Her horoscope?

424
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,319
Pisces.

425
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,839
Sentimental.

426
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,319
Her favorite flower?

427
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,400
The lilies.

428
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,839
Chairman, we've checked.

429
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,079
President Jiao did not book any

430
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,439
flight ticket or train ticket

431
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,839
or any other hotel.

432
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:22,839
His most recent phone calls
were with Secretary Yan.

433
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,359
Yes, lilies.

434
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:27,119
Tomorrow, try to gather all the lilies

435
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,479
from all florists in the city.

436
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:30,040
By the way. The weather forecast.

437
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,719
Have you confirmed with the weather station?

438
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:33,040
It'll be sunny, right?

439
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:35,199
Um, okay. Now, gather all the

440
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:37,199
Leisure Hotel staff who are on duty.

441
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:38,439
Tell them to clean the rooftop.

442
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,319
Don't worry. I'll tell Jiao Yang

443
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,560
to give them overtime pay.

444
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,760
Call me President Jiao.

445
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,000
President Jiao will surely agree on it.

446
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,439
Alright. That's it for now.

447
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,640
Why do you ask Xin to clean the rooftop?

448
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,079
For the wedding. What else is it for?
A sacrificial ceremony to Heaven?

449
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,000
Will the couple agree with a rooftop wedding?

450
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:01,400
Based on my

451
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:03,280
previous experience in wedding planning,

452
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,640
brides usually

453
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,040
call all the shots for their weddings.

454
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,119
This bride is 22 years old.

455
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,319
She has just graduated.

456
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,040
I'm sure she has spent four years

457
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,959
in the university

458
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:14,880
watching and reading
romance dramas and comic books.

459
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,560
She must have had a dreamy

460
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,160
vision of love and romance.

461
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,800
Moreover, she's a Pisces.

462
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,239
Pisces ladies are

463
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,640
romantic and unrealistic by nature.

464
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:25,040
They are like little girls who never grow up.

465
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,239
I think there are

466
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:28,280
only two types of

467
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,319
weddings that suit her fancy.

468
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,000
The first one is a church wedding.

469
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,520
The second is an outdoor wedding.

470
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,680
Based on what's available at our hotel,

471
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,839
there are only two spots for an outdoor wedding.

472
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:38,760
One, the swimming pool.

473
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,560
But the swimming pool

474
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,800
is too close to the wedding venue of

475
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,520
the other couple.

476
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,000
So we're left with the second option.

477
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,079
The second spot is the rooftop.

478
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,160
That's why I made the decision.

479
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,599
Assistant Lin.

480
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:53,640
I have to remind you that

481
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:54,760
the wedding will be held at night.

482
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,959
Leisure doesn't have proper lighting on the rooftop.

483
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:57,880
I know that.

484
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,439
That's why I've brought you here.

485
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:01,520
This is a business district.

486
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,319
Are we here buy lamps at this time?

487
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,479
We're not buying. We'll just take some.

488
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,160
Hello?

489
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,040
Is it the banquet department at Champs Hotel?

490
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,560
Well. Three days ago, I booked a banquet hall

491
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,640
at your hotel

492
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,920
for a wedding tomorrow night.

493
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,319
Yes.

494
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,680
I'll confirm the booking with you again

495
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,439
tomorrow morning.

496
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:28,160
Please reserve the banquet hall for me.

497
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:28,940
[9:38-10:00. The latest time to
enter the venue is at 10:00 a.m.]

498
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,239
Okay. Thanks.

499
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,439
Surprise!

500
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:43,640
Jun.

501
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,319
It's late. Why are you here?

502
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,560
It's because tomorrow is Chinese Valentine's Day.

503
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:49,520
Oh.

504
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,959
But I have to work tomorrow.

505
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,040
I can't spend the day with you.

506
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,319
I know.

507
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,599
That's why I come to you.

508
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,319
Do you want to guess

509
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,520
what I've bought you as a gift?

510
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,119
Sorry, Jun.

511
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,479
I have to work overtime tonight too.

512
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
Our company's hotel

513
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,560
has to host two weddings but we only

514
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,680
have one wedding venue.

515
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,319
The wedding is tomorrow.

516
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,280
Did you just find out today?

517
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,599
I found it out a while ago.

518
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:21,959
But my bosses just found it out today.

519
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,520
I even prepared a backup plan.

520
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
My boyfriend is the best.

521
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,400
But weddings don't have to be held

522
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,920
in the banquet hall.

523
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
It's so dull.

524
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,439
You can hold

525
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,599
a wedding at an outdoor location.

526
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:41,119
Actually, every woman will certainly be

527
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,599
contented as long as

528
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,920
she thinks that

529
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,160
her wedding is special.

530
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,880
It's not that simple.

531
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,839
Yeah, I don't know much about your work.

532
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,760
I only know

533
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,479
that my boyfriend

534
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:53,119
is the most impressive man
in the world and the universe.

535
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,119
You can work later.

536
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,839
Open the gift first, okay?

537
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:57,880
I'll leave once you open it.

538
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,560
I won't get in your way, okay?

539
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,719
Manager Wu.

540
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,760
Yes.

541
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,319
I know tomorrow is Chinese Valentine's Day

542
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,560
and many people want to book hotel halls.

543
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:14,760
But haven't I

544
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,959
already talked to you about that?

545
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,079
Okay. I'll meet you in person.

546
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,920
We can talk this through. Okay?

547
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:22,959
No. Not at all.

548
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,160
I've already made a backup plan.

549
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,119
I'll head back to the company to pick it up.

550
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,800
It'll take 30 minutes at most. I'll go meet you.

551
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,839
Okay.

552
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:30,839
Jun, I have some work to do now.

553
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,760
You can take a cab home later.

554
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,119
I can't drive you home.

555
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,640
No. Wait.

556
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,560
I have to go now.

557
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,319
No. I...

558
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,640
I'm coming along.

559
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,319
I'm telling you.

560
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,560
Don't try to woo me with such an odd tactic.

561
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,359
I'm not into it.

562
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,760
What? What are you talking about?

563
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,959
Take this off now.

564
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,040
No. This kind of errand...

565
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,760
Why don't you ask Xin to buy these?

566
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,160
Why must you torment me?

567
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:12,560
No. Xin has something else to deal with.

568
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,439
Besides, I can only test the effect of

569
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,680
the lighting tonight.

570
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,839
I don't have the time either.
I don't have time to buy these.

571
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,439
Quick.

572
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:20,160
You think I want to do this?

573
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:21,239
I don't have a choice.

574
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,560
I don't want to do it if I have a choice.

575
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,560
It's done.

576
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,839
Get down. Let's...

577
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:29,079
As an assistant, what should you do?

578
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,560
Not bad.

579
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,160
It seems that you have a good understanding

580
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,400
of the principles and requirements of your job.

581
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,319
I'm relieved.

582
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,959
Alright. Stop talking.

583
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,560
Let's steal... No. Let's borrow some in this tree

584
00:26:59,319 --> 00:26:59,959
as well.

585
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,439
No.

586
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,880
We've taken so many things. That's enough.

587
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,079
Not at all.

588
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:07,719
You're such a weirdo.

589
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,280
You're suicidal and homeless.

590
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,640
You do anything to get what you want.

591
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,359
Did your boyfriend kick you out of the house?

592
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,359
No.

593
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,800
Don't be so childish.

594
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,319
Quick. Steal that.

595
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,719
You're nervous.

596
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,119
Was I right?

597
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,000
No, you aren't. Do me a favor.

598
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,119
Stop talking nonsense.

599
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:40,280
Let's get it done quickly.

600
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,119
Quick. Be quick.

601
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:41,959
No.

602
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,599
Cheng Jun, wait for me.

603
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:14,119
What...What are you doing?

604
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:24,880
You shouldn't touch me.

605
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,400
Let go. Lin Miao.

606
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Let go of me.

607
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,160
Let go.

608
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,959
Let go.

609
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,040
I know it's frustrating when someone else

610
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,439
discovers your secret.

611
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,319
I understand if you want revenge.

612
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,439
But you're doing it in such a childish way.

613
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,479

00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,880
Why are you running?

623
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,719
Jun.

624
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:22,920
Didn't I ask you to go home first?

625
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,119
You're awful.

626
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:26,560
You told me that

627
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,239
you want to

628
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:28,760
discuss something with Manager Wang or whoever

629
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,520
and you made me wait.

630
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,439
But when we finally met,

631
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:32,160
you looked absent-minded when we talked.

632
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,920
Tomorrow is Chinese Valentine's Day.

633
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,160
I've even prepared a gift for you.

634
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,319
You haven't even looked at it.

635
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,479
Look at that couple just now.

636
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,520
They were holding each other.
They were inseparable.

637
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,359
That was so sweet.

638
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,160
You...

639
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,319
It's my fault.

640
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,040
What do you want me to do then?

641
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,959
I don't want much from you.

642
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:50,800
I just...

643
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,160
Everyone says that girls should
give their boyfriends chocolates

644
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,040
before Chinese Valentine's Day.

645
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,959
So I've prepared a box of chocolates.

646
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:00,920
It's a box full of my tiny hearts.

647
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,520
I quite like them.

But Jun,

649
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,239
I must return to the company to write a project plan.

650
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:07,839
If I bring snacks back to the office,

651
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,160
my colleagues will make fun of me.

652
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:11,119
Why not take it first?

653
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:13,239
Give it to me when we meet next time, okay?

654
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:14,880
I should go now.

655

00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,079
Stop right there.

673
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:00,479
Sorry about that.

674
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:02,000
Stop right there.

675
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,959
Stop.

676
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,599
Stop.

677
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,959
Stop pushing me. Let's head back.

678
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:27,920
No. Why are we running?

679
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,040
We're just borrowing lamps.

680
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,119
Why do we end up like this?

681
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,800
Shut up. If we didn't get out of there soon enough,

682
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,079
they would've caught us already.

683
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:35,319
Alright. They haven't seen us.

684
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,119
We should leave.

685
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,079
Get away from me.

686
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,400
Stop touching me.

687
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,239
What do you mean?

688
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,640
Weren't you the one who cuddled up to me just now?

689
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,959
No, just now I was...

690
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:45,719
Be gentler.

691
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:47,119
I risked my life for this.

692
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,760
Stop right there.

693
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:58,040
Stop.

694
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,160
Untangle this.

695
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,319
Untangle this.

696
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,119
Alright. Stop that.

697
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:33,599
Did you do it on purpose?

698
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,199
It was so close.

699
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,119
If it weren't for my improvisation just now,

700
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,560
all our effort tonight would've been a waste.

701
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:51,079
Yeah. It's all these lamps' fault.

702
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:53,599
The wires are unexpectedly tough.

703
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:10,160
This is...

704
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,800
Wipe with this.

705
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:12,560
Wipe what?

706
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,319
Your foot.

707
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:20,959
Okay.

708
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,359
There are three hours till daybreak.

709
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,439
Later on, when the lighting technicians arrive,

710
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:33,160
I'll get everyone to set up the light stands.

711
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:35,239
We'll decorate the venue and then hang the lights.

712
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,680
Before daybreak, we must at least

713
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,160
check the effect of the lighting once.

714
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:39,680
If there's no other issue,

715
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:40,920
then we're pretty much prepared.

716
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,359
Assistant Lin, you forget about something.

717
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,719
What?

718
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,180
[Message from Jun]

719
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,280
I've arrived home.

720
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,520
Don't tire yourself out at work.

721
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,359
Happy Valentine's Day.

722
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,119
Li.

723
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,839
Does President Jiao have anything plan?

724
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:06,640
Yeah.

725
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,199
They seem to plan a rooftop wedding.

726
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,760
The plan sounds unrealistic.

727
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,439
Leisure is still in a mess.

728
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:14,719
That's fine...

729
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,719
Let's come up with more ideas.

730
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,120
When I call you, go over there.
Let's do this together.

731
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,919
Hi, President Jiao.

732
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,040
Hi, President Jiao.

733
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,760
Hey, everyone. Thanks for your hard work.

734
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,520
Have some night snacks.

735
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,639
Thank you, President Jiao.

736
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,280
Thank you, President Jiao. Thank you.

737
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,479
Thank you, President Jiao.

738
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,399
Thank you, President Jiao.

739
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,280
Thank you, President Jiao.

740
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,479
Enjoy the food.

741
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,639
Assistant Lin.

742
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,919
Come here.

743
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,040
This is the thing you forget to do.

744
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:05,520
Thanks.

745
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:10,399
But the company has already
given everyone overtime pay

746
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,479
and prepared warm water for us.

747
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,760
Those are from the company.

748
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:16,199
This is just a small gesture from me.

749
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,320
President Jiao, it surprises me that you

750
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,159
know how to build connections at the workplace.

751
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:20,919
Of course.

752
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:23,159
How else would my employees

753
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:25,239
protect me from my father's watchful eyes?

754
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:28,360
Not bad.

755
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,239
Who knows that you're kind of smart?

756
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,239
It's not yet done.

757
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:35,560
Once Xin brings us the decorations

758
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,120
like flowers and balloons,

759
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,639
we'll decorate the place properly.

760
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,239
It's pretty much done now.

761
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,159
It's already late at night.
Where did you get

762
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,719
freshly ground coffee and bubble tea?

763
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,719
The internet cafe where I play online games

764
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,879
wants to keep their customers awake at night,

765
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:54,040
so they prepare some

766
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,320
coffee and bubble tea.

767
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,560
I think it tastes nice.

768
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,239
Better than coffee from normal cafes.

769
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,199
Besides, I'm quite close to the owner.

770
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,320
He lets me buy 10 and get 1 free.

771
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,840
Excuse me, Miss Lin.

772
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,639
We've hooked up all the cables.
Should we turn on the power?

773
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,360
Okay. It's almost dawn.

774
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,320
Let's test it out.

775
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,840
Okay.

776
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:10,520
Thank you.

777
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,399
By the way, give me your phone.

778
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,159
What for?

779
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,840
I'm taking pictures of the venue,

780
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,520
so that you're able to convince the groom and bride.

781
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,560
Just me?

782
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,959
Why don't you come along?

783
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,879
First of all, I have to stay here for the whole day

784
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:30,320
to decorate the venue.

785
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,439
Second, you're the vice president after all.

786
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:34,479
You have more sway.

787
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:35,719
You can go on your own.

788
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,000
Yes.

789
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:40,919
Well, I've promised to

790
00:36:40,919 --> 00:36:42,239
let you be in charge after all.

791
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,560
Are you sure you don't want to attend
the wedding with the chairman?

792
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,479
Alright.

793
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:49,760
I've said. I'm your employee today.

794
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:50,959
Let's turn on the lights.

795
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,360
Let's test it out.

796
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,719
Three, two, one.

797
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:57,840
Turn it on.

798
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,639
You see that.

799
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,719
So beautiful. So pretty.

800
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,719
Look at this.

801
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,360
What do you think, President Jiao?

802
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:18,320
Quite nice.

803
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,479
Isn't your foot injured?

804
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,239
Here.

805
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:42,000
President Jiao, you have
medical plasters with you?

806
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,560
The pharmacy opens 24/7.

807
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,560
President Jiao, you're quite thoughtful.

808
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:51,840
You have no idea.

809
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:54,879
Don't just hold it.

810
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,239
Put it on.

811
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:00,439
Let me help you.

812
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,159
Done.

813
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,520
Thank you.

[Hong Yu Group, Itinerary for the backup wedding]

815
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,959
Cheng Jun, you're impressive.

816
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,199
Within one night,

817
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,320
you've finished the itinerary
for the backup wedding.

818
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,919
Other people will

819
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:57,800
need a week to finish it.

820
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,239
I'm acquainted with people
working at other hotels.

821
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:08,320
Coincidentally, Champs has an extra banquet hall,

822
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,320
and they are willing to rent it to us.

823
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,600
If we stick to this schedule,

824
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,239
we'll be able to finish decorating

825
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,919
the venue before tonight's wedding.

826
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:17,560
Then we'll send some cars to the Leisure
Hotel entrance and put them on standby.

827
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,879
They can drive the guests to Champs Hotel later.

828
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,360
You've really thought about everything.

829
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:23,360
The board of directors
will be impressed with you.

830
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:24,840
Li.

831
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,840
Let's deliver this document

832
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,479
to the chairman's office.

833
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:29,280
Okay.

834
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:33,600
Is it your job to worry about

835
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,159
President Jiao's business?

836
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,719
The chairman has said that

837
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,320
President Jiao will handle the

838
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,760
wedding preparation himself.

839
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,239
You just have to do your own jobs.

840
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,600
Don't overestimate your ability and influence,

841
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:50,760
especially the nobody who

842
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,959
doesn't know his place.

843
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:56,679
Who do you think you are? The chairman's son?

844
00:39:58,919 --> 00:39:59,919
Director Wu

845
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,360
will surely take credit of your work

846
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,800
in front of the chairman again.

847
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,639
Chairman, you're here early.

848
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,159
Same with you.

849
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,320
I'm here to check on Jiao Yang.

850
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:22,600
I heard that they moved
the wedding location to the rooftop.

851
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,959
I can't keep up with their wild imagination.

852
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:28,560
It's a good thing that young folks have ideas.

853
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,320
Yeah.

854
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,600
Where's Jiao Yang?

855
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:36,399
Why is he not around at such a critical time?

856
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,679
Isn't he with the couple?

857
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:38,719
Why hasn't he come back?

858
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,560
Assistant Lin.

859
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,360
I've just talked to President Jiao on the phone.

860
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,639
He has something else to deal with.

861
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,679
He's on his way back now.

862
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,959
The wedding is about to begin.

863
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,719
The bride is getting ready.

864
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,040
Alright. Understood.

865
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,719
Assistant Lin. The bride is ready.

866
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,959
What should we do now?

867
00:40:58,719 --> 00:40:59,639
Attention, all departments.

868
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:01,639
I'm Lin Miao, President Jiao's assistant.

869
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,320
From now on, please follow my instructions.

870
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:03,800
Understood.

871
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:04,600
Final check.

872
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,000
Are the musicians ready?

873
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,919
Yes.

874
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:09,120
What about the host?

875
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,600
Yes. The wedding will go on as planned.

876
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:12,320
Let's begin.

877
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,080
Honored guests,

878
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,360
ladies and gentlemen,

879
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,120
good evening.

880
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,520
Welcome to

881
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,760
Mr. Zhang and Miss Sun's sacred wedding.

882
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,600
Now let's welcome

883
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,919
the beautiful bride

884
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:28,919
with the groom.

885
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,639
One, two, three. Get the spotlight ready.

886
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,800
What's going on?

887
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,639
Why is the power out?

888
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,239
What's going on? What happens to the lighting?

889
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:49,760
Assistant Lin,

890
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,239
There's an issue with our circuit box.

891
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,919
It's overloaded. It has stopped working.

892
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,719
What about the hotel's emergency power generator?

893
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:55,320
Turn it on now.

894
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,719
Assistant Lin. There won't be enough time.

895
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,120
Even if we use a power generator,

896
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,439
it'll take at least half an hour.

897
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:01,000
Half an hour? Are you joking?

898
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,560
What's going on?

899
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,840
Why is the power out?

900
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
It's a grand hotel.

901
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,520
How could this happen?

902
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,439
What's going on? It's such an inauspicious sign.

903
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:12,560
Assistant Lin.

904
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,919
President Jiao is not around.

905
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:15,120
Please think of something.
