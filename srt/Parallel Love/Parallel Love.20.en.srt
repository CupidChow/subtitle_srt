President Jiao didn't stop her?

00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:29,320
Of course! No more nonsense!

169
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,119
Take it.

170
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:31,919
No regrets?

171
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,159
No regrets!

172
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,559
Alright, my princess,

173
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,000
today, I am your knight.

174
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,280
Wait!

175
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:48,039
Helping a bride-to-be escape
on her engagement night,

176
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,119
is such a big deal,

177
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,039
why aren't you scared,

178
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,320
and surprised?

179
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,719
Director Zhao, as I said,

180
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,359
as long as you are happy,

181
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:59,479
I will support all your decisions.

182
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,760
Let's go.

183
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,159
Jiao Yang, remember when we were little,

184
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,119
I really liked collecting candy wrappers?

185
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:24,159
Every time when you helped me
find my favorite candy wrappers,

186
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,440
I was so happy.

187
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:28,440
Actually, I was not happy
because of the candy wrappers,

188
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,400
but because of you.

189
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,400
Brother Yang Yang,

190
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,599
all along,

191
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,520
I thought that marrying you

192
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,880
would be my life's destination.

193
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,559
But it wasn't until yesterday that

194
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,599
I suddenly understood,

195
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,479
the little girl who used to
love collecting candy wrappers,

196
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,440
and the little boy,

197
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,359
have both grown up.

198
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,599
Unknowingly,

199
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,440
we have taken on two different paths.

200
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,919
Brother Yang Yang,

201
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,000
thank you for preparing

202
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,400
this perfect engagement ceremony for me.

203
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,640
But I'm sorry,

204
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,200
you are no longer my destination.

205
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,640
Jiao Yang,

206
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,320
this is the last thing I can do for you.

207
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:39,440
Promise me that

208
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,640
you will treat Assistant Lin well.

209
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:45,200
You two have to be happy.

210
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,679
Of course,

211
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,200
I will be happier than you two!

212
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:50,960
Goodbye!

213
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,400

00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,680
My promise is still valid.

338
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:27,520
Zhao, you doing these,

339
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,920
what else should I say?

340
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,000
With our relationship,
you don't need to say anything.

341
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,959
You're leaving the country tomorrow,

342
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,359
so get some rest.

343
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,239
I'm heading off now.

344
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,439
I still have to explain it

345
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:39,119
to my friends and relatives.

346
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,439
Dad,

347
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,319
I'm sorry.

348
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,680
Zhao's words today

349
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,760
are already the most merciful.

350
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,520
If in the future,

351
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,599
he wants to help you,

352
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,560
considering our long relationship,

353
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,239
you shouldn't expect too much.

354
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,560
Jiao Yang,

355
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,800
do you understand what I mean?

356
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,359
Understood.

357
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,959
Have a seat.

358
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,199
Lin Miao,

359
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,439
tell me if I am...

360
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:56,520
incompetent?

361
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,239
My father,

362
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,479
Uncle Zhao,

363
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,359
Yan,

364
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,800
and you,

365
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:14,880
everyone

366
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,920
is working hard for me,

367
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,319
struggling and compromising.

368
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,839
But

369
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,959
I'm the only one who is standing still,

370
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,160
neither going forward,

371
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,280
nor going backwards.

372
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,599
In the end,

373
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,560
I failed to live up to everyone's expectations.

374
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,119
It's not your fault.

375
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:57,119
You are also just a passive recipient.

376
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:58,800
From your standpoint,

377
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,680
you have no other way out

378
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:03,959
but to protect Hong Yu.

379
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,959
I understand you.

380
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:11,479
The fact is, I tried my best

381
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:13,280
to protect everything in my world,

382
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,560
but I want to protect you

383
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,239
the most.

384
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,160
That's enough!

385
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,839
You and Xin should go back now!

386
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,400
The roads are jammed at this hour.

387
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,719
Don't be late later.

388
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:44,599
I'll take the subway later,

389
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,599
I won't be late.

390
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,920
I want to keep you company for a while.

391
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,199
You usually don't even remember

392
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,199
to come back to see me once a month,

393
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,880
but now you're acting like a filial son.

394
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,959
Dad,

395
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:57,680
just enjoy my every act.

396
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,680
If you really don't like it,

397
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,760
and you find me annoying,

398
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,239
then I'll introduce you

399
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:03,119
to a wife myself.

400
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,160
You could give me some brothers and sisters

401
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,800
to play with.

402
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,560
You little rascal!

403
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,319
Don't be so rude to me!

404
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
Alright, dad.

405
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,520
Promise me

406
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,520
that you'd take care of your health.

407
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,719
When the situation of Hong Yu
gets slightly better,

408
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
I'll go and visit you.

409
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,119
It's a sensitive time for Hong Yu Group,

410
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:24,359
but I'm running away from it.

411
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,560
Son, please don't blame me.

412
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,400
Dad, what are you talking about?

413
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,439
I can't blame you.

414
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,640
Maybe you and Hong Yu

415
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,839
will have a very hard time.

416
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,199
But I believe that you

417
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,719
will do very well.

418
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:41,319
Sooner or later,
Hong Yu will have to revamp itself.

419
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,079
Rather than passively waiting for problems,

420
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:46,199
it's better to actively
confront those challenges.

421
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,040
The future of Hong Yu all depends on you.

422
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,119
Rascal!

423
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You'll have to move on by yourself from now on.

424
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:59,359
Don't cry out in pain even if you fall.

425
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:00,800
Okay!

426
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,880
Let's go.

427
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,640
Coming and going as you please,
aren't you?

428
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,040
The chairman called me before boarding.

429
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:32,599
I'd like to...

430
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,439
I don't agree.

431
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,560
Jiao Yang, you already have

432
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,239
Director Zhao's shares in your hands,

433
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,640
but if the other shareholders of the company

434
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,560
gather together,

435
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,000
you'll still be threatened.

436
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,880
It's now a critical time,

437
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:46,479
so I want to come back.

438
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,400
We'll face Hong Yu's challenges together,

439
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,800
and then I'll leave, okay?

440
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:52,959
I can handle this matter all by myself.

441
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:54,040
I don't need your help.

442
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,520
Why don't you get it?

443
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,839
I chose to leave without saying goodbye before,

444
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,560
but this time,

445
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,280
I want to be by your side.

446
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,359
President Jiao, Assistant Lin,

447
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,760
so your relationship is real?

448
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:15,160
Now you are in the middle of a reunion, right?

449
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,119
I like this scenario.

450
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,319
-We're not getting back...
-We're not getting back...

451
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,560
I really got it right!

452
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,079
I knew there was something wrong
with you the other night!

453
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,359
What kind of a boss
would tell a resigning employee

454
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,640
that I wouldn't forget you!

455
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,880
Also, Assistant Lin,

456
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,359
the look in your eyes
when looking at President Jiao,

457
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:34,160
you obviously love him so much

458
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,319
but you still have to
soberly restrain yourself...

459
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,359
Stop it!

460
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,359
Ding Ding,

461
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,040
the engagement of
President Jiao and Director Zhao

462
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,239
has just gone wrong.

463
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,239
If the news that

464
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:45,239
I'm with President Jiao gets out at this time,

465
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:46,959
I'm afraid the people of the company
might over-think it.

466
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:49,160
So, please keep it a secret, okay?

467
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,959
Don't worry! Absolute confidentiality!

468
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:00,920
Lin Miao,

469
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,199
you told me that

470
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,079
once I become the president, you can go back,

471
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,119
is that true?

472
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,760
Whether I'm leaving or not,

473
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,280
you need to be president.

474
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,680
So will you go back or not?

475
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,319
Depends on your performance.

476
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:22,319
What?

477
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,479
Depends on my performance?

478
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:27,719
Why the sudden meeting?

479
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,719
Is there such a rush to announce me
as the president's assistant?

480
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,359
Hello, everyone.

481
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,800
Lin Miao, have a seat.

482
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,319
Here. Assistant Lin.

483
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,400
This is the new proposal.

484
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,160
Assistant Lin is reinstated?

485
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,800
Yes.

486
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,439
Everyone, first have a look at the proposal.

487
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,239
Before ten o'clock tomorrow morning,

488
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,920
propose your ideas and opinions respectively.

489
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,839
If there are any related resources or groups,

490
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,079
please contact them as soon as possible.

491
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:53,560
Infinite Home concept upgrade,

492
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:56,719
solar integrated eco-technology?

493
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,119
Yes.

494
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,520
This is the idea that
Assistant Lin mentioned to me before,

495
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,640
and it's also our current focus.

496
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:05,880
During the planning period,

497
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,800
Ying Jun will still be
in charge of market research.

498
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,400
Jiang Rou will be
in charge of copywriting.

499
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,640
Ding Ding will be
in charge of landscaping.

500
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,400
What a nuisance!

501
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,119
So much sweetness in one go!

502
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:16,920
Ding Ding,

503
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
what's wrong with you?

504
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,319
Don't you think this scene is so sweet?

505
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:21,520
Sweet?

506
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:24,640
I mean,

507
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,479
it's great to have Assistant Lin back.

508
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:28,959
Let's welcome Assistant Lin's return.

509
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:40,199
Alright, that's it for the assignment.

510
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,800
Dismiss.

511
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:44,959
Assistant Lin,

512
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,319
I need to speak to you
privately about something.

513
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,280
Sure.

514
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:57,880
You both talk.

515
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,839
Don't worry! I won't tell anyone!

516
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,239
Okay. No problem.

517
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:14,439
There are a few things
that are really not quite right,

518
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,920
I'll go back and correct them.

519
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,239
Any other problems?

520
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,479
If there's nothing else, I'm off.

521
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:24,640
Where are you going?

522
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,239
Go home.

523
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,719
Don't tell me it's Johnny's place.

524
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,920
Anything wrong with that?

525
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:38,959
Is there nothing wrong with that?

526
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,239
You knew that this period

527
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:43,119
is the probationary period
of my performance.

528
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,319
During this period,

529
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,000
do you feel it is appropriate

530
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,560
for you to live

531
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,439
with another man intimately?

532
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,920
So you knew that this is a probationary
period for your performance?

533
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,280
Then I naturally have the right

534
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,520
to go back wherever I want.

535
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Lin Miao,

536
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,839
stop pushing it, okay?

537
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:10,079
By the way,

538
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:13,439
did I say I was going to Johnny's?

539
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,199
Let's go! Time to go home!

540
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:18,599
I'm hungry.

541
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,439
All work and no eat?

542
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,599
So what you want to eat?

543
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,160
The most expensive one!

544
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,479
Alright. Bird's nest, abalone, and shark's fin.

Jiao Yang! Jiao...

582
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:15,080
Why can't I see clearly?

583
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,320
My eyes!

584
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,000
Let's eat.

585
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,840
But I have to tell you

586
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,000
it's the first time I have cooked,

587
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
so give me some face.

588
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:34,760
Eat.

589
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,320
How is it?

590
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,080
What look is that?

591
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:54,439
Commendable sincerity!

592
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,399
What do you mean by that?

593
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,919
That means it's not good, right?

594
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,520
No.

595
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,040
Where's your taste?

596
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,439
Why would you say so?

597
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,719
But I do think that

598
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,439
your cooking

599
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,919
is very special.

600
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,439
As soon as I tasted it,

601
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:19,239
I could tell that it is
the taste of Jiao's private kitchen.

602
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,040
By the way,

603
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,040
did you know that

604
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,239
a person's taste memory

605
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:30,600
is 500 times greater
than their brain memory?

606
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,919
I used to think that,

607
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:34,840
it's just some food blogger talking nonsense.

608
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,320
But I didn't expect that today's meal

609
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,600
would actually let me taste home.

610
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:44,800
So are you confessing to me in another way?

611
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,959
I'm not confessing to you!

612
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,520
I'm just complimenting your cooking!

613
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:50,879
Seriously,

614
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,520
Jiao Yang, if you couldn't make it as the president,

615
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,320
you could consider becoming a chef.

616
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,719
I think it would also be quite promising.

617
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,840
What are you talking about?

618
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:59,439
Why won't I make it as the president?

619
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,239
I will become the president

620
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:03,159
and impress all of you!

621
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:06,600
But if you disappear again

622
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,159
after I become the president,

623
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:09,719
we will never...

624
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,719
Someone's still under probation.

625
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,360
Watch your mouth!

626
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,800
Yes, Assistant Lin, whatever you say.

627
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,560
Assistant Lin, have you had enough to eat?

628
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,120
Right, you just had a couple of bites.

629
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,439
How about this, Assistant Lin,

630
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:25,520
try this soup.

631
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,479
It's the soup that I've made especially for you.

632
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:29,399
Don't!

633
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,520
I'm sorry.

634
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,560
I...I'll get another bowl.

635
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,040
Let me. Let me.

636
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,639
I'll get you another bowl.

637
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,679
I'll clean up later. Eat up.

638
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,159
I can't see clearly?

639
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,879
Why?

640
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:55,320
Today, we have gathered everyone,

641
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,919
mainly on behalf of the chairman,

642
00:36:56,919 --> 00:36:58,040
to announce a decision.

643
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,639
During the period
of his overseas surgery and recovery,

644
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,120
Jiao Yang will be appointed as an acting president,

645
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,320
in place of the chairman,

646
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,159
to handle all the affairs of the company.

647
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,639
Voting will now begin.

648
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,639
President Jiao's performances recently

649
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,959
are really worrisome!

650
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:22,719
Is he capable enough

651
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:24,239
to take care of Hong Yu?

652
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:25,439
Right! Right!

653
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:31,360
Jiao Yang,

654
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,479
do you have anything to say?

655
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,320
I invite all of you to take a look
at the proposal first.

656
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,479
Isn't this the Infinite Home?

657
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,959
We have made a concept upgrade.

658
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,719
In addition to the concept of Home,

659
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:53,639
the word Infinite

660
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,760
will also be the main theme of our concept.

661
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,520
To this end, we have adopted

662
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,399
solar integrated eco-technology

663
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,159
to create a green home concept,

664
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,959
which is energy-efficient
and environmentally friendly.

665
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:07,080
Chairman Cao, you have
the experience in this area.

666
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,439
Do you think this proposal is reliable?

667
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,600
With President Jiao's endorsement,
it's naturally reliable.

668
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:18,760
Even if it's not,

669
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,679
there's still the chairman
to hold the fort if the sky falls.

670
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:21,760
Chairman Cao,

671
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,159
I'll take responsibility
for anything I do myself.

672
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,159
If President Jiao has made up his mind,

673
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:29,679
I agree.

674
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:35,239
Since the board members
have no objections,

675
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,719
later on,

676
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:40,800
Hong Yu will proactively prepare the
inauguration ceremony for the president.

677
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:45,320
Chairman Cao, why would you vote for it?

678
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:48,800
The fun of the gambling
lies in the comings and goings.

679
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,520
The tougher the enemy is,

680
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:53,040
the more rewarding it will be to defeat him.

681
00:38:53,212 --> 00:38:56,024
[Zhong Lun Law Firm]

682
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,679
From now on, the legal affairs of Zhong Qing

683
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:02,840
will be entrusted to your firm.

684
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,320
Wish happy cooperation!

685
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:05,479
Wish happy cooperation!

686
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,840
Send Director Su away.

687
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,479
This way.

688
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,120
Chairman Zhao.

689
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,320
Su?

690
00:39:19,439 --> 00:39:20,600
What are you doing here?

691
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:24,439
I'm here on behalf of Zhong Qing
to sign the legal counsel contract.

692
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:26,360
I see.

693
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,159
I almost had the wrong idea.

694
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:31,719
What else would Chairman Zhao think I'm here for?

695
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,959
Nothing,

696
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:34,520
It's just me overthinking.

697
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,280
Su, you're so young and promising,

698
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,840
if the chairman's wife saw you...

699
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,080
I'm being rude.

700
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,120
Since it's business,

701
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,760
I will leave you to it.

702
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,159
Chairman Zhao.

703
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:52,719
Hello.

704
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:53,360
- This way.
- Alright.

705
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,159
Have a seat.

706
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,399
Is everyone ready?

707
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:01,919
Three... Two... One...

708
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,679
Congratulations President Jiao
on being promoted to President!

709
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,000
Lay low! Lay low!

710
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,479
It's no big deal.

711
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:11,560
Why all the fuss, right?

712
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,159
President Jiao,

713
00:40:13,439 --> 00:40:15,159
with your current distinguished status,

714
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,639
how can one assistant be enough?

715
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:17,919
Won't you consider finding another one?

716
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:20,479
Jiang Rou, stop being delusional.

717
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,639
It's enough for President Jiao
to have Assistant Lin.

718
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:24,280
What do you mean by
having Assistant Lin is enough?

719
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,679
There has to be someone to help her.

720
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,439
Besides, I just want a raise,

721
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:30,120
so I can buy a couple of lipsticks,
what's wrong with that?

722
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,000
By the way, President Jiao,

723
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,080
when is your inauguration ceremony?

724
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,280
This is a major priority
for the president's office!

725
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,120
We need more time to prepare!

726
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,760
For the inauguration ceremony,

727
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,719
I'll leave it to Assistant Lin.

728
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,919
Assistant Lin will assign tasks to you later.

729
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,479
Assistant Lin, come with me.

730
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,280
As expected of a couple I'm a fan of,

731
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,040
they even walk so in sync with each other.

732
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,479
Jiao Yang,

733
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,520
where are we now?

734
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,639
Jiao Yang!

735
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:10,479
What's going on?

736
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,520
I couldn't see clearly just now.

737
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,560
Are you alright?

738
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,639
I'm fine.

739
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,679
Maybe I was just blindfolded for too long.

740
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,840
Is this a gallery?

741
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,479
What did you bring me to the gallery for?
