00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,119
Bad news, Director Zhao, something happened.

171
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,880
Stop talking nonsense.

172
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,520
What makes you break in the board meeting?

173
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,119
Director Li, don't be angry.

174
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,039
Something bad happened.

175
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,960
What is it?

176
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,359
These days, the marketing department
has been assisting

177
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,919
Director Zhao to manage
the company's official website.

178
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,640
As soon as I opened the website,

179
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,039
I found a lot of comments like this

180
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,159
in the forum.

181
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:00,119
All kinds of blogs and forums have found out

182
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,400
the cat allergy incident

183
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,599
from nowhere,

184
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,159
and pointed out that Leisure Hotel

185
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,280
are using uncleaned utensils,

186
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:09,119
so they're posting stuff to express
dissatisfaction towards President Jiao.

187
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,039
I think it's urgent so...

188
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,479
How could it be possible?

189
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,799
Yan, tell me what's going on.

190
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,080
After the reform of the official website,

191
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,119
we added a customer comment area,

192
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:20,559
which was originally conducive
to the promotion of the image of Leisure.

193
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,080
But how would it...

194
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,559
Now many clients have protested

195
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,440
on the Internet platform,

196
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:29,200
they think Leisure can't meet the standards

197
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
in the aspect of basic hygiene problems.

198
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:32,679
And they said that if the hotel continues

199
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,080
to be managed by such a president

200
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:36,880
who is not concerned about his work

201
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,479
and personal relations,

202
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:40,520
they're going to move out.

203
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,760
Many key customers
who've cooperated with us

204
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,840
have also called to

205
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,320
express their concerns
about our corporate image

206
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,679
We need to consider.

207
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,119
This incident has quite a serious impact

208
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,280
in our company.

209
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,440
Exactly.

210
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,479
Everyone, it's obvious that

211
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,000
some people have maligned President Jiao,

212
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,280
we can't just let it be,

213
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,919
we should hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit.

214
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,200
Director Li,

215
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,119
Tens of thousands of posts have
been published in various forums,

216
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,039
I'm afraid that we can't do anything.

217
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,840
Then just let it be.

218
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,119
We shall just close our ears.

219
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:18,080
Jiao Yang did nothing wrong,
he has nothing to fear with.

220
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,200
What do you think, Chairman?

221
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:26,200
Yan, you are in charge
of brand public relations,

222
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,520
in this case,

223
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,719
what can we do to
protect the company's reputation

224
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:30,960
as soon as possible?

225
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:31,960
I...

226
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,479
We...

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,400
If you don't want to say, then let me do it.

228
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,119
If this happens,

229
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,280
the shareholders of the company should vote.

230
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:44,880
If the votes are more than half,

231
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,640
Jiao Yang will be removed
from the post of vice president.

232
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,559
Chairman,

233
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,280
it's not that serious.

234
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,359
We can think of a better way.

235
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,479
Directors,

236
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,440
who thinks Jiao Yang is no longer suitable

237
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,400
to be the vice president of the
company, please raise your hand.

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,719
Uncle Jiao.

239
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,799
Dad.

240
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,039
Okay.

241
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,559
Unanimous consent.

242
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,280
Now I declare that from now on,

243
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:20,080
Jiao Yang will be removed from his post

244
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,640
and he has to hand over the
management right of Leisure Hotel

245
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,359
until the matter is completely settled.

246
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:26,280
We will decide again afterwards.

247
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:27,840
The meeting is over.

248
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,760
You must be happy with a new boss soon.

249
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,679
The chairman just suspended you,

250
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,159
but you gave yourself up.

251
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:33,400
I'm not interested in running a hotel,

252
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,159
that's exactly what I want.

253
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,799
Are you really uninterested in hotel management

254
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,479
or unhappy that

255
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:40,440
people are maligning you online?

256
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:41,559
You've got to be kidding me.

257
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,880
I don't even care, alright?

258
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Then what are you doing here?

259
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,599
I'm just going to take a walk
and feel the wind and sun.

260
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:54,400
So as to avoid making my dad unhappy.

261
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,000
I remembered the chairman had once said that

262
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:03,119
your mother dreamed of
the sun when she was pregnant,

263
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,919
that's why they named you Jiao Yang.

264
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,159
No wonder you like the sun so much.

265
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,440
What are you trying to say?

266
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,359
I'm saying you're stupid.

267
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,280
You're stupid.

268
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,280
You're sad for being suspended,

269
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,080
and mad that people are maligning you.

270
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,559
But why don't you think about it?

271
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,760
Obviously,

272
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,799
it's man-made cyber violence,

273
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:29,039
someone is hiring people to ruin your name,

274
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:31,359
in order to destroy your reputation.

275
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,840
It was strange from the beginning.

276
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,799
It is clear that there's something wrong

277
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,640
with the utensils of Leisure Hotel.

278
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,479
But why does the public

279
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,599
blame it on you,

280
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:41,919
but not Leisure?

281
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,960
You mean

282
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
someone had deliberately
guided the public opinion?

283
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,080
Tens of thousands of comments overnight,

284
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:51,719
you're not a public figure,

285
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,000
how could it be possible that so many people

286
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,080
stay up all night

287
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,840
and send posts to malign you?

288
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,080
You are right.

289
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:59,479
Even if they want to post about me,

290
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,359
it shouldn't be maligning me,

291
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,640
but should be complimenting me.

292
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,919
Then,

293
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,440
how do we get the manipulator?

294
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,799
You alone is never enough.

295
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:10,440
You can use your strength.

296
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:11,880
What kind of strength?

297
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,599
Like what Mr. Sui had said

298
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,440
the loyal employees.

299
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,960
No.

300
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,840
I can't pull you all into this.

301
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,400
I knew you would have said that.

302
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,840
So everyone has got
their resignation letters ready.

303
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,039
If you can't prove yourself,

304
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,239
you'll really get us involved.

305
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,719
Especially me,

306
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,479
I have to endure being said

307
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,960
to have an improper relationship with you.

308
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,239
You've got to be kidding me

309
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:42,880
I'm the one

310
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,520
who got involved because of you, alright?

311
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:50,080
we alone can't solve it,

312
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:51,679
so we need some experts.

313
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,679
We'll look for my friend, K.

314
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,880
Everybody, according to my tracking,

315
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,159
I found that the thousands
of comments on the Internet

316
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,000
are actually distributed
on only five IP addresses.

317
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,239
And these five IP addresses

318
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,119
are very close.

319
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:03,239
They should be in the same cyber cafe.

320
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:04,440
So I inferred that

321
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,400
there should be a group of people

322
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,239
in this cyber cafe,

323
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,919
and then constantly changed their user names

324
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,520
to make comments on the Internet.

325
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:10,919
Then we should assign the tasks now.

326
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,080
Ding Ding and Jiang Rou,

327
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,159
You are responsible for
spying on and enticing the enemy.

328
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,479
Okay, President Jiao.

329
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:18,039
Ying Jun and Xin, you are in charge of assisting

330
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:19,400
and cover their retreat in time.

331
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,239
Okay, President Jiao.

332
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:22,280
If K and Pang start to fight,

333
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
all of you will have to control the situation.

334
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:25,239
Okay, we got this.

335
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,200
Let's move

336
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,119
now.

337
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,280
Brother, I just need a minute to edit my thesis.

338
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:32,159
Why don't you go to another cyber cafe?

339
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,239
Go away.

340
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,039
Excuse me,

341
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,479
I need to do some searching,

342
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:41,320
can I use this computer?

343
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,400
Sure.

344
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,719
I've booked this area.

345
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,239
Please.

346
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,239
Cute man,

347
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,080
you have a tall nose.

348
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,679
let's take a picture together.

349
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,239
One, two, three.

350
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,500
[Writing a post to malign President Jiao]

351
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:00,719
President Jiao, we have confirmed.

352
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,559
It was them.

353
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,200
Get them.

354
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,919
Done.

355
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,719
What are you doing?

356
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:12,880
Give me your phone.

357
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,119
Get him.

358
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:21,599
Stop right there!

359
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,599
I'm telling you, you're not going anywhere.

360
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,479
Just stay here.

361
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,039
Thank you.

362
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,960
I've told you, these lilies are beautiful.

363
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,479
Cheng Jun, aunty's going to like it.

364
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,599
Stop right there!

365
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,799
They're catching a thief.

366
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,760
Don't be a busybody.

367
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,799
Stop right there!

368
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,440
Jun, wait for a while, I'll be right back.

369
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,440
Aren't you...

370
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,599
Cheng Jun.

371
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,200
Stop running!

372
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,320
Stand right there.

373
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,400
Stand right there, don't move.

374
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,880
Why are you here?

375
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,160
Stop talking, chase him.

376
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,920
I'll help.

377
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:18,280
Don't move!

378
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,920
Thank you.

379
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,199
It's okay.

380
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,400
Assistant Lin, how are you?

381
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,640
Are you okay?

382
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,719
I'm fine.

383
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:44,880
It was him, who maligned
President Jiao on the Internet.

384
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,160
Do you mean that

385
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,439
he's the one who maligned President Jiao

386
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:50,520
on the official website?

387
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,760
These people are awful.

388
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,760
I'll help you send him to...

389
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,880
No, no.

390
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,719
We can handle it.

391
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,199
Excuse me.

392
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,160
Are you okay?

393
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,479
I'm fine.

394
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,239
Hello?

395
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,239
Young man, where did you go?

396
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:09,319
You have to come back now.

397
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,280
Something happened to your girlfriend.

398
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,599
What happened? Is she okay?

399
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,479
Come back now.

400
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:15,439
Nothing's important than your girlfriend.

401
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,359
You can go if there's something urgent.

402
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,280
We can handle it.

403
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,760
Okay, I'll be right back.

404
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,560
I'm leaving now.

405
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:44,719
Are you...

406
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:45,880
How do you know each other?

407
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:48,920
No, we don't know each other.

408
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,920
You ran so fast.

409
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,319
I didn't expect you to so nimble.

410
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,000
I was a champion for
a long-distance running at school.

411
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,560
Where did you get the rope?

412
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,000
Brother Tang gave it to me.

413
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,439
When people are getting older,

414
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,000
they love this kind of things after a break-up.

415
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,839
Jun, are you alright?

416
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,839
Yu, what took you so long?

417
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,079
My hand hurts and it's in pain.

418
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:22,640
Thanks to the lady boss

419
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,599
who gave me the band-aids,

420
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,520
otherwise, I would've lost too much blood.

421
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,760
It's not a big deal.

422
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,160
It's a big deal, it hurts.

423
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,920
I don't care. You have to buy me daises.

424
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,199
As a comfort to me.

425
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,719
Why do you want daises?

426
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:41,760
You forgot it again?

427
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,359
You gave me daises during our first date.

428
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,000
During our first anniversary,

429
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
you gave me

430
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,920
daisy bracelet as a present.

431
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:52,319
Pretty, you do have good taste.

432
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,760
Daises symbolize deep love,

433
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,719
your boyfriend must love you very much.

434
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,359
Really?

435
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:00,959
Of course.

436
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:02,359
My boyfriend loves me the most.

437
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,160
Who booked this place?

438
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:09,319
I did.

439
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,760
Let's cheer for it.

440
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,119
Here, cheers.

441
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:14,920
Cheers.

442
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,199
Oh, right, none of you knows

443
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,599
when I returned to the company this afternoon

444
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,599
to send the confession statement

445
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,520
and the allegation letter,

446
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,760
Director Li was so angry.

447
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,160
He must be feeling guilty.

448
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,959
President Jiao, why don't you check it out?

449
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,599
If we continue to check on it,

450
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,319
we will definitely find the manipulator.

451
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:35,920
We shouldn't be too harsh.

452
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,800
Think about it.

453
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,000
Isn't it better to keep him awake all day long

454
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,239
than to expose him to in public?

455
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,520
No matter what,

456
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,800
The misunderstandings of
President Jiao has been cleared up.

457
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,160
Not only that,

458
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,040
President Jiao is an example
of success in this field.

459
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,439
We have to thank Assistant Lin
for teaching us about

460
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,959
how to treat people as they did to us.

461
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,839
It's been a long day for Jiang Rou and Ding Ding,

462
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,640
who kept transforming into various identities

463
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,040
to publicize Mr. Jiao's glorious deeds

464
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,599
and express his reverence in blogs and websites

465
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,719
to get the hype effect.

466
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:09,119
It's not that difficult.

467
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,400
It was just our true feeling.

468
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,359
Right, with the technical support from K.

469
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,199
otherwise, I couldn't do anything
with only one account.

470
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,479
Okay, I'm going to

471
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,079
express my appreciation for all.

472
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:23,359
First of all, I would like to thank K

473
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,880
for the amazing technical command.

474
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:28,199
Next, Pang

475
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,439
who keeps working out for a long time.

476
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,160
Also, our best actors

477
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,119
who have Oscar-level acting.

478
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,239
And our Ying Jun and Xin

479
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,319
for the amazing assistant skills.

480
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,199
Lastly,

481
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:49,199
we have to thank our brother Tang

482
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,040
for giving out

483
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,800
his space.

484
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,520
It's nothing.

485
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,760
Jiao, you haven't thanked Assistant Lin.

486
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,599
No, I did nothing

487
00:21:58,599 --> 00:21:59,920
in this operation.

488
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:02,079
I nearly spoiled the operation.

489
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,920
My appreciation for Assistant Lin

490
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,199
is to raise her payment

491
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,319
after her reinstatement next Monday.

492
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,640
Okay.

493
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,079
I hereby announce that

494
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,239
our appreciation ceremony has come to an end.

495
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,920
Let's enjoy ourselves.

496
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:23,000
Enjoy ourselves!

497
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,359
Good, cheers.

498
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:31,439
They're all drunk.

499
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,560
I didn't think you can drink that much.

500
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:39,319
And you're still awake.

501
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,040
I...

502
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:44,280
Because I haven't said thank you.

503
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,359
And I need to say"thank you" too.

504
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,760
Thank you

505
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
for what you said to me at the beach.

506
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,839
Thank you for giving the bedroom to me.

507
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,000
Thank you for going to Mr. Sui

508
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,160
for me.

509
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,520
Thank you for cleaning the bathroom for me.

510
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
And making dinner for me.

511
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,560
Thank you for disregarding your own safety

512
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,319
to save the customer experience officer.

513
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,239
Thank you for disregarding your image

514
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,719
to stay with me all night when I was sick.

515
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:43,719
Thank you for helping me with the outdoor wedding.

516
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,280
Thank you for the white shoes and chocolate.

517
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,760
Thank you for being my assistant.

President Jiao.

528
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,920
I forgot to report

529
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,280
a very important thing to you.

530
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:35,719

I met Manager Su

532
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:39,119
when I went to the company this morning

533
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,239
to deliver the confession statement,

534
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:41,880
he gave me a document.

535
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,959
It's a document that has recorded all cases

536
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,880
that have happened to you in the past two years

537
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,119
that are similar to this one.

538
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:47,719
Su Cheng Jun?

539
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:48,560
Yes.

540
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,359
It was a very persuasive document.

541
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,319
Which makes the company have faith in you.

542
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,199
It was a real maligned case.

543
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,319
I got it.

544
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
You can sleep now.

545
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,319
Okay, President Jiao, goodnight.

546
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,040
Lin Miao,

547
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,359

Have I become a lightweight drinker like 10 years ago?

558
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:02,680
How could he run away?

559
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,479
He could ever feel embarrassed?

560
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,719
No.

561
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,880
He wasn't the one who was taken advantage of.

562
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:22,439
How could he...

563
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:24,760
ran away?

564
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,599
And he's not going to work.

565
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:30,560
What does that mean?

566
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,920
I should stop thinking about it.

567
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,439
I can't be temporarily blinded by hormones.

568
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:40,439
Alright, Lin Miao?

569
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,359
Okay.

570
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,119
I should go to work now.

571
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:50,760
Okay, don't worry.

572
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,800
Alright, Dad.

573
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,079
I'll go and meet you now.

574
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:54,400
Okay.

575
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:13,199
She isn't embarrassed at all,

576
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,560
I shouldn't feel embarrassed either.

577
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,959
What a coincidence. Good morning, Assistant Lin.

578
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,239
Good morning, President Jiao.

579
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,280
Is she faking the amnesia?

580
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,160
And acting serious in front of me?

581
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,800
Good morning, President Jiao, Assistant Lin.

582
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,479
Morning.

583
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,160
President Jiao, now the whole world has known

584
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,680
about your achievement.

585
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:53,959
Are you heading to
the chairman's office to get your reward?

586
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,160
It's nothing, keep that a low-key.

587
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,439
It's not a big deal.

588
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,439
This honor

589
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:03,160
belongs to the entire president office

590
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:04,640
you all have a lot of credit.

591
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:10,400
I heard that our company is holding

592
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,680
trans-department employment.

593
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,800
I wonder

594
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,599
if we have the chance.

595
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,400
After all, President Jiao needs

596
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,280
more than one excellent
assistant for the business.

597
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,319
Hangover makes me look haggard.

598
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,839
Oh, right, Assistant Lin.

599
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:32,839
I've forgotten to ask

600
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:34,319
you and President Jiao,

601
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,880
who was drunk first?

602
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:37,839
-It was me before him.
-It was me before her.

603
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,479
Okay, it was you.

604
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,439
It was me.

605
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,400
Jiao Yang.

606
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,760
You've been doing well recently.

607
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,400
Here's your reward.

608
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:10,079
Dad, you should have just
rewarded me a sports car.

609
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,160
What's it about?

610
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,380
[Rebuild contract of Yue Rong Villa]

611
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,400
Wait.

612
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,880
Dad, did you take it wrong?

613
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:23,520
This is Yue Rong Villa

614
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,239
which wanted to reopen several times
in the past two years,

615
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:31,000
but the development plan
can't be pushed forward

616
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,959
because the staff of the
original hotel did not cooperate.

617
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,239
I've heard about it, so?

618
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:39,000
You are responsible for this project.

619
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:40,760
I can't handle it.

620
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,319
What did you just say?

621
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:45,479
If you really want to push the project,

622
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:46,560
you should find someone else to do it.

623
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,959
Who do you think has a bigger role in this company?

624
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,959
You or me?

625
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,280
It should not be you to have the final say

626
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,160
on the development of Yue Rong Villa.

627
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,560
Even if my mother is gone,

628
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,880
you shouldn't make your own decision.

629
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,640
We're talking about business.

630
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,920
Okay, Chairman.

631
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,400
A lot of managers who tried to
develop the villa before,

632
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:10,319
and none of them has succeeded.

633
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,280
Besides, this investment is not a small amount,

634
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,560
if we don't have full certainty,

635
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,800
it's going to be a heavy hit.

636
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,280
Jiao Yang,

637
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,760
I know what you're thinking about.

638
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,040
As the future leader of Hong Yu Group,

639
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,160
you have to face the company's problems directly.

640
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,479
Yue Rong Villa is

641
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,199
such a desirable project for many people,

642
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:33,199
it's not easy for me to have finally

643
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,239
grabbed this opportunity for you.

644
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,119
It's decided then.

645
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,280
I'm not going to do this anyway.

646
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,640
If you don't like me.

647
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,079
wandering around,

648
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,439
I'll come back two days later.

649
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,439
You don't have to

650
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,599
be a vice president any more.

651
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,359
Okay, Chairman.

652
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,000
Is there anything else, Chairman?

653
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:51,119
I'm leaving if not.

654
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:51,599
You...

655
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:58,959
Hu.

656
00:30:59,119 --> 00:30:59,839
Yes, Chairman Jiao.

657
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,599
Ask Assistant Lin to come to my office.

658
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:02,199
Okay.

659
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:12,760
Come here, I have something to tell you.

660
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,239
Listen,

661
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,359
after you meet my dad,

662
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:19,640
no matter what he says, don't agree with it.

663
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,119
So what's he going to say?

664
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,839
Whatever he says,

665
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,479
just don't say yes to it.

666
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,439
It seems that the rumors are real.

667
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:37,760
Yeah, look, they are so close.

668
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,839
What is it?

669
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,680
President Jiao, we're not that close,

670
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:49,520
please call me Assistant Lin.

671
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,160
Remember, don't say anything.

672
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:13,520
President Jiao, here's
the contract, please have a look.

673
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,959
Assistant Lin,

674
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,199
I understand you're afraid of unemployment,

675
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:30,079
but does your conscience hurt you?

676
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,560
President Jiao, perhaps it could
be difficult for you to understand,

677
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,319
But I think the chairman

678
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:37,040
gives you a bigger chance.

679
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,760
Assistant Lin, you know nothing about it.

680
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,280
Don't follow what he said.

681
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,079
Then you should tell me about it.

682
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,719
So that

683
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,880
I can better understand the situation.

684
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,560
Have you ever seen a president

685
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,239
report to his assistant?

686
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:01,359
President Jiao, you've said you're not going.

687
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,119
That's because I think it's necessary

688
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,520
for the top management of a company

689
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,719
to know every single project

690
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:14,920
of the company.

691
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,520
It's like a must-do

692
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,760
for me.

693
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,079
Don't think too much.

694
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:25,959
Since you insist on it,

695
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:27,319
I won't force any longer.

696
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:30,800
But I think...

697
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:34,560
But I think...

698
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,439
If you reject the development
project of Yue Rong Villa,

699
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:38,520
the chairman

700
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,160
will definitely arrange
a more difficult job for you.

701
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,839
As for the development of the resort,

702
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,040
there's going to be a group of
people willing to take your place.

703
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,959
whatever it becomes,

704
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,400
it's none of your business.

705
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,319
President Jiao, although I don't know

706
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,479
why you refused to develop the Yue Rong Villa,

707
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:59,599
it is imperative for the company

708
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,680
to go on with the project.

709
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,280
I think it's better for us
to do it ourselves than to

710
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,280
hand over to irrelevant people, right?

711
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:07,000
It's more reliable.

712
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,159
Assistant Lin,

713
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,679
there's one thing in my mind.

714
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,320
Imagine there's a man and a woman

715
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,360
at night together in the resort,

716
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,959
and you're particularly interested in this matter.

717
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,439
are you doing it purposely?

718
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,000
President Jiao,

719
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,679
I think

720
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,199
we are running out of time,

721
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,760
you should read the information

722
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,959
and the contract as well.

723
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,560
so that I could report it to the chairman.

724
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:40,520
Okay.

725
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,740
[Report on Yue Rong Villa ]

726
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,919
Yue Rong Villa.

727
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,719
Jiao Yang is heading to Yue Rong Villa?

728
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,959
Xin, hurry up and pack the things.

729
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,520
We are going with Jiao Yang.

730
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,560
Director Zhao, I can understand that you

731
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,479
wanted to work with President Jiao,

732
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,840
but I have to remind you that

733
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,040
Chairman Jiao and Director Zhao

734
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,239
will not agree.

735
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,679
And you need to deal with

736
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,959
the follow-up disturbance
of the network public opinion.

737
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,679
So President Jiao has arranged for me to stay

738
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,679
to cooperate with your public relations work.

739
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,280
So you are going to stay?

740
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:15,320
Then who's going to take care of my Jiao Yang?

741
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,560
It's Lin, Assistant Lin.

742
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,040
Assistant Lin?

743
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,000
Why?

744
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,399
It can't be.

745
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,919
Lin Miao got the point there.

746
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
We wouldn't know what would it be

747
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,719
if it falls on others hand.

748
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,879
But didn't she put too much concern on it?

749
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:43,320
Could it be...

750
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,439
You can't even do it properly,

751
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,840
You're ruining your performance in this quarter.

752
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,679
Deduct it all.

753
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,280
Director Wu, Manager Su has been doing well

754
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,000
in recent months.

755
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,360
He helped a lot calm down the effects

756
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,879
of network public opinion.

757
00:35:53,879 --> 00:35:55,320
You don't have the right to voice out.

758
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,639
Manager Su,

759
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,159
Since you are so thoughtful and energetic,

760
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:01,000
I'll assign you to do all the planning cases

761
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,399
mentioned in today's meeting.

762
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:04,800
Director Wu, I can't do them alone

763
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,000
in such a short time.

764
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:14,159
Director Wu, I can't finish

765
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,239
such a heavy workload all by myself.

766
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,439
Can I ask Li to help?

767
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:20,919
You could help President Jiao

768
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:22,439
collect the Internet defamation cases,

769
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,360
you must be able

770
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,600
to finish the project on your own.

771
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:26,199
Don't lie to me.

772
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:27,199
I'm telling you that

773
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,399
you will have to finish the new project today.

774
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:31,479
Otherwise, leave the marketing department.

775
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:52,280
President Jiao.

776
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,479
Did he embarrass you?

777
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,000
No,

778
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,439
it's my fault, I didn't complete my mission.

779
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,560
President Jiao,

780
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:01,399
I still have a project to do,

781
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:02,600
I have to go now.

782
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,800
Lin Miao said that

783
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,840
if you protect me as you wish,

784
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,840
I couldn't do anything

785
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,760
other than staying in the office.

786
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:21,919
But if you fire me,

787
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,040
it can keep Li Dong Qiang's mouth shut,

788
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,120
and also I can solve the problem in my own way.

789
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:29,679
Stop showing off.

790
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,199
Do you think I did well?

791
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,439
Pretty good.

792
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,900
[Wife, Liang Yu Jun]

793
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:44,080
Let's go.

794
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,280
Chairman, President Jiao.

795
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:02,639
You're here.

796
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:04,479
Yes.

797
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:07,719
I have cleaned the tombstone,

798
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:09,800
I'll leave you to mom.

799
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:11,239
I'm leaving now.

800
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,780
[Wife, Liang Yu Jun]

801
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:32,600
Did you say he had helped you?

802
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:34,560
Yes.

803
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:38,439
He helped me to catch the thief,

804
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:41,000
and also provided the clarification documents.

805
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,520
Dad, I'm thinking

806
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,919
we are being too subjective, sometimes.

807
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,320
After all, he is mum's son.

808
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,959
I'm not being overly sensitive,

809
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,239
and I'm willing to give
young people opportunities.

810
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,679
But do you remember that his dad

811
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,760
got drunk and acted crazy in our house,

812
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:07,120
while your mum was still here.

813
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,199
And he asked for money.

814
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,360
Your mother's illnesses

815
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:12,879
was partly caused by him.

816
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,399
This child grew up with his dad,

817
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,199
I have to guard against him.

818
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:20,040
Yes, his dad

819
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,320
is not a good man.

820
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,000
But having such a dad is not his fault.

821
00:39:26,919 --> 00:39:27,800
He is quite a hardworking man,

822
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,520
but the department director keeps bullying him.

823
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:35,520
Dad, maybe you should

824
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,560
give him a chance.

825
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,959
Let me think about it.

826
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,239
Are you interested in joining my team?

827
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,479
President Jiao, you don't have to worry.

828
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,760
I will do my best

829
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,239
this time.

830
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,120
Great, see you tomorrow.

831
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,280
Besides, you don't have to call me President Jiao

832
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,399
when there's only you and me.

833
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,719
You can just call me Jiao Yang.

834
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,399
I feel distant when you call me President Jiao.

835
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,479
Okay, President Jiao.

836
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:06,959
Sorry.

837
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,639
I'm used to that.

838
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:11,399
I can't change in a short while.

839
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,360
It's okay.

840
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,800
These documents are for tomorrow,

841
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:17,280
get yourself prepared.

842
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,800
Jun.

843
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:32,639
What took you so long, Cheng Jun?

844
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,760
The dishes are getting cold.

845

849
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,239
Miss, I've heated it up for you.

850
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:50,840
Thank you.

851
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,080
This resort looks great.

852
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,879
Where is it?

853
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,600
What do you think?

854
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,479
Let me tell you.

855
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,080
It's a tourist resort

856
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,800
that I've been looking for a long time.

857
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,520
I plan to go with my boyfriend.

858
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,320
What a sweet couple.

859

Cheng Jun.

860
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:08,800
Cheng Jun, over here.

861
00:41:15,879 --> 00:41:18,320
Cheng Jun, you seem thinner.

862
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:19,760
Is it because of that bad manager

863
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,879
who keeps making you work overtime every day?

864
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:23,360
You need to give yourself a break.

865
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,399
You have to rest.

866
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,520

-I'm on a business trip tomorrow.

I'll be back in two weeks.

868
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,199
Such a long time.

869
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,520
Will you come back halfway during the business trip?

870
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:34,879
Probably no.

871
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,520
Take care of yourself.

872
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,439
Don't forget to clean up the house.

873

This promotion opportunity is important to me,

874

I hope you can understand.

I know.

You said you have something to tell me?

880
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,760
What is it?

881
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,800
It's nothing.

882
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,320
I just want to congratulate you

883
