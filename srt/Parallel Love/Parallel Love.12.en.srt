You...You know my boyfriend?

Someone said he was on the roof,

38
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,119
but when I came to look for him,

39
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:31,080
there was no one here.

40
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,399
Are you his colleague?

41
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,720
Do you know where he is?

00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,440

It's my duty to bring you an umbrella.

51
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,360
Please stop saying

I said, don't look for me at the company.

you haven't been answering my calls recently.

Okay, I'll send it to you right away.

Is it her?

72
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,519
Lin Miao, right?

Have you?

165
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,440

166
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,039
Have you?

167
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,919
Then why are you being so unusual?

168
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,799
So what's not unusual?

169
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,359
Assistant Lin,

170
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:07,280
have I been unfair to you at work?

171
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,320
No.

172
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,080
Am I not nice to you in private?

173
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,119
Neither.

174
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:19,359
In that case,
why are you saying that I'm unusual?

175
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,359
Because...

176
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,440
Because you're not doing this usually.

177
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:32,840
I just think that

178
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,520
a professional working relationship

179
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,919
is better for you and me.

180
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,119
From now on, get a taxi to work.

181
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,640
Remember to get the receipt for the fare.

182
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,200
I'll have the
finance department reimburse it to you.

183
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,200
Right. That's good.

184
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,799
Draw the line.

185
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,599
It's for the best.

186
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,559
Director Zhao,

187
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,080
these two donation platforms

188
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,719
have been chosen after evaluation

189
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:06,919
as the most suitable for the nature of our donation.

190
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,880
Please have a look.

191
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,880
The data in every aspect is very similar,

192
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,400
it's really hard to choose between them.

193
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,000
Manager Su, in this case,

194
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,400
which of these two platforms

195
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:25,239
do you think will bring more prestige to Hong Yu?

196
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,919
I will respect your opinion.

197
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,119
This one.

198
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,880
Manager Su, about you signing a private agreement,

199
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,919
I've heard about it.

200
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,799
I'm not as kind as President Jiao.

201
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,919
Personally,

202
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,400
I would rather believe
it exists than it does not.

203
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:51,119
So I will respect your opinion,

204
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,359
but I won't accept it.

205
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,159
The fish bit the bait.

206
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,000
Reel it in.

207
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,320
You're quitting?

208
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:39,559
Jiang Rou has just wired the donations

209
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,919
to the third-party platform
determined by Director Zhao.

210
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,320
The other party has confirmed they received it.

211
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:44,919
The crowd-funded donation

212
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,119
is considered to end.

213
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,080
As for me, it's time to step down.

214
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:53,799
Is it because of the chairman?

215
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,000
No.

216
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,960
It's just that with my status,

217
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,479
it's really not a good idea to stay in Hong Yu.

218
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,000
Alright.

219
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,559
Since you've made your decision, I will respect you.

220
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,359
Manager Su, with your capabilities,

221
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,080
whether you're in Hong Yu

222
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,280
or elsewhere,

223
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,559
I believe you will make it big in the future.

224
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,080
Thank you, President Jiao.

225
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,239
I'm Su Cheng Jun.

226
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,679
I can start tomorrow.

227
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,840
I'm sure that the future of working in Zhong Qing

228
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,440
will be very pleasant.

229
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,359
Why aren't you eating?

230
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:51,440
Not hungry.

231
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,359
You have to eat even if you're not hungry.

232
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,679
Company lunches are served per person,

233
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,559
so it would be a waste if you don't eat it.

234
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,000
President Jiao,

235
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,599
I'm just an assistant,

236
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:01,640
so you don't need to be bothered

237
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,080
whether I eat or not.

238
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,640
Assistant Lin.

239
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,239
Manager Su, can I help you?

240
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,320
I'm officially leaving Hong Yu tomorrow.

241
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:14,719
If you don't mind,

242
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,400
would you like to have dinner with me?

243
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,320
Leaving Hong Yu?

244
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,239
I've just tendered my formal resignation

245
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:22,479
to President Jiao.

246
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:24,799
President Jiao?

247
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,520
Do you need to be notified
of your superior's decision?

248
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,039
Don't worry, it's my choice.

249
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,280
Six o'clock tonight.

250
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,000
Are you going?

251
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,479
Whether I'm going or not...

252
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,080
Whether you're going or not,

253
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,200
I don't need to be bothered about it.

254
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:15,640
President Jiao,

255
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:17,080
for the donation,

256
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,760
I have completed the wire transfer

257
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
according to Manager Zhao's instructions.

258
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,320
They said that they would
give us an official certificate

259
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,119
tomorrow morning.

260
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:24,200
I believe the controversy

261
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,559
will settle down in no time.

262
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,320
There's one more thing you to have a look at.

263
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:36,520
A feasibility plan for
the artificial cultivation of althaea.

264
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,559
You wrote this?

265
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,960
I found it in Assistant Lin's wastebasket.

266
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:44,599
Didn't I tell her not to touch this project?

267
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,440
Judging from its thickness,

268
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,679
she should have

269
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,200
started working on it

270
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,320
since you first proposed the idea.

271
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:56,200
I was wondering how much work
Assistant Lin has put into it.

272
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,479
What work is this hectic?

273
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,960
Why does it feel like every day
is a race against time for you?

274
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,280
People's time is very precious.

275
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,159
Of course, I need to be smart about it.

276
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
Never waste it on

277
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,359
unworthy people or stuff.

278
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,400
Here you go again.

279
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,000
Now I'm curious

280
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,000
what is the important thing.

281
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,799
The thing that you are
willing to spend your time on

282
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,599
is the important thing.

283
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,559
The person that
you're willing to waste your time on

284
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,840
is an important person.

285
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,960
Got it, President Jiao?

286
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,400
Manager Su, why did you resign?

287
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,359
Is it because of
what the chairman said the other day?

288
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,799
The food in this restaurant is
excellent, and it's close to the office,

289
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,440
it's a restaurant that I like very much,

290
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:05,560
but I can't just go to this one.

291
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,479
Manager Su, you jumped ship?

292
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,400
In the new company, I'll be a director.

293
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,439
Well, congratulations.

294
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,839
I'm sure wherever you are,

295
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,199
you'll have a good prospect.

296
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:24,199
Assistant Lin,

297
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,239
do you really have that much faith in me?

298
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,239
There's actually something
I've been meaning to tell you.

299
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,880
All along,

300
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,000
I've had a strange feeling.

301
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,359
I felt like I've known you for a long time.

302
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,319
I've never thought that

303
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:51,000
someone knew me so well in presence.

304
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,959
I don't even need to speak,

305
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:55,439
just a single glance,

306
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,800
and she could understand what I was thinking.

307
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:00,040
Manager Su,

308
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,359
I suddenly remembered.

309
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,599
President Jiao has something else for me to do.

310
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,000
Sorry, I have to go.

311
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:16,839
Assistant Lin,

312
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:19,239
perhaps it is a little rude of me

313
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,319
to say all this today out of the blue,

314
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,319
but I just want you to give me

315
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,920
a chance to pursue you.

316
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,479
Sorry,

317
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,640
she can't say yes.

318
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:36,760
The reason is simply,

319
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:43,239
because the one she likes is me.

320
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,239
Excuse me.

321
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,000
Let's go.

322
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,199
Jiao Yang, why do you have to
rob me of everything!

323
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,760
No, President Jiao, you...

324
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,319
President Jiao.

325
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,400
President Jiao, please let go

326
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,560
President Jiao!

327
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,719
What do you think you're doing?

328
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,680
You're the one who said to draw the line!

329
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:26,880
I regret it.

330
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,800
Lin Miao,

331
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:36,359
for you,

332
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,239
my matter is worth spending your time on, right?

333
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,319
No.

334
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,719
For you,

335
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,400
I'm worth spending your time on, right?

336
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,479

00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,959
do you and
President Zhao abstain from voting?

505
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,760
I have no objection.

506
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:20,160
There is nothing wrong with punishing the guilty.

507
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:22,880
But before we conclude the meeting,

508
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,800
I would like every one of the board

509
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:27,280
to first take a look
at this report in your hands.

510
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,520
This is Leisure's income
statement in the first quarter,

511
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,680
Why it has increased so much
from last quarter

512
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,199
and the same quarter last year?

513
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,199
Who would have thought that
the rooftop wedding

514
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:40,479
and the Industry Association
would have such an outstanding effect.

515
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,719
Fellow board members,

516
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:47,239
although Jiao Yang has been in turmoil

517
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:48,479
ever since he became
the Vice President of Hong Yu,

518
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,520
but I believe that the achievements
that he has made

519
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,880
are visible to all of you.

520
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,599
He is young.

521
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,920
We must allow him to learn by trial and error

522
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,760
in order to grow.

523
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
I will not oppose
to the board of directors'resolution

524
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,359
to fire Jiao Yang,

525
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,319
but I hope the company
can give Jiao Yang a chance

526
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,680
to redeem himself.

527
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,199
I just got the news.

528
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:12,920
Heng Yuan Properties
will be holding a citywide tender

529
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,280
for a commercial site in the development area

530
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:17,479
in three days.

531
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,160
The document I have in my hand
is an internal document.

532
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:22,760
The official documents for the tender
will be distributed later

533
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,800
to any enterprises in the city
that are interested in the project.

534
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,760
I propose that Jiao Yang temporarily

535
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,560
represents Hong Yu in the bidding

536
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,719
as an ordinary project team leader.

537
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,119
If he fails,

538
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,959
the company won't suffer from any losses，

539
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,000
but if he succeeds,

540
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,319
Heng Yuan's position in the industry,

541
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,239
which is well known to everyone

542
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,800
will surely bring great benefits to the company.

543
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,839
Until then, we will judge again,

544
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,000
whether Jiao Yang

545
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,280
is a qualified Vice President or not.

546
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:51,640
What do the board members think?

547
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,239
This is bad! This is bad!

548
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,760
You... Sit down and talk.

549
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,520
Why are you shouting and screaming?

550
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,839
Is there anything worse than a donation fraud?

551
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,119
Ding Ding,

552
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:12,680
now we are all concerned about President Jiao,

553
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:13,839
we don't have time to listen to

554
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,040
your rumors and gossip.

555
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,280
President Jiao, resigned!

556
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,119
Resign?!

557
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,680
This is really bad!

558
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,040
Are you sure it wasn't the board that fired him,

559
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,359
and that it was him who resigned?

560
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,239
Yes!

561
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,560
It was a vote within the board,

562
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,239
four against one,
approving of President Jiao's resignation.

563
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,439
Sorry, excuse me for interrupting.

564
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,359
The human resources department
has received a notice from the board,

565
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:36,439
During this period,

566
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:38,520
all benefits of the Vice President
for President Jiao will be cancelled,

567
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,959
which includes transportation,
outings and banquets,

568
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:42,719
all of which must be applied for from the company.

569
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:43,920
As for the Vice President's office,

570
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
it will be sealed off for now.

571
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,439
Don't touch President Jiao's belongings!

572
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:50,599
If you want to get into President Jiao's office,

573
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:51,760
you have to go through us first!

574
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,079
Before President Jiao returns,

575
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,359
we're sorry we can't cooperate with you,

576
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:54,880
is that okay?

577
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
Right! if anything goes wrong here,

578
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,760
who's going to be responsible?

579
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,319
Right!

580
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:59,800
This is an order from the board,
please cooperate!

581
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,280
Go!

582
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:02,280
-Stop it!
-Let's talk...

583
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,680
Sorry for delaying your work.
Thanks for your hard work.

584
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:17,959
Thank you, President Jiao.

585
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,000
Stand still.

586
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,680
I appreciate your good intentions,

587
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,520
but they're just carrying out the order.

588
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,439
There's no need for us
to make things difficult for them.

589
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:34,520
President Jiao, I'm sorry.

590
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,000
For the coordination

591
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I could have been more thorough.

592
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
You don't have to say that.

593
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,079
If you think about it from another
perspective, you've actually helped me.

594
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,599
Really. I've long wanted to work with you

595
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,239
closely.

596
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Besides,

597
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,239
after stepping down from that position
I'm pretty relaxed.

598
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,359
Alright, let's not talk about this.

599
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,400
There are two important things

600
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,199
that I need you all to accomplish.

601
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,560
Any confidence?

602
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,639
President Jiao,

603
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,959
since you've already resigned,

604
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:13,840
why would the company
still assign you an assignment?

605
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,080
Because sometimes,

606
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,239
crises can be turned into opportunities.

607
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,080
What does that mean?

608
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,600
What President Jiao means is,

609
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,760
if we can get this bidding done right,

610
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,840
you'll have a chance to be reinstated.

611
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Retreat for the sake of advancing.

612
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,919
Eventually winning.

613
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,560
That's great, President Jiao!

614
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,719
We'll do our best

615
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,159
to help you strike a good comeback!

616
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:33,679
Alright!

617
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,439
Over the next period,

618
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:36,840
As a team lead,

619
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,800
I will lead you to participate in this bidding.

620
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,560
But this bidding, to us,

621
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,520
will be a challenge

622
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
So the time coming,

623
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,760
everyone may have to work a little harder.

624
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,600
And,

625
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,080
from now on,  you have to
address me as Leader Jiao.

626
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,760
You will always be our President Jiao.

627
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,439
You are such a flatterer.

628
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,320
And,

629
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,600
I'm no longer the Vice President of Hong Yu.

630
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,879
I appreciate you all for
being willing to stay with me.

631
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:00,879
President Jiao, what are you talking about?

632
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,000
The President's office is all in one boat.

633
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,000
President Jiao has to start punching in tomorrow.

634
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,280
Don't be late.

635
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,560
I'll try.

636
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,520
President Jiao, you need to apply for

637
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,800
an employee's cafeteria card.

638
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,959
You can go and apply it later.

639
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:12,679
By the way, President Jiao,

640
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:15,360
where will you be working from now on?

641
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,719
Isn't there an empty seat next to Assistant Lin?

642
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,679
President Jiao,

643
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,600
why don't you just sit next to Assistant Lin?

644
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,479
That way you can communicate
and work more easily.

645
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:26,120
Let's not talk about this issue first.

646
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:28,879
Our top priority

647
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:30,360
is to solve the problem of the donation

648
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,199
and the bidding of Heng Yuan.

649
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:33,280
Together, we will...

650
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,000
Go! Go! Go!

651
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,360
Cheng Jun!

652
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:49,840
What are you doing here?

653
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,080
I...

654
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,000
I...I've thought about it calmly,

655
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,199
and I feel like our problem is that

656
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,919
we hardly communicate with each other.

657
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,919
It's just that we've hardly seen each other,

658
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:00,800
and talked to each other recently.

659
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,600
I didn't even know you changed jobs.

660
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,760
There is a lot of work to be done
at the new company

661
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,439
and I haven't had the chance
to tell you about it yet.

662
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:12,280
Why did you suddenly change jobs?

663
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,639
You used to tell me everything.

664
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,840
Look for a job, Jun.

665
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,040
I've got a new job.

666
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,919
You should get a new life, too.

667
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:49,959
Without you, how can there be a new life?

668
00:36:57,959 --> 00:37:00,159
President Jiao, still not getting off work?

669
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:01,719
I'm not in a hurry.

670
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,919
By the way, this is for you.

671
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:06,120
What is it?

672
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,239
It was sorted out by Assistant Lin this afternoon,

673
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,199
regarding all the details of the donation.

674
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
She wanted me to take this document

675
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,399
to the board of directors to clear it up for you.

676
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,199
What's this all about?

677
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,040
Why would she put everything on herself?

678
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,800
Where is she?

679
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,239
She said she had something

680
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,479
important to do today and left.

681
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:27,639
Okay, carry on with your work.

682
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,439
Alright.

683
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,420
[Jiao Yang]

684
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:00,560
Granny,

685
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,120
that boy confessed his love to me yesterday,

686
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:08,560
but I turned him down.

687
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,399
We're from two different worlds

688
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,159
and it's never going to work out.

689
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,199
It's good.

690
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,399
It's good to draw a line.

691
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,120
At first, I thought

692
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,479
I would just need to do my work properly...

693
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:45,360
But I trusted the wrong person,

694
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,239
and he was forced to resign.

695
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,120
President Jiao brought me to Yue Rong

696
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,679
initially to promote me,

697
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,639
but I would have thought that

698
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,320
I did nothing helpful.

699
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,520
Manager Su, you don't have to blame yourself.

700
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,959
You've already done a good job.

701
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,360
If I had paid more attention

702
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,439
to the anomalies in the villa in those days,

703
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:32,560
maybe this wouldn't have happened.

704
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,239
Anyhow, the most important thing right now

705
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,159
is to help President Jiao
get out of this situation.

706
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,879
Actually,

707
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,159
I do have an idea.

708
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:44,159
And what is that?

709
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,239
Do charity.

710
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,399
Charity?

711
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,080
Yes.

712
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,000
We can make targeted charitable donations

713
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:53,719
to official environmental organizations.

714
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,239
Those environmental enthusiasts

715
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,280
are just under the misconception that
we are destroying the environment.

716
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,320
We just need to
tell them with our actions that

717
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:01,239
we are willing to do our part for the environment,

718
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,520
and with the official endorsement,

719
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:03,600
in this way,

720
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,840
I believe that the controversy
will soon be even out.

721
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,719
Although he said it was okay

722
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,399
and there was still a chance to make it right,

723
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,239
seeing his look when he was comforting us,

724
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,520
made me feel worse instead.

725
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,120
He might as well just scold me

726
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:25,239
or simply ignore me,

727
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,080
I would have felt better.

728
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,439
You're home.

729
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,199
It's late, get some rest.

730
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,919
I'm not sleepy.

731
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,600
I can't sleep with you like this.

732
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,600
I'm sorry then.
