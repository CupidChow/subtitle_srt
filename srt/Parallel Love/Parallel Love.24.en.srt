On 1 November,

34
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:05,800
there will be thunderstorm
and heavy rain in our city

35
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,480
accompanied with ball lightning.

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,839
Forecast experts said that

37
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,039
on 1 August, we'd already seen

38
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,919
such extreme weather
spectacle of ball lightning.

39
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,080
After three months, the same
phenomenon will appear again,

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,240

you'd be in a bad mood every Monday,

59
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,000
so you should dress up more seriously,

Don't you always find it hard
to get up from the bed?

65

You always take so long
to prepare every morning,

66
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,520
so I thought I could help you match.

423

I was so eager to go back,

424
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,880

425
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:57,520
myself to be so sad

426
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,760
when it was really time to leave.

427
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:05,040
I used to think the countdown of time

428
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,160
is a joke on me from God,

429
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,160
but now I realize

430
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:17,560
it's actually a gift from the heaven.

00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,520
I still want to see your magic tricks.

436
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,359

happened in these three months,

00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,319

after the beep.

457
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:18,439
Lin Miao, the reason
I'm calling you is to tell you

458
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,680
I resigned.

459
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,800
Listen to me first
before you get angry with me,

460
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,920
don't scold me yet.

461
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,760
It's like this.

462
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,079
I was really hardworking in doing this job,

463
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,319
I was really serious about it,

464
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,680
but

465
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:33,599
a little problem happened.

466
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:35,359
It was my fault though.

467
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,760
Didn't you tell me before that

468
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,319
a person has to be
responsible for his mistakes,

469
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,400
so I chose to resign.

470
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,000
Isn't that a small improvement

471
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,760
for me?

472
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:49,319
At least, I've learned to be responsible now,

473
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,000
right?

474
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,040
Actually I forgot to tell you,

475
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,880
I don't hate you anymore.

476
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,800
I actually rather like you.

477
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:05,439
There was even one time when I told myself

478
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:08,319
I wanted to be someone like you in the future.

479
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,839
Thank you for being in my life.

480
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,560
Thank you for giving me
so much encouragement and help.

481
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:19,520
I will take care of myself from now on,

482
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:23,920
work hard and learn from you.

483
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:26,359
Don't you worry about me,

484
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:29,560
I'll surely live a
much more interesting life than yours.

485
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,160
Is it weird

486
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,640
to talk to you like this?

487
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,719
But it's the only way

488
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,199
I could say

489
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,520
these words to you.

490
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,160
That's it then.

491
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,000
I will work hard.

496
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,560
Are we in the same direction?

497
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:19,359
It's alright, it's the same direction
wherever you go.

498
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,920
Hello? Xin,

499
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,599
why haven't I seen the

500
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,560
marketing plan for the next quarter yet?

501
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,520
President Jiao, did you forget that

502
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,839
you gave us a holiday after

503
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:35,520
the last project?

504
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:38,119
I'm sorry, I forgot.

505
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,839
Okay, you two have fun.

506
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:41,520
See you when you're back.

507
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,160
It's Jiao Yang again?

508
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:05,520
He called so many times during our vacation.

509
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,000
President Jiao is like Assistant Lin now.

510
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,280
Ding Ding said Assistant Lin
went overseas to get treatment,

511
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:12,160
no idea when she will come back though.

512
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,920
Assistant Lin has been
away for three months already.

513
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,280
Why President Jiao is okay with her going alone?

514
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,640
I forgot again.

515
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:24,040
Jiang Rou and Ying Jun

516
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,439
are off to meet their parents today,

517
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,520
they're not free to take my call.

518
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,359
It seems like
everyone's life is pretty good,

519
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:39,760
mine too.

520
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:46,400
You must wait for me.

521
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,839
Yan, Yan.

522
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,280
What is it?

523
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,560
Look,

524
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:03,959
this is a castle I built for you.

525
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,280
Look how silly you are.

526
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,119
How can you recover something

527
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,479
that has been swept away?

528
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,040
Even if it would be swept away 100 times,

529
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,119
if you like it,

530
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,680
I'd rebuild it 100 times.

531
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,920
Xin, I have been living

532
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,479
in a castle since I was young.

533
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,760
I was under my
father's protection all the while,

534
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,040
I was imprisoned by my own fantasy,

535
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,680
but after going through so many things,

536
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:47,400
I've entirely left the castle.

537
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,839
Even if the castle was swept away,

538
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:51,040
I wouldn't feel sorry about it

539
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,439
because I could be

540
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:55,040
a tough heroine now.

541
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,560
Yan.

542
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,160
However,

543
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,920
now I met someone

544
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,719
whom I could depend my life on.

545
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
So, I've decided that

546
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:12,399
as long as this person is by my side,

547
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:14,360
I will be a princess

548
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,959
who can't even open her own bottle.

549
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,000
Silly you.

550
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,360
I've already given out
such an obvious hint,

551
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,600
if you still don't take any action,

552
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,360
I'm leaving.

553
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:29,879
Don't, don't, Yan.

554
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,639
I'll open bottle caps for you forever.

555
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,280
Ying Jun,
which relative of yours are so loaded

556
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,639
to have given us a luxury

557
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,120
trip to the beach for five persons?

558
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:01,040
Ding Ding, rather than a rich relative,

559
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,840
aren't you supposed to think why

560
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,439
Ying Jun didn't sell those tickets

561
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:06,000
but invited us out for free instead?

562
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,040
You have to know that Ying Jun

563
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,639
is even stingier
than an iron tree blossoming.

564
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,520
Yeah, why?

565
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,919
Aren't you saying

566
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:16,639
how you're getting used to President Jiao's abuse,

567
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,679
and you find it boring now that you're free?

568
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,479
I was afraid that you'd
be too bored staying at home.

569
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,719
Besides,

570
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,120
last time when we were shopping,
you said you wanted to go to the beach.

571
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,239
What is going on?

572
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:26,959
Are you two on a date in secret?

573
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,760
Ding Ding, shut your mouth.

574
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,199
What do you call a date?

575
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
He was just

576
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,280
there to hold my handbag when I was shopping.

577
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,239
Yes.

578
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,239
Ying Jun, what are you shy about?

579
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,040
Don't expect a free trip to the beach

580
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,120
can be enough to win my heart.

581
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,560
I know, I know.

582
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,919
I'll continue to work hard.

583
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:52,600
Forget it, I don't want sunbath anymore.

584
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,040
It's so hot, I'm going to
buy some iced tea.

585
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,439
Be careful of the sun.

586
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,840
Be quiet, don't be so close with me.

587
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,520
Okay, okay. Then about your promise

588
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,959
to meet my sister tomorrow,

589
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:05,040
you still remember? Right?

590
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,360
It depends on your performance.

591
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,320
Ding Ding, what's with the two of them?

592
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,760
You bunch of shining couples,

593
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,560
don't ask me, I don't know anything.

594
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,520
Here.

595
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,080
Ying Jun, you never told me

596
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,800
your sister works at such a grand place.

597
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,040
What does your sister actually do?

598
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:35,479
She...

599
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,520
Hi, sister.

600
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,040
Let me help you with that.

601
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,239
Miss, it's inappropriate.

602
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,760
Why is it inappropriate?

603
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,120
With your relationship with Ying Jun,

604
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,959
I should be doing this.

605
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,280
What are you waiting for?

606
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,719
Come and help out.

607
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,439
How could you let your sister work alone?

608
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,719
She must be very busy,

609
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,360
so we can't trouble her any more.

610
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,159
Ying Jun.

611
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,719
You've brought your girlfriend home,

612
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,280
how could you let her do that?

613
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,679
Sister.

614
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
Sister?

615
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,639
Good night.

616
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:47,439
Infinite Home Condo

617
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:49,439
has higher sales than we expected.

618
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,000
Our third phase of
real estate opened on schedule,

619
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,439
but it's almost sold out by now.

620
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:58,199
Jiao Yang has indeed not let me down.

621
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:01,320
President Jiao.

622
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,000
President Jiao.

623
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,159
Chairman.

624
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:03,919
Sister.

625
00:39:04,439 --> 00:39:06,639
Ying Jun, how could you let your

626
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:07,879
pregnant wife come here?

627
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,560
Sister, you said to keep
a unit from the third phase

628
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,840
for us with internal discount.

629
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,959
So we're here for the opening

630
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:14,239
to quickly sign the contract.

631
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,760
After all, our family rule says

632
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,040
it's a loss not to earn.

633
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,120
Don't worry.

634
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,320
I have never broken

635
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,439
any of my promises

636
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:22,879
President Jiao, President Jiao,
President Jiao,

637
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:23,919
a client said

638
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:25,800
she wantss to buy 001 unit
from the first phase.

639
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,600
Didn't I say 001 unit
from first phase is not for sale?

640
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:29,040
No...

641
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,639
Ding Ding,

642
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:31,159
Secretary Yan and Director Zhao

643
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,760
have only been on their
honeymoon trip for a month,

644
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,320
you've already recited his mantra already?

645
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,239
Don't interrupt.

646
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,320
President Jiao, how could you not understand?

647
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,239
This client said that

648
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,600
this condominium is her home.

649
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:41,840
President Jiao, quickly go now.

650
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,800
Otherwise, you'll be too late.
