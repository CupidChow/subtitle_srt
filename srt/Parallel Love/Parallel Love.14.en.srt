33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,880
It was Chairman Li.

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,440
He dispatched someone
and sneaked into your office,

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,639
when none of us was in the office.

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,679
They said Chairman Li wanted your office.

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,880
He cleared out all your stuff

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,279
so that he can put his stuff in.

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,160
He is going too far.

40
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,679
What are you going to do?

41
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,679
I'm going to find him.

42
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,240
If you're going to beat him up

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,880
and you can make sure that
we're going to win the bid tomorrow,

44
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,919
then I will not stop you.

45
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,919
But you need to prioritize things.

46
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:46,039
Don't be a slave to your emotions,

47
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,160
Should we accept and submit to the humiliation?

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,559
If we don't fight back in time,

49
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:51,960
he will definitely get more aggravated.

winners get to do what they want.

54
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,080
Don't worry, Jiao Yang.

55
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,240
Your office will still be yours,

56
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,039
I'll make sure he never gets what he wants.

71

It's been a long time.

72
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,759
It's been a long time.

73
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,759
You're getting slimmer.

74
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,919
Really? That would be good.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,360
I'm losing weight without spending money.

76
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,559
I've heard that something happened to Jiao Yang.

77
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,559
It must be tough for you.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,640
I know that

79
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,359
you are the initiator of the incident,

80
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,640
you don't have to act like a good man here.

81
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,079
Even you are doubting me now?

82
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,480
All the evidence points to you.

83
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,760
Do I still need to doubt it?

84
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,679
Right.

85
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:43,480
I'm just the bad guy

86
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,640
in your eyes,

87
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,640
I've always wanted to frame Jiao Yang.

88
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,760
Aren't you?

89
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,320
If you could analysis correctly,

90
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,880
if Zhao Yan had more faith in me,

91
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,480
if Jiao Yang was clever enough,

92
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,959
the donation fraud incident

93
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,119
wouldn't have happened.

94
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,399
I just made use of the opportunity,

95
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:11,480
you can only blame yourself

96
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,119
for falling into the trap.

97
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,040
The perpetrator turned his back

98
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,399
and blamed the victim for being so weak.

99
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,679
You are such a bloody genius, Su Cheng Jun.

100
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:22,480
Lin Miao,

101
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,679
can we just stop discussing Jiao Yang?

102
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,519
I really like you.

103
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:27,799
Jiao Yang is a pampered person,

104
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:28,480
but I'm not.

105
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,519
Both of you are never the same.

106
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,679
Both of you are brothers by blood,

107
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,959
but you two are completely different.

108
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:35,959
Su Cheng Jun,

109
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,359
I suggest

110
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:39,239
you should hide your hypocritical face,

111
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,959
I will not look down on you

112
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,959
if you were a bad but frank person.

113
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:52,839
So you want me to be like that?

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,640
Okay.

115
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,079
I'll do whatever you want.

116
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,679
Assistant Lin,

117
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,119
where's your questionnaire?

118
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,640
I think you can just skip mine

119
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,640
since you've collected so many, right?

120
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,559
So that's your work attitudes when you're at work?

121
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,799
No, it's because

122
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,000
the questions are too difficult

123
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,559
for me to answer.

124
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:24,320
Fine.

125
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,200
Guess what did I saw

126
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,600
in the coffee shop downstairs?

127
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,399
You saw it?

128
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,079
You're in between Su Cheng Jun and Jiao Yang.

129
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:39,959
Assistant Lin,

130
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:41,079
you may have heard

131
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:41,839
the saying that

132
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,399
we shouldn't put all eggs in the same basket.

133
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,640
It's such a waste

134
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,880
that you didn't do investment banking.

135
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,920
Director Zhao talks so eloquently,

136
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,799
you have made the best use of your
talent a public relations professional.

137
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,239
Lin Miao,

138
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,679
you should give up now.

139
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,600
I grew up with Jiao Yang since we were small,

140
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,279
no one could understand him better than me.

141
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,600
For all these years,

142
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,320
I've been treating him

143
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,200
like my future husband.

144
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:04,839
I've been working to be a better person,

145
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,000
I just thought that one day

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,160
I could help him

147
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,440
manage a company.

148
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,160
But since he got to know you,

149
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,000
he has changed.

150
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,000
He has only got his eyes

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,799
on you.

152
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,519
Lin Miao,

153
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,559
tell me if you like Jiao Yang.

154
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:20,519
I don't want to lose my chance

155
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,559
to get him.

156
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,640
Director Zhao,

157
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,160
Jiao Yang is not a doll for

158
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,480
two little girls to fight.

159
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,959
He is a living person,

160
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,320
he has the right to think and choose.

161
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,160
Apart from that,

162
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm busy with my work every day,

163
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,239
I don't have time

164
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:40,559
for the likes and dislikes.

165
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,239
Let alone the winning or losing.

166
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,679
If you really want to be with him,

167
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:45,559
fine,

168
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,880
let's play fair.

169
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:48,600
What? Play fair?

170
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,920
Does that mean that

171
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,399
you like him too?

172
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,040
I never say that.

173
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,600
But you mean that.

174
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,640
Lin Miao,

175
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,200
no one's around,

176
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,279
let's get it straight. Do you like Jiao Yang?

177
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,679
What if I say yes?

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,799
Good.

179
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,920
She said she likes me.

180
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,040
She likes me.

181
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:18,000
Although you're not prettier than me,

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,320
you're not feminine enough,

183
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,399
and you don't share the childhood memories with him

184
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,040
as Jiao Yang and I do,

185
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,119
but I can still

186
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:25,760
accept you

187
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,239
to be my competitor.

188
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,719
Director Zhao,

189
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,719
you're cute.

190
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,080
I know I'm cute.

I'm happy.

197
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,479
Yes.

I'm happy.

199
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,760
Should we just call a car?

200
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,719
No.

201
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,000
It's going to take us an hour to reach home.

202
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,599
We will waste a lot of time.

203
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,599
I thought you'd enjoy spending time with me.

204
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:29,479
I'm happy.

Look at you,

208
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,280
your feet are worn out,
yet you're still holding on to it

209
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,239
I can feel your love

210
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,599
for me.

211
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,640
How about

212
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,679
we take a cab back
instead of walking back?

213
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,760
Can't you see

214
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,479
the grudge in me?

215
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,719
It was you who suggested walking home,

216
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,119
and now you want to take a cab back

217
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,359
while it's only 300 meters left

218
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,919
away from your community?

219
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,440
You're too incomprehensible.

220
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,679
Look at you now,

221
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,840
you're no different from
while you were at Yue Rong Villa.

222
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,880
While we were at Yue Rong Villa,

223
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:21,359
the reason why I stopped you

224
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:24,320
from finding Althea is...

225
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:29,200
my father died when he was looking for it.

226
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:38,559
I'm sorry.

227
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:40,520
I don't know about that.

228
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,039
My father was away from home for work

229
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,200
when I was a child,

230
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,799
I was at home with my mother.

231
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,359
We lived in a suburban community

232
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,200
with a small garden outside,

233
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,799
which was about the same size as here.

234
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:59,960
I used to sing and dance

235
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,640
in the garden.

236
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,640
And my mother would fill the water glass

237
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,039
to make music

238
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,159
as accompaniment for me.

239
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,239
I thought I was

240
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:14,479
the happiest child in the world.

241
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,359
Do you remember you once asked me

242
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,880
what I think of home?

243
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,479
That's all the memories about home

244
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:25,000
that I can barely remember.

245
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,119
So I think that a home

246
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,640
is a place for you to rest,

247
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
a place to share,

248
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,000
and a place where you can let your guard down

249
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,880
and face yourself.

250
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,000
Home should also be a place

251
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,599
to create memories

252
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,640
with the most important people in life.

253
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,919
Yes.

254
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,039
I'll give you a home.

255
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,280
Thanks for that.

256
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:10,520
But according to the current housing market,

257
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,719
I think I'm able to afford a house.

258
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,840
Did anyone tell you that

259
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,080
you really know how to spoil the mood?

260
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,799
Did anyone tell you that

261
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,840
you're overly careful about detail?

262
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,039
Jiao Yang,

263
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,559
It turned out that the biggest
miracle that appeared in my life

264
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,679
is not the time that has turned back，

265
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,359
but encounter with you.

266
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,719
Assistant Lin, you look beautiful today.

267
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,599
Why did you ask Xin

268
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:07,799
to get this for me?

269
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,599
We're here for the bid,

270
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,080
why do I have to wear a dress?

271
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,679
That's not important.

272
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,919
But we shall see what will happen after the bid.

273
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,799
Jiao Yang, what's your purpose?

276
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,159
Hi,

277
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:41,840
I'm Su Cheng Jun, the representative
for Zhong Qing Group.

278
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,200
What fate.

280
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm Jiao Yang, the represent for Hong Yu Group.

281
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,440
Thank you all

282
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,919
for coming to our Heng Yuan bidding conference.

283
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,280
I'm the host

284
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,000
and one of the judges for this bidding conference.

285
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,520
The panel of the judge is composed

286
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,520
of the other two judges and me,

287
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:23,359
and the final decision
will be made by Chairman Liu.

288
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,479
In order to save time,

289
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,640
the judges

290
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,599
have discussed

291
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,599
the proposals submitted by each company

292
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:30,599
before the meeting.

293
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,559
For now, four companies have been selected,

294
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,679
and they will directly enter
the second round of bidding

295
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,520
and starts with presenting.

296
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,520
The four companies are

297
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,359
Cheng Xin Group's High-End Business Hotel,

298
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:46,119
Zhong Qing Group's Urban Eco-Hotel,

299
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:49,080
New Century Group's Holiday-Theme Hotel,

300
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,520
and Hong Yu Group's Urban Eco-Hotel.

301
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,559
What?

302
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,159
There are two proposals
out of the four are the same.

303
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,119
What a coincidence.

304
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,359
Next, let's welcome President Su

305
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,599
from Zhong Qing Group

306
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,599
to present his proposal.

307
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,599
First of all, I'm happy and grateful that

308
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,479
Heng Yuan Group has approved

309
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,880
of our Urban Eco-Hotel proposal.

310
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,919
While we were planning for

311
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,400
the hotel area,

312
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,520
we have taken into account

313
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,559
the nearby artificial lake

314
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:24,880
and the small garden,

315
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,840
which aims to combine the hotel environment

316
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,679
with the unique landscape garden of the city

317
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,400
and create a new concept of Urban Eco-Hotel.

318
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,520
Thank you, Director Su.

319
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:38,000
Let's welcome our next presenter

320
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,440
from Hong Yu Group, Leader Jiao.

321
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,520
Jiao Yang, just give up.

322
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,080
Jiao Yang.

323
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,440
Trust me.

324
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:52,599
Good afternoon, Chairman Liu,

325
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,679
good afternoon, everyone.

326
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,280
Regarding the explanation
of the Urban Eco-Hotel,

327
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:59,320
I will not go into details again

328
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,520
since everyone has heard it from Director Su.

329
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,880
Next, I would like to elaborate on

330
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,679
the concept of home

331
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,200
in addition to the concept of ecology.

332
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,880
As we all know, traditional hotels

333
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,640
only provide services for
customers who are on a business trip

334
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,440
or business travelers

335
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,320
who need accommodations for a brief stay.

336
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,880
However, as the pressure of life increases,

337
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,840
we find that providing guests

338
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,799
with a comfortable environment like home

339
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:25,679
is a new option for more and more guests.

340
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,919
A home is a place for you to rest,

341
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:29,760
a place to share,

342
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,880
and a place where you can let your guard down

343
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,559
and face yourself.

344
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,559
Home should be a place where
we stay with someone we care about

345
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,880
and it should be a place

346
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,559
to create memories

347
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,440
with the most important people in life.

348
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,599
Yes.

349
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,239
I'll give you a home.

350
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,239
So we should be more rigorous
regarding this matter,

351
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,959
so as to avoid people taking advantage of us.

352
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,000
Assistant Lin.

353
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,199
Director Su.

354
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,239
After the bidding ends, do I have a chance to...

355
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:30,040
No.

356
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,160
She has to stay with me after the bid.

357
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,719
Leader Jiao,

358
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,439
I'm asking Assistant Lin,

359
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,040
It's not right for you to answer on behalf of her.

360
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,520
He represents me.

361
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,880
Let's go now, Assistant Lin.

362
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,079
Now I will announce

363
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,280
that the three companies

364
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,719
that will enter the next round of bidding are

365
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,839
Zhong Qing Group's Urban Eco-Hotel,

366
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,959
New Century Group's Holiday-Theme Hotel,

367
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,680
and Hong Yu Group's Urban Eco-Hotel.

368
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,800
Why did the same two companies get chosen?

369
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,040
Yeah, that's strange.

370
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,479
What's going on?

371
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,719
Manager Lu,

372
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,800
my friend who works in the admissions office

373
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,920
has time today,

374
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,239
would you like to have a meal together?

375
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:51,340
[Block 3, Building 1]

376
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:51,880
Master,

377
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,280
I'm sorry to rush you.

378
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:54,640
It's okay, this is what we should do.

379
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,400
Let's go.

380
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,839
Okay.

381
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,040
I wonder

382
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,439
where those ideas come from.

383
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,199
The bidding has ended.

384
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,040
So can you tell me now

385
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,680
why I have to wear like this?

386
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,599
Just be patient, I'll let you
know when we get home.

387
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,680
Let's see how long you can hold.

388
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,479
Hello, this is Lin Miao.

389
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:17,959
What?

390
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,079
Okay, I'll handle it.

391
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,400
What's wrong?

392
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,920
The hospital called and said

393
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,000
Lin Wei Jun was missing.

394
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,680
Let's go look for her.

395
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,839
Give me a second.

396
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,359
Let me think where she would go.

397
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,359
If you're constantly being immature

398
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,400
and naive,

399
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:49,000
I think we should just stop here.

400
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:52,239
We can begin again.

401
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:52,959
The past, the past.

402
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,680
Can't you stop living in the past?

403
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,920
What you need is

404
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,520
someone who can stay by your side

405
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,719
and accompany you.

406
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
And what I need

407
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,719
is someone who can make progress

408
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:03,400
and grow with me

409
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,520
in life and career.

410
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,560
What we want is different.

411
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,359
Do you understand?

412
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,560
You should find a job, Jun.

413
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,680
I have found a new job.

414
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,520
You should start a new life too.

415
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,280
Let's break up.

416
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:25,959
We're not fit for each other.

417
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,479
No.

418
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,560
I did it later than I do now

419
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,160
ten years ago.

420
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,079
She is temporarily unconscious

421
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,599
and needs to pay attention to at any time.

422
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,520
Okay.

423
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,040
Is she really in a coma?

424
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,760
Yes.

425
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,880
Maybe she's acting?

426
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,839
Let me tell you something,

427
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,839
She was in the drama club
when she was in college,

428
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
she knows how to act.

429
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,160
Why don't you believe it?

430
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,680
She almost died.

431
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,319
It shouldn't be like that.

432
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:14,400
What is it?

433
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,439
Nothing, just...

434
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,479
Wait,

435
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,760
is it because you did the same thing in the past,

436
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,199
so you don't believe it?

437
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,359
No, I'm not.

438
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:36,640
Lin Miao,

439
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,199
don't do anything stupid.

440
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,680
Can you imagine how scared I was

441
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,880
when I saw that Lin Wei Jun

442
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:51,680
is in a coma?

443
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,239
Because you did the same thing

444
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:56,359
as you do now.

445
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,719
How did you get through in the past

446
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,040
without me?

447
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,839
I'll just have to bite the bullet.

448
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,160
And everything would be alright.

449
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,199
But I can't stand to see you suffer anymore.

450
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:22,359
Only those who have been
suffered know how to appreciate things.

451
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,880
You've got a point there.

452
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,599
Actually,

453
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,439
you should thank your past self

454
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,599
for being stupid, selfish and ignorant,

455
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:42,439
you wouldn't meet

456
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,680
such a promising young president like me.

457
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,760
And you wouldn't have become

458
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,400
such a beautiful and intelligent woman, right?

459
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,880
You're right.

460
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,760
I owe you thanks.

461
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,520
You're welcome.

462
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,479
Doctor,

463
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:02,800
how's her condition?

464
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,640
The patient will wake up after a short rest.

465
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,280
Okay, thank you.

466
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:10,920
Are you hungry?

467
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:12,959
No.

468
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:13,760
What do you want to eat?

469
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,760
I want to eat steamed buns.

470
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,319
Okay.

471
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,640
Doctor, how was she?

472
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,520
It was you.

473
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,160
It was you who saved my life ten years ago.

474
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,040
You mean

475
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,520
other than Lin Wei Jun,

476
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,439
I saved you ten years ago?

477
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,319
Exactly.

478
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:12,719
You saved me,

479
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,319
and paid for my hospitalization expenses.

480
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:16,719
When I woke up,

481
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:18,000
I tried to find you,

482
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:19,520
but I failed.

483
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:23,000
Anyway, I can only remember

484
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,839
a few fragments about this matter.

485
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,680
It does sound like me.

486
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,359
Then how are you going to thank me?

487
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:36,520
Marry me?

488
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,560
No.

489
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:43,880
Then I marry you.

490
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:50,439
Cheng Jun.

491
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,239
Let's check her out.

492
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:52,680
Okay.

493
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,920
Why is it you?

494
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,079
What are you doing here?

495
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,079
Call the doctor.

496
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,920
You should leave now.

497
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,479
I don't want to see you.

498
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:12,280
Su Cheng Jun broke up with me

499
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,560
because of you.

500
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,000
How could you

501
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,359
be insatiable?

502
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,479
You could have died without us.

503
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,719
I never asked for it.

504
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,560
I don't have family or friends.

505
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,599
And now Cheng Jun is going to abandon me.

506
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:25,439
I just don't see a point in life.

507
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:26,680
I should die.

508
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,479
That's enough.

509
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:29,160
Stop it.

510
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,920
Don't touch me.

511
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:31,599
Stop it now.

512
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,479
Let me go.

513
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,719
Go ahead and die.

514
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,479
Su Cheng Jun would be so happy

515
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,319
if you die.

516
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,800
He could finally live without you.

517
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,040
If you died,

518
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,439
on one feels sad for you.

519
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,719
If you die now,

520
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:59,880
you should go down there and meet your mother,

521
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,959
let her see

522
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,880
her well-brought-up daughter

523
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,400
is so self-effacing

524
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,599
that she wants to give up her life.

525
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:07,680
Go ahead and die now,

526
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,839
I will not stop you from doing that.

527
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,359
She can't accept any stimulation,

528
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,560
you should take responsibility

529
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,000
and take care of her.

530
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:48,160
That's it.

531
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,680
Complete the discharge formalities.

532
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,959
Take her to my house.

533
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,359
So that I can take care of her

534
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,479
and prevent her from acting excessively.

535
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,880
Take her to your house?

536
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,640
That's not suitable.

537
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:07,439
But both of you are still you,

538
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:08,359
I can't abandon her.

539
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:14,280
I'm not going.

540
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,319
Lin Wei Jun, you've gone too far.

541
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
I won't willing to accept you

542
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,040
if not for Lin Miao.

543
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,400
I have a place to go.

544
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,400
And Cheng Jun told me that

545
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,479
he would take care of me.

546
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:23,400
I'm not going to your house.

547
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,119
Are you sure?

548
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:25,719
Then you should give him
a call and ask him directly.

549
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,599
I will call him.

550
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:37,319
Did he pick up your call?

551
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,520
I can take care of myself

552
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,800
even without him.

553
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,599
Stop lying to yourself, alright?

554
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,479
I can go, but under one condition.

555
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,599
But you have to make sure that Lin Miao is gone.

556
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,439
Gone.

557
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,520
Come in.

558
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,280
Why do you have woman's shoes in your house?

559
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
That belongs to Lin Miao.

560
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:19,000
Do you two live together?

561
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,520
There are many jobs recently,

562
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,439
so she stays here for the time being

563
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,239
which is more convenient to work.

564
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,959
Don't be a busybody.

565
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:31,560
I don't believe it.

566
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
You have two houses,

567
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,640
why didn't you let me stay here?

568
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,040
Because I want to live with you.

569
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,160
Is there any problem?

570
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,239
You are a rogue.

571
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:56,560
Stop acting.

572
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,280
Do you dare to say that

573
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,119
there wasn't slightest excitement

574
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,680
when you saw my body for the first time?

575
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,839
Excitement?

576
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,560
Felt blushing, heart beating fast
and even wanted to...

577
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,640
Wanted to do what?

578
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,680
To make a baby.

579
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,199
Baby?

580
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:13,680
I can sense the connotation in your words.

581
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:14,760
No, I'm not.

582
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,920
It's getting late. Go back and sleep now.

583
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,680
Sleep early.

584
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:17,959
But I'm serious,

585
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,680
we can let Lin Wei Jun sleep alone downstairs.

586
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,760
She might like being alone.

587
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,599
Right?

588
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,079
Since you've taken her in,

589
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,400
you will have to watch over her from now on.

590
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:29,839
Just take care of her,

591
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,760
I don't want her to cause problems anymore.

592
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,400
Besides,

593
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,520
I've got used to sleeping on the bed,

594
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,400
so you might have to move downstairs

595
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,680
and sleep on the sofa.

596
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,280
A woman and a man staying together,

597
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,359
aren't you worrying at all?

598
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,439
What do I have to worry about?

599
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:47,880
I'm handsome and temperament,

600
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,920
and I'm a noble son of Hong Yu Group.

601
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,959
It's hard to find a man like me.

602
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,079
Aren't you afraid that
we might fall in love over a period?

603
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:57,160
Please wake up.

604
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,839
Lin Wei Jun can only think about

605
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,119
her Su Cheng Jun,

606
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,199
she wouldn't have her eyes on you

607
00:31:01,199 --> 00:31:02,239
even if you're Takeshi Kaneshiro.

608
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:03,160
Okay, you should go now.

609
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,319
Go and sleep.

610
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,359
I can be Daniel Wu

611
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,880
even if I can't be Takeshi Kaneshiro.

612
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,880
Give me a hand.

613
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,359
I'm a patient, I can't move.

614
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:20,199
Can you put down your ice-cream first

615
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:21,880
before you start acting?

616
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,719
No wonder Lin Miao told me
that you are a veteran actor.

617
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,640
What did she say about me?

618
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,040
She won't have her eyes on you

619
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,520
even if you're Takeshi Kaneshiro.

620
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,599
I'm busy,

621
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:35,959
I don't want to waste my time on you.

622
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,040
Up to you.

623
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,160
Why the clothes of a boss and an assistant

624
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,239
are put together?

625
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,199
And he said there was nothing between them.

626
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:59,400
The assistant has something on her mind.

627
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,560
So heavy.

628
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,280
You slept on the sofa last night.

629
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:15,520
Did she eat a big bucket of ice cream,

630
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,040
and she had diarrhea so badly

631
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,640
that she had to run to the toilet many times,

632
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
and you could barely sleep because of that?

633
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,079
How did you know that?

634
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,359
You guess.

635
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,119
Wait a minute,

636
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,439
Are you feeling insecure?

637
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:30,959
So you installed a surveillance camera in my house

638
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:33,319
to monitor my every move with Lin Wei Jun?

639
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,719
Do I need a surveillance camera for that?

640
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,560
When she passes 25 years old,

641
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,280
she will finally realize that

642
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,239
uncontrollably eating cold food

643
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:41,640
is very harmful to health.

644
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:44,160
She will learn over time.

645
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,239
President Jiao, Assistant Lin,

646
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,560
This is what I estimated last night.

647
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,839
Currently, the cost of our whole project

648
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:52,959
is expected to be around 4.8 billion yuan.

649
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:54,239
Civil engineering

650
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,800
costs about 1.5 million yuan.

651
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:59,079
Apart from the mechanical and
electrical installation and designing,

652
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,000
the proportion of interior
decorating is the largest,

653
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,479
which is expected to be about 2.2 billion yuan.

654
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,560
We don't have an advantage

655
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,640
in the second round of bidding

656
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,880
with our current price.

657
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,839
That's the problem.

658
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,560
Although there are three companies

659
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,400
have successfully entered
the second round of bidding,

660
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,040
but New Century Group isn't creative enough

661
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,160
to be afraid of.

662
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:21,199
Our biggest competitor is Zhong Qing Group.

663
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:24,119
We are both having the concept of Urban Eco-Hotel

664
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:26,479
and the total costs

665
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:28,959
are almost the same,

666
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,439
but we have added the concept of home,

667
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:32,920
so the cost will definitely
be much higher than theirs.

668
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,479
I have estimated that our total cost

669
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,359
is about 30 million yuan more than

670
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,280
Zhong Qing Group's.

671
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,479
Then what should we do?

672
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,359
I have inquired about it,

673
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,359
Chairman Liu of Heng Yuan Group

674
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,160
cares about the price-performance ratio.

675
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,800
Although I don't know why he

676
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,239
approved of our proposal,

677
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,920
we can't take any more risks

678
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,479
in the next price comparison.

679
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,839
Is there any other way

680
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:58,880
to save cost

681
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,959
without causing problems
with the internal quality.

682
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,520
The interior decoration

683
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,760
has always cost the largest part

684
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,119
of the total cost,

685
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,400
and we have already set the style

686
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,520
and specification for our hotel,

687
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,439
so it's not easy to save the cost

688
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,800
of the decoration part.

689
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,320
Assistant Lin,

690
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:15,280
I want you to go with me later.

[Hao Xing Steel Factory]
This is the largest steel supply market in the city,

692
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,879
We are here to meet the boss,

693
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:21,639
Boss Chang,

694
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,080
Since you have known Hong Yu for many years,

695
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,320
I'll go straight to the point.

696
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,120
As you can see that

697
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,399
there's a high demand for steel consumption.

698
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,679
If you're willing to give us

699
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,479
two more percents discounts than usual,

700
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,639
I can give you this project.

701
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,959
Besides, if you can guarantee the steel quality,

702
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,560
I will give you a priority

703
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,719
on all relevant projects of Hong Yu

704
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,199
in the next five years.

705
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,399
For the discount price you mentioned,

706
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:46,679
I'm sorry I can't do it.

707
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:48,800
Okay.

708
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,959
Since that's the case,

709
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,840
we shall look for another supplier.

710
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,080
However,

711
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,520
since we have known each other

712
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,840
for many years,

713
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,399
I do have a shortcut here

714
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,560
and I think you might need it.

715
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,760
Assistant Lin,

716
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,479
do you still remember

717
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:16,560
the entrepreneurial spirit of Hong Yu?

718
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:18,239
We build the house with our heart,

719
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:19,600
so that our residents could live in peace.

720
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:20,840
Right.

721
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,000
Boss Chang,

722
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:26,560
My parents have put
a lot of efforts in Hong Yu Group,

723
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,479
and by fate, we could work together,

724
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,239
but it seems that we have no fate this time.

725
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,560
We shall leave now.

726
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,120
Thanks for your time.

727
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,719
Let's go.

728
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,320
Lin Miao,

729
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,919
will there be a big difference between
the next ten years and the present?

730
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,080
Of course.

731
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,320
By that time, there are car-sharing services.

732
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,719
Will that happens for real?

733
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,439
Of course, the world is changing fast.

734
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:53,080
Let's take the real estate industry as an example.

735
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,919
Although it is profitable

736
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,040
to build buildings, hotels and shopping malls,

737
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,639
but who could ever expect that

738
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,360
the housing rental market

739
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,439
and the long-term serviced apartments

740
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:03,520
are very popular in the future?

741
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,280
Most of the people have chosen

742
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,600
long-term serviced apartments instead of hotels

743
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,719
when they are traveling or on a business trip.

744
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,120
Wait,

745
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,040
would you repeat it?

746
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,320
I said the future is always changing.

747
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,000
No, I mean the last sentence.

748
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,959
Most of the people have chosen

749
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,040
long-term serviced apartments instead of hotels

750
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,360
when they are traveling or on a business trip.

751
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:28,280
Tell me more about

752
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,639
the apartment that you mentioned just now.

753
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,439
I have an idea.

754
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,840
Compared with the traditional apartments,

755
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,479
the long-term hotel apartment

756
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:37,520
is more humanized

757
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,879
and customized.

758
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:39,520
In short,

759
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,000
it can provide some simple decoration

760
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,399
for the residents,

761
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:44,040
and of course, it won't be particularly luxurious.

762
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,159
The second most important thing

763
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,360
is the humanized service.

764
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,360
For example, it will offer free daily breakfast,

765
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,560
ironing service,

766
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,600
cleaning service,

767
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,719
travel reservation service and so on.

768
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:57,840
In short, it's about the feeling

769
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,280
of staying in a high-end hotel.

770
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:04,000
Wouldn't the residents

771
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,919
be dissatisfied with the simple decoration?

772
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:07,479
In fact, no.

773
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:09,959
the majority who choose
long-term serviced apartments

774
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:11,280
are the young ones.

775
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,000
They like to make some
arrangements or decorations on their own

776
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,320
in their rooms,

777
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,919
so it's cheaper to rent

778
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:18,719
and more comfortable to live as it's a home.

779
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,800
I think I know how to save those 30 million yuan.

780
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:24,360
You did a good job.

781
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:30,600
Dad, this is the newly adjusted plan

782
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,959
and the new budget planning table.

783

785
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,679
how did you come up with

786
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:43,919
this adjustment plan?

787
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,399
At first,

788
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,840
I thought the bidding would going to fail,

789
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,280
but thanks to Assistant Lin for the idea

790
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:53,199
which made me think of a way

791
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,000
to upgrade the concept

792
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,520
and to reduce the costs as well.

793
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,560
Well done.

794
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,439

795
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,199
Now you can finally take complete charge.

797
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,600
if you think this plan is going to work,

798
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,840
I'll ask Xin

799
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,040
to pass it to the board of directors to sign.

800
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:09,639
Wait a minute,

801
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:13,879
the bid involves a large amount,

802
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:16,399
I think it's more suitable

803
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:17,199
for the board office to handle it.

804
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,679
I'll ask Secretary Hu

805
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,320
take it to the director's office
after I go through it.

806
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,399
Okay.

807
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,600

00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:25,919
this project will be ours

come in.

Chairman, are you looking for me?

813
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,120
Take this document

814
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,919
to the directors' office,

815
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,479
and make sure they sign it within today.

816
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,639
Okay, Chairman.

817
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,800
Oh, right,

818
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,080
Do you have a result on the incident

819
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,879
that I asked you to check previously.

820
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,399
You got it right.

821
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:55,080
The video leakage of Yue Rong Villa

822
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,280
has confirmed to be done by Chairman Li.

823
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:58,239
The purpose was to get rid of Su Cheng Jun

824
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,919
and drive away the
right-hand man of President Jiao,

825
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,280
but unexpectedly, Su Cheng Jun

826
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,399
became the representative of Zhong Qing.

827
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:03,600
And he keeps against President Jiao

828
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,719
in the bidding.

829
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,280
Now it seems that

830
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:07,679
he has achieved his plan.

831
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,959
Li Dong Qiang

832
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,879
are just like that, that's all he can do.

833
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,760
The bidding is now at an important phase,

834
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,919
he will definitely do something to Jiao Yang

835
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,760
so that he could not return to the position.

836
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,080
Get yourself updated with the situation

837
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,560
and report to me immediately

838
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,560

[150 million yuan]

840
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:28,560
No,

841
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,679
this isn't enough

842
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,719
But this is already the lowest price.

843
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:35,080
And you've said that Hong Yu

844
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,639
has added the concept of home in their proposal.

845
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:40,320
So their interior decoration costs
must be higher than our budget.

846
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,959
That's what we want.

847
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,719
We must have an overwhelming advantage

848

in the overall cost planning this time

849
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,719
to eliminate the winning chances of Hong Yu.

850
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:53,199
Follow on and check the details with engineers

851
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,159
to see if the price can be lowered.

852
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,439
But...

853
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,360
Do you know why I could be a director

854
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,560
and you can only be an assistant?

855
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,159
Whenever there are obstacles,

856
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,560
I choose to face them

857
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,919
and you choose to compromise.

858
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,840
If you compromise once, you will do it again.

859
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,040
Those who give up in a fight

860
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,919
can only be a loser.

861
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,679
I will do as you said.

862
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:36,199
This bidding

863
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,520
decides how far I can go in Zhong Qing,

864
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,879
and it will also have an impact

865
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,479
on the status of Jiao Yang and his father.

866
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,040
And Lin Miao will finally realize

867
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,360
how incompetent Jiao Yang is

868
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,919
compared with me.

869
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,479
And you, mom.

870
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,919
you abandoned me for Jiao Yang.

871
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:56,760
Let's wait and see,

872
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,879
you will regret choosing the wrong heir.

873
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,120
I'm going to win

874
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,879
