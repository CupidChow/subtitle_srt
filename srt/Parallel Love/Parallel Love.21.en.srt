Jiao Yang.

What's wrong?

37
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:29,639
I couldn't see clearly just now.

38
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,440
Are you alright?

39
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,240
I'm fine.

40
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,960
Maybe I was just blindfolded for too long.

41
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:38,639
Is this a gallery?

42
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,279
What did you bring me to the gallery for?

43
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:41,360
Come.

44
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,160
This design exhibition

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,440
was designed by my mother.

46
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,240
I came here often when I was young.

47
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,919
I don't simply bring anyone to here.

48
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,399
However, you're different.

49
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,039
That's why I brought you here to see it.

50
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,800
How's it?

51
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,440
This painting...

52
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,839
My mum drew it.

53
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,800
Who is it in the painting?

54
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,039
The right one is my dad,

55
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:09,639
while the left one is my mum.

56
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,720
My mum

57
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,119
had a lot of fantastic ideas.

58
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,880
Meanwhile, my dad

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,240
always helped her realize her ideas.

60
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,440
He realized them

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,119
by turning them into real buildings.

62
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,000
I didn't know that Chairman and his wife

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,240
were so romantic.

64
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,839
I think that the message of

65
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:38,559
of our chairman's wife is

66
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:42,639
not to let go of your lover's hand

67
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,960
no matter what.

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,039

You told me that I'd complete your home.

71
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,839
Actually, you feel lonely sometimes.

72
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,880
You'll miss

73
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,440
your future home too, right?

74
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,160
I don't want to let you go.

75
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,239

how the world will be like after ten years.

78
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,720
I've spent effort in making this surprise for you.

79
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,519
You must appreciate it.

80
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,440
So, Miss Lin,

81
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,600
are you willing to spend your life with me?

82
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,600
Thank you for everything.

83
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,119
I got no choice,

84
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,880
being in loving with a hard-hearted woman,

85
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,519
By the time she acts,

86
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,079
I guess

87
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,119
it would be the end of the world,

88
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,239
where flowers would die
and the sea would be dried.

89
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,160
Then...

90
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:25,440
No. No.

91
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,600
You spent so much effort

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,000
in making surprises for me.

93
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,480
So give me a chance

94
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,839
to make one for you too.

95
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
No need. Being simple is the best.

96
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,079
It's better to keep things simple.

97
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:36,279
No. No.

98
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,239
It's better to make it grand.

99
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,959
It'll be sincerer.

100
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,200
Let's go.

101
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,519
Didn't we agree to walk together
toward the future world?

102
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,799
We've done exploring the future.

103
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,640
We shall return to the real world and fight.

104
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:53,160
Let's go.

105
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,679
What fight?

106
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,679
I don't know it either.

107
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,399
Fight.

108
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,760
Does it have the one you want?

109
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,119
Come on.

00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,640
Yes. Something must happen.

What has happened to him these days?

115
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,720
Keep smiling at the computer.

116
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,640
Impossible, right?

117
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,959
The truth is in front of us.

118
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,079

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,559
Tell us!

122
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,799

President Jiao and Assistant Lin?

124
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,760
No idea.

125
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,559
Tell us.

126
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,000
I really don't know.

127
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,119
Hey, Assistant Lin.

128
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:59,320
I've informed the hotel.

129
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,959
The rooftop and dining hall of Leisure Hotel

130
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,480
have been reserved

131
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,959
to ensure the inauguration of President Jiao

132
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,160
will be perfect.

133
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,480
Alright, I'll go back after sending the documents.

134
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,959
I am wondering how she's doing

135
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,519
alone there.

136
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,079
You're right.

137
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,640
It's more comfortable
to wear flat shoes sometimes.

138
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,000
Dropping our ego and stubbornness

139
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:37,640
will give us better scenery.

140
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:47,959
Don't be sad, little kid.

141
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,920
Let me help you.

142
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,079
The castle can be easily rebuilt.

143
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:06,760
Please, Chairman Zhao.

144
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,279
Su. You aren't here

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,559
for a cup of tea, right?

146
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,920
You're well known for
your steadiness, Chairman Zhao.

147
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,359
I want to know

148
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,519
why you looked so surprised

149
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,480
when you saw me at Zhong Lun.

150
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,880
Su,

151
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,320
Although you aren't a member of Jiao's family,

152
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,239
you and the chairman are somehow more alike

153
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,559
than Jiao Yang.

154
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,559
If the chairman's wife was here,

155
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,559
she wouldn't like to see

156
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,359
the current situation
between you and the Jiao family.

157
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,679
She really missed you.

158
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,119
Missed me?

159
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,239
Yes.

160
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,280
Before she passed away,

161
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,200
she kept mumbling about your compensation.

162
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:05,760
Compensation?

163
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:08,559
Just sent me to Hong Yu

164
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,679
and put me in an awkward position,

165
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,440
asked me to serve Jiao Yang

166
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,640
forever, right?

167
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,119
How could you describe your mum like that?

168
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:17,799
Her compensation

169
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,679
wasn't this.

170
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,559
Then, what was it?

171
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,359

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,319
and your life to be better.

344
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,599
Stop it.

345
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,839
I tell you.

346
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,439
I won't be involved in the project of Zhong Qing.

347
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,319
If you've let me go,

348
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,400
you wouldn't be so afraid

349
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,439
to work with me.

350
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,319
I think that you haven't changed.

351
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,800
You're still the same.

352
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,959
I can clearly separate

353
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,119
my professional and private life.

354
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,079
I'll meet you

355
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,800
to discuss the work tomorrow.

356
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,640
This is the more important thing?

357
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,000
The pool needs to be decorated
for the president's inauguration?

358
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Need candles and balloons?

359
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,239
It needs to be so mysterious?

360
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,959
It must be something.

361
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:44,079
I didn't know that
Assistant Lin didn't say what she meant.

362
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,079
This is obviously

363
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:47,400
a birthday surprise for President Jiao.

364
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,160
How dare she hide it from us!

365
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,199
Seriously.

366
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,560
She did it because it's a surprise, right?

367
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,160
Why don't we give Assistant Lin a surprise too?

368
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,439
Good idea.

369
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:08,199
Assistant Lin decorated the rooftop wedding

370
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,160
so well.

371
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,199
Why can't she do the same

372
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,319
here?

373
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,719
It's too ugly!

374
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,800
I agree.

375
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,760
Do they know about love?

376
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,479
It's not romantic at all.

377
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,880
That's why

378
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,479
we're here.

379
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,239
Why don't we help them?

380
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,319
Let's do it.

381

Why are you still awake?

382

Are you doing something without my consent?

383
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:46,800
I'm preparing for the inauguration tomorrow.

384
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:49,439
Please rest early.

385
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,199
I'm going to sleep.

386
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,079
Wait.

387
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,800
You haven't given me an answer.

388
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,040
What's that?

389
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,680
Your lifetime employment contract.

390
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,719
Sign it.

391
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,239
I don't want to.

392
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,719
Why?

393
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,959
It should be made based on a mutual agreement.

394
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,560

395
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:17,959
We've become like this.

396
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,560
What else can you choose?

Explain it.

It's...

401

like that.

402

This is you. This is me.

403
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,000
We knew each other.

404
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,319
Then, like this, like this, like this.

405
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,280
Isn't it obvious?

406
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,199
So, did you purposely do it?

407
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,119
Don't fall into the trap.

408
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,079
Give it to me.

409
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,239
I got the contract.

I feel your sincerity too.

411
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,680
However, regarding the time to sign it,

412
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,079
I'll consider it again.

413
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,520
Good night.

414
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,160
Is it a sign

of the end of three months?

416

I was busy in the morning.

418
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:34,839

give your client a piece of paper,

438
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,760
I think I should reconsider it.

00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,040
You should

685
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,919
give a face to your brother

686
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:57,479
no matter what.

687
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,000
Yes, Jiao Yang.

688
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,439
You're my brother.

689
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
How can a brother

690
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,600
be absent

691
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,679
from such a precious moment?

692
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,439
Something interesting has happened finally.

693
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:15,399
Why is he here?

694
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,679
Manager Su.

695
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,639
If you're dissatisfied with me,

696
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,399
we can discuss it personally.

697
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,000
Please behave yourself

698
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,600
to avoid troubles

699
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,080
on this occasion.

700
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,679
Are you threatening me?

701
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,320
As your brother, I feel upset.

702
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:37,280
I'm here to congratulate you

703
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:39,360
for your success.

704
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:40,560
Really?

705
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:43,600
Please do it

706
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:44,879
after my speech.

707
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:46,000
Get a seat.

708
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,080
Although you weren't invited,

709
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,560
we would still treat you as our guest.

710
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,199
Here, please, Manager Su.

711
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,679
Don't go

712
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:58,520
too far, Su Cheng Jun.

713
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,560
You and the Jiao family

714
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:04,760
are the one who go too far, Jiao Yang.

715
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,280
You all took my mum away from me.

716
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,879
You all even took away

717
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:08,959
the only care she left for me.

718
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:11,600
You'll disappoint her if you keep doing this.

719
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,399
Please leave.

720
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:14,919
Don't make a fool of yourself.

721
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,760
Send him off, Xin.

722
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,120
Security! Security!

723
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,879
Please, Manager Su.

724
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,479
I'm here

725
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,399
to take back what I deserve today.

726
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,479
This is the will

727
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,719
of my mother, Madam Liang Yu Jun

728
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,600
as the wife of the chairman of Hong Yu Group.

729
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,000
It's clearly written that

730
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:42,560
I'd get five per cent of

731
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,000
the shares of Hong Yu Group from her.

732
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:46,879
I request Hong Yu Group

733
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:48,520
to halt the president's inauguration

734
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:49,879
and give me an official response.

735
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,320
How can it be?

736
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,280
Yes.

737
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:54,399
Seriously?

738
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:56,199
How can it be?

739
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,600
President Jiao must be clear

740
00:39:58,879 --> 00:40:00,760
with the words written on the will.

741
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:03,840
The signature belonged to our mum,

742
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,040
Madam Liang Yu Jun.

743
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,180
[Liang Yu Jun]
[Witness: Cai Jia Rui]

744
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,879
You can get the best handwriting expert witness

745
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:13,800
to verify it.

746
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:14,560
Trust me.

747
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:17,080
You'll be disappointed.
