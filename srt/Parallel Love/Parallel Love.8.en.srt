[Episode 8]

33
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,199
President Jiao,

34
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,199
here's some basic
information about Yue Rong Villa.

35
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:06,919
Do you want to read it before you sleep?

36
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,199
Who asked you to agree with my dad on this project.

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,919
and make the decision on my behalf?

38
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,639
I'm very familiar with it,

39
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,199
I don't need your information.

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,520
By the way,

41
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,399
are we close?

42
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,520
Talk to me less at home.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,679
You're a girl,

44
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:35,240
but look at the things you're bringing.

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,759
I...

46
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:39,080
These are all my private stuff,

47
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,919
President Jiao, aren't you being too bossy?

48
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,199
You already look rather common.

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,800
You will get sun-burned there.
Take care of your skin, OK?

50
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,000
Take these face masks.

51
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,000
One more box.

52
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,440
Besides,

53
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,199
you hurt your head last time,

54
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:55,000
take some calcium supplement.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,839
Oh, right, hold on.

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,880
Don't pack first,

57
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,160
stop packing, stop packing,
stop packing.

58
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,279
You even dare not to bring
the shoes that I gave you,

59
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,160
pack up.

60
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,880
Is there anything else to bring, President Jiao?

61
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,399
Just now, we almost again...

62
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,479
Did you do it on purpose?

63
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,679
You did it last time

64
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,399
and this time too.

65
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,919
On purpose?

66
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,759
Like this.

67
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,759
What, what's wrong with it?

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Just like this, what's wrong with it?

69
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,000
It was unintentional too,

70
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:14,240
it's an accident.

71
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,079
Accident?

72
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,079
Just like that, it's nothing?

73
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,320
The white shoes that I gave you are nothing too,

74
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
take them out then.

75
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,799
Do it.

76
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,480
You're really taking them out?

77
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,839
Shh, talk less.

78
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,720
Let me tell you, if you take them out...

79
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,320
Shoes, face masks, medicine.

80
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,239
Take them back.

81
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:44,839
Satisfied now?

82
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,079
Why are you so near?

83
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,160
Are you thinking of...

84
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,679
Okay.

85
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,480
From now on,

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,799
let's draw the line between us.

87
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:58,000
President Jiao, please stay
three meters away from me in the future,

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,440
alright?

89
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,559
Three meters, right?

90
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:02,279
Okay. One, two, three.

91
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,359
Three meters.

92
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,720
Three meters, step back.

93
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:34,799
President Jiao,

94
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,679
I do not know why you rejected

95
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:38,119
the development of Yue Rong Villa,

96
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,839
but

97
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,239
the development is imperative.

98
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:42,959
In my opinion,

99
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,000
it's better for us to do it ourselves

100
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,119
rather than handing it to other people,

101
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:47,920
don't you think?

102
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,119
We're more at ease.

103
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
Years have passed

104
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,559
and I allow you to work for the company,

105
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,440
so that you can have a job to support yourself.

106
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,880
This should be enough
to uphold your mother's

107
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,359
last entrustment of you to me.

108
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,440
You have to understand that

109
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,799
Jiao Yang is a very kind child.

110
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,079
I don't want him to get hurt,

111
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,399
you know what to do.

112
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,760
Assistant Lin,

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,760
last night, I gathered some detailed information

114
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,600
about Yue Rong Villa for the past few years.

115
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,119
Take a look at it, it might be of use.

116
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,720
Thank you.

117
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:09,640
The first half is about the
villa's specific information,

118
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,760
and the second half is the
analysis of cases at the villa.

119
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,359
I think we can decide on the

120
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,640
development plan when we reach there.

121
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,279
Okay.

122
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,559
You two have already started discussing work?

123
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:22,720
Come, let me see, let me see.

124
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,720
Let me see, let me see.

125
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,640
Childish.

126
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,200
Manager Su, your proposal is indeed detailed.

127
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,920
Look at how creative these sticky notes are.

128
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,480
Manager Su, what are they for?

129
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,880
President Jiao, the color tones of the sticky notes

130
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,640
represent the priority and
seriousness of the matter.

131
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,040
The numbers are the order for the same category.

132
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:46,760
Assistant Lin, how do you know

133
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,920
the meanings of these notes?

134
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:54,679
I have my own logic and
habit in labeling the sticky notes,

135
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:55,880
they are different from normal practices.

136
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,880
Are you taking me as air?

137
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,920
Driver, stop the car.

138
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:17,880
Are you kidding me?

139
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,399
You want me to wait for half an hour?

140
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,160
Let me tell you,

141
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,559
if you can't make it in 1 minute,

142
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:22,839
you don't have to come to work on Monday.

143
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,760
President Jiao, what's so important that

144
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,239
you need Xin to send it over now?

145
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:30,679
It's none of your business.

146
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:33,880
Okay.

147
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,799
You're not willing, are you?

148
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,200
Or do you regret not being able to

149
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,039
go with Manager Su first?

150
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,719
Being weird again.

151
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,440
President Jiao, 59 seconds.

152
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,039
Fine,

153
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,359
did you bring my important personal item?

154
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,000
Is it this, this one?

155
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,719
Good that you've brought it, I need it.

156
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,039
All good now. Assistant Lin, get into the car.

157
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:14,640
I'm leaving.

158
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,599
Hey.

159
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,760
Director Zhao, why are you here?

160
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,479
Of course, I'm here to pick you up.

161
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,640
Me?

162
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,400
Why are you standing there? Get in.

163
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:46,119
Okay.

164
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,200
Director Zhao,

165
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,559
I didn't know that you care
about your subordinates so much,

166
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,520
but how do you know I'm here?

167
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:56,559
Fasten your seat belt.

168
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,559
Okay.

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,320
We must quickly catch up with Jiao Yang.

170
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,919
Catch up with President Jiao?

171
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:03,679
Yeah.

172
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,200
Didn't I tell you before that

173
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,840
we're going to Yue Rong Villa too?

174
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,039
Director Zhao, President Jiao has instructed

175
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,359
us to stay at Hong Yu.

176
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,239
It seems really nice here,

177
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,840
the air is fresh too.

178
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,559
Assistant Lin,

179
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,799
if it wasn't for my wise decision,

180
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:39,000
can you see such a paradise now?

181
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,719
President Jiao,

182
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,960
why do I remember that

183
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,760
you were

184
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,640
unwilling to develop Yue Rong Villa at first

185
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,359
and I was the one to convince you to do it?

186
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,080
That's enough.

187
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,200
We've finally arrived,

188
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,440
but how come there's no staff at all at this villa?

189
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,960
Someone should have come and welcomed us.

190
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,479
President Jiao.

191
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,200
Assistant Lin.

192
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,640
Why are you alone?

193
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,239
Something wrong with Yue Rong Villa.

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,919
Hello?

195
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,280
Is anyone here?

196
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:41,400
Over there.

197
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,559
Let's go over and see.

198
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,640
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

199
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:54,479
Ahh!

200
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,119
Here.

201
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:23,320
Don't worry,

202
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:25,679
the safest place in Yue Rong is here.

203
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,159
The light button is here.

204
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,640
I'm sorry, President Jiao.

205
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,239
I didn't do it on purpose.

206
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,000
Are you done?

207
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:25,880
Yeah.

208
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,679
One more left.

209
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,479
Here.

210
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,119
Three, two, one.

211
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:38,960
Mother, you're so great.

212
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,919
I want to be like you in the future

213
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,679
and draw a lot of beautiful houses.

214
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,640
I'm really sorry, President Jiao.

215
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
It's okay,

216
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:10,000
I know it's unintentional.

217
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,679
What is this place?

218
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,119
It used to be my mother's workshop.

219
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,159
What a waste.

220
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,599
I couldn't protect any of it.

221
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,200
It was an accident just now.

222
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,719
The chairman has already handed
you the resort development project,

223
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,679
it means he believes
that you could protect it

224
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,679
and make the best choice.

225
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,719
Do you think so?

226
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,880
Of course.

227
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,960
Except you, no one else has the right

228
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:01,440
because this is your mother's design.

229
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,000
President Jiao,

230
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,680
we're locked in from outside.

231
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,599
Morning.

232
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,439
Morning.

233
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,479
Good morning.

234
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,880
Manager Su, good morning.

235
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,319
How come the door is open now?

236
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,560
When I woke up this morning,
I found the door open,

237
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,719
so I went out for a stroll.

238
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,640
I've already found the staff of Yue Rong Villa.

239
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,280
We don't have to sleep in the loft anymore tonight.

240
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:07,479
That's great.

241
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:08,959
I sat on the bench for the entire night,

242
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,280
now my body is sore.

243
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,599
Sat there for the entire night?

244
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,439
Then, did a ghost help me build the model?

245
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,560
President Jiao, don't you know
that there are ghosts in Yue Rong Villa?

246
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,000
Maybe a female ghost that likes you

247
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,079
helped you build it last night.

248
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,839
That's enough, you talk too much.

249
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,520
Let's go.

250
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,439
There are people in

251
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:39,359
Yue Rong Villa,

252
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,880
last night why did we even...

253
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:44,920
Handsome boy.

254
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,119
They are...

255
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:53,439
Everybody,

256
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,160
this is Hong Yu Group's vice president,

257
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,719
President Jiao.

258
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:59,680
This is an assistant, Miss Lin Miao.

259
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,239
President Jiao,

260
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,880
this is the lobby manager, Manager Zhou.

261
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,800
Hi, I still have work.

262
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,520
Bye.

263
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,680
This is Chef Liu from the restaurant.

264
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:18,160
What, what's that look?

265
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,520
He's looking at you.

266
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,599
This is...

267
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,920
My name is Ji Zi.

268
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,959
President Jiao,

269
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:26,760
if you have time, come to the bar for a drink.

270
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,160
Stop drinking,

271
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,319
the staff is not allowed
to drink alcohol while working.

272
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,400
Then, what drinks are allowed?

273
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,520
You're so cute.

274
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,920
President Jiao, why are you blushing?

275
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,359
Is it?

276
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,680
It's not, stop talking nonsense.

277
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,040
Uhm, let the kitchen
prepare something to eat.

278
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:55,239
We haven't eaten anything

279
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:56,280
since last night.

280
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,119
Assistant Lin.

281
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,760
What is wrong with this place?

282
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,800
There's not even a waiter.

283
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,079
President Jiao,

284
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:27,520
due to the lack of business
in the villa for some time now,

285
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,040
most of the workers left,

286
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,920
so only these few people are left.

287
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,239
Let's have our meal first.

288
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,079
It looks rather good.

289
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,719
I heard that Chef Liu
was from an artistic background.

290
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,959
Manager Su, you first.

291
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,680
Thank you.

292
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:05,800
Please enjoy your meals.

293
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,680
Wait, hold on a minute.

294
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,920
Did you make a mistake?

295
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,920
No.

296
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,160
You're asking a president to eat this?

297
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,560
The food a person eats

298
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,560
does not depend on his status,

299
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,560
but on the person's temperament.

300
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,520
Miss Lin and Mr Su here

301
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,160
both have an aura of intelligence

302
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,439
and a sense of maturity.

303
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,160
Therefore, this serving of
high-quality California steak

304
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,359
suits them very much.

305
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,920
As for President Jiao, the feeling you portray,

306
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,119
one word.

307
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:31,640
Handsome.

308
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:32,920
Vulgar.

309
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:36,199
So, this serving of fried noodles

310
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,280
suits you the best.

311
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:39,319
The way of cooking is simple and rough,

312
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,239
no need for the brain.

313
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,719
It perfectly matches
the arrogance in you, President Jiao.

314
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,640
Chef Liu,

315
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,160
do you know who you're talking to?

316
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,079
When the encounter of elegance and vulgarity

317
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,920
produces a fierce

318
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,839
internal contradict and conflict,

319
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,839
it really has a high artistic value.

320
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:14,199
You all may enjoy your meals

321
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,560
and pretend that I'm not here.

322
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,640
Change.

323
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,680
Okay.

324
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:26,640
You eat, you eat.

325
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,400
President Jiao,

326
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,560
Chef Liu's thinking might be somewhat subjective,

327
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,520
let me exchange with you.

328
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm talking about replacing people.

329
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,760
Yes, yes, yes. Replace, must replace.

330
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,959
President Jiao, please step away quickly,

331
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,719
you're too vulgar.

332
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:41,760
I can't continue my art piece.

333
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,319
Zhou, Zhou.

334
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,560
President Jiao,

335
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,760
this is our first time here,

336
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,719
I think we still need to

337
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:53,359
maintain a good relationship with the old staff.

338
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,599
Please, don't be angry.

339
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,959
Yes, I didn't say anything either.

340
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,040
It's just that I've suddenly lost my appetite,

341
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,719
I would like to go back and rest.

342
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,359
Are you done?

343
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,359
Yes, yes. Let's go, let's go.

344
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,160
You haven't even touched the steak.

345
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:10,319
Could you at least respect my labor result?

346
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:12,359
You, go back.

347
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,520
You, sit down.

348
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:17,959
Lin Miao,

349
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,160
you stay here

350
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,839
and enjoy your noble and elegant lunch.

351
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,520
I'll head back first.

352
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,199
President Jiao.

353
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,000
President Jiao.

354
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:30,920
Sit down, Zhou.

355
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,359
Sit down quickly.

356
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:37,839
How dare they didn't come to stop me.

357
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:40,119
Stupid weirdo one after another,

358
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,920
no wonder Yue Rong Villa is like this now.

359
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,760
I'll replace all of you sooner or later.

360
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,040
It's fine.

361
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,560
Zhou, help me look at my art.

362
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,359
Is there anything wrong with it?

363
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,199
You didn't get scared last night, did you?

364
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,239
I'm fine.

365
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,319
Assistant Lin,

366
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:06,000
Yue Rong Villa is not peaceful after all

367
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,640
and we have limited time.

368
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,319
I'm thinking

369
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,199
whether we could

370
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,400
directly destroy the place and rebuild.

371
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,640
Miss Lin,

372
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,400
this is my calligraphy,

373
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,560
I don't simply give it to others.

374
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,880
Thank you, Chef Liu.

375
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:27,160
It's my honour.

376
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,760
May I ask you for a favour?

377
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,239
Only now you come over...

378
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,319
Manager Su.

379
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,199
President Jiao.

380
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:47,400
Come in.

381
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,959
Take a seat.

382
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,040
President Jiao,

383
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,119
you didn't eat anything just now,
you must be hungry.

384
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:03,439
This bowl of noddles is made by Chef Liu.

385
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:06,719
Thank you, Manager Su,

386
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,760
but please tell him,

387
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:11,359
people who know shame do not accept charity.

388
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,800
Where's Assistant Lin,

389
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,199
is she not done with
her high-class lunch yet?

390
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,880
Assistant Lin was dragged by Chef Liu

391
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,520
to see his artworks,

392
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,719
but President Jiao,

393
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:24,439
Assistant Lin was the one to request
this bowl of noodles from Chef Liu

394
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,439
for you.

395
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,239
Lin Miao?

396
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:30,239
Yes.

397
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,359
Okay then,

398
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:36,239
since Chef Liu has taken the initiative,

399
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,959
I'll give him some face.

400
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,760
However, after I finish this bowl of noodles,

401
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,239
I will still fire him.

402
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:42,959
Not only will I fire him,

403
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:44,680
but I will also fire

404
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,640
every employee in this villa.

405
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,719
No improvements and they
think they were the kings in the villa.

406
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,319
Look at what a nice villa

407
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,680
has become now.

408
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,560
Wait till I'm full, I'll take care of them one by one.

409
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,079
Is there anything else?

410
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:02,040
President Jiao,

411
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,920
about last night's incident,

412
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,400
I'm really sorry.

413
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,800
You have

414
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,640
already apologized last night.

415
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,239
Besides, Lin Miao already helped me

416
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:15,760
to complete half of the model,

417
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,239
so you don't have to feel sorry.

418
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,800
You have such heavy eye-bags,

419
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:24,000
you didn't have a good sleep last night?

420
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,800
Coming to the villa reminds me of many things,

421
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,560
so I couldn't sleep.

422
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,719
If I remember it correctly,

423
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,239
Yue Rong Villa

424
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:44,160
was the place we first met each other.

425
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
President Jiao, you still remember?

426
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,800
I heard about your father.

427
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,000
It must be hard for you.

428
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,680
Those were in the past.

429
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,719
Things from the past,

430
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,280
I can't remember them clearly any more.

431
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,280
For now, work is more important.

432
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,239
However,

433
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:14,119
from last night's situation,

434
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,079
the task to develop Yue Rong Villa

435
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,280
might not be as easy as we thought.

436
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,920
President Jiao, do you have any plan?

437
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,319
To be honest, not yet.

438
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,319
Yue Rong Villa

439
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:31,040
was the place we first met,

440
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,280
and now this is the
first project we're working together,

441
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,640
it seems like destiny.

442
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,239
I believe if we work hard together,

443
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:46,359
we surely can give this place a new look

444
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,680
and not disappoint my mother's expectation.

445
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,199
Manager Su,

446
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,680
are you willing to help me protect this place?

447
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,680
President Jiao, don't worry.

448
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:02,880
I'll give this place an entirely new look.

449
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,719
That's great.

450
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,560
Tomorrow, you'll be off to Yue Rong Villa,

451
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,520
everything is on you now.

452
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,680
The people in the villa is so unusual,

453
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,160
but the food they made is rather delicious.

454
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,160
Yeah,

455
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,680
I was telling Assistant Lin earlier that

456
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,599
the situation in the villa is too complicated,

457
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,319
why don't we destroy and rebuild?

458
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:34,760
Destroy?

459
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,959
Who dares?

460
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,760
Who dares to destroy Yue Rong Villa?

461
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:45,920
This place belongs to me and Jiao Yang.

462
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,520
Why are you two here?

463
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,839
We're here to look for you.

464
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,040
Jiao Yang, don't worry,

465
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,800
I've already settled everything in the company.

466
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:02,400
President Jiao, I really couldn't stop her...

467
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,079
Jiao Yang,

468
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:08,239
do you still remember when we were small,

469
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,560
we stayed here?

470
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,160
Back then, there were insects, birds,

471
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,400
flowers, grasses

472
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,920
and also a romantic attic.

473
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,199
Bring me there now.

474
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,719
Director Zhao,

475
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,280
about the attic,

476
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,520
you'd better not go there now.

477
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:23,800
Why?

478
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,119
It doesn't matter.

479
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:30,359
Last night, there were
indeed various unusual signs,

480
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,439
but

481
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,239
electronic candles can be turned on and off,

482
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:36,040
dishes can be prepared earlier,

483
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,040
the sounds can also be recorded beforehand.

484
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,319
As for the female ghost in white...

485
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,640
Female ghost?

486
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,920
I'm afraid that it's not a female ghost,

487
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,719
but someone is playing tricks with us.

488
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,079
President Jiao, what you mean is...

489
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,719
This bunch of people is treating me like a fool,

490
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
they even dared to act as a ghost to scare me.

491
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:57,640
Then, don't blame me for returning their favors

492
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,839
and reveal their plots.

493
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,640
Nonetheless, what's important now

494
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,640
is to find the evidence.

495
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,560
I've already made the necessary arrangements,

496
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,599
I hope you have fun.

497
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,680
Fight with me?

498
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,839
You all are too inexperienced.

499
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:22,479
I haven't gone looking for you

500
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:23,920
yet you came by yourself.

501
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,400
You'll see how I...

502
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,239
Give me back my stuff.

503
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:37,359
President Jiao.

504
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,199
She blew her cover

505
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,239
and I've got something on her.

506
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:40,839
Catch her.

507
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:46,479
Stop running.

508
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,160
You, you!
Stop running.

509
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,400
Stop.

510
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,119
Stop her.

511
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,760
Help!

512
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,680
It's not...

513
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,439
What kind of look is that?

514
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,760
I didn't do it on purpose.

515
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,400
Little boss,

516
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,599
you've made a mess this time.

517
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,160
Shan Shan,

518
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,040
is not only our little cutie,

519
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,839
but also Manager Zhou's niece

520
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,479
and Yue Rong's baby.

521
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,119
How could you bully her?

522
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:35,400
I didn't think that
you're such a heartless businessman,

523
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,800
you even dare to bully her in public.

524
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,839
I bully her?

525
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,520
Please,

526
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,719
she was the one acting
like a ghost to scare me.

527
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,000
What evidence do you have

528
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,599
to prove that we were playing tricks behind you?

529
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,599
Shan Shan has already hurt,

530
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,000
yet you're still quibbling.

531
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,359
She went into my room with her face covered,

532
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,599
if she wasn't acting
like a ghost, what was she doing?

533
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,400
Visiting me with best wishes?

534
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,560
Did I sleepwalk again?

535
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,439
I didn't do it on purpose.

536
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:00,920
He's so fierce,

537
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,800
he's the one who made me fall.

538
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:03,800
You,

539
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,160
you should stop spouting nonsense.

540
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:08,280
Our Shan Shan sleepwalks,

541
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,880
you disrupted her during her sleepwalk

542
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,319
and even tripped her.

543
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:14,760
If she hurts anyhow,

544
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:16,760
let's not talk about criminal liability,

545
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,680
your fame as the vice president of Hong Yu

546
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,560
will be gone first.

547
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:20,560
You...

548
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,280
Shan Shan, is it painful?

549
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:22,959
Don't be afraid.

550
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,119
Later I'll bring you
for an examination in the hospital

551
00:33:25,199 --> 00:33:26,839
and get proof of assault.

552
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,839
Fine,

553
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,239
you just wait here.

554
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,199
Xin,

555
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,680
come here.

556
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,439
President Jiao.

557
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,160
You want proof, right?

558
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,119
Give them proof.

559
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,239
President Jiao,

560
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,479
the safe in your room is empty.

561
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,280
How is this possible?

562
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,640
I'm a hundred percent sure.

563
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,199
Please think carefully,

564
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,479
did you really place the things

565
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:58,040
in the safe just now?

566
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,880
I see it now.

567
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,599
You are plotting against me, aren't you?

568
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:06,760
When I let my guard down,

569
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,600
Shan Shan acted as a decoy to distract me

570
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,439
and you stole the evidence, right?

571
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,280
President Jiao,

572
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,199
don't slander us if you don't have any evidence.

573
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,639
That's right, don't try to change the topic.

574
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,120
In the situation right now,

575
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,760
you have to compensate Shan Shan,

576
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:21,959
or else we'll have to go to court.

577
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:24,080
Compensate it is.

578
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,360
Tell me, how much do you want?

579
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,239
I can settle each one of you
after the compensation.

580
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:29,959
This man is so handsome,

581
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,760
I want him to marry me.

582
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,959
The child is just joking,

583
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:38,080
don't believe it...

584
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,280
You must agree to marry Shan Shan today.

585
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,679
Yes, little boss.

586
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,600
After today, I even have to call you brother-in-law.

587
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,439
What, what brother-in-law?

588
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:53,679
Are you insane?

589
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,600
You refuse?

590
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:56,719
Then, don't blame us for being using force.

591
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:59,840
What are you doing?

592
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:01,800
Do you all even know the law?

593
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,439
What are you doing?

594
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,679
Jiao Yang is mine,

595
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,800
you can't force him to marry someone else.

596
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,399
Where did this little kid come from? Move aside.

597
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,280
Who, who are you calling a little kid?

598
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:10,719
Who are you calling a little kid?

599
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,199
Move, don't dare me to hit you.

600
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:12,879
Stop, stop Chef Liu.

601
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:13,560
Jiao Yang is mine.

602
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,399
Don't stop me.

603
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:16,239
Assistant Lin.

604
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,520
Lin Miao, are you okay?

605
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,479
I'm fine.

606
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:23,520
Manager Su,

607
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,840
Manager Su, are you alright?

608
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,159
Take it slow.

609
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,199
I'm fine.

610
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,159
You're so irresponsible,

611
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,320
what kind of man are you?

612
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,280
Besides,

613
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,360
why should we hand over Yue Rong Villa

614
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,760
to someone who's not responsible at all?

615
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,560
You were the ones slandering people, you still...

616
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,879
That's enough, Yan.

617
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:39,760
Stop the nonsense.

618
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,080
Let me tell you,

619
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,800
don't bother wasting time anymore,

620
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,959
it's impossible for me to marry Shan Shan.

621
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,639
I already have a fiancé,

622
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,760
it's her.

623
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,080
What?

624
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:02,040
What?

625
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,719
What nonsense are you talking about?

626
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,479
I'm not interested in taking the blame with you.

627
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:14,320
Don't ask for more than you can bite,

628
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,800
I'm not even complaining,

629
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
what are you grumbling about?

630
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,879
Assistant Lin,

631
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,159
up to this point,

632
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,399
let's not keep it a secret anymore.

633
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:22,239
Tell them,

634
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:23,280
save the situation and save the people.

635
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,959
Stop lying to us,

636
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,439
everyone here knows that

637
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,520
she's only your assistant.

638
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,199
Yeah, right.

639
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,840
Miss Lin has such good taste,

640
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,000
such good quality,

641
00:36:36,087 --> 00:36:37,367
how could she ever like you?

642
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:38,239
You don't believe me?

643
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,399
Then ask her.

644
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,280
That's right, I'm President Jiao's fiancé.

645
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,520
I'll prove it to you all.

00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:47,159
It shouldn't be embarrassing, right?

679
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,280
How is this possible?

680
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,600
Every girl who encounters that situation

681
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,959
must be very delighted,

682
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,360
especially girls like you.

683
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,399
I'm talking about you,

684
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,320
Lin Miao.

685
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,639
You took the advantage.

686
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,239
You took the advantage.

687
00:39:09,919 --> 00:39:11,199
You took the advantage.

688
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:18,199
What's that noise?

689
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:35,479
Lin Miao, what are you thinking?

690
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,679
Is your mind not clear?

691
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:43,280
Once was enough,

692
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,840
but I was kissed twice.

693
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:54,399
All of it is not real.

694
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,479
You have to calm down,

695
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,280
they're not real.

696
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,520
Who is it?

697
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,479
Director Zhao,

698
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:09,280
it's so late already. What's the matter?

699
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,840
Don't pretend to be a good person here.

700
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:16,959
Let me tell you,

701
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:19,479
I would never give Jiao Yang to you.

702
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,040
To marry Jiao Yang,

703
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,639
that's my dream since I was a child.

704
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,639
I followed him all the way from the company

705
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:26,560
is to be by his side.

706
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,679
Although I don't know what kind of tricks you used

707
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:33,719
to get to him first,

708
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,520
I believe

709
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,879
that I would never let you two be together.

710
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,000
Director Zhao,

711
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,679
if I tell you that all these

712
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:48,120
are just to prevent President Jiao
from being forced into a marriage,

713
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,479
do you believe it?

714
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:54,199
Then, how come you both said
those things at the lobby just now...

715
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,560
They were all made up,

716
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,639
none of it was real.

717
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,760
Really?

718
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,879
Really, you didn't lie to me?

719
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,439
No.

720
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,479
Confirm?

721
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,760
Definitely.

722
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,679
Then,

723
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,959
if that's the case,

724
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:18,840
I,

725
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,360
I will confess to Jiao Yang about my feelings.

726
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,040
Back then, Jiao Yang and I had a beautiful

727
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:31,280
time at Yue Rong Villa.

728
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:34,760
At that time, Jiao Yang's mother was also here.

729
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,479
Thinking of it now,

730
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,159
Yue Rong Villa

731
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:41,520
was the place we made our love promise.

732
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,439
This time, besides developing the villa,

733
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,399
I want to make him mine.

734
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:54,000
Oh.

735
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,199
If he's with me then,

736
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:58,600
you can't get near to Jiao Yang anymore.

737
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,760
