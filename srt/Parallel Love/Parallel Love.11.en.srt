For the demolition of Yue Rong Villa,

It's obviously video manipulation!

That's not the truth, right?

This morning,

48
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,080
after the news of althaea
being found around Yue Rong Villa

49
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,199
has been exposed,

50
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,320
the animal and plant conservation association

51
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,559
and many conservation volunteers

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,000
have surrounded the company,

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,520
saying that Hong Yu is an unscrupulous developer

54
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,000
that uses plants and animals for profits,

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,160
and requesting the government

56
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,080
to stop the development of Yue Rong Villa.

57
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,000
That's weird.

58
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:55,039
Something's not right
about the last incident of cat hair.

59
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:57,600
How could there be a sudden spam attack?

60
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,440
It's the same this time.

61
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,479
Why is it that every time Jiao Yang

62
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,600
achieved something,
something goes wrong?

63
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,919
Could it be that someone is sabotaging?

64
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,399
Actually, in response to this incident,

65
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,880
the first thing we have to do

66
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,880
is to reassure the volunteers,

67
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,639
control the media,
stop the news from spreading,

68
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,080
and avoid it from getting worse.

69
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,440
In this way,

70
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,320
we can at least buy some time.

71
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,839
Someone's definitely playing tricks.

72
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,559
How could the villa's security footage

73
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,119
even be leaked?

Could it be that people from the villa
betrayed President Jiao?

78
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,520
I don't think it's the people from the villa.

79
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,880
Think about it. If the people from the villa

80
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,199
are trying to harm President Jiao,

81
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,639
they could just disagree with the development

82
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,679
at the beginning.

83
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,119
Why even bother going through all these?

it's not the people from the villa...

consider whether you can handle it!

Manager Su never showed up.

99
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,880
But it was President Jiao
who asked Manager Su to remain in the villa

100
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,480
to organize the application form
for the protection village

have any concrete evidence,

106
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,839
it's better not to doubt Manager Su.

Jiao Yang, where have you been?

170
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,600
I have been looking all over for you. I am worried.

171
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:07,920
Assistant Lin just made

172
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,359
a very good suggestion.

173
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,519
From now on,

174
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,480
everyone has to listen to
Assistant Lin's instructions.

175
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,119
I'm going to show those who are up to no good

176
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,920
what our president office is capable of.

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,239
Listen to Assistant Lin's instructions?
Then what are you doing, Jiao Yang?

178
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,760
I...

179
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:24,000
obviously have other things to do.

180
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,920
Jiang Rou, your intel is more reliable.

181
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,799
You and Ding Ding

182
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:32,159
will be in charge of monitoring
public opinions on the Internet.

183
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:33,039
Ying Jun, Xin,

184
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,400
you two will be in charge of contacting the villa,

185
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,200
and getting the real security footage,

186
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,479
so that it can be used
as evidence for future clarification.

187
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,440
Director Zhao,

188
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,520
you have a wider connection.

189
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,239
So the name list for the donation,

190
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,239
I'll leave it to you.

191
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,039
Manager Su, you are more experienced.

192
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,440
You will take charge of communicating
with the donation platform.

193
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,320
Alright.

194
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,119
As for me, before we get off work,

195
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,080
I will have the donation proposal
ready for everyone.

196
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,320
If there's no problem,

197
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,760
we should get a move on.

198
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,599
Wait.

199
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,479
I have some questions.

200
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,239
Something as big as the donation platform，

201
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,760
how can we leave it to an outsider?

202
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,799
I'm worried.

203
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,119
Director Zhao is right.

204
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,679
The platform is very vital,

205
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,599
I certainly can't handle it by myself.

206
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,880
Assistant Lin,

207
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,719
how about this,

208
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,479
Director Zhao will be in charge of the platform.

209
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,000
As for me, I will assist

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,599
Director Zhao.

211
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,239
Then let me reassign it.

212
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:35,760
So Director Zhao, you will be in charge of

213
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
communicating with the donation platform?

214
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,479
Manager Su,

215
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,119
you can help with the name list for the donation.

216
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,000
Alright.

217
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,960
This matter

218
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,599
is extremely important
for both President Jiao and Hong Yu.

219
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:50,039
I hope everyone can pay much attention to it.

220
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:51,559
When this is over,

221
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,880
I'll treat you all to a nice meal, alright?

222
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,919
Alright!

223
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,200
Keep it up!

224
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,039
So does she like me or not?

225
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,400
If she likes me,

226
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,919
why did she reject me?

227
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:17,559
If she doesn't,

228
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,599
but she's so upset about my problems.

229
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,039
If she likes me,

230
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,320
but this woman kissed me,

231
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,039
and still said that it was just business.

232
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,440
If she doesn't,

233
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:40,799
why did she look for me in the mountain with tears?

234
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,119
She likes me. She doesn't like me,

235
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,520
She likes me. She doesn't like me...

236
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,479
she doesn't like me.

237
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,280
she likes me...

238
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,640
Come in.

239
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,640
It's still 'she doesn't like me'...

240
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,599
President Jiao,

241
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,520
So this is

242
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,440
the other important thing you said?

243
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,200
Is it trendy to count leaves these days?

244
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,200
As the saying goes, to see a world in a wild flower

245
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,359
and a bodhi in a leaf.

246
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,520
It may seem like I'm counting leaves,

247
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:35,000
but I'm actually reading into

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,359
the philosophies of life in this big world.

249
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,840
Forget it. You don't know Buddhism,
you wouldn't get it.

250
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,840
Why don't you just tell me what's the matter?

251
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,320
The board of directors responded,

252
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,599
saying that they will not
fund our donation campaign.

253
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:52,359
Also, within such a short time,

254
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:53,760
to raise such a huge amount of money

255
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
is a bit difficult.

256
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,039
So...

257
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,239
That's it?

258
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,520
I thought it was a bigger deal.

259
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:07,440
Don't worry.

260
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,599
Money is never a problem.

261
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,880
I'll take care of it.

262
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,799
Cheng Jun,

263
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,159
you've been in Hong Yu for a long time.

264
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,520
You are indeed a very talented man.

265
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,400
Compared with your peers,

266
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,719
you are more down-to-earth

267
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,479
and you have more of a sense of calmness.

268
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:28,679
You have the potential to become a leader.

269
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,599
Thank you.

270
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,799
But having potential

271
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,840
doesn't mean that you can become

272
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,159
a true leader.

273
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,080
What kind of person you are,

274
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,239
I see it very clearly.

275
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,039
When Jiao Yang and Lin Miao

276
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,000
were planning the rooftop wedding,

277
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,159
you knew there was a clash of venues,

278
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,000
Instead of informing Jiao Yang in advance,

279
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,840
you went behind his back
and contacted another hotel.

280
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,119
You were trying to take advantage
of the situation, weren't you?

281
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,520
Making Jiao Yang take the initiative to request me

282
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,719
to allow you to go to the villa,

283
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,679
was also what you had planned for a long time.

284
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,200
And this time,

285
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:14,719
Lin Miao came to me

286
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:15,559
with the rebuilding plan for the villa.

287
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:19,119
Although I was pressured by the board to agree,

288
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,320
I never would have guessed that

289
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,840
Yue Rong Villa was your mother's legacy,

290
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:31,000
but you're the one who proposed
to tear it down and rebuild it.

291
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,919
Can you live up to your mother's hard work?

292
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,320
I didn't do anything unjust to my mother.

293
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,440
Alright.

294
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,159
Since we are mentioning your mother,

295
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,080
for her sake,

296
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:52,000
I can drop the whole thing,

297
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,159
but you have to leave Hong Yu!

298
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,719
If not,

299
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,239
I'll get to the bottom of all these.

300
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,840
I heard that President Jiao and the others

301
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,359
wanted to restore Hong Yu's reputation
by donating to charity.

302
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,840
What if,

303
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,520
it was like the last time,

304
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,000
they can resolve the issue...

305
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,039
So what if they do?

306
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,400
Jiao Yang is too naive.

307
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,520
He only knows how to rob Peter to pay Paul.

308
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,960
filling in one hole after another.

309
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,080
He thought that by calming the public's opinion,

310
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,599
the board would spare him.

311
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,640
Childish!

312
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,400
Beloved.

313
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,559
From now on, you have to maintain it properly.

314
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,320
Don't ever scratch it,

315
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,919
bump it or dent it.

316
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:03,400
Maybe I'll be able to reconnect with it someday.

317
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,679
Don't worry. I'll take good care of my car.

318
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,520
I've been discussing it with you for so long,

319
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,679
and you don't even let me touch it.

320
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,200
Why are you willing to let go this time?

321
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,840
That's none of your business!

322
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,840
Hurry up and pay before I regret it.

323
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,520
Alright.

324
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,440
But with the car sold,

325
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,640
how will you get to or off work?

326
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,039
Why are you being such a nuisance?

327
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:25,960
How much is that?

328
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,159
You're home.

329
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,599
Why are you dressed like that?

330
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,840
Mo...You rode a motorcycle?

331
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,840
It's quite nice riding a motorcycle!

332
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,159
Not boring, not stuck in traffic,

333
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,840
cooler and more stylish.

334
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,200
You didn't sell your car, did you?

335
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,640
How did you know?

336
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,440
You really sold your car?

337
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,559
It's just a car. It doesn't matter if I sold it.

338
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,760
Besides, this is the first time Assistant Lin

339
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,039
has asked me for help because of work.

340
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:13,039
how can I just stand there and do nothing?

341
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:14,520
But that was

342
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,239
your 24-year-old birthday present.

343
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:17,039
How could you...

344
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,880
Out with the old, in with the new!

345
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,479
Besides, I'm tired of driving that crappy car.

346
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,200
Look at me now,

347
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:25,599
dressing this outfit,

348
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,320
and riding a motorcycle.

349
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,000
I think it's quite nice.

350
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,200
Have you fallen under my spell again?

351
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,919
At this point,

352
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,599
you still have the mood for jokes?

353
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,960
Aren't you fully in charge of the donation?

354
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:47,679
But that's indeed not enough.

355
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,880
That is not enough?

356
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,719
So what's to be done?

357
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,599
The organization of public welfare is,

358
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,200
at best, a way to allay
the public's environmental concerns.

359
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,640
But then the focus

360
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,239
is on how to give the board an answer.

361
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,719
You know what?

362
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,359
The value of althaea is actually worth much more.

363
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,000
As far as I can verify,

364
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,439
there are already
research teams working on

365
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,599
the industrialization of artificial
cultivation of althaea.

366
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,400
If we can get ahead of the curve,

367
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:22,839
we can carve out a large
portion of the market in the future.

368
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,800
Exactly.

369
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:24,880
With this,

370
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,079
not only will it solve
the earnings problem of Yue Rong,

371
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,319
but also stop the board's blabbering mouth.

372
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,719
Once we realize artificial cultivation,

373
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:35,640
the world will be amazed by the beauty of althaea.

374
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:39,640
Daddy,

375
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
does althaea really exist?

376
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,920
Jun,

377
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,040
althaea is the most beautiful flower in the world.

378
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,000
One day, daddy will find it

379
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:51,680
and let the world be awed by its beauty.

380
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:54,880
Althaea is not only an ornamental plant,

381
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,239
but its usage is also actually very versatile.

382
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,239
Jiao Yang, do you know

383
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,119
the usage of althaea is very versatile?

384
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,920
Now the hard-to-find althaea

385
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,719
can not only be artificially cultivated,

386
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,599
but in the future, it can also be worth up to

387
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,439
tens of thousands of yuan per shoot.

388
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,599
Tens of thousands of yuan per shoot?

389
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,439
I believe the future of althaea in the early stage

390
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,719
is very promising,

391
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:25,160
but isn't that price a bit much?

392
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,239
I'm telling you, not at all!

393
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,239
Althaea is not only of high ornamental value,

394
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:31,800
but it is also highly utilized

395
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,319
in the medical and aesthetic fields.

396
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,239
If we can

397
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,640
form it into a complete industrial chain,

398
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,560
the prospect of it is very promising.

399
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:48,280
How do you know so much about althaea?

400
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,000
Through reading!

401
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,199
There is a book dedicated to predicting

402
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:57,520
what the next decade holds for althaea.

403
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,319
Is there such a book?

404
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,719
Yes! Of course, there is!

405
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,719
President Jiao,

406
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,839
you should read less Chicken Soup for the Soul

407
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,239
and more useful books.

408
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,439
It's late.

409
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,079
I should take a shower and go to bed.

410
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,199
You should get some rest, too.

411
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,079
Tell me,

412
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,000
why did you reject me?

413
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,199
Because I'm from the future.

414
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,800
I'm telling you,

415
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,520
in our place, it's already 2020.

416
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,239
And I am already thirty-three years old.

417
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,119
Lin Miao,

418
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,040
are you really from the future?

419
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:57,640
How do you know so much about althaea?

420
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:00,599
There is a book dedicated to predicting

421
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,000
what the next decade holds for althaea.

422
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,280
Do you still remember

423
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,839
the people who attacked you online?

424
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,400
Those are called spammers.

425
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,280
It's a popular tactic in our place.

426
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,520
You wouldn't get it.

427
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,319
President Jiao.

428
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,400
President Jiao!

429
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:20,000
What is it?

430
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,319
The board approved of

431
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,839
our proposal for the charity donation

432
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,000
and said if things work out,

433
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,839
we're allowed to

434
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,719
proceed with the project of Yue Rong Villa.

435
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,640
But if it doesn't work out...

436
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,719
I'll take the blame and resign.

437
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,560
You don't have to worry too much.

438
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,920
Since the board has conceded,

439
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,599
that means there is still
a chance for things to turn around.

440
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,199
And when I came up here just now,

441
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:40,640
Assistant Lin asked me to tell you...

442
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,439
What did she say?

443
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,640
She said,

444
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,520
We'll be working overtime tonight

445
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,000
to get through this with you.

446
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,640

447
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,560

450
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,319
do you think if there is a possibility

451
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,599
that someone around you

452
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,839
is not from this world?

453
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,479
Then from which world?

454
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,319
You can go back to work.

00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:50,000
so I'm not quite sure.

468
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:51,359
Another work task?

469
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,319
What task is that?

470
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,040

00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:18,400
so I wanted to look for you at the office,

505
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,719
but you did say that
you didn't like me going there,

506
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:21,839
so I've been here waiting for you.

507
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,439
I've been waiting since afternoon,

508
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:25,319
but I never thought it would rain
while I was waiting,

509
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,680
so I went to buy an umbrella for you.

510
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:27,920
Good thing I waited for you,

511
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,280
otherwise, you'd have to go home in the rain,

512
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,800
right?

513
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,439
I'm fine.

514
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,239
By the way,

515
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,920
I made a lot of your favorite food.

516
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,719
Spare ribs, potatoes,

517
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:38,280
braised baby back ribs,
salt and pepper baby back ribs,

518
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,040
goji berry spare ribs soup,

519
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,160
-butter baked potatoes...
-All right, all right!

520
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,479
Do you want to come over
to my place for dinner together?

521
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,640
Okay.

522
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:48,199
But Jun,

523
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,439
You'd better not come to the office to see me.

524
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,280
Is there something

525
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,880
you've been hiding from me lately?

526
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,719
Why would I?

527
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:05,640
I've just been busy lately.

528
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:09,520
Then you have to promise me that

529
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,280
you won't reject my calls,

530
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,319
my texts,

531
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:16,119
or my QQ messages in the future.

532
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,079
Alright, got it.

533
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:18,959
Let's go.

534
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,880
Is that your colleague?

535
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,599
Should I buy an umbrella for him?

536
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,000
No need, his assistant is picking him up.

537
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:39,719
It seems that today is destined
to continue working overtime.

538
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,880
A girlfriend is way more reliable.

539
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,760
A female assistant or what

540
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,839
should get a pay cut.

541
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,920
Is that so, President Jiao?

542
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:50,479
What are you doing here?

543
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,119
I was just afraid you'd cut my salary,

544
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,119
so I rushed over to suck up to you.

545
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:56,479
Fine,

546
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:58,359
let's go.

547
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,439
-Let's go!
-Go!

548
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:14,760
Lin Miao!

549
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,319
have you noticed a pattern?

550
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,079
What's that?

551
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,040
Two people with two umbrellas

552
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,640
is a very wasteful thing to do.

553
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,359
I think it's only a waste

554
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,199
if two people have two umbrellas
but they only use one.

555
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:41,719
I'll hold it for you.

556
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,359
Then President Jiao will have to
hold the umbrella for a good while

557
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,520
before his little assistant,
me, can get home.

558
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,839
Hold the umbrella for a good lifetime?

559
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,079
Are your ears deaf?

560
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,439
You managed to hear a good while
into a good lifetime.

561
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,680
A lifetime?

562
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,479
President Jiao,

563
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,959
I'm your assistant.

564
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:12,000
It's my duty to bring you an umbrella.

565
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,239
Please stop saying these obscure statements.

566
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:22,920
By the way,

567
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,760
Xin said you even assigned him a task.

568
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,560
There are only two days and two hours left

569
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,359
until the deadline set by the board.

570
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,760
At this hour,

571
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,920
how can there be time for other arrangements?

572
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,079
It's only because there are some obscure people

573
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:41,239
who love to talk about some obscure principles

574
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,000
and waste the clear intentions of others.

575
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,719
Now,

576
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:49,400
you're saying some obscure statements.

577
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,880
No matter how obscure I am,
I'm not as obscure as you are!

578
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:54,119
Do you want to share an umbrella with me?

579
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,479
No, I don't. Haven't I brought an umbrella for you?

580
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,520
Alright.

581
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,079
I'm telling you, Lin Miao,

582
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,640
from now on, unless I say so,

583
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,239
you're not allowed to court me.

584
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:14,199
President Jiao,

585
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,680
your suit is haute couture and it can't get wet.

586
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,680
You're to blame if it's ruined!

587
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,359
I...

588
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,599
Is there such a thing as a life?

589
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:55,608
[Please respect yourself!]

590
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:59,199
Cheapskate!

591
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,000
[Lin Miao]

592
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,319
Cheng Jun,

593
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:28,520
I made a sandwich.

594
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,479
Want to have a bite?

595
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,520
I'm not eating.

596
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,040
There's something important
at the company today.

597
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,479
I...

598
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Why don't I pack one for you?

599
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,239
You can have it at the office.

600
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,880
It's okay, I'm running late, I'm heading out now.

601
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,920
No, you can bring it with you and...

602
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:45,400
eat it after work.

603
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,680
Report, President Jiao!

604
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,400
The controversy on the Internet
is all under control!

605
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,160
Report, President Jiao!

606
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,079
The unedited video has arrived!

607
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:51,719
Report, President Jiao!

608
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:53,479
The donors that Director Zhao
contacted the past two days

609
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:54,760
are also willing to help!

610
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,520
Well done.

611
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:58,920
Now we just need to screen the donation platform

612
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,319
and we're considered
ahead of schedule in finishing our work.

613
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,439
President Jiao, on the choice of platform,

614
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,520
I think I need help from Assistant Lin.

615
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,199
You need Lin Miao?

616
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,880
Didn't you say yesterday that
the screening of the platform

617
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,319
was almost complete?

618
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,400
It's that Director Zhao

619
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,479
is not satisfied with
the detail of the information

620
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,599
I've provided so far.

621
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,719
She said to have Assistant Lin and me

622
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,280
collaborate to get this done.

623
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:28,839
Fine, then I'll give you...

624
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,160
two hours.

625
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:32,839
Within two hours,

626
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,439
make sure all the tasks are completed.

627
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,160
Alright, President Jiao. Thank you.

628
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,959
If there's nothing else, you can go ahead.

629
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,880
Alright, President Jiao.

630
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,399
[Lin Wei Jun's data]

631
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,479
President Jiao,

632
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:52,359
here's the information on
the person you asked me to investigate.

633
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,439
Lin Wei Jun, twenty-three years old,

634
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:55,479
an orphan.

635
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,920
She grew up in a welfare house
after the death of her parents.

636
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,280
Close with a granny named Chen Rui Fang there.

637
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,119
She's so miserable.

638
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,800
Her biography, education,
place of origin, and other information

639
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,160
are all compiled here.

640
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,880
Because of the short time,

641
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,040
so...

642
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:14,400
there are only these two photos from the orphanage.

643
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,040
That's the last copy of the investigation.

644
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:23,880
Xin,

645
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,479
tell me,

646
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,119
for you,

647
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,479
what do you think about

648
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:32,920
this parallel time and time traveling?

649
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,239
I know the question is quite tripping.

650
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:37,680
I mean what if.

651
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,719
What if

652
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:40,239
someone around you

653
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,239
might not be from this world,

654
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,599
how do you feel about that?

655
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,280
After sampling a large number of
movies and TV shows,

656
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,719
time traveling usually intends

657
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:57,640
to spark an earth-shattering romance.

658
00:31:58,199 --> 00:31:59,280
You see, President Jiao,

659
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,160
in the year 2003,

660
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,479
the TV drams Love Across Time,

661
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:05,319
told the story of a heroine
who traveled to the Ming Dynasty

662
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:07,040
which resulted in an amazing love affair

663
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,920
with Zhu Yun Wen, the eldest grandson of
the emperor at that time.

664
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,959
Right, right, right!

665
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:12,160
And in the year 2001, TVB's

666
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,479
A Step into the Past was again the story of

667
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:15,520
Xiang Shao Long, played by Koo Tin Lok,

668
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,160
who had an emotional entanglement

669
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,959

Where's Lin Miao?

679
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:46,599
President Jiao,

680

what a hundred percent love is.

686
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,920
What are you talking about, President Jiao?

687
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,520
Nothing.

She's probably just not satisfied with me.

694
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,319
Actually, the incident at the villa,

695
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,400
was just an accident.

696
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,119
You don't need to take it too personally.

it's not difficult if I want to
check a piece of document.

719

Su Cheng Jun colluded with
other people behind your back,

720
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,879
and you, as the leader,
were wrong with your judgment of people,

721
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:02,800
and still you want to shield him now.

722
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,199

723
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:06,000
I believe Manager Su.

724
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,919
He must have been framed.

725
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,000
You believe him?

726
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:11,040
Why would you believe him?

727
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,280
Because he's trying everything he can to help me!

728
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,479
Absolutely foolish!

I'm telling you, Su Cheng Jun must be fired!

The worst part is that
the chairman already found out.

00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,879
He was just given a lecture,

737
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:38,479
probably he would get fired.

It was said that Manager Su
came out from the chairman's office

741
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,320
and went to the rooftop.

742
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:50,399
He's not trying to kill himself, is he?

743
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,800

invited me to join his team,

With my identity,

759
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,479
people would inevitably suspect

00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,239
that I had ulterior motives.

I think it just a misunderstanding this time.

764
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,520
When it's over,

765
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:21,040
the chairman will change his mind about you.

766
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,399
