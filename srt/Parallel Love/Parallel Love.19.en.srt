[Episode 19]

33
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:02,360
President Jiao,

34
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,400
I have confirmed the venue of the rooftop.

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,480
Coincidentally, the hotel is renovating

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,199
for the rooftop wedding proposal.

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,960
Within the next week,

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,919
no one has made a reservation.

39
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,000
Today's renovation is over.

40
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,559
After the workers move the machines,

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,440
we can reopen it for the public tomorrow.

42
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,479
By the way, President Jiao,

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,119
why did you and Director Zhao

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,119
suddenly want to check the rooftop?

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,440
Assistant Lin, why are you here?

46
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,160
Now, Assistant Lin

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,559
is our engagement ceremony planner.

48
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,759
She came to investigate the venue with us.

49
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:44,800
Let's go.

50
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,720
Engagement?

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,160
Didn't you say you didn't accept it?

52
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,720
Assistant Lin, what is it going on?

53
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,960
Chairman Cao,

54
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:08,240
regarding the project we talked about,

55
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,839
would you be interested in a meeting?

56
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,559
Of course, I'm interested!

57
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,199
Director Su can decide on the location.

58
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,160
How about your company's Leisure Hotel?

59
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,880
I happen to be nearby for some work.

60
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:21,960
Director Su, aren't you
afraid of bumping into the host?

61
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,600
Wouldn't that be a good way

62
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,679
for Chairman Cao to compare

63
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,199
who's better or worse?

64
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:29,639
How bold of you!

65
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,520
Okay, Leisure Hotel it is.

66
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,160
About the proposal just now,

67
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,039
how's Chairman Qin considering?

68
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,399
I never thought Chairman Cao
would make such a big move

69
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,919
once returning to the country.

70
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,039
I have no choice.

71
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,639
Although Hong Yu wasn't founded by me,

72
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,160
I've spent

73
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,800
a lot of effort on it.

74
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,720
Initially, if the ship was sailing steadily,

75
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,119
I wouldn't have had a problem
with whoever the captain was,

76
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,080
but the chairman
insisted on handing over the ship

77
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,720
to a rookie who has never guided before.

78
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:08,600
I'm only doing this to prevent,

79
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,080
in case the ship turns over,

80
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,240
we all won't suffer along with it.

81
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,720
What about Chairman Li?

82
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,519
Chairman Qin thinks that

83
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,000
I would still have come to see you

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,480
if I couldn't even convince Li Dong Qiang?

85
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,200
Chairman Li has helped me a lot over the years,

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,959
since it's Chairman Li's wish,

87
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:29,760
I would naturally give him my full support.

88
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,440
I didn't expect that

89
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,079
Chairman Cao and Chairman Li
don't seem to get along on the surface,

90
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:36,839
but you have such a good personal friendship.

91
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,799
I don't have any personal
friendship with Li Dong Qiang.

92
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,399
Choosing me

93
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
is the best business decision he's ever made

94
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,320
with the brain that's been
muddled for half of his lifetime.

95
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,239
Come.

96
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,600
Let's hope that Chairman Cao

97
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,640
won't let our choice down.

98
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,160
Don't worry, Director Qin.

99
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,839
I, Cao Hua, however bad I might be,

100
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,920
am far more reliable than a rookie.

101
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,079
This one is too big, too small,

102
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:04,760
too low-key,

103
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,519
this one is too high-profile,

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,839
too ill-matched.

105
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,880
Miss Zhao,

106
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,440
this is the last batch of diamond rings
I've been able to get

107
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,239
through my 20 years of connections.

108
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,399
Are you sure
there's not a single one you like?

109
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,839
Jiao Yang,

110
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,679
I find Assistant Lin usually has good taste,

111
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,399
why don't you ask her to help me choose?

112
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:34,279
Then let's trouble
Assistant Lin to help you pick one out.

113
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,239
This diamond ring is called Sirius,

114
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,600
which means the brightest star in the sky

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,760
and it matches
Director Zhao's age and temperament.

116
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,399
As for its matching ring, it's called Sun,

117
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,720
which matches President Jiao's name.

118
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
These two rings mean

119
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,200
the two brightest stars in the sky,

120
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,119
dazzling and irreplaceable,

121
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,480
they are the only choice for each other.

122
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,239
Excellent!

123
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,799
She is truly our gold planner of Soulmate!

124
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,920
Miss Zhao, how about this pair?

125
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,440
Assistant Lin really is very knowledgeable.

126
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,799
Then what is the meaning of the pair next to it?

127
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,920
I'm not quite sure.

128
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,440
You know the hard one, but not the easy one.

129
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,119
Let me do it.

130
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,640
The ring is called Orion,

131
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,279
and its matching ring is called Artemis,

132
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,040
which means Orion

133
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,200
and the Goddess of the Moon in Greek mythology.

134
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,079
It is often interpreted as

135
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,920
lovers who have traveled through time and space

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,119
to be together forever.

137
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,880
Extremely auspicious!

138
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,320
Nothing less than that pair.

139
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
Miss Zhao, which one do you prefer?

140
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,640
Let's take this pair!

141
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,480
Assistant Lin,

142
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,239
you won't mind if I seize the loved, right?

143
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,239
Director Zhao is such a joker.

144
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,720
What's there to seize from.

145
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,359
As long as you like it.

146
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Planner Lin is indeed
knowledgeable and professional.

147
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,920
Xin, is the rooftop ready?

148
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,040
Let's go and see.

149
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,600
We shouldn't waste Planner Lin's
professionalism and dedication.

150
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,640
Jiao Yang, wait for me.

151
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,000
It's such a coincidence
to run into President Jiao here.

152
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,720
Chairman Cao, I haven't seen
President Jiao for a long time

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,239
and need to catch up with him.

154
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,320
Why don't you take a break in the private suite?

155
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:12,279
Okay.

156
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,239
Jiao Yang, I'll see you later.

157
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,079
Su Cheng Jun,

158
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:24,519
why are you here with Chairman Cao?

159
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,720
What President Jiao said is very interesting.

160
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,200
Can't I enter the door of Leisure?

161
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,480
Or I can't meet Chairman Cao?

162
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,039
But there's no harm in telling President Jiao.

163
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:36,599
I heard that Chairman Cao

164
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,440
brought back a new scientific research
technology from the United States,

165
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,760
so I came here on behalf of Zhong Qing,
looking for a cooperation opportunity.

166
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
I don't care what new ideas you are having,

167
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,119
but stay away from Hong Yu.

168
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,159
President Jiao, although Chairman Cao
is a shareholder of Hong Yu,

169
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
this technology

170
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,799
is invested by her under her own account.

171
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,719
The market is changing rapidly right now.

172
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,039
Chairman Cao's lab is
throwing money away every day.

173
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,159
If Hong Yu is not interested in developing it,

174
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,400
stopping others from doing so

175
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,559
is a bit inelegant, isn't it?

176
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:11,000
Su Cheng Jun, did I hear that right?

177
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
A man like you

178
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:14,400
doesn't even have the decency
to mention the word elegant.

179
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,359
Director Zhao,

180
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:20,119
you and President Jiao are getting engaged,

181
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,599
but you're in such a hurry
to make a name for yourself,

182
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,719
you're a bit too eager
to get married, aren't you!

183
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,280
President Jiao is so lucky!

184
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:31,919
Assistant Lin on the left

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,320
and Director Zhao on the right,

186
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,840
For you, they both treat me,

187
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,280
Su Cheng Jun, as a crook,

188
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,840
lash out at me harshly.

189
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,080
With such two good women,

190
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,760
I wonder which one President Jiao loves more?

191
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,479
However, it doesn't matter which one you love,

192
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:57,200
after all, the Jiao family chose their
daughter-in-law not for the person,

193
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,840
but for the shares that she has.

194
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,400
I...

195
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,320
Isn't that right, Director Zhao?

196
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,440
Su Cheng Jun, you've been jealous of
Jiao Yang since you were a child,

197
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,000
but unexpectedly, even when you grew up,

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,520
you still haven't changed this habit.

199
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,280
Behind me, Zhao Yan,

200
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,799
is the share of the Zhao family.

201
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,000
It's my birthright,

202
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,320
and it's also my capital
to be on equal footing with Jiao Yang.

203
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,440
Isn't that all you wanted to get out of

204
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,919
by ingratiating yourself with me,
and racking your brains in scheming?

205
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,919
It is a pity that no matter how hard you try,

206
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,200
you will not be able to cross this barrier,

207
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,599
because it is only through sheer virtue
that you will be able to make it.

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,840
People like you only
deserve to live in the gutter.

209
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,719
Director Zhao's ability to deceive oneself,

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,679
I am ashamed of being not as good as you.

211
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,840
Every scene in Yue Rong Villa,

212
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,359
you and I were both there to witness it.

213
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:49,719
Director Zhao actually managed to forget
all about it in the blink of an eye.

214
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,000
As expected of someone who will be the
Jiao family's future daughter-in-law,

215
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:55,719
you indeed have the style of the rightful wife.

216
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:59,119
Su Cheng Jun,

217
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,640
watch your words,

218
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,080
don't behave atrociously here.

219
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,840
President Jiao, did I say something wrong?

220
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,400
Or are you going to say that

221
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,200
you and Director Zhao are truly in love,

222
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,239
and that you and Assistant Lin
are just playing around?

223
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:17,960
Su Cheng Jun,

224
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,359
I didn't expect that you're
not only a speculative maverick,

225
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,960
but also have the impressive ability
to manipulate right and wrong.

226
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:25,599
So according to you,

227
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,599
all the well-matched marriages in the world

228
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,520
are bound by interests?

229
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,200
Director Zhao and President Jiao grew up
together as childhood sweethearts,

230
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,640
and their engagement is natural.

231
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,320
The affection between them

232
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,400
is not something that
you can deny with just a few words.

233
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,599
As for Director Zhao,

234
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,119
whether in terms of character or capability,

235
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:42,880
it's not something that
you are qualified to evaluate.

236
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,000
As for me and President Jiao,

237
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,640
we used to be superior and subordinate,

238
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,119
but we will have no connection at all.

239
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,440
I hope you won't make an issue out of it.

240
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,280
Is that so?

241
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,880
Hearing you saying this,

242
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:59,119
I wish I really did misunderstand you.

243
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,400
No connection at all, these few words,

244
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:02,799
are the most delightful words I've heard

245
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,000
since I knew you.

246
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,200
I was really wrong to advise you in the past,

247
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,919
Su Cheng Jun.

248
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,559
Please put on your hypocritical mask,

249
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,880
because your current villainous look

250
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,239
is really disgusting!

251
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,400
It's okay, Lin Miao.

252
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:17,599
You could take me the wrong way,

253
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,039
but I'll make you change your mind about me.

254
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,919
I still have work to do today,

255
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,599
so I will stop bothering President Jiao

256
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,479
enjoying this last joy with several partners.

257
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,119
I hope that next time,

258
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,039
I'll have the chance to treat you to a meal alone.

259
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,599
Director Zhao...

260
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,440
Jiao Yang, I'm a bit tired.

261
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,440
Let's check the rooftop some other day.

262
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,159
President Jiao, you should
follow her to see what's going on.

263
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,559
Give her a moment to herself.

264
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:54,679
She doesn't want to see anyone right now.

265
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,520
Director Su troubled a lot to invite me to Leisure,

266
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,239
just to quarrel from jealousy,

267
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,919
and humiliate a young lady?

268
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,119
A mere Zhao Yan

269
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,520
wouldn't be worth my trouble.

270
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,919
I asked Chairman Cao to come to Leisure today,

271
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,599
just to show Chairman Cao,

272
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,080
between Jiao Yang and me,

273
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,919
who is really the most worthy person to work.

274
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,840
Chairman Cao, the Jiao and Zhao families

275
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,320
are now interested in uniting by marriage,

276
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,200
if you don't make a move,

277
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,679
will there still be a place for you
in Hong Yu in the future?

278
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,080
I stopped playing the game of sowing discord

279
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,200
and killing with a borrowed knife 20 years ago.

280
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,200
I thought Director Su's meeting me today

281
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,080
was to genuinely discuss the project.

282
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,559
Since this topic is not
of interest to Chairman Cao,

283
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,239
let us talk about what is of interest to you.

284
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,440
Chairman Cao, the contents of this document,

285
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:55,520
do you feel it's genuine enough?

286
00:13:59,036 --> 00:14:00,703
[New energy project collaboration proposal]

287
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,000
Congratulations, Director Su.

288
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:07,599
Your goal for today is half achieved.

289
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,640
Engagement?

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,479
Yes,

291
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,719
marry Yan.

292
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,599
But dad, I'm already with Assistant Lin,

293
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:33,039
how could I get engaged with Yan?

294
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,400
Who's there?

295
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,119
Director Zhao,

296
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:15,239
you've been sitting here for quite a while,

297
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,400
do you need me to send you home?

298
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,919
You've come to pity me, too.

299
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,400
No, that's not what I meant.

300
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:32,280
Director Zhao, I think you're very brave.

301
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,000
I think, to like someone for so many years

302
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,679
is a very brave thing to do.

303
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:42,880
No one has the right to laugh at it.

304
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,239
Even if it's an unrequited love
that will never be answered?

305
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,359
Yes!

306
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,719
Even if it's an unrequited love
that will never be answered!

307
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:59,400
Director Zhao, not everyone who loves someone else

308
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,200
has to get a response.

309
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,200
As long as the person who is loved

310
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,559
is feeling happy and joyful,

311
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,719
the person who is silently guarding behind

312
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
will also feel relieved and happy

313
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,520
from the bottom of the heart.

314
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:20,039
Are you trying to
convince me to give up Jiao Yang?

315
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:24,039
Choosing to hold on or give up,

316
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,119
is the freedom of Director Zhao.

317
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,880
but as long as you're really happy,

318
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,840
I'll support all your decisions.

319
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,960
Happy?

320
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:39,440
Xin,

321
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,960
You know what?

322
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,640
The first time I met Jiao Yang
when I returned to the country

323
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,400
was on the rooftop of Leisure.

324
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,400
The night sky that day

325
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,799
was filled with glorious fireworks.

326
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,440
Dad,

327
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,320
where is Jiao Yang?

328
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,799
Don't be rude.

329
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:02,320
Wait until the wedding is over,

330
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:04,319
your Uncle Jiao and I
will ask Jiao Yang to welcome you.

331
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,199
Now go!

332
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,160
Jiao Yang!

333
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,719
Jiao Yang! Jiao... Jiao...

334
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:17,680
Jiao... Jiao Yang!

335
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,400
His eyes were filled with
the brightest star in the night sky,

336
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,400
exactly the same as

337
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,680
when I first saw him as a child.

338
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,760
At the time I thought,

339
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,119
how nice,

340
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,680
the man I love hasn't changed a bit!

341
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,119
But just now as I recalled the images of that day,

342
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,839
the whole time,

343
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,959
he didn't even notice me.

344
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,800
Even though I was the bridesmaid,

345
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,160
standing in such an obvious spot,

346
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,119
he didn't even look at me.

347
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,880
And this time,

348
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,839
I... I just want to be capricious for once.

349
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,479
Can't I even do that?

350
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:23,920
Director Zhao...

351
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:43,479
You asked me if I'm happy?

352
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,520
Up until today,

353
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:51,400
I have been lying to myself that

354
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,920
I am happy.

355
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:57,599
I, Zhao Yan, am determined, brave,

356
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:00,439
and happily liking Jiao Yang.

357
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:04,040
Even if this liking

358
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:14,319
is used, ignored, and ridiculed,

359
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:17,479
I could care for it less.

360
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,319
I was just like protecting a crystal ball,

361
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,560
carefully protecting it.

362
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,000
But... But...

363
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,199
But this crystal ball,

364
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,599
still...

365
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,160
little

366
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,119
by little

367
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,400
by little, shattered!

368
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,400
You know what, Xin?

369
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,640
Even if it has shattered,

370
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,239
I still couldn't bear to throw it away.

371
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:11,079
I really, really like the fireworks that day.

372
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,400
That was the wedding of my dream

373
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,079
with Jiao Yang.

Since you've decided to get engaged,

382

how is it now?

389
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,199
It's still a cardiac problem.

390
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,719
Very unstable.

391
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,800
Doctor, how's my dad?

392
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,160
The patient suffered heart failure again

393
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,319
and is now being resuscitated.

394

00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,640

396
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,079
quickly sign it.

Don't worry, Jiao Yang.

400
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:26,079
The chairman has been through many
trials and tribulations in his life.

401
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:28,040
He'll get through this one.

402
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,599
The doctor said once his condition improves,

403
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,000
he can go to the US for surgery.

404
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,920
Why did his condition suddenly worsen?

405
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,359
Jiao Yang, at this point,
I'm not going to hide anything from you.

406
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,319
Did you know that since
Chairman Cao returned to the country,

407
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,880
she has been actively

408
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,280
absorbing Li Dong Qiang's shares in secret?

409
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,319
Why didn't my dad tell me?

410
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:51,920
The chairman just couldn't bear to

411
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:54,599
put you through so much pressure all at once.

412
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,040
Chairman Cao is not someone you can handle.

413
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:59,160
Did you know

414
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:00,599
how she entered the company back then?

415
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,280
Back then, your mother passed away,

416
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:05,199
the chairman was overly depressed.

417
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,239
Not only did his health suffer,

418
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,280
but the company's operations
also ran into trouble.

419
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:12,319
The financial capital behind Chairman Cao
took advantage of

420
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:14,280
the situation and became the company's
fourth-largest shareholder.

421
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,640
Since then,

422
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,680
the situation of the Board of Directors
has become increasingly complicated.

423
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,400
Many of the chairman's
decisions in the company

424
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,920
are gradually being restricted.

425
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,920
I'm afraid the trouble is serious.

426
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,400
Jiao Yang, the chairman is so sick,

427
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,439
but he's still delaying to leave the company,

428
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,920
because he's worried that

429
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,239
the situation like today will arise.

430
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,800
Don't blame him for hiding everything from you.

431
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:23,160
Lin Miao, you're actually right.

432
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,479
I've always been a farce.

433
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,119
I thought I was losing because
I didn't have any bargaining chips,

434
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,719
but actually I didn't even have
the right to be at the table.

435
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,680
In the end, I was only a joke.

436
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,839
That's not true, Jiao Yang.

437
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,000
You've tried.

438
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:52,920
Tried?

439
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,079
I can't even make you stay.

440
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,760
It's not that you can't make me stay,

441
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,119
it's that I'm not even worth it.

442
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:21,920
We can never be together.

443
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:27,920

444
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,520
I came to you?

445
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,839

It's you?

448

you're the only one who wouldn't say that to me.

495
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,839
These are the facts, believe it or not!

496
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,680
Please complete your
engagement ceremony properly.

497
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:04,880
The only thing I can do,

498
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:08,400
is to keep my promise as a wedding planner

499
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,479
for giving you and Director Zhao

500
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,920
a perfect engagement ceremony.

501
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,479
Once it's all over, I'll leave.

502
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,239
I'll never bother the two of you ever again.

503
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,599
Thank you for letting me go home.

Jiao Yang,

515
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,599
let's get engaged.

516
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:56,319
Don't worry,

517
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,079
this is not a confession,

518
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,839
it's a fulfillment.

519
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,000
Alright, I promise you.

520
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,719
Lin Miao,

521
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,640
since you want to go home so much,

522
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,599
fine, I'll send you home.

523
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,599
[Leisure Hotel]
Push harder! Come on!

524
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,719
These flowers,

525
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,599
and the floral foam and everything,
move them all in!

526
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,520
Let me look at these!

527
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,719
These are racks!

528
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,719
These are flower stands!

529
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:37,920
In there, are there any...

530
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,119
Bride-to-be,

531
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:46,280
today is your most important day.

532
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,319
Be happier.

533
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,359
Smile and I'll put some blush on you.

534
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,719
It's okay, that's enough.

535
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:53,760
Thank you,

536
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,719
You can carry on with your work.

537
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,040
Okay.

538
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,239
Xin,

539
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,640
do I look beautiful today?

540
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:07,079
Beautiful.

541
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:09,319
You look beautiful in every way.

542
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,880
Then you'll have to look closely.

543
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,520
After today,

544
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,800
it might be a while before you can see me again.

545
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:22,400
Are you going on
an engagement trip with President Jiao?

546
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,439
Xin, thank you for what you said to me yesterday.

547
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,119
Don't worry,

548
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,920
I will definitely make myself happy.

549
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:45,160
Director Zhao, you must be happy.

550
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:47,920
As long as you're happy, I'll...

551
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:54,640
I'll keep on blessing you and President Jiao.

552
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,439
Put these all in place.

553
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:04,119
I'll see what else is missing.

554
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,040
And...

555
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,719
The flowers over here, take a look,

556
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:14,839
see if there are any
missing little flowers, stick them on.

557
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,319
Planner Lin, have you seen the groom-to-be?

558
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,160
We still have to go over the procedures
of the event with him again.

559
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,400
I...

560
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,239
Mister Jiao!

561
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,680
Mister Jiao!

562
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,719
Please come over here. We still need to...

563
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,239
Oh, my god!

564
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,239
Lin Miao, it's time that the company needs you.

565
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,560
President Jiao, this is the
procedure of the banquet,

566
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,920
let me check it with you.

567
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,920
The ceremony will begin at nine thirty-eight.

568
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,719
The reception, ushers

569
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:48,000
and hosts will be in place.

570
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,760
Five minutes later, the guests
will enter and music will be performed.

571
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,199
Next, the newlyweds enter,

572
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,800
engagement rings will be exchanged,

573
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,719
and speeches will be made.

574
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,239
Finally, fireworks.

575
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:58,000
If there's no problem,

576
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,520
the general procedure will be like this.

577
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:03,520
Planner Lin is personally working on it.

578
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,800
how could anything go wrong?

579
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,959
It seems that this wedding

580
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,400
also meant a lot to Planner Lin.

581
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,199
Thank you, President Jiao.

582
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,640
All I can do is to give you and Director Zhao

583
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:23,520
a grand

584
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,079
and unforgettable engagement ceremony.

585
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,160
Unforgettable?

586
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:31,439
That's something you've already done.

587
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:55,319
Dad, not that I complaining,

588
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,520
but you're so sick,

589
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,839
why do you still insist on coming here?

590
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,880
I wouldn't take back what I promised you.

591
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,640
Your engagement is important,

592
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,199
how can I not be present?

593
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,280
Little rascal! Where's Yan?

594
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,399
Yan is doing her makeup.

595
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,760
This girl is so happy,

596
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:10,919
she's been up all night.

597
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,919
She's probably covering up her dark circles.

598
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,320
About the engagement,

599
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,399
I've asked the public relations
department to notify the media.

600
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,719
As for the hospital in the United States,

601
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,679
they have also confirmed the doctor's time.

602
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:21,320
As soon as the engagement banquet is over,

603
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,199
I'll arrange for your departure.

604
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,000
Zhao, thanks for taking the trouble.

605
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:26,959
It's nothing.

606
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,760
Jiao Yang is doing such a good job.

607
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,040
Look, just one day's work,

608
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,760
and he's done such a good job
of setting up the venue.

609
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,840
Jiao, from now on,

610
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,120
we'll truly be a family.

611
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,760
From now on, I will treat Jiao Yang

612
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,159
the way I treat Yan.

613
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,040
You can go to the United States without worries.

614
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,560
When you get well and come back,

615
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,040
we will find an auspicious day

616
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,879
to hold the wedding officially.

617
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,520
Jiao Yang,

618
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,479
I'll leave my precious daughter to you,

619
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,000
you must take good care of her.

620
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,919
Uncle Zhao, don't worry,

621
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,280
I will.

622
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,040
Hi, this way, please.

623
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,679
President Jiao.

624
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,280
President Jiao.

625
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,040
President Jiao.

626
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,439
Hi, sir. Just a moment.

627
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,719
Please check in here.

628
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,120
President Jiao.

629
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,199
Excuse me, sir.

630
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:15,919
Just a moment.

631
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:16,639
You can't come in here.

632
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,800
Sorry.

633
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,360
President Jiao, I'm sorry.

634
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,760
This guest insisted on coming in.

635
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:22,959
You can leave now.

636
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,239
What is it, Su Cheng Jun?

637
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,639
If my memory serves me right,

638
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,679
you weren't invited on the list.

639
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,000
How could I not come
to my brother's engagement?

640
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:36,600
Although President Jiao was so engrossed
in the happiness of the engagement

641
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,479
that he forgot to invite me,

642
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,479
but I, as a brother,

643
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:42,239
will still give my most sincere blessings.

644
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,639
I don't need your blessings.

645
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,040
Just leave.

646
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,000
How do you not need it?

647
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,840
I'm still waiting for one day in the future,

648
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,399
when Assistant Lin and I get engaged,

649
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,679
President Jiao will do the same for me.

650
00:35:57,399 --> 00:35:59,600
It looks like Lin Miao was right, Su Cheng Jun.

651
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,840
You really are disgusting right now.

652
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,320
Let me tell you,

653
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:06,760
don't try to get close to Lin Miao,

654
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,120
you don't deserve it.

655
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:10,719
Whether I deserve it or not,

656
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,000
it's no longer up to President Jiao to decide.

657
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:16,199
After all, from now on,

658
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:18,199
the person standing next to President Jiao

659
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,199
can only be Director Zhao.

660
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,199
Change it!

661
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,159
Miss Zhao, the ceremony is about to begin!

662
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,399
The pair! Try these on! Quickly!

663
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:37,639
This pair is too ugly. Not good looking.

664
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,360
This is the thirty-third pair you've tried on!

665
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,199
Our wedding shoes are
almost done for you to try on!

666
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,120
This pair! This pair are haute couture.

667
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:46,000
This pair won't work either. Change it!

668
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,120
Planner Lin, give me a hand!

669
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,639
You understand Miss Zhao, help her choose a pair.

670
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,520
Director Zhao...

671
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,360
This pair.

672
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:55,159
I want to wear this pair.

673
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:00,479
Miss Zhao, today is your engagement ceremony,

674
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,040
the great moment of your life.

675
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,800
How can you wear this pair?

676
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,399
I'm sure I want to wear this pair.

677
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:09,239
Assistant Lin, give me your shoes.

678
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,439
As a return,

679
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,879
you can pick anything I have.

680
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:26,719
Director Zhao, are you okay?

681
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,840
You can leave now.

682
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,520
I still have to do my make-up later.

683
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,320
Assistant Lin...

684
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,159
Close the door for me.

685
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:41,199
See you later.

686
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:43,879
Alright.

687
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,879
How's it going? Is Miss Zhao ready?

688
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,199
It's all ready.

689
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:15,000
How is it? How are you doing over here?

690
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,520
It's ready.

691
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,199
Ready?

692
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,040
Good.

693
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:20,919
Lin Miao,

694
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:26,000

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,199
and all of our past

697
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,600
will be over.

698
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,239
You really don't have anything to say to me?

699
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:48,760
No.

700
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:55,040
