[Episode 22]

33
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:03,480
Now the situation is not only related to

34
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,480
the family affairs of Jiao Yang,

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,000
but also the equity change of Hong Yu.

36
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,320
I hope everyone could understand
it's related to our equity interest,

37
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,240
and we're all in the same boat.

38
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,639
Let me introduce our new partner

39
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,839
and also one of our shareholders,

40
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:22,399
Su Cheng Jun.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,639
Su, have a seat.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,160
Su Cheng Jun, even if you're
a shareholder of the company,

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,440
you are not eligible to
sit in the position of chairman.

44
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,199
There is only one empty seat here,

45
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,440
are you asking the
directors here to give me a seat?

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,880
Or perhaps President Jiao

47
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,800
would like to give me his seat?

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,039
It's just a matter of a seat,

49
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,600
no need to argue.

50
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,479
Beyond Home and Infinite Home

51
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,639
sounds similar.

52
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,800
I doubt it.

53
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,600
What is Infinite Home?

54
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,000
Is this name on the market?

55
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,720
Instead, I suppose that Beyond Home

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,679
will be the first long-term
serviced apartment in the city.

57
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,919
Directors, if you are interested,

58
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,399
please come to my office to further

59
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:15,000
discuss the plan of Beyond Home.

60
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:42,639
He's way too arrogant.

61
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,839
Are they thinking we
are too weak to beat them?

62
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:45,720
Can't help scolding him.

63
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,240
Spit it.

64
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:47,199
It really ticks me off.

65
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,759
Don't worry, President Jiao,

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,960
Though they completed the model house,

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,119
we're almost there as well,

68
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,679
and our decoration
materials are fancier.

69
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,240
What does that mean?

70
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,720
We will always support you.

71
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,520
-Yes.
-Support.

72
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,679
Do you think I'm afraid?

73
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,440
I don't think we will lose

That's it, It's not going
to be easy, keep going.

00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,880
Assistant Lin, what's wrong with you?

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,559
President Jiao asked you to sign

82
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:36,679
the commencement approval.

83
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,640
We keep calling your
name but you didn't respond.

84
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,839
Let's go.

00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:48,200
They look good together.

86
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,519
They fight together
like a movie setting.

00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,799
Love them.

What's wrong with you?

89
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,600
Nothing, probably
haven't had enough rest.

90
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,200
You should give yourself a break.

91
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,040
Get some rest.

92
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,600
Health is more important than work.

93
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,200
How do I tell you that

94
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,959
the three-month deadline is approaching

95
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,239
and my condition is getting worse.

96
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,519
Come in.

97
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,000
Uncle Zhao.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Chairman Zhao.

99
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,600
Jiao Yang, how are things going?

100
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,040
The press release of the PR
Department has not yet been decided,

101
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,679
but I'll get it settled
as soon as possible

102
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,559
At present, in addition to dealing
with the news from the outside world,

103
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,720
what's more important is

104
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,000
how to gain a firm
foothold in the company

105
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,119
when the situation is
not favorable to your family.

106
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,959
Now that Su Cheng Jun has
teamed up with Chairman Cao,

107
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,519
you also have to promote
the Infinite Home Project

108
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,359
as soon as possible.

109
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,239
I got this, Uncle Zhao.

110
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,200
Don't worry,

111
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:53,959
I will definitely let the board
and the outside world know that

112
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,279
Infinite Home is the industry leader.

113
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,760
Alright, Jiao Yang.

114
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,160
Keep ongoing.

115
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll go first.

116
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,720
Slowly.

117
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,239
Goodbye, Chairman Zhao.

118
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,279
Why can't you sign it?

119
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,040
President Jiao, don't put me
in this awkward predicament.

120
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,399
The board thinks too much investment is needed

121
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,399
for Infinite Home Project,

122
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,920
so they don't approve it.

123
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,480
With no investment,

124
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,239
how dare our engineering department sign?

125
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,519
We've been preparing for this for so long,

126
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,600
it would help if you
could bend the rules.

127
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,519
President Jiao,

128
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,320
the current situation
has forced me to do so.

129
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,200
But I can tell you secretly

130
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,799
for your kindness to me.

131
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:38,160
Beyond Home have got the approval.

132
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,839
Looks like Chairman Cao
and Su Cheng Jun

133
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,200
are going to fight us to the end.

134
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:00,959
Su,

135
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,920
you have lived up to
your mother's expectations,

136
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,720
and you didn't let me down.

137
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,679
Not as good as you, Chairman.

138
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,880
You've been hiding
it all for so many years.

139
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,799
Now everyone in Hong Yu thinks that

140
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,799
it is Chairman Cao who
has allied with me,

141
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,040
but no one knows that

142
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:24,720
it is you behind the scheme.

143
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,119
What's this?

144
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:33,920
Shrimp fried rice.

145
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,320
My mom used to cook
for me when I was a kid.

146
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,399
It might not look good,

147
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,040
I've only learned about
50 percent similar to my moms.

148
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,440
But the key is that

149
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,519
when you're in a bad mood,

150
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,720
a diet rich in carbohydrates

151
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,440
will make you'll feel better.

152
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:49,640
Thanks.

153
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,959
Thank you for being here with me.

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,519
I'm the one who should say thank you.

155
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,640
Thank you, President Jiao

156
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,839
for giving me a chance to cook for you.

157
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,079
Try it now.

158
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,399
Did I forget to put salt?

159
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,160
Why is it so bland?

160
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,920
I've just put the soy sauce.

161
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,399
I'm sorry about that.

162
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,720
Give it to me.

163
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,720
I shall make it better.

164
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,760
-Wait a minute.
-Don't...

165
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,640
A minute.

166
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't...

167

sent to Jiao Jun Hong in a minute

and he must return to
China immediately for investigation.

320
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,920
Second option, I can wait
until he gets well and returns home,

321
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:45,560
but Assistant Lin will
have to be in charge of

335
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,839
Whatever he gives you,

336
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,439
I can give you as well.

337
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,479
Su Cheng Jun, don't you call my name.

338
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,040
I came to you simply for Jiao Yang.

339
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,400
Tell me, what do we
have to do so that you could stop.

340
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,479
Assistant Lin, you
should give up on Jiao Yang.

341
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,640
He will no longer be the president.

342
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,400
What does that mean?

343
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,520
I'm not the only one who
wants to go against Jiao's family.

344
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:02,040
Jiao Yang has become the target of all,

345
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,839
he has no way to run.

346
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,119
For you, choosing the right team

347
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,040
is the wise way to go.

348
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,040
Lin Miao, you and Hong Yu,

349
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:12,479
I'll get both.

350
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,239
Su Cheng Jun, listen,

351
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,439
you are nothing

352
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,800
to me.

353
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,719
Lin Miao.

354
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,920
Lin Miao.

355
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:39,000
Su Cheng Jun, what have you done to her?

356
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,319
The doctor said she is in poor health

357
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:50,119
and needed a full physical examination.

358
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,119
Su Cheng Jun, listen.

359
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,319
I won't let you get away easily

360
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,479
if something wrong with her.

361
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,959
Please get out and fight.

362
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,520
We're going to have a comprehensive
examination of the patient,

363
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,920
please don't disturb our work.

364
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,719
Did you hear that?

365
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,239
Get off.

366
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:09,839
Jiao Yang, I have done what I can.

367
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,160
I hope you can return my people

368
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:15,640
when Lin Miao wakes up.

369
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:32,040
Hi.

370
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:35,920
Lin Miao.

371
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,319
It's her again.

372
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,400
She came before?

373
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,319
This patient

374
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,560
had visited our hospital because of having

375
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,040
frequent loss of vision,

376
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,520
hearing and taste problems.

377
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,839
I've asked her to stay

378
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:48,760
for further checking,

379
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,560
but she discharged immediately.

380
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,479
What is it now? Fainted again?

381
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:54,719
Can you confirm her problems now?

382
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,520
We have to wait
for the patient to wake up

383
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,040
for further examination and diagnosis.

384
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,839
You can go through the
hospitalization procedure first.

385
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,800
Having hearing,
vision, and taste problems.

386
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,280
What are you doing?

387
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:41,239
Why do you buy so many things?

388
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:44,319
The doctor said that

389
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,119
you fainted because of hypoglycemia.

390
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,560
So I've bought some food
for you to replenish nutrition.

391
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,839
Right, sometimes I
experience low blood sugar

392
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:57,959
when I was too tired from work.

393
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:01,400
Let me help you.

394
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,560
It's okay, you can go and rest.

395
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,239
I can do it.

396
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,560
It's alright, go and rest.

397
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:10,359
Wait there.

398
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,520
Jiao Yang's special dish is worth waiting for.

399
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:14,280
Go ahead, go.

400
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
Go, go get some rest.

Can you understand?

416

Do you feel sleepy?

417
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,119
You can sleep if you're tired.

418

No.

419
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,319
I haven't watched the last episode.

420
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,319
Or maybe you can sleep for a while,

I don't think you would invite me here

426
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,119
simply for a coffee treat.

427
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,800
Unlike you,

428
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,280
I'm busy.

429
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:52,920
I still have to deal with Assistant Lin

430
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,119
on the handover work of Beyond Home.

431
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,280
The reason why I looked for you today

432
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,719
is to apologize
for my previous recklessness.

433
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,920
When did President Jiao

434
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,400
become so wordy?

435
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,319
Why don't you get straight to the point?

436
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,760
I know that you have
good relations with the directors,

437
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,359
especially Chairman Cao,

438
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,599
but please

439
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,599
don't get interfere with
my inauguration ceremony.

440
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,680
This could be

441
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,160
the funniest joke of the year.

442
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,560
One week.

443
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,239
Within one week.

444
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:43,439
If I can become the president of Hongyu,

445
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,560
I can accept any request from you.

446
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,760
Any request?

447
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,239
It doesn't matter what
requests you're going to make.

448
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,359
I've made a promise.

449
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,160
I can promise you anything you want

450
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,640
as long as you are willing to help me.

451
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:13,239
I don't like this style

452
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,359
I'm going to tear the house
down and rebuild it.

453
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,359
It belongs to you now.

454
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:20,280
Do whatever you want.

455
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,479
Don't you always say that

456
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,160
home is important and very precious?

457
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:31,000
Are you really

458
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,040
going to give up your home?

459
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,760
People like you
will never understand that

460
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,760
home is a place where

461
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:46,560
you live with those you care.

462
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,880
Satisfied?

463
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:50,439
I'm leaving now.

464
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:54,439
The shares and
this house were originally mine,

465
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:55,520
it was you and your father

466
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,199
stole it from me,

467
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:59,079
and I will get them all back.

468
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:06,400
One day you will realize

469
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,560
how much you lost

470
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:11,599
because of your behavior.

471
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,119
Only the power and money in your own hands

472
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,959
will never betray you.

473
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,439
Damn it!

474
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,920
Where did Jiao Jun Hong

475
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,359
hide the last will?

476
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:48,000
Hello?

477
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,400
Oh, Director Su

478
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:50,560
Something happened to Beyond Home.

479
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:51,760
What is it?

480
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,079
Director Su.

481
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,239
What's wrong?

482
00:29:58,239 --> 00:29:58,839
Most customers

483
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,439
who've done booking for our apartments

484
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:01,800
wants to cancel, after they have come

485
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,479
to visit the sample rooms

486
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,560
and complain

487
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,199
about the bad decoration and unpleasant smell

488
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:07,319
which was inconsistent
with online renderings.

489
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:08,800
They have also taken photos
of sample rooms on-site

490
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,119
and posted in the customer reviews,

491
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
which have resulted in
a large number of order losses.

492
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,400
This matter has been
brought to Chairman Xue,

493
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:16,760
and he wants to see you now.

494
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:22,359
Director Su, can you explain to me

495
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,479
why would customers
want to cancel their booking?

496
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,239
Chairman Xue, I
should've strictly controlled the quality

497
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:29,520
of the sample rooms.

498
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,199
I've informed the
decoration team to redecorate,

499
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:34,719
and it's expected to
reopen on next month.

500
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,160
I know you're now

501
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,719
holding five percent
share of Hong Yu Group,

502
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,680
so wouldn't care much
about Zhong Qing's projects anymore!

503
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:46,520
If you can't handle it well,

504
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,079
your Beyond Home Project
will come to an end,

505
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:53,680
and you will no longer be
able to stay in Zhong Qing.

506
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,239
Su Cheng Jun, how
could you break your promise?

507
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,040
I have done what you told me to do,

508
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,079
I have dismissed all the
staff of the president's office

509
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,079
and even the villa is yours now.

510
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:18,040
But Infinite Home is my bottom line.

511
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,520
What do you want me to do?

512
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,439
My dear brother,

513
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:25,359
the bottom line is meant to be broken.

514
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,719
Don't worry,

515
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,199
as long as you promise me one last request,

516
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:31,160
I can assure you that

517
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:33,079
the next president of Hong Yu Group

518
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:35,800
will be you.

519
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:37,560
Su Cheng Jun,

520
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:40,839
You know exactly what
Infinite Home means to me,

521
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:42,119
to my mom,

522
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,520
and to Lin Miao.

523
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:46,280
Don't be too harsh.

524
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,359
Up to you.

525
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,000
To protect Infinite Home

526
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,239
or become Hong Yu president.

527
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:54,760
Choices are at your hand.

528
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:05,479
My dear brother, I still
have things to do, I'll be leaving now.

529
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,199
As for the mentioned request...

530
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,839
I'll wait for your good news.

531
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,719
How long did I sleep?

532
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:32,599
Not long.

533
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,319
Maybe I'm just too tired recently.

534
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,920
I always feel sleepy.

535
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,199
I'll go shower.

536
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,880
You should sleep early today.

537
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:46,400
I'll go with you to the
company tomorrow, alright?

538
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,400
Okay.

539
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,599
Hello, it's me.

540
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:22,319
I accept your offer,

541
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,520
please keep your promise

542
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,640
and let me be the president.

543
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:42,119
What time is it now?

544
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,839
Did you turn off my alarm?

545
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,640
You were in deep sleep.

546
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,760
Get more rest.

547
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,400
No, I have to wake up.

548
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,959
It's getting late,
I have to wake up now.

549
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,040
It's okay, you can sleep at home.

550
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:00,400
I can go by myself.

551
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,959
I won't let you do that.

552
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,800
I have made a promise

553
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,199
to go with you.

554
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,239
I can't break my promise.

555
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,239
You can keep that
in mind, and do it next time.

556
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:15,399
Okay.

557
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,840
I promise I'll make it up to you.

558
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,239
If that's the case,

559
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,360
you do owe me a lot.

560
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,280
For example?

561
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,479
This.

562
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,660
♪Every scene of you and me♪

563
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,500
♪Time counting down,
from broken to whole♪

564
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:39,719

565
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,180
♪Let this beginning of the encounter♪

566
00:34:42,155 --> 00:34:45,511

00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:50,511
♪With everything I have,

568
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
It's done.

569
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,639
Sorry.

570
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,120
I've read the news.

571
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,959
The Zhong Lun team led by you

572
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,639
has made a great success in the
cross-border M&A.

573
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,159
You're a very promising young man.

574
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
Chairman Zhao, please get to the point.

575
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,879
Then I shan't be too welcome.

576
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,399
I am here

577
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,479
for the will.

578
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,919
Do you mean the
will related to Su Cheng Jun?

579
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:19,280
I remember that you
had practiced at the law firm

580
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:21,320
before the death
of the president's wife.

581
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,959
It was my master who has taken the case

582
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,199
and I wasn't senior enough

583
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,600
to get involved at that time.

584
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,919
I feel that there's
something wrong with that will

585
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,560
but I have no evidence to prove it.

586
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:34,600
Your master has gone.

587
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,719
And Chairman Jiao is
recuperating abroad,

588
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,520
he won't be able to do anything.

589
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,239
Things are getting complicated.

590
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:45,239
Su Cheng Jun,
he wants to destroy Hong Yu.

591
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:46,879
I can't just sit back.

592
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,040
I can only think of you.

593
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,479
Chairman Zhao,

594
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,919
Chairman Jiao and Jiao Yang

595
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:56,879
may be entitled to question

596
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:58,159
Mrs. Jiao's will for Su Cheng Jun,

597
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,840
but what's your position in this case?

598
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,280
I'm in a position

599
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,679
which is good for both of us.

600
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,439
Be careful, it's hot.

601
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
What is this soup?

602
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,600
This is chicken soup, have a try.

603
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:16,080
I can do it by myself.

604
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,919
How is it?

605
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,120
Would it be too salty?

606
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:28,199
It tastes good.

607
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:29,239
Really good.

608
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:30,520
Really?

609
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,239
Try other dishes.

610
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:33,080
Here, try it.

611
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,760
Okay, let me do it.

612
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,520
Here you go.

613
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:40,199
How is it?

614
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:44,479
Not too salty or bland, perfect.

615
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,800
I didn't expect I could cook.

616
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:52,679
As long as it's made by you...

617
00:38:00,399 --> 00:38:01,520
Is it too hot?

618
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,719
Let me blow on it,
so it won't be too hot to eat.

619
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:10,520
I'll go get you some water.

620
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:26,120
Sorry, I can't cooperate with you.

621
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,719
Gu Chen, don't refuse a toast
only to be forced to drink a forfeit.

622
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,919
For the friendship between
you and my master,

623
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,479
let me advise you:

624
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,399
Chairman Zhao,

625
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:42,120
why don't you continue hiding

626
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,280
since you've been
doing it for so many years?

627
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:46,719
You've been in a
good role from the beginning,

628
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,120
no one would ever doubt about it.

629
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:57,439
How could it be possible
that the Infinite Home fails?

630
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,719
It can't be true.

631
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:01,800
Infinite Home is about to on-sale,
how could they overthrew it!

632
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:02,560
Exactly!

633
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,120
Even my favorite milk tea can't calm me down.

634
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,639
I feel like I want to beat someone up.

635
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,040
Assistant Lin, what a coincidence.

636
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,159
What are you doing here?

637
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,080
Did you just say that

638
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,560
Infinite Home Project is
going to be overthrown?

639
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:14,879
No, we didn't.

640
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:18,159
We were talking about Beyond Home.

641
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,360
Because it was about to open for sale,

642
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,080
but has been receiving
a lot of charge backs.

643
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,080
Is that so?

644
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:24,879
It's good timing,

645
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:26,399
President Jiao is
buying coffee in there,

646
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:27,439
I'll go check with him.

647
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:28,439
Don't.

648
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:31,120
It was President Jiao who
asked us to hide it from you.

649
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,560
He had his reasons.

650
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,199
It's all because of Su Cheng Jun.

651
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,479
Report to Assistant Lin,

652
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,399
The Infinite Home Project
is actually going well.

653
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,479
Even if Su Cheng Jun
has any wild ambition,

654
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,760
President Jiao will
resolve them in time.

655
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,520
We still have things to do,

656
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,360
we have to go now.

657
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,280
Go.

658
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,959
Su Cheng Jun? What about him?

[Total bill: 32 Yuan]

660

Someone has touched my phone.

661
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,639
What's wrong?

662
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:28,840
I need you to go with me.

663
00:40:30,879 --> 00:40:31,639
