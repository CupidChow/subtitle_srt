Thank you for helping Shan Shan go overseas.

Don't worry, Manager Zhou.

35
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,279
I promised to do it.

I will return the key tomorrow.

Uncle, I don't want to go abroad.

I want to stay by your side and take care of you.

Don't be silly, Shan Shan.

I have never been to overseas in my life.

I don't allow you to do the same.

I know you actually

I also understand that you want

127
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,880
to protect Yue Rong Villa with us.

128
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,880
Only you can take us to find althaea.

129
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,480
Are you willing to help us?

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,920
But...

131
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,320
If Uncle Zhou knows about it,

132
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,000
he will blame me.

133
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,640
I was raised by him since childhood.

134
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,480
I don't want to do things
that will let him down.

135
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:22,399
But are you going to let your father down?

136
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,119
But...

137
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,079
What are you hesitating?

138
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,920
I think that photo is fake.

139
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,399
You have never seen althaea before.

140
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,160
Certainly not!

141
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,200
I can remember clearly

142
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
how to go to the mountain!

143
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,559
Dad took me there.

00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,799
I will never forget it.

145

If you don't believe it,

00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll bring you to find althaea now.

148

Assistant Lin.

150
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,200
They don't have a car or a map.

151
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,239
They can't do anything.

152
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,000
Where is Shan Shan?

153
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,839
Bad news, Assistant Lin.

154
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,600
I just saw

155
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,040
Shan Shan went out with
President Jiao and the others.

156
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:04,959
What?

157
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:05,920
Damn it.

158
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,600
They must have gone to find althaea.

159
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,320
The mountain is so dangerous.

160
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,799
Usually we don't dare to go there.

161
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,000
Not to mention that it is going to rain now.

162
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,440
This boss

163
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,040
can't be flexible at all.

164
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,440
I've told you he would never listen to advice.

165
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,000
Assistant Lin, please get an idea.

166
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,320
What should we do?

167
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,720
This is President Jiao's own choice.

168
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,600
He needs to be responsible for the circumstances.

169
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,119
I've already done everything I could.

170
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,119
I can't control him.

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is it.

172
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,640
Yes.

173
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,359
Exactly the same as what I remember on the map.

174
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,200
Let's go!

175
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,519
Let's set off.

176
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,000
No, I can't walk anymore.

177
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,640
It's too difficult to find.

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,239
No wonder I have never seen any althaea

179
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,520
in the mountain since then.

180
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,559
We have been searching for so long.

181
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,760
I didn't even see a petal.

182
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,840
Maybe everything is fated.

183
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,840
Brother, let's just approve of

184
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,159
the rebuilding proposal of Yue Rong Villa.

185
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,200
No way.

186
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:50,119
I won't give up until the last minute.

187
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,200
Shan Shan, don't worry.

188
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:53,960
Since I have promised you,

189
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,520
I will surely fulfill your wish.

190
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:56,400
President Jiao.

191
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,200
But if we keep going on,

192
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,599
I'm afraid we will be in danger.

193
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,960
Furthermore, Director Zhao and Shan Shan

194
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,479
seem to be too tired.

195
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,119
What about this way?

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,479
Quickly send both of them back.

197
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,880
I will find althaea by myself.

198
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,479
President Jiao.

199
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:13,599
-Jiao Yang.
-President Jiao.

200
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:22,239
Let me tell you that Jiao Yang

201
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,919
is stubborn and grumpy man,

202
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,239
who never listens to any advice.

203
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,760
Even though I can't go back forever,

204
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,840
I don't care about him anymore.

205
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,799
Just let him have a hard time.

206
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,799
Sooner or later one day he will
come back crying with regrets.

207
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,320
I'm afraid that you are the one
is going to regret with tears.

208
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:38,559
Exactly.

209
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,520
I feel so regretful.

210
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,599
I regret knowing him,

211
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,119
and coming to this resort with him.

212
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,239
Regret...

213
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,200
There are so many regrets.

214
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:54,960
Am I a busybody?

215
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,640
Why should I care whether
Jiao Yang is dead or alive?

216
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,239
You are so worried about the boss.

217
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,440
Assistant Lin, I'm afraid you...

218
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,919
Miss Ji Zi.

219
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:11,080
You seem to bias towards President Jiao.

220
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,919
Because I believe him.

221
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,440
Throughout so many years,

222
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,679
he is the only one like us

223
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:23,119
that really wants to protect Yue Rong Villa.

224
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,599
I believe

225
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,200
he definitely can

226
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,760
do things that others can't accomplish

227
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,880
with his determination

228
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,400
towards the villa.

229
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,039
Since this is the case,

230
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,559
why are you still on my side?

231
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,479
I have no other way.

232
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,599
Zhou

233
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:38,479
always wanted to send Shanshan abroad.

234
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,119
Chef Liu is lonely without painting brush.

235
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,280
Regarding me...

236
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,080
I was born kind.

237
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,280
So look,

238
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,760
each of us that lives in this world

239
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,039
needs to be a fool sometimes

240
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,919
no matter right or wrong.

241
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,200
But I am doing it for his own good.

242
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,000
Jiao Yang can't go to find althaea.

243
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,239
He will not come back.

244
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,000
How do you know he can't come back?

245
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:22,320
Because my dad never came back.

246
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:30,080
In this world,

247
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,559
everyone has their own way.

248
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,919
You make a decision for him arbitrarily.

249
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,760
How do you know what is he thinking?

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,359
But I...

251
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,679
Jun, save me.

252
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,559
Dad, where are you?

253
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,080
Is it you dad?

254
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,320
Lin Miao, save me.

255
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,080

Where is Jiao Yang?

266
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,440
We didn't manage to find althaea.

267
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,840
So Jiao Yang went to find it himself.

268
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,039

He is alone in the mountain.

However,

449
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,000

451
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,959

452
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:14,160

453
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,719
She is very capable of doing things in order.

454
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,239
But...

455
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:19,239
What?

456
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:20,839
But she likes role-playing

457
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,920
and she has a sleepwalking habit.

458
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,000
So at night, everyone must take care of her.

459
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,359
What if she gets hurt again?

460
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,920

461
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,119

462
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:33,680

463
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,839

00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,439
with outstanding bar-tending skills.

465
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,560
But in the future, you need to
be careful about your actions and words.

466
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:45,079
Boss.

467
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,560

468
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,280
What do you mean?

469
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,520
Or would you give me some advice?

470
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,280
As for Manager Zhou,

471
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,239
I know you have been

472
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,319
wishing to send Shan Shan to study abroad.

473
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:58,319
But Shan Shan is not ready yet.

474
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,439
So we set up a study fund.

475
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,119
When Shan Shan is ready,

476
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,640
send her to study overseas.

477
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,199
Or it's not too late for her to follow her father

478
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,719
and travel around the world.

479
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,520

00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,520

481
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:18,920
Thank you.

482
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:19,959
That's alright.

483
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,959
You should thank Assistant Lin.

484
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,599
This is what she suggested to me.

485
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,439
Thank you, Assistant Lin.

486
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,000
Okay, that's all I wanted to say.

487
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,119
Boss, you are so cute and thoughtful.

488
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,119
I feel sadder to be apart from you.

489
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:34,959
What should I do?

490
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,599
Miss Ji Zi, we can't do this.

491
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,920
You already said that

492
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,920
I have my own destined lover.

493
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,959

494
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,479
Who is it?

495
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,800
Sister Ji Zi, who is his destined lover?

496
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Is it me? Is it me?

497
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,599
This...

498
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,520
You have to ask the boss himself.

499
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,119
President Jiao, thank you very much.

500
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,000
Throughout so many years,

501
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,520
we also have met many developers.

502
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,800
But none of them really stood by our side

503
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,760
except you.

504
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,040
I really want to apologize to you.

505
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,400
Manager Zhou, you are too courteous.

506
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,199
In the future, President Jiao will
treat everyone as a family.

507
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,800
I believe President Jiao

508
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,560
will write off all the old scores.

509
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,680
He will let pass on them.

510
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:48,119
Correct.

511
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:50,439
You all need to protect

512
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,680
Yue Rong Villa in the future.

513
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,560
Do not worry.

514
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:55,119
I will definitely lead all of us to protect Yue Rong.

515
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:56,719
Come.

516
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,000
Toast to Yue Rong Villa!

517
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,719
Toast to President Jiao!

518
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:05,800
Assistant Lin.

519
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
All these credits to you.

520
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,040
Come, let me give you a toast.

521
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,479
Thank you, Manager Zhou.

522
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,199
Fill it, fill it.

523
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,040
Assistant Lin.

524
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,319
I give you a toast.

525
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:25,040
Why do you want to toast me?

526
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,439
Thank you for seeing my proposal,

527
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,880
although it is now a pile of wasted paper.

528
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,319
Cheng Jun, let me tell you.

529
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,520
You have done very well.

530
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,400
Do not give yourself too much pressure.

531
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:40,839
What did you just call me?

532
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,599
I drink it up.

533
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,000
Don't drink too much.

534
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,199
Assistant Lin.

535
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,239
Thank you for your encouragement.

536
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,199
Previously, I

537
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,439
have always been fighting alone.

538
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:10,079
But after this period,

539
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:12,319
I realized clearly that

540
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:16,160
how much I wish I could have someone

541
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,880
to grow together with me.

542
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:22,880
From now to the future,

543
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,959
that person is...

544
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,839
Come, drink more.

545
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,239
How much did you drink?

546
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,439
Stop drinking, stop drinking.

547
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,760
I'm fine.

548
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,719
I still can drink, I am normal.

549
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:42,280
Okay, don't move, don't move.

550
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,479
I can drink three more glasses.

551
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:44,520
Drink three glasses, drink three glasses.

552
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,920
Let me go, I'm so sleepy.

553
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
I want to go home to sleep.

554
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,680
Okay, I'll take you home to sleep.

555
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,520
No way.

556
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,520
You don't know where my house is.

557
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,800
No one knows where my house is.

558
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,079
Yes, they don't know, I know.

559
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,000
You don't know it either.

560
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,319
I know, let's go.

561
00:26:58,439 --> 00:26:59,599
Let's go, go home, go home.

562
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,040
Go home.

563
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,760
Jiao...Jiao Yang...

564
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,800
Okay, come here.

565
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,040
Come, come, Yan.

566
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,199
Let's drink.

567
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:09,760
In the future, we will work together for Yue Rong.

568
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
Slow down, slow down.

569
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,239
Slow down.

570
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,880
Where is this place? This is not my home.

571
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:30,520
Come, sit down.

572
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:31,560
Sit for a while.

573
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,439
Come, sit down.

574
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,800
Slow down.

575
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,280
Lie down.

576
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:04,839
When did you finish it?

577
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:08,839
The day before yesterday?

578
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,239
Yesterday?

579
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,479
Don't get me wrong.

580
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,359
I was just seized by a whim.

581
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,959
You are really...

582
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:24,000
You are drunk yet you are still double-dealing.

583
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:26,920
Okay, since you are drunk,

584
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,680
I accept your kindness.

585
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:29,760
By the way...

586
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,930
[Hong Yu Group
Lifetime employment contract: Lin Miao]

587
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,439
What is it?

588
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,000
Lifetime...I don't want it.

589
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,040
What is it?

590
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,319
Why did you ask me to work for you all my life?

591
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:52,119
Why don't you understand?

592
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,479
This is your reward given by me.

593
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:55,680
It is not working for a lifetime.

594
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,599
It is...

595
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:57,880
What?

596
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,800
In short, hurry up and sign.

597
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,160
I don't want to sign.

598
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,520
You really don't know how to appreciate.

599
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,040
You are homeless.

600
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,880
I am willing to keep you for life.

601
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,640
You dare to reject me at such a sacred moment?

602
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,119
Do you know

603
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:21,040
this is my first time...

604
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,760
Anyway, you quickly sign it.

605
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,920
I said no, I don't want to sign.

606
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
Why?

607
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,119
Because I...

608
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,920
Because you don't think you deserve me?

609
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,680
Or do you think my dad will object?

610
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,520
Because I...

611
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:13,000
Lin Miao, where did you vomit?

612
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:16,000
Slow down, slow down.

613
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:17,599
Why did you drink so much?

614
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,719
Slow down, don't vomit.

615
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,319
You made my clothes dirty.

616
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,959
Watch your wages.

617
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:23,760
Why are you...

618
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,439
Are you made from steel bars?

619
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:26,560
Why are you so heavy?

620
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,040
What are you doing?

621
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,719
Undress.

622
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,199
Undress?

623
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,479
Who to undress?

624
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,680
Don't mess around.

625
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:38,479
No, other people will see it.

626
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:40,359
Don't move, undress.

627
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,599
Stop it, what if people see it?

628
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,920
Don't move.

629
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:51,640
You rejected me before.

630
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,199
What is the situation now?

631
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,199
Your customized suit is dirty.

632
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:59,079
I'll clean it up for you. Don't cut my wages.

633
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,199
No need.

634
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:02,599
Why are you shy, kid?

635
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,959
I am eight years older than you.

636
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,599
When I was in high school,

637
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:09,119
you were still playing pinball.

638
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,920
What are you talking about?

639
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Don't move.

640
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,400
Troublesome.

641
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,400
You don't listen to me.

642
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,599
I don't want to play with you anymore.

643
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,319
Go to bed.

644
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:32,040
What's the situation?

645
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,280
Jiao Yang, I feel so bad.

646
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,319
Do you think you are the only one feeling bad?

647
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:56,599
Do you know how much effort and time I have spent

648
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,719
to draft the contract?

649
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,119
I feel bad.

650
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,439
Lie down nicely.

651
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:06,239
Come.

652
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:07,959
Come.

653
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,760
Come.

654
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,160
You are so noisy.

655
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:30,599
So noisy.

656
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:43,880
Lin Miao.

657
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,040
Don't try to avoid my question

658
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,839
just because you are drunk.

659
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,400
Say it.

660
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,800
Why did you reject me?

661
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,680
Because...

662
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,160
Because I came from the future.

663
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,760
At my place,

664
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,719
it's already 2020.

665
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,319
And I,

666
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:18,920
am already 33.

667
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:25,839
Are you playing a role-playing game
as Shan Shan did?

668
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,520
So.

669
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:30,640
Is this the butterfly effect
or the black hole frequency?

670
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,479
What nonsense.

671
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,959
Let me tell you.

672
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,640
Here.

673
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,520
There is a person looks exactly like me.

674
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,839
Her name is Lin Wei Jun.

675
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:46,640
You will believe it when you see her.

676
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,760
Lin what? Wei Jun?

677
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,719
Lin.

678
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,040
Wei.

679
00:33:57,199 --> 00:34:00,239
Jun.

680
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,800
This is a secret.

681
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:05,000
You must help me keep this secret.

682
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,080
If you were a person from 2020,

683
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,000
then I were from 2030.

684
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,399
At my place,

685
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,159
there was a person who looked exactly like me

686
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,159
and a person who looked exactly like you.

687
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,280
Together, we

688
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,840
raised a bunch of children.

689
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,879
Kid,

690
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,600
what nonsense are you saying?

691
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,600
I'm not lying.

692
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,639
Do you remember those who smeared you?

693
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
They are anti-fans.

694
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:40,639
This method is very popular in our place.

695
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,760
You don't understand.

696
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:46,679
However,

697
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,719
with such a beautiful face,

698
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,679
if I have a bunch of children with you...

699
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,120
It's good.

700
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,399
But you still haven't answered my question.

701
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,239
Lin Miao.

702
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,520
Lin Miao?

703
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,520
Lin Miao?

704
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,320
You just fell asleep?

705
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,639
I'm not a fool.

706
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,919
It was my first confession.

707
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:38,159
But you rejected me for such a ridiculous reason?

708
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,719
I don't accept it.

709
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:03,000
Am I not awake?

710
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:10,800
Since you are awake, why are you pretending?

711
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,439
You don't want to be responsible, right?

712
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,959
What are you talking about?

713
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,439
What nonsense are you talking about?

714
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,080
What are you talking about?

715
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,159
I knew you would definitely

716
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,639
pretend that you lost memory

717
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,719
about last night.

718
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:42,919
Last night?

719
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,399
What happened?

720
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,639
Did I say anything?

721
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You said...

722
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,040
How can I let her know how shameful I was

723
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,320
to be rejected by her?

724
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,600
It's okay, don't talk about it.

725
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,239
Anyway, I don't really want to know.

726
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,800
You stripped my clothes and loosened my belt.

727
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,399
In that case,

728
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:09,399
what do you think you could say?

729
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,199
President Jiao,

730
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:17,800
you'd better not talk nonsense

731
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,360
without any evidence.

732
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,600
This kind of things,

733
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,639
only you, I and the God know about it.

734
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,919
I can't prove anything,
and I don't want to prove it.

735
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,879
Hurry up and go back to Hong Yu today.

736
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,080
President Jiao.

737
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,000
Did you have a great time
with Assistant Lin last night?

738
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:54,120
What did I say last night?

739
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,840
Assistant Lin.

740
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,520
President Jiao.

741
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:00,000
Please come back often when you have time.

742
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,879
Sure.

743
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,199
Manager Zhou.

744
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,959
Please take care of Yue Rong Villa in the future.

745
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,800
Don't worry.

746
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
Have a safe trip.

747
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,639
Cheng Jun, are you coming back today?

748
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,959
I'm preparing for dinner.

749
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:11,040
Come back early after getting off work.

750
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,040
Xin.

751
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:21,080
Here, drive my car.

752
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,520
Director Zhao, how are you going back?

753
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:28,120
So everyone is taking the car of President Jiao?

754
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:32,719
Jiao Yang.

755
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,639
This time, you made a contribution to Hong Yu.

756
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,239
Uncle Jiao will definitely reward you.

757
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,239
Do I have a share?

758
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,040
Of course.

759
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:40,360
Everyone in my team will be rewarded.

760
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:06,860
[Heartless businessman. Develop by force]

761
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:08,120
Protect the environment!

762
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,600
Protect the environment, boycott demolition!

763
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,760
-Protect the environment.
-Protect the environment!

764
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,560
I'm already on the way back.

765
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:37,479
Directors.

766
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:41,120
These news reports are making deliberate
misinterpretation out of context.

767
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:44,080
Please give me a few days to investigate

768
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,800
who is trying to frame us.

769
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,040
I will definitely give a satisfactory answer

770
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,840
to all the directors and the public.

771
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:51,959
Since President Jiao has taken
the initiative to take responsibility,

772
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,679
we might as well give him this opportunity

773
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,479
to investigate this matter clearly.

774
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:57,919
The evidence is here.

775
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,360
Why do we need to investigate?

776
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,399
The company sent Jiaoyang there

777
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,840
just for a preliminary investigation.

778
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,679
But he applied it for environmental
protection zone on his own.

779
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,000
It was his fault at first.

780
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,479
This has caused a lot of trouble

781
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,879
and damaged Hong Yu's reputation.

782
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,040
The board of directors must deal
with this matter seriously.

783
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,840
Doing it without inform you is my fault.

784
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,080
But don't blame everything at once.

785
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,879
Obviously,

786
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:22,320
someone is playing tricks behind this incident.

787
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,439
That was not the case at the time.

788
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:25,239
President Jiao.

789
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:28,280
Can anyone prove what you said?

790
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,080
Members of my team.

791
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,639
Dead men tell no tales.

792
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:42,159
Chairman.

793
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,159
Jiao Yang makes mistakes repeatedly,

794
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,800
infringing on the company's reputation

795
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,959
and the benefits of the board of directors.

796
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,199
Please also give us a reasonable explanation.

797
00:40:50,919 --> 00:40:52,239
Yes, Chairman.

798
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:55,919
Please also give us an explanation.

799
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,040
Within a week,

800
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,399
the President Office must
investigate this thing clearly

801
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,520
and settle it properly.

802
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,679
Otherwise, Jiao Yang

803
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:14,919
will be suspended.

804
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,000
Chairman, you really can

805
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,959
distinguish your private
and work matters clearly.

806
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,120
Directors.

807
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:32,320
No matter who is the one behind this.

808
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,560
I, as the person in charge,

809
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,919
will definitely calm down the public
as soon as possible.

810
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:37,919
I will give a satisfactory reply

811
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:40,040
to the directors and the public.
