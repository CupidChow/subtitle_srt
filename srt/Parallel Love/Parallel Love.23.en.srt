[Episode 23]

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,720
Here is the evidence to prove that

34
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,160
you and Chairman Li had
made a deal under the table.

35
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,319
You utilized the shell company

36
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,720
under Li Dong Qiang

37
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,720
to move from China to the United States,

38
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,240
then to the Cayman Islands,

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,639
and then using
Zhong Qing to get benefit from it.

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,759
You've earned far more than

41
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,639
what Chairman Li
and Chairman Xue have got.

42
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:22,320
You are the real winner

43
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,199
behind the scenes.

44
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:37,119
Hong Yu turned upside down

45
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,440
when Jiao Yang got the bid of Heng Yuan,

46
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,520
and Chairman Li was out.

47
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,919
But both of us know that even he dared to do,

48
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,199
he didn't want that to happen.

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,320
Since then I suspected that

50
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,639
there was someone else hiding in Hong Yu.

51
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,119
I thought the man was Chairman Cao

52
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:56,360
who have a close
relationship with Chairman Li,

53
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,839
but I never thought that it was you,

54
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,720
the one who've done all these

55
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,320
and has always been
loyal to Jiao Jun Hong.

56

Su Cheng Jun,

57

what do you want?

58
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,639
You are done.

59
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
Grandma,

60
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:45,279
I have brought him to you.

61
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,520
It's him.

62
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:54,559
He said he wants
to have a family with me.

63
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:59,279
Just like when you lived with me.

64
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,880
Grandma, if only you could awake.

65
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,839
I hope you're with me as well.

66
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,320
I regret it a lot in these ten years.

67
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:21,799
I always think that

68
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,359
if I have spent more
time with you back then,

69
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,040
would everything be different now?

70
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay.

71
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,600
I have no secrets now.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,279
I hope that

73
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,799
we are open and honest.

74
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,600
I want to apologize

75
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,480
for hiding my
physical condition from you.

76
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,679
I knew it.

77
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,519
I don't think keeping the words in mind

78
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,640
is called concealment.

79
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,440
I promise you that

80
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,959
I'll be the president
as soon as possible

81
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,200
and send you back.

82
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,640
But you can't use Infinite Home

83
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,399
as a bargaining chip for
you to become the president.

84
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,920
It's just a house to me.

85
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,600
It's more than just a house,

86
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,959
you and your mother
have put a lot of effort into it.

87
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,799
I won't let you do it.

88
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,600
No matter what happens,

89
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,040
we will face it together, okay?

00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,200

00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,480
Yes, I am.

Someone's looking
for you at the reception desk.

93

It could be Xin,

94
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,040
they might have something urgent,

95
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,559
I'll go check it out.

96
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:48,160
Okay.

97
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:49,160
Let's go.

98
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,720
Okay.

99
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,320

What are you doing here?

101
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,640
Don't be so defensive.

102
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,519
I have good news

103
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,440
for you.

104
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,559
Soon, Jiao Yang's Infinite Home Project

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,160
will be gone.

106
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,200
It's impossible.

107
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:43,920
It only happens in your dream.

108
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,839
Making the impossible possible

109
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,160
is more interesting.

110
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,320
Isn't it?

111
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,279
You must be crazy.

Lin Miao,

113
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,519
As long as you leave Jiao Yang

114
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,679
and be with me,

115
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,640
I don't mind giving my dear brother

116
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,640
a nominal position as the president.

117
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:07,880
You didn't mean to be with me,

118
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,720
you just want to use me

119
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,200
to destroy Jiao Yang.

120
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,079
Let me tell you,

121
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,920
you're such a bad and pathetic person,

122
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,200
stay away from me.

123
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:21,839
You are right.

124
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,480
Why can he always

125
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,079
get everything easily,

126
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,480
and I get nothing

127
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,079
even if I've given all I can.

128
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,040
I've tried so hard,

129
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,480
but it never works.

130
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,160
All I want is a chance for me

131
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,079
to fight back

132
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,320
when I was forced into the corner.

133
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,519
You're awake.

134
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,000
I...

135
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,679
Did I get fainted again
for having hypoglycemia?

136
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:55,320
You get fainted again

137
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,119
because you were too full.

138
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:58,920
Yeah.

139
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,679
I'm not but you are.

140
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:05,480
You still have strength to fight.

141
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,519
What are you doing?

142
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,880
Just to kiss you.

143
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,640
You.

144
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,760
Lin Miao,

145
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,839
you're being so mean to me.

146
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,320
Just imagine that,

147
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,200
you're staying home

148
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,200
with a well-developed man,

149
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,399
alone

150
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,880
but you don't let him do anything,

151
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,239
don't you think you're
being too harsh on him?

152
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,919
What do you want?

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,640
Are you sure you don't know?

154
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,960
We are lovers,

155
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,599
it's normal for us

156
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,000
to have some interaction

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,479
on this occasion.

158
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,799
You still don't get it, do you?

159
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,679
For example, like this.

160
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,039
Stop it.

161
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,640
I...

162
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,039
I need your help.

163
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:59,640
What is it? You want a baby?

164
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,880
Sure, come on.

165
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
No no no.

166
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,280
I...I regret that there are a lot of things

167
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,159
haven't achieved in 2010.

168
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,479
I would like you to complete it with me.

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,599
Regret?

170
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,679
For example?

171
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,080
How much do you have?

172
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,880
So you've already started
to inquire about my property?

173
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,400
Without first giving
something in return?

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Do you want to be a rich woman?

175
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,479
I'll take you to buy a house.

176
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,080
Why?

177
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:30,119
Because a house
is the most valuable asset,

178
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,359
buying more real estate

179
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,080
can be regarded as a guarantee.

180
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,599
But I

181
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,640
already have lots of houses.

182
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,479
Then ignore what I just said.

183
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,080
Well...

184
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,200
What's your other regrets

185
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,760
besides buying a house?

186
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,159
I'll make up for you.

187
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,599
What else do you want?

188
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,520
Tell me,

189
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I'll make it for you.

190
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,119
I...

191
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,719
I want to watch a movie,

192
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,679
visit the zoo,

193
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,080
and I want to see the underwater world.

194
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,760
I just realized that

195
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,039
I haven't tried a lot of things.

196
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,679
It's really boring that

197
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,640
I've been doing the
same thing every day.

198
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,280
Okay.

199
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,239
Is there anything else?

200
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,440
Yes.

201
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,400
Cheers.

202
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:39,039
Jiang Rou, why don't you drink?

203
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,599
My period has come,

204
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,679
I would like to drink
ginger tea with brown sugar.

205
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,119
But we don't have brown sugar here.

206
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,880
Hmm...

207
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,080
I've brought it.

208
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,479
You can go over there and prepare it.

209
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,760
Jiao Yang, Ying Jun is a guest.

210
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,239
You should go
instead of letting him do it.

211
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,559
Are you stupid?

212
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,840
Can't you see that he wants
to show off? Why should I get involved?

213
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,960
But why do you bring them here?

214
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,400
President Jiao, that's
your favorite blackboard

215
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
for the meeting.

216
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,880
Assistant Lin asked us to bring it here.

217
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,159
That's right, President Jiao.

218
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,080
Once you have it,

219
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,760
you can show your ability

220
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
and start your speech.

221
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,159
Thank you guys.

222
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,479
It's nothing, President Jiao.

223
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:24,200
As long as you can

224
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
make up for our losses

225
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,479
and treat us better
after we go back to Hong Yu,

226
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:27,640
and we definitely will
redouble our efforts to work.

227
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,000
Right, we want a pay rise.

228
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,280
And end our probation early.

229
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,320
That wouldn't be a problem.

230
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,479
Boss,

231
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,960
we would like to have a
five percent discount for Infinite Home.

232
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,320
Yes, five percent.

233
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,719
I assume that you're
taking advantage of me.

234
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,000
My family motto is we're
losing money if we're not earning.

235
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,479
Right, we're losing
money if we're not earning.

236
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,960
About the five percent discount...

237
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,400
No way.

238
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:55,039
Fine.

239
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,200
All crows under the sun are black.

240
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,960
Even if they usually hide well,

241
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,799
they will still expose
their businessman's attributes

242
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,159
when it comes to money.

243
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:02,960
Be careful, it's hot.

244
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,239
I don't care if my mouth burns,

245
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,799
it's better than my heart hurts.

246
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,039
Five percent discount
has been never enough

247
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,719
to pay off everyone's efforts.

248
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,479
It should be six percent discount.

249
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,000
It's time to work now.

250
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,200
Attention.

251
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,159
Our best president's office on earth

252
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,679
is going to reopen.

253
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,280
President Jiao,

254
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,359
let's make a plan.

255
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:26,559
Okay, let's go.

256
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,760
That's it.

257
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,400
This is the general plan.

258
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,599
Does anyone have anything to add?

259
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,880
Everything is ready,
all we need is money.

260
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,359
Just pay me back
according to the bank's interest rate.

261
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,479
Ying Jun.

262
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:50,960
Alright, interest-free is acceptable.

263
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,359
Interest-free? It would cause him

264
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:56,000
so much suffering.

265
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,119
It's okay, Ying Jun.

266
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,440
I'll come to you

267
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,320
when I really need it.

268
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,159
Deal.

269
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:05,239
Ding Ding, Jiang Rou,

270
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,479
Ying Jun, and Xin,

271
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,159
thank you, everyone.

272
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,280
President Jiao, you forget to thank

273
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,520
the most important one.

274
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:15,960
Well,

275
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,200
I'll thank her in person.

276
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,320
Warning, be careful with what you say.

277
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,960
It's a crucial moment,

278
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,000
let's keep it up

279
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,679
and win the fight, alright?

280
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,520
Go go go.

281
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,960
Go go go.

282
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,239
Let's do this together.

283
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,479
I believe you know that

284
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,039
Su Cheng Jun has his wild ambition.

285
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,640
You will be his next target

286
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,080
once he kicks me out.

287
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,840
Li Dong Qiang has told me that.

288
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,599
But why does everyone think that

289
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,799
it has to be me?

290
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:52,239
Don't underestimate

291
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:53,840
the five percent share that he has.

292
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,640
Even Jiao Yang can't beat him.

293
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,440
Although you are now

294
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,760
in the position of the
second largest shareholder,

295
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:01,400
you should also plan for the future.

296
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:03,559
Actually, I've received
an email from Su Cheng Jun

297
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:06,159
while I was on my way here.

298
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,960
I think now not only me,

299
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:11,679
but all of the board members have known

300
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,559
what you, Li Dong Qiang,

301
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
and Chairman Xue have done.

302
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,840
You won't get

303
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,679
even one supporter now.

304
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,159
Since we've been
working together for many years,

305
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,760
I'd like to give you a piece of advice.

306
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,760
Don't embarrass yourself

307
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,239
while you can

308
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,039
quit with dignity.

309
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,440
Dad.

310
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,039
Yan.

311
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:58,239
Yan,

312
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,320
Where have you been all these days?

313
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,439
I've already known

314
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:05,959
what happened to Hong Yu.

315
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Aren't you

316
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:11,160
going to tell me the truth?

317
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,640
Why would you have this?

318
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,719
Somebody asked me to give it to you.

319
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:31,880
Didn't you ask me

320
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:32,920
where did I go?

321
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,280
I guess you should have known by now.

322
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,479
You've been staying
together with the chairman.

323
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,359
Somebody has kept watching

324
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,239
and reporting all things
that happens here to Uncle Jiao.

325
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,959
But he slept more than

326
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,599
when he was awake,

327
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,719
so all these things

328
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,760
were reported to me first.

329
00:17:58,239 --> 00:17:59,439
And when he woke up,

330
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,640
I would report important issues to him.

331
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,640
But later, I regretted about it.

332
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,239
Dad,

333
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,160
others might not know

334
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,000
what you've done,

335
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,800
but you can't hide it
from me and Uncle Jiao.

336
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:18,359
Uncle Jiao has never blamed you for that,

337
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,719
I'm so ashamed of that.

338
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,160
Yan.

339
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:31,359
Uncle Jiao asked
me to bring this to you,

340
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,280
and he wants me to ask you

341
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,359
if you still remember it.

342
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes, I do remember.

343
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,680
Of course I remember.

344
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:45,199
When Hong Yu was first established,

345
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,280
there were only four people,

346
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,800
including Jiao, Li, Yu Jun and me.

347
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,839
And we barely had
enough money to buy this pen,

348
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,319
we carry it around

349
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,280
when we went out for business

350
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,959
so that we could look decent.

351
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,640
It's never easy to start a business.

352
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,680
We've met lots of people who
judging only by appearance,

353
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,880
and this pen really helped us a lot.

354
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,719
We've made our first order of business

355
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,680
in less than a week

356
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,880
after we have bought it.

357
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,439
After that, our business got better,

358
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,359
and together we've laid
a solid foundation for Hong Yu.

359
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,839
Since you remember everything,

360
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,280
how could you bear to destroy Hong Yu?

361
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,520
Now whenever I think of it,

362
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,760
those words that I've
used to scold Li Dong Qiang

363
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,400
were like reflecting back to myself.

364
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:44,160
You're still young,
you won't understand.

365
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,520
I know.

366
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,119
It's not easy running a business,

367
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,959
but we must never
forget our original intention

368
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,199
as we go along the path.

369
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,199
Dad, stop doing the wrong thing.

370
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,839
You wouldn't want Uncle Li and Aunt Jiao

371
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,400
saying it to your face

372
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,479
and call you a traitor

373
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,680
when you meet them in the future, right?

374
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,079
Stop doing the wrong thing.

375
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:44,479
Okay, that's the situation.

376
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,800
Does anyone have a problem?

377
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,280
Is that what President Jiao said?

378
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,119
Yes.

379
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,640
I talked to him on the phone last night

380
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,319
and he laughed

381
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,479
when I mentioned about his retirement.

382
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:57,640
He said he was too bored abroad

383
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,959
and have no friend
to play chess with him.

384
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,839
Then he said that

385
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,880
Chairman Cao is a capable woman

386
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,359
to entrust with an important task.

387
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,280
So Chairman Cao
will be the acting chairman

388
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,319
before his return.

389
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:11,839
Congratulations to Chairman Cao.

390
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,520
Thank you
Chairman Jiao for the recognition.

391
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:24,319
Chairman Zhao, please
pass on my message to Chairman Jiao

392
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:25,800
that I'll take care of Hong Yu for him

393
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,119
and for all of us,

394
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,479
and he should take care of himself.

395
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,439
If you want to say
something, go ahead and say it.

396
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:41,400
If it wasn't Jiao Yang
who asked me to see you off,

397
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,920
I guess you wouldn't tell me

398
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,040
that you were back, right?

399
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:45,760
I've wanted to tell you,

400
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,400
but then I didn't do it.

401
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,280
Why?

402
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:50,599
I'm ashamed of myself.

403
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,920
But this isn't your fault,

404
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,839
and I didn't blame you,

405
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,119
neither did Jiao Yang.

406
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:56,359
Yan Xin,

407
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,920
let's go abroad with me.

408
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,880
Do you mean now?

409
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,839
Why? You don't want to?

410
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,160
No.

411
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,040
Now is an important stage for Jiao Yang.

412
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,880
Are you stupid?

413
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,560
I'm just kidding.

414
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:13,719
You're still so dumb.

415
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:16,640
Jiao Yang, you've known it all, right?

416
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:17,719
Yes,

417
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,079
I know it.

418
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,599
Su Cheng Jun
has copied all the mails to me.

419
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,479
Up until now, I have
nothing to say anymore.

420
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,719
You don’t have to say anything.

421
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,920
You can talk to my dad

422
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,719
when you see him.

423
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,400
Dad, we should go now.

424
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,839
Okay.

425
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:42,920
Well, I shall stop here.

426
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,560
Take care,

427
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,319
Yan and Uncle Zhao.

428
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,000
Alright.

429
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's go.

430
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:51,959
Oh, right, Jiao Yang,

431
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,959
I have always been
in doubt about one thing.

432
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:56,400
What is it?

433
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:59,640
It's about the will,
the will for Su Cheng Jun.

434
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,839
You better check up on it.

435
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,640
Okay.

436
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,880
Yan, what about us after all of these?

437
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,239
We shall know in the future.

438
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,119
Let's go.

439
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:28,199
From now on, you can
only open the cola can for me.

440
00:24:34,894 --> 00:24:35,590
[Lin Wei Jun]

441
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,839
Hello.

442
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,359
Here's the tea.

443
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,599
Did the sun rise from the west today?

444
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:50,880
Why are you being so polite?

445
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:52,640
I'm sorry.

446
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:54,719
Just say what you want to say.

447
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:55,400
Stop joking around.

448
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,479
It was because of my negligence

449
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,239
in the will incident

450
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,839
which made Su Cheng Jun
took advantage of it.

451
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,280
I know that I can’t make up

452
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,040
for the damage and loss

453
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,160
that had happened to you and Hong Yu,

454
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,760
but I think that

455
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,719
I owe you an apology in a formal way.

456
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,520
Are you done?

457
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,479
Have some tea.

458
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,280
You should drink more.

459
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,359
No, I'm full.

460
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,760
As the saying: "The inside of the prime
minister's stomach can hold a boat.",

461
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,719
so you should drink more

462
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:35,239
to prove that you have a large stomach.

463
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:40,079
I'll take the responsibility.

464
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,160
It's okay, it's not really your fault.

465
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:45,640
I remember that

466
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,280
I have already been
together with Su Cheng Jun

467
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,560
before Aunt Jiao died.

468
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,599
There was a lawyer
always looked for him at that time,

469
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,400
but he didn't want to pay any attention

470
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,800
about anything related to Aunt Jiao,

471
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,640
so he asked me to send the lawyer away.

472
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:00,680
And then?

473
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,160
Anyway,

474
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:04,680
the last time the lawyer
sent him a picture frame,

475
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,839
but he threw it away.

476
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,079
A picture frame?

477
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,280
It was the only
photo of him with Aunt Jiao.

478
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Although I don't know

479
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,119
what was the intention of the
lawyer by sending him the picture...

480
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,239
You may have some tea first.

481
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:21,479
I have to leave for a while.

482
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:29,560
Miss Jiang,

483
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,880
does the joke so funny to you?

484
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,920
The funny part wasn't about the joke,

485
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,599
but the one who's telling it.

486
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:39,040
Mr. Chen, am I right?

487
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:41,040
I'm just afraid that
you might look down on me.

488
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:43,160
Actually,

489
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,479
I do value a person's professionalism.

490
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,040
But why can't an
excellent person like you

491
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:50,680
go further in your career?

492
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,520
It brings me to
tears when I think about it.

493
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,000
My leader...

494
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,959
Even though Jiao Yang
might be lacking some skills,

495
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:59,040
but he never treated you badly, right?

496
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,359
Director.

497
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,319
Both of you are...

498
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,640
We're on a blind date.

499
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,000
Jiang Rou, I know
exactly what's your intention.

500
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,079
You should listen to my advice,

501
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,520
stop wasting time on my assistant.

502
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,520
You won't find any
valuable clues that you want

503
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,280
no matter how hard you try.

504
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,599
Su Cheng Jun.

505
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,640
I guess it's getting
a lot of people recently

506
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,359
who acts high and mighty,

507
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:26,439
running around and
make a fool of themselves.

508
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:57,079
Damn it, it's Su Cheng Jun,

509
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,119
we were all fooled by him.

510
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,359
Jiao Yang,

511
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:03,800
Su Cheng Jun has quite
a number of his men in Hong Yu,

512
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,959
it's not wise for you

513
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,040
to come to me like this.

514
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:08,520
I would not come here easily

515
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,199
if I were not well-prepared.

516
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,920
I'm here for a reason.

517
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:25,880
Hello.

518
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:27,079
Hello, Jiao Yang.

519
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,880
I'm in Su Cheng Jun's house now.

520
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,040
And I have found the will.

521
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Lin Wei Jun

522
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
Lin Wei Jun.

523
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:41,640
Jun,

524
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,040
what are you doing in my house?

525
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,959
I'm here to ask you,

526
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,520
do you really think

527
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,560
they don't know what you've done?

528
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,760
Do you think that nobody noticed

529
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,319
when you kept
going in and out of the law firm?

530
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,520
You intentionally sent me away while
we were in the reference room

531
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,800
so that you could steal the will, right?

532
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,439
I don't know what you're talking about.

533
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,479
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

534
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,000
What did you take?

535
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm here to pick up
my personal belongings.

536
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,959
You don't have to know about that.

537
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,800
And I've got what I want,
I'll be leaving now.

538
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,719
Goodbye.

539
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,359
I mean I hope
we don't see each other again.

540
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,400
Jiao Yang, think carefully.

541
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,199
If you leave now,

542
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,719
there will be no second chance.

543
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,839
Okay.

544
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,560
Give it to me.

545
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,719
So you're here for the will.

546
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:56,280
Give it to me.

547
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,319
You're here for it.

548
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,640
Jun,

549
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:02,359
I didn't mean it.

550
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,319
Hello, Lawyer Gu.

551
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,760
I need your help

552
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,560
with something important.

553
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,199
Okay, I got it.

554
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:10,000
Then I'll meet you later

555
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,400
at Su Cheng Jun's house.

556
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:20,280
Do you want it?

557
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:23,719
What are you going to do?

558
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,079
Stop it. What are you doing?

559
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:29,359
You.

560
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,280
Lin Wei Jun.

561
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:39,839
Jiao Yang, he's holding
an attachment to the will,

562
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,800
which says that the shares

563
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,400
given to him by Mrs. Jiao

564
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,040
will not take effect until
he reached 40 years old.

565
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,040
But...

566
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:46,920
The attachment

567
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,479
was once existed

568
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,319
but no longer does.

569
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,040
Su Cheng Jun,

570
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,000
why would you be like this?

571
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,839
You ask me why?

572
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,880
Why don't you ask Liang Yu Jun,
ask Jiao Jun Hong,

573
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,959
and ask him.

574
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,000
Su Cheng Jun,

575
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,000
why do you always
think that you're right

576
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,719
and everyone should be sorry for you?

577
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:18,439
You've never walked in my shoes,

578
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,959
you will never know
the pain of being belittled,

579
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,599
abandoned and ridiculed.

580
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,760
Jiao Yang, I have already defeated you,

581
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,400
and soon Hong Yu will be mine as well.

582
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,040
Everything will be mine.

583
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:41,239
Really?

584
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:44,880
Okay.

585
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:48,319
Lawyer Gu.

586
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,560
Boss,

587
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,239
you're going to lose everything.

588
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,479
Gu Chen, what are you doing here?

589
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,400
I warn you,

590
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:03,599
these things have
nothing to do with you,

591
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,079
you better stay out of it.

592
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:07,280
Mrs. Jiao's will was
accepted by Zhong Lun,

593
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,160
and of course Zhong Lun will
take the responsibility until the end.

594
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:14,626
[Attachment 1. The will shall not take effect until the death of Party A.
2. The will will not take effect until the recipient reaches age 40.]

595
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,119
Zhong Lun has not
transitioned to a paperless office

596
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,959
when my master died.

597
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,719
But all is the heaven arrangements,

598
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,040
I found the scanned electronic archive

599
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,079
in his old computer.

600
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,280
How could it be possible?

601
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:34,280
Gu Chen, help me.

602
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,280
I promise you,

603
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,520
I'll give you anything you want.

604
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:38,040
I'll give you anything.

605
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,880
Help me.

606
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:43,479
What benefits did he give you?

607
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,359
Restoring Zhong Lun's reputation

608
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,880
is the greatest benefit for Zhong Lun.

609
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:05,439
Su Cheng Jun,

610
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,000
do you know where is the will?

611
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:12,400
It's right behind this photo.

612
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,800
Su Cheng Jun,

613
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:26,479
my mother actually has
prepared the will long ago,

614
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,479
but she put it behind the picture

615
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:29,880
captured together with you.

616
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,119
You gave it up

617
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,959
yourself,

618
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:37,079
and you gave up your life.

619
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:40,760
You can only blame yourself for that.

620
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:49,319
Jiao Yang,

621
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,800
I can't believe you made up such a story

622
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,119
to make me forgive her.

623
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,520
Do you think I will believe it?

624
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:57,560
Let me tell you,

625
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,760
I will never forgive her.

626
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,160
She did nothing wrong.

627
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,160
She doesn't need to be forgiven.

628
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,920
You're just making excuses

629
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,879
for your own.

630
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:11,959
I can tell that you're afraid.

631
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,560
Well,

632
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,800
I can let you go.

633
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,560
And I won't hold you accountable.

634
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,439
Would you forgive me so easily?

635
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,320
Because I think

636
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,959
losing everything

637
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,639
will be the biggest lesson for you.

638
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:48,120
Chairman Cao.

639
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,840
I've told you, you only have one chance.

640
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,800
Now it's my turn to give you a chance.

641
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,800
Did I hear you correctly?

642
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,879
You heard me right.

643
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,679
So I guess you've
dealt with Su Cheng Jun.

644
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,239
You could say that.

645
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,840
You said you want to give me a chance.

646
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:16,919
Chairman Cao, let's think about it.

647
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,280
As soon as Su Cheng Jun left,

648
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,600
Zhong Qing will be
like an army without a general,

649
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,919
and Beyond Home
is just an unorganized workforce.

650
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:22,679
So, it will be the best time

651
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:25,000
for you to join Infinite Home.

652
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,479
How can I believe you?

653
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,639
The best proof is that

654
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,919
you're willing to accept
the role of acting chairman,

655
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,479
and you're not a person

656
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:35,000
who will do loss-making business.

657
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:37,120
That's it?

658
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,280
The research fund you invested

659
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,679
in the United States
before was not a small amount.

660
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,159
Do you really want to give up

661
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,560
such a good opportunity
to earn the pay back?

662
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:47,639
What do you want in return?

663
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:51,959
I want to be the president of Hong Yu.

664
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,000
Your offer wasn't attracted enough.

665
00:35:58,879 --> 00:35:59,879
What if I say

666
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:01,520
I could make you the chairman?

667
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:03,639
Go on.

668
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,320
I just had a conversation
with my dad on the phone.

669
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:18,919
How is it?

670
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,800
How did the surgery go?

671
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:21,600
It's going well.

672
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,919
But that's not the point.

673
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,600
Then what?

674
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,959
The youngest prospective president

675
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:31,280
is now standing right in front of you.

676
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:37,479
Did the chairman make an announcement?

677
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,360
When will be the inauguration ceremony?

678
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:41,320
We need to hurry up and plan.

679
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:42,679
We're running out of time.

680
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,120
I have discussed with my dad,

681
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,800
the inauguration ceremony
has been scheduled for October 31,

682
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:55,239
the day where you've
stayed here for three months,

683
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,040
and I will send you back
as soon as I become the president.

684
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:00,560
I don't want to go back.

685
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,080
Why?

686
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,000
Don't you want me to be the president?

687
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,320
Not anymore.

688
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,040
I can send you back

689
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,120
once I become the president.

690
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:17,080
Isn't that what you want?

691
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,399
That's not what I want.

692
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:21,040
You never asked me

693
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,600
if I wanted to go back or stay.

694
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,080
Actually, I've made my decision.

695
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,520
I want to stay here

696
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,360
and I don't want to go back.

697
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:32,439
But you can't risk your life.

698
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:33,320
I'm not joking.

699
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,719
I'm serious.

700
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
I'm not going back.

701
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,080
I don't care anymore either
you're going to be the president or not,

702
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:40,840
the mission,

703
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,159
or even the three-month deadline.

704
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:46,080
I'm back for god's sake,

705
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:50,439
give me a chance to bet on it, okay?

706
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,159
I can't.

707
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,959
I won't let you die.

708
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,800
You don't have to force yourself.

709
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,080
I'll be fine.

710
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,600
Let's give it try.

711
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,399
Alright?

712
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,879
We shall put the inauguration

713
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,760
after 31st.

714
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:16,919
Let's give it a try.

715
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,800
But I want you to live.

716
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,800
I'll send you back.

717
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,360
Lin Miao, did you fall asleep?

718
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,840
I just want you to live.

719
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,679
Why don't you listen to me?
