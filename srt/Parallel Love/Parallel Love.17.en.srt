00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,280
Director Zhao.

170
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,599
This is for you.

171
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,239
Thank you.

172
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:56,359
I heard that when you're down,

173
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,000
you can try having carbonated drinks.

174
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,599
Gulp down a mouthful of it

175
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,880
and let out a loud belch.

176
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,440
You'll feel a lot better.

177
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,559
See?

178
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,840
See? I feel so much better.

179
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,200
Thank you, Xin.

180
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,159
Wait a minute.

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,960
Did you see me being upset?

182
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,840
I am just worried about Uncle's Jiao's condition.

183
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,320
Really?

184
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,799
Of course.

185
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,679
Have I ever lost to another woman?

186
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,239
Alright. I don't have time to chat.

187
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,520
I need to go home and make soup for Uncle Jiao.

188
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,919
When Uncle Jiao wakes up and

189
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,599
has the soup made with Aunt Jiao's recipe,

190
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:46,880
he'll recover very soon.

191
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,400
I'm leaving.

192
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,119
Director Zhao.

193
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,320
Why don't you try?

194
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,400
The cola trick really works.

195
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,719
Stay there and don't move.

196
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:58,200
Your mission is to look after Jiao Yang.

197
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,039
Understand?

198
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:01,719
I'm leaving.

199
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:41,760
Fellow members of the board,

200
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,280
the doctor says that

201
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,320
the chairman will be fine after taking a break

202
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,599
for a while.

203
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,599
Meanwhile, company affairs will be

204
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:53,200
handled by President Jiao with my assistance.

205
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,960
Chairman Zhao.

206
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,440
Given President Jiao's current
capability and experience,

207
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,799
it's a heavy responsibility to him.

208
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,239
According to the rules,

209
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,000
when the chairman suffers
from serious health conditions,

210
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,000
the board of directors has the rights to

211
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
elect a new chairman to run the company.

212
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,719
Under my father's leadership,
Hong Yu Group has

213
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:10,080
weathered through countless challenges.

214
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,799
So, he'll surely make through this.

215
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,080
Besides, as the vice president of the company,

216
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,119
I won't let anything go wrong.

217
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:17,719
President Jiao,

218
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,280
one cannot run a company
with a smooth tongue.

219
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,760
Other concerns aside,

220
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:24,479
let's talk about Chairman Li.

221
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:27,039
Now whom you're going to hand over

222
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,440
his businesses to?

223
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:33,400
Enough.

224
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,400
This is not the point of today's meeting.

225
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,919
Fellow members of the board,

226
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,880
back them, when we and the chairman

227
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,119
founded Hong Yu,

228
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,679
we were all young and inexperienced too.

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,919
I believe that as time passes,

230
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,799
President Jiao will gain

231
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,320
your approval as a good leader.

232
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,919
And I, Zhao Zhen Chuan,

233
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,599
will give everything I have

234
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,799
to make sure it happens.

235
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,719
Meeting adjourned.

236
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:16,400
Uncle Zhao, thank you for speaking up for me just now.

237
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,520
Jiao Yang.

238
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,280
They're used to looking
down on younger people.

239
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,599
It's not personal.

240
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,119
You don't have to comfort me.

241
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,200
I know that

242
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,359
the current situation is
not very optimistic to me.

243
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,679
Hello.

244
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,080
Thank you.

245
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,880
Uncle Zhao, my dad is awake.

246
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:42,520
Jiao, how are you feeling?

247
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,080
I'm fine.

248
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,599
How's the company doing?

249
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,200
Jiao, you don't have to
worry about the company.

250
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:52,520
Your health is your utmost priority.

251
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,880
You should head to the US for the surgery soon.

252
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,799
Those fellows

253
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:01,280
try to take over the company when I fall sick.

254
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,919
At a time like this,

255
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,200
how can I leave for the US without worries?

256
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,080
It's difficult for Jiao Yang.

257
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,239
Zhao.

258
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:12,880
Thank you.

259
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,320
You're the only person who can

260
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,559
help Jiao Yang.

261
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,440
Jiao Yang, don't be anxious.

262
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,119
With Chairman Zhao's advice,

263
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,080
the chairman will surely agree to fly to the US.

264
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,880
My dad's temperament really

265
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,919
worries me.

266
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,320
You haven't got much sleep.

267
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,440
You should go home and get some rest.

268
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,799
I'll keep you company.

269
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:39,960
No.

270
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,799
I'll stay by your side no matter
what you're going through.

271
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,119
Pull yourself up.

272
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,919
Don't let the chairman worry.

273
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,520
Jiao Yang.

274
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,239
The chairman asks you to come in.

275
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,039
Okay.

276
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,000
Go.

277
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,080
I'll buy you some food.

278
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,200
Okay.

279
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:27,200
Engagement?

280
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,280
Yes.

281
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,080
Marry Yan.

282
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,440
Our family and Zhao's family become one.

283
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,559
With your Uncle Zhao's stature

284
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,919
and shares of him and his daughter,

285
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,239
the members of the board

286
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,039
won't dare to make things difficult for you.

287
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:43,080
No, dad. You...

288
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,640
You're not joking, are you?

289
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:47,280
How could I get engaged with Yan?

290
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,559
I've always seen her as a little sister.

291
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,159
You and Yan were childhood friends.

292
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,559
Our families are compatible.

293
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,640
Besides,

294
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,440
your Uncle Zhao has already agreed.

295
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,599
With him by our side,

296
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,599
I believe you'll grow to become

297
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,440
a good leader soon.

298
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,000
Only then,

299
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,479
I can go abroad without worries.

300
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,599
Yeah. Uncle Zhao is willing to help us.

301
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,760
I'm genuinely grateful, but

302
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,880
we can't expect Yan to

303
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,400
make sacrifices because of this, right?

304
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,160
So you know that

305
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,479
Yan will have to make sacrifices?

306
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,760
To be honest with you,

307
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,400
If she doesn't like you,

308
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,199
why would a girl from a rich family

309
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,520
put herself through this for you?

310
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,280
After the engagement,

311
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,959
you should treat her nicely.

312
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,560
But Assistant Lin and I

313
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,319
are in a relationship.

314
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,319
How could I get engaged to Yan?

315
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,439
Lin?

316
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,000
Who's that?

317
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,040
When did you come back?

318
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:50,359
Just now.

319
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,119
How did it go with the chairman?

320
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,920
Has he agreed to go abroad for the surgery?

321
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,079
What did you buy?

322
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,119
I'm a little hungry.

323
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,800
Let's eat. Let's go.

324
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,439
What did you buy?

325
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,719
Wontons with chicken soup.

326
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,000
Aren't you going to eat?

327
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
I'm not hungry.

328
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,000
You should have one too.

329
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,640
I...

330
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,040
Have one.

331
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,280
It's a little cold.

332
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,439
It's fine. It's quite tasty.

333
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,719
Um.

334
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,040
Look. It's done. We did it.

335
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,319
Push it. Push it.

336
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,040
Okay.

337
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,680
Quick. Grab it for me.

338
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,400
This one.

339

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,520
You have to come back when
we're about to get off work?

510
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,560
It's about the Infinite Home development project.

511
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,319
I think there's room for improvement.

512
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,760
It's alright.

513
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,280
When you're available, I'll discuss it with you.

514
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,239
Um.

515
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,319
Pre-President Jiao.

516
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,000
I know what you want to ask.

517
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:06,880
Follow me.

518
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,479
What's wrong?

519
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,680
Who has made my daughter unhappy?

520
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,079
Dad, why are you here?

521
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,719
All my life, my proudest achievement

522
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
is having a

523
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,199
smart and sensible daughter like you.

524
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,760
When you were young, you were like a boy

525
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,280
And you never cry easily,

526
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:52,719
except when Jiao Yang was involved.

527
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,160
That fellow

528
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:57,319
was simply our family's nemesis.

529
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:58,760
Every time he bullied you,

530
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,079
you defended him.

531
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,680
That's too upset.

532
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,959
You only know to play

533
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:06,680
with this Lego castle that he bought for you.

534
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,640
Dad, what are you talking about?

535
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,439
I just noticed that there was dust on it,

536
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,000
so I'm dusting it.

537
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,880
Oh, I see.

538
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,640
My daughter has grown up

539
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,479
and preferred an outsider
over her own family.

540
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,560
Since you defend him,

541
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,040
I won't pressure you to tell the truth.

542
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:26,520
I've come to

543
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,640
tell you about good news.

544
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,439
What good news?

545
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:45,839
Your Uncle Jiao and I
have discussed and agreed that,

546
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,400
before he leaves the country,

547
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,119
we'll let you and Jiao Yang get engaged.

548
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:50,400
What do you think?

549
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Jiao Yang and I will get engaged?

550
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,959
Yan, what's going on with you?

551
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,439
Dad.

552
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:30,199
Dad, I'm so happy.

553
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,920
I'm over the moon.

554
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:35,599
Dad, do you know that

555
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,000
when I was seven,

556
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,119
after Jiao Yang gave me this gift,

557
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:44,880
I've been dreaming to

558
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,560
put on a wedding gown,

559
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,719
and he was riding a white horse.

560
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,680
Together, the two of us

561
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,719
would move into this gorgeous castle.

562
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,239
Dad,

563
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,560
thank you

564
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,599
and Uncle Jiao

565
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,280
for fulfilling my biggest dream.

566
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:18,000
Get... get engaged?

567
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,000
President Jiao.

568
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,479
Is it why you asked me to set
up a meeting with Chairman Qin

569
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:23,640
and lie to Assistant Lin?

570
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,520
What about the other three
members of the board?

571
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:31,319
Chairman Sun has always
been supportive of you,

572
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,560
but when he heard that you
wanted to meet him alone,

573
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,520
he avoided me faster than Chairman Xie did.

574
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,560
Chairman Cao, however,
agreed to meet right away.

575
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,280
The meeting is half an hour from now.

576
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,959
Chairman Sun doesn't really support me.

577
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,199
He does it for my father's sake.

578
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,680
He's avoiding me

579
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,239
probably because my dad has talked to him.

580
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,839
I won't put him in an awkward position.

581
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:49,880
Try to set up a meeting with Chairman Xie.

582
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,439
I'll go meet with Chairman Cao now.

583
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,839
If Lin Miao is looking for me,

584
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:54,800
help me deal with her.

585
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,239
She must not find out this matter.

586
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,239
Pre-President Jiao.

587
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:03,040
About the engagement...

588
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,920
Does Director Zhao know about it?

589
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:07,000
It's impossible.

590
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,920
Yan doesn't need to know.

591
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,160
My family needs the Zhao family's support.

592
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:12,760
I need Uncle Zhao,

593
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,400
but I can't sacrifice Yan.

594
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,800
Understood, President Jiao.

595
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,599
As for Chairman Xie,

596
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,520
I'll do everything I can to get
him to agree to a meeting.

597
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,719
But in half an hour,

598
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,000
we'll get off work.

599
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:29,000
If Assistant Lin comes to look for you,

600
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,439
I'm afraid I can't deal with her.

601
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:32,040
You aren't afraid of those cunning old foxes.

602
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,959
But you fear Assistant Lin?

603
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,479
Get over here.

604
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:56,359
Oh, no. Oh, no.

605
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,079
I'm so sorry.

606
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,000
This is bad.

607
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,160
What is bad?

608
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:01,640
President Jiao and I are in trouble.

609
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,400
No.

610
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,839
I begged the financial department repeatedly

611
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,479
before they agreed to
lend me a classified document.

612
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:08,800
Due to time constraints,

613
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,079
I didn't report this to the board of directors.

614
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,239
The finance manager kept reminding me that

615
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,239
once President Jiao read it,

616
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:16,040
I must return it to the department.

617
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,479
But now

618
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:18,880
it's mixed up with other documents.

619
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,640
What am I going to tell the finance department?

620
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,719
If they are unhappy about this incident

621
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:23,760
and report to the board

622
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,479
that President Jiao disregarded
the company policy,

623
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,239
Members of the board

624
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:28,119
will certainly get
President Jiao in trouble again

625
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,239
Don't just stand here then.

626
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,839
-Quick. Sort them out.
-Assistant Lin.

627
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,760
But President Jiao has assigned me

628
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,599
some very urgent tasks.

629
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,560
Of all in his office,

630
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,680
President Jiao trusts you the most.

631
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,920
Please.

632
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:44,880
I beg you.

633
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,880
Don't make that face.

634
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:50,640
I... Alright.

635
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,719
I can help.

636
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:55,680
How's the taste?

637
00:32:58,479 --> 00:32:59,520
Chairman Cao, you brought it

638
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,800
all the way here from the US after all.

639
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,520
The taste is indeed unique.

640
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:03,839
Alright.

641
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:06,079
You're not here to have tea with me, right?

642
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,520
Just get to the point.

643
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,520
You're just like the chairman, lacking

644
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,040
your mother's straightforwardness.

645
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:17,199
Chairman Cao, you never
worked with my mother, right?

646
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,160
But it doesn't mean I can't respect

647
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,439
or admire your mother.

648
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:23,439
After all, as a role model
for career women,

649
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,040
Ms Liang's prestige as a great designer

650
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,520
outshone your father's fame within

651
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,640
the women's community.

652
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,319
When I heard that she
suddenly passed away,

653
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,839
I thought it was a pity.

654
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,640
Many of her works never
got to be shown to the public.

655
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:37,760
But I didn't expect that her most brilliant work

656
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,319
will be shown to the world

657
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:40,760
through you.

658
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,959
You're talking about Infinite Home project.

659
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,239
Jiao Yang.

660
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,199
Since you're here to persuade
me to be on your side,

661
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,119
you should let your guard down a little.

662
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:52,880
I know

663
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:55,520
what people speak of me behind my back.

664
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,959
But I, Cao Hua, have always been
open and frank about everything.

665
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,160
I don't hide my admiration
for your mother.

666
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,439
And I don't plan to mask
my suspicion towards you.

667
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,479
If you want me to be your ally,

668
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:10,159
you need to persuade me with something promising.

669
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,879
You know

670
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,479
I'm always neutral.

671
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:16,800
Interest is my best ally.

672
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,639
Then, Chairman Cao,

673
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,439
what do you think I can offer to win you over?

674
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,439
Something that can make money, of course.

675
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:25,199
I've just told you.

676
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,520
This flower tea might taste ordinary,

677
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,000
but the energy recycling
technology that produces it

678
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,919
is a game changer.

679
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,040
With such impressive technology,

680
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,120
if you simply plant
tea leaves on the roof,

681
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,479
isn't it a waste?

682
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:40,360
If we can utilize it like Infinite Home,

683
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,479
present it as a new way of living,

684
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:43,600
so that it can integrate into Leisure

685
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,959
and even all our hotels across the country,

686
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,080
I imagine the future of our company

687
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,040
will be bright.

688
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,520
Come in.

689
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,560
Lin Miao...

690
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,600
Assistant Lin is sorting out
the documents at the pantry.

691
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,520
President Jiao.

692
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,479
How was your meeting
with Chairman Cao?

693
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,439
Although Chairman Cao

694
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,800
is the youngest member of the board,

695
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:13,719
she is very slick.

696
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,120
Judged from her ability and the
way she interacts with people,

697
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,399
she cannot be underestimated.

698
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,760
What do you plan to do next?

699
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,040
Keep talking to Chairman Xie.
Persuade him to meet with me.

700
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:23,679
I'll think about what to
do with Chairman Cao.

701
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:24,719
Yes, President Jiao.

702
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:26,199
And, again,

703
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:27,399
you must not let...

704
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:28,600
Assistant Lin finds it out.

705
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,280
No worries. I've kept that in mind.

706
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:35,239
I...

707
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:36,159
Assistant Lin.

708
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,199
It's late. Why haven't you got off work?

709
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:39,919
I tell you. If you bump into me again,

710
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:41,000
never mind getting off work,

711
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,360
I might not even be able to get home.

712
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:43,919
Hold these.

713
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,239
Is President Jiao in there?

714
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:51,879
No.

715
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,080
You're lying.

716
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,600
I heard people speak in there.

717
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:06,120
What?

718
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,320
What?

719
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,439
Jiao Yang, I'll ask you a question.

720
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,520
Are you and Xin hiding something from me?

721
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:16,040
You sent me away this afternoon.

722
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,840
Why?

723
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:20,280
Xin, that fool. So unhelpful.

724
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,800
We're exposed so soon.

725
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,879
Don't grumble about Xin internally.

726
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:27,360
You're not much of a good teacher.

727
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:29,479
That's why your protegee is so-so.

728
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:32,159
This...

729
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,879
If you don't tell me, I'll find out myself.

730
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,159
I can ask Ding Ding and find out everything.

731
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
Don't be anxious.

732
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,199
Xin and I are indeed

733
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,000
hiding something from you.

734
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,560
It's a surprise.

735
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:45,959
Surprise?

736
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,479
But before we even finish preparing,

737
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:50,000
you find it out.

738
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,879
Women's sixth sense is indeed

739
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:54,040
impressive.

740
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,840
No matter what happens,

741
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,320
I hope you won't hide it from me.

742
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,520
I can shoulder everything with you.

743
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,600
Lin Miao, actually...

744
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,520
Hello?

745
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,879
Got it.

746
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,320
Lin Miao, I have to go to the hospital.

747
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:25,120
After I visit my dad,

748
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,520
I'll come back and explain it to you.

749
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,439
Wait for me.

750
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:50,000
Look how adorable you were as a kid.

751
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,120
You were chubby.

752
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,040
Too chubby.

753
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,800
Yan, why are you here?

754
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,600
I'm... I'm keeping Uncle Jiao company.

755
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,360
Are you alright?

756
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,320
I'm fine.

757
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,919
Jiao Yang, look,

758
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,120
these are all the pictures

759
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,679
we took when we were young.

760
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:08,080
Aunt Jiao took them for us.

761
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,719
I thought

762
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:10,959
we had lost them.

763
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:12,800
But Uncle Jiao has kept all these.

764
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,919
How could I lose them?

765
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,199
These were

766
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:18,719
your Aunt Jiao's favorite pictures.

767
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:20,399
I still remember that

768
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,360
Jiao Yang gave you a Lego castle
when you both were young.

769
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,000
He said that he wanted to
marry you when he grew up.

770
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,800
I don't remember that.

771
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:35,520
Yan.

772
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,159
All these years,

773
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,959
I've treated you as one of our own.

774
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:43,919
If I tell you that

775
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,439
before I leave the country,

776
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:47,360
I hope that you and Jiao Yang would get engaged,

777
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,360
are you willing to do that?

778
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,040
Uncle Jiao, I...

779
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,000
No, dad. Look.

780
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,239
It has been such a long time.

781
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,360
Why do you bring up
my childhood anecdotes? It's silly.

782
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,120
Alright. Stop looking at the photos.

783
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,520
Okay, Yan.

784
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,520
I'll drive you home now.

785
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
Don't tire yourself out.

786
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,040
Okay.

787
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,879
Dad, get some rest.

788
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:10,320
Okay.

789
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:11,000
Let's go.

790
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,360
Alright. Uncle Jiao, take good care of yourself.

791
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,399
I'll visit you again.

792
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,600
Okay.

793
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,679
Yan.

794
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,040
My father worries that no one will
look after me after he goes abroad,

795
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,159
so he made a hasty decision.

796
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,280
Don't take it seriously.

797
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:29,399
Jiao Yang.

798
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,919
I don't mind.

799
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,719
Uncle Jiao just wants the best for you.

800
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,959
Yes.

801
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:36,080
I understand my father's concern.

802
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,800
He has spent most of life

803
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,199
on Hong Yu and me.

804
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:42,679
But you know,

805
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:45,239
no one can live under others' protection

806
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:45,919
forever.

807
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,879
I'll prove myself in the future.

808
00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:53,000
He doesn't have to worry about me.

809
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,159
Alright. Let's not talk about that.

810
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:56,040
I'll drive you home.
