171
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,440
What's it?

172
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,000
-Thank you, boss.
-Thank you, President Jiao.

173
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,559
Any drink?

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,440
Please.

175
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,640
Jiao Yang,

176
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,400
has been sacked by the board.

177
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,960
Heng Yuan project

178
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,080
will be his last chance.

179
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,919
I was informed that

180
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,000
Zhong Qing will join the bidding too.

181
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,000
It counts on you

182
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,359
to make his disappearance forever.

183
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,520
I'm still new in Zhong Qing.

184
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
I don't have a say in it.

185
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,280
It's not easy

186
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:07,840
to bid the project.

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,280
Don't worry.

188
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,775
[Internal Bidding Proposal]

189
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,039
Do your homework.

190
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,239
In tomorrow's regular meeting,

191
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,960
you'll get a surprise.

192
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,239
Thank you, Chairman Li.

193
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,119
Then,

194
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,280
wish us good cooperation.

195
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:27,520
Wish us good cooperation.

196
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,880
In the plan for
artificial cultivation of althaea,

197
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,640
the development of the supply chain sector

198
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,080
has to be optimized again.

199
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
Take these reference books

200
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,719
and read them.

201
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,799
Alright. Thank you, Dad.

202
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:49,880
Don't worry.

203
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,320
I'll read all these books

204
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,479
even if I have to stay up late.

205
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,599
It's not easy to meet you normally.

206
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:56,479
This time, you came here

207
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,799
not for the reference books of cultivation, right?

208
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,080
You're right. I have something

209
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,719
to ask you.

210
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:10,840
How did you pursue my mum?

211
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,479
No.

212
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,520
Don't get me wrong.

213
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,239
I'm going to join the bidding, right?

214
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:18,919
Will the

215
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,280
bidding process be the same as

216
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,280
pursuing a girl?

217
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,760
Your mum pursued me.

218
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,719
I didn't put any effort into it.

219
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,280
Don't be kidding.

220
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,559
You pursued Liang,
the famous designer, for three years.

221
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,320
It's well known in the industry.

222
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,039
Uncle Zhao has told me.

223
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,880
Seriously, Zhao.

224
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,200
Your mum rejected me for a few times.

225
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,719
I almost gave up.

226
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,840
However, I realized that

227
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,280
she cared about me

228
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,919
although she spoke harsh words.

229
00:10:56,359 --> 00:11:00,000
For example, she would

230
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,359
indirectly give me suggestions for designs

231
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,640
of the project I handled.

232
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,799
Besides, she

233
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,440
bought drinks for the colleagues on behalf of me.

234
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,440
Moreover,

235
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
your dad is so handsome

236
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,880
and realistic.

237
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,119
I was destined

238
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,200
to marry your mum.

239
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,520
Lend a hand unintentionally.

240
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:26,239
Buy drinks for the colleagues on behalf of me?

241
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,799
Women don't say what they mean, Dad.

242
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,200
Jiao Yang.

243
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:34,039
Handling a business is the same as pursuing a woman.

244
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,440
Perseverance is important.

245
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,479
You did well in

246
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:41,440
the development of the resort.

247
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,679
Although some problems might occur

248
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,280
in the subsequent work,

249
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
I believe that

250
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,679
you can solve everything,

251
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,559
like I always have trust in you

252
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,520
that you're the most suitable
candidate in developing the resort.

253
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,119
Thank you, Dad.

254
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,840
Oh, yes, Jiao Yang.

255
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,760
Recently,

256
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,840
I heard that a few

257
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,200
potential new companies from Heng Yuan

258
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,000
will join the bidding.

259
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,640
Do your best.

260
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,919
It's your only chance to win.

261
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:15,280
Cheng Jun.

262
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,599
You're back, Cheng Jun.

263
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,039
What do you mean?

264
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,520
You haven't eaten, right?

265
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,719
I've prepared for dinner.

266
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,000
It's been a while

267
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,760
since we ate together.

268
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,559
Let's talk while eating, okay?

269
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,760
Cheng Jun.

270
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,760
Did you forget something?

271
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,239
Today marks the anniversary of our first date.

272
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,520
You gave me a bouquet of daisies at that time.

273
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:50,719
You told me that

274
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,320
daisy means

275
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,679
hidden love.

276
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,239
You told me that you'd give me

277
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,400
daisies in every date.

278
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:58,760
I'm tired, Jun.

279
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,719
I don't want to recall memories with you.

280
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,880
It's my turn this time.

281
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,159
You cared about me.

282
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,200
You were tolerant of me. You gave me flowers.

283
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,000
Today, it's my turn

284
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,520
to give you daisies.

285
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:14,239
I'll take care of you. I'll change myself for you.

286
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,479
You don't have to do these.

287
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:17,760
I know. I know.

288
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,080
We've been together for a long time.

289
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:23,280
Four years.

290
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,840
Compassion fatigue is unavoidable.

291
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,679
I know everything about it.

292
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,799
I'm really changing.

293
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:32,000
See.

294
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,599
I've sent out many resumes

295
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,359
and made an effort in finding a job.

296
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:37,239
I promise you.

297
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:38,400
I won't go to your office

298
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,840
to find you anymore.

299
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:43,719
Cheng Jun. I...

300
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,400
We've been together for four years.

301
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,280
Nothing's changed, right?

302
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,119
You still love me, right?

303
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,000
If not,

304
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,840
we can restart it.

305
00:13:58,119 --> 00:13:59,479
Let's go back to the old days, okay?

306
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,919
Old days! Old days! You always live in the past!

307
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:11,080
Jun.

308
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,280
I'm someone different now.

309
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,000
I have a new job and a new life.

310
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,280
I've had enough of the old days!

311
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:22,359
I don't need a girlfriend

312
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,919
who lives in the past without any improvement.

313
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,119
Since we're still good,

314
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,280
let's break up gracefully.

315
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,359
Cheng Jun.

316
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,320
What did you say?

317
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:42,520
Let's break up.

318
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,080
We aren't a good match.

319
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,320
Not a good match?

320
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:56,239
We've been together for four years.

321
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:57,760
Now, you're telling me that we aren't a good match?

322
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,039
Jun.

323
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,840
You need

324
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,320
someone who can accompany you

325
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,359
and live with you every day,

326
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:07,479
while I need

327
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,440
someone who can improve
and grow together with me

328
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,479
in life and career!

329
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:13,359
Our lives will be different.

330
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:14,119
Do you understand?

331
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,440
I don't.

332
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:19,280
I don't understand why we don't match.

333
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,559
We've been together for four years.

334
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,239
How could you say that
we aren't a good match so easily?

335
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:28,679
Fine.

336
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,400
You won't get it forever.

337
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,039
Please leave.

338
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,119
I'm not leaving!

339
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:37,440
If you don't clarify it,

340
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
I won't leave!

341
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,840
I don't agree with the break-up.

342
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Give me a reason!

343
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,039
Why?

344
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,359
Which part doesn't match?

345
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,080
Cheng Jun. You...

346
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,119
Do you like someone else?

347
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,000
Who is she?

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,640
Enough!

349
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,239
Just stay here

350
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:58,559
and I'll leave.

351
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,599
I...No...I...

352
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,520
Which part doesn't match?

353
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,359
Lin Miao.

354
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,719
Dear managers,

355
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,159
You are holding

356
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,280
the photocopy of the
internal bidding proposal of Heng Yuan.

357
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,479
Later, Heng Yuan will officially
announce the bidding document

358
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,799
and start the bidding

359
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,000
of the development of

360
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,840
an area in commercial land.

361
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,599
I believe that everyone knows that

362
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,479
Zhong Qing upholds

363
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:04,920
the principle of fairness and justice.

364
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,439
All managers here,

365
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,880
no matter how old or how experienced you are,

366
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,199
stand a chance to represent
the company in the bidding.

367
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,880
However, your ability

368
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,319
decides the possibility of winning the chance.

369
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,640
If you have any idea,

370
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,760
please speak up now.

371
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,599
Do you have any idea, Director Su?

372
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,839
President Xue, and all managers,

373
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,719
I think that, the main idea of the bidding

374
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:27,880
is to develop long-term
cooperation with Heng Yuan

375
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,079
through this bidding,

376
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:32,119
so that we can be better in the industry.

377
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:33,839
President Xue.

378
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,479
Know yourself and the enemy, you
won't be imperiled in a hundred battles.

379
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:40,640
Oh, yes, President Jiao.

380
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,400
I've read the bidding proposal.

381
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,400
The bidding of Heng Yuan

382
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,839
won't be easy.

383
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,439
If it isn't over budget,

384
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,520
would they be willing

385
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,640
to share the profit?

386
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,800
You meant that Heng Yuan is
looking for another party

387
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,119
to share the burden of capital

388
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,040
and the risk?

389
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,119
Many luxury hotels

390
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,239
have diluted the customer base

391
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,760
around the area.

392
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:07,920
Now, it's going to be used

393
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,040
in bidding for the hotel development,

394
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
they will set a strict condition
on the other party for sure.

395
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,400
After we eat,

396
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,719
let's call an internal meeting

397
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,239
to gather ideas first.

398
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,119
No wonder Cheng Jun...

399
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,839
Come here, you wicked woman!

400
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,119
No!

401
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,900
[Outpatient Dept]

402
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,839
I didn't expect that she'd do it.

403
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,640
I'll apologize to Assistant Lin.

404
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,079
Do you think that Lin Miao

405
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,560
will care about someone who used her before?

406
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,520
President Jiao.

407
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,079
Don't simply say anything.

408
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,359
My mum didn't expect that
you'd become someone like this

409
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,040
when she hired you to work for Hong Yu, right?

410
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,319
You and Chairman

411
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,079
never accept me as a part of Hong Yu.

412
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,560
Letting the case of donation pass

413
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,359
doesn't mean that I know nothing.

414
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,199
Su Cheng Jun.

415
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,400
You'd better watch out.

416
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,640
I won't give Lin Miao and Hong Yu

417
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,160
to anyone.

418
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,400
We shall meet again.

419
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,439
I won't give my ground to you anymore.

420
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,560
Don't worry, President Jiao.

421
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:53,400
We shall meet again soon.

422
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,119
I tell you!

423
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,680
Su Cheng Jun has a girlfriend.

424
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,560
I won't allow you to get close to him anymore!

425
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,560
Manager Su and I

426
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,359
are just colleagues.

427
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,680
Just colleagues?

428
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,040
Would he sacrifice for his colleague?

429
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,000
Would he break up with me for his colleague?

430
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,640
Break up?

431
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,079
What a short relationship.

432
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,040
Short?

433
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,239
Su Cheng Jun and I
have been together for four years.

434
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,920
Why did you want to become his mistress?

435
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,439
Why did you destroy our relationship?

436
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,479
I've told you, miss.

437
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,359
It's a misunderstanding.

438
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,199
Manager Su has left Hong Yu.

439
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,800
Please solve

440
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,160
your relationship issue yourself, okay?

441
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,319
He's broken up with me.

442
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,479
Who else should I look for, if not you?

443
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,160
Was I someone so unreasonable in the past?

444
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,079
Great.

445
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,239
If you two have really broken up,

446
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,680
I don't think that it's not something unusual.

447
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,040
Perhaps, this break-up

448
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,119
might be something good for you

449
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,520
in future.

450
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,040
Instead of wasting time

451
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,880
on Su Cheng Jun,

452
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,000
why don't you spend time

453
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,280
in improving yourself?

454
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,160
What nonsense is that?

455
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:01,719
I was just giving you advice.

456
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,000
Instead of spending time

457
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,640
in doing these nonsense things,

458
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,119
you should learn the lesson

459
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,239
from the relationship to make yourself better.

460
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,800
Look at yourself.

461
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,400
Like a willful child.

462
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,040
Since Su Cheng Yu has dumped you

463
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
and broken up with you,

464
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,319
then you should let it go

465
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,280
and restart your new life, right?

466
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,319
Hey, lady.

467
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,520
Who are you?

468
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,599
On what basis you decided my life?

469
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:22,880
Did I waste my time?

470
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,239
Su Cheng Jun is my everything.

471
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:26,520
I'm telling you.

472
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:27,880
I won't allow anyone

473
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,319
to destroy our relationship!

474
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,359
Lin Wei Jun.

475
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,560
In future, you'll realize that

476
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,959
Su Cheng Jun is not

477
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:44,520
the most important man in your life.

478
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,479
The only thing that you can't lose is not him

479
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,680
but yourself.

480
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:54,000
Breaking up with him

481
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,839
is giving the utmost respect to your own life.

482
00:21:58,959 --> 00:21:59,680
President Jiao.

483
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,119
Here's the investigation report for you.

484
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:04,199
Lin Wei Jun. 23 years old. An orphan.

485
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,520
She was raised in a welfare center
after losing her parents.

486
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:09,000
She's good with a grandma
called Chen Rui Fang at the center.

487
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,640
Take it.

488
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:37,160
I don't like sweet food. Thank you.

489
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,599
I didn't expect that you
were like this ten years ago.

490
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,280
I don't believe it either.

491
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,160
Perhaps, God wanted

492
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,280
to let me know

493
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,560
how stupid and stubborn I was in the past.

494
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,319
If I could know the truth of the so-called

495
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,640
family member,

496
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,800
my life might have been different.

497
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,760
You're stubborn too now.

498
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,119
You don't tell your problems to others.

499
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,199
That's the reason you rejected me, right?

500
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,400
What?

501
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,800
Sorry.

502
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,959
You must have led a hard life

503
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,920
to become Lin Miao today.

504
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:44,119
Perhaps, God sent you back

505
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,199
for you to meet me.

506
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:50,719
Lin Miao.

507
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,160
You don't have to change yourself

508
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,280
to lead a different life.

509
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,119
You and Lin Wei Jun are totally different.

510
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,359
You have rights to decide your life.

511
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,439
So, I'm willing to be with you
to overcome all difficulties

512
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,760
and to open my heart.

513
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,680
Most importantly, you have to give me a chance.

514
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,199
Don't reject me again.

515
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:22,319
Take a candy.

516
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:28,599
To someone like you,
whose life is filled with bitterness,

517
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:31,239
the heart must need a lot of candies to fill.

518
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,920
Not really.

519
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:46,719
Someone with a bitter heart like me,

520
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,920
just needs a piece of candy.

521
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,719
Please wait at the lobby.

522
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,640
Later, Manager Lu...

523
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:26,920
We've been waiting since the morning.

524
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,160
When can we meet Manager Lu?

525
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,280
Our time is precious too.

526
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:32,359
Please urge him.

527
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:32,880
Yes.

528
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,800
Then, I'll talk to him now.

529
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,040
Please wait.

530
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,880
It doesn't make sense for

531
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,239
an assistant to sit while her boss is standing.

532
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:47,880
It's my instruction.

533
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:51,280
Don't doubt the decision of your boss. Sit.

534
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:53,319
Thank you, boss.

535
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,079
President Jiao

536
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:59,400
came here for the bidding proposal himself.

537
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:01,959
Who else could cover for him

538
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,760
after the donation scandal?

539
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,760
Hong Yu still dares to send him for the bidding.

540
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,359
Is it a shame to Heng Yuan?

541
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,520
Assistant Lin.

542
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,880
Have you ever watched A Chinese Odyssey?

543
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,319
Yes.

544
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,760
Did you know why Sun Wu Kong

545
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,560
had to kill Tang Seng?

546
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:35,839
He talked too much.

547
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,280
I was really angry just now.

548
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,000
Pass me the cup.

549
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,040
The value of a cup

550
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:55,680
wouldn't depreciate if it was overpressed.

551
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,560
An easy life is boring.

552
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,839
Congratulations, President Jiao.

553
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,520
A hard life is about to start.

554
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,920
Then, is Assistant Lin interested

555
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,439
in the game with me?

556
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:14,439
It depends on the rewards you give.

557
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:18,760
Manager Lu.

558
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,319
President Liu has assigned you

559
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,599
this important bidding project.

560
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,400
You have to meet so many companies in one day.

561
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,599
It must be hard for you.

562
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
Those companies

563
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,520
are not qualified in the aspects
of experience and ability.

564
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,920
It's just a simple job.

565
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:31,839
President Liu

566
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,199
is strict and firm.

567
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,319
He only emphasizes

568
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,079
the KPI and the price-performance ratio.

569
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,680
Only Zhong Qing,

570
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,280
a big corporate with talents,

571
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,479
is qualified to cooperate with Heng Yuan.

572
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:50,040
Excuse me. It was my wife.

573
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,280
Your wife looked for you.

574
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:52,359
It might be an urgent matter?

575
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:54,560
We're so worried

576
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,800
about our kids' schooling.

577
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,119
Manager Lu.

578
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,800
I don't have any child,

579
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,560
but it's nice to meet you.

580
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,959
I have a friend.

581
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,199
He's an expert in the industry of education.

582
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,719
He might be able to help you.

583
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,359
That's great.

584
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,719
I hope that you can contact him for me.

585
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:16,880
No problem.

586
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,040
Hello.

587
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,439
When is Manager Lu

588
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:22,640
going to meet us?

589
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,040
Manager Lu is still busy now.

590
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Our company arranges two days

591
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,439
for the collection of the bidding document.

592
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,680
If you all are busy,

593
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,760
please come tomorrow.

594
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,239
The official bidding will be after tomorrow.

595
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:32,439
How are we supposed to prepare

596
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:33,599
if we can't get the bidding document?

597
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,520
Heng Yuan is really a bully!

598
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,680
I'm sorry.

599
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,640
Don't be sorry.

600
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,839
Please think of a way.

601
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,319
I'm really sorry.

602
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,400
Hello.

603
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,760
Are you Manager Lu?

604
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,560
I am.

605
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Hello. We are from Hong Yu.

606
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,800
It's not your turn yet.

607
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,680
Please go back and wait.

608
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,839
We are the representatives from Hong Yu Group.

609
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Please wait for a while.

610
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,319
Someone

611
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,359
will serve you later.

612
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:00,560
Excuse me. Let me answer a call.

613
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:03,959
Hey. President Liu.

614
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,920
Yes, it's me.

615
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:07,280
I'm waiting for the
bidding proposal at your office now.

616
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,520
Okay. I'll meet you after that.

617
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,760
Alright, sure. Goodbye.

618
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,920
It's fine, Manager Lu.

619
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,760
Please carry on.

620
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,959
We'll go back and wait for it.

621
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:17,520
Let's go.

622
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,359
Please wait, President Jiao.

623
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,839
I'll give you the bidding proposal now.

624
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,800
Thank you.

625
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,839
You're welcome.

626
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,640
I make a move first.

627
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:27,959
Sure.

628
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:28,760
Thank you, Manager Lu.

629
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,439
You're welcome.

630
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,439
How did you know President Liu?

631
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,119
I don't know him.

632
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,000
But you answered his call just now, right?

633
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:41,680
10086.

634
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,199
Let's go.

635
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,560
Director Su.

636
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:50,400
I've provoked his emotion based on your request.

637
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,119
However, he didn't slam the door.

638
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,839
He got the bidding document.

639
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:56,359
Got it.

640
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,680
About our deal...

641
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,920
Don't worry.

642
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,199
I'll support you

643
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,680
with some projects in Zhong Qing.

644
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,400
Director Su.

645
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:06,680
Manager Lu is available now.

646
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,719
Here, please.

647
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,640
How's it, President Jiao?

648
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,680
How's the feeling of
overseeing your subordinate?

649
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,359
Great.

650
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,959
Excellent. Perfect.

651
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,239
There's something even better.

652
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,400
We're going to inspect the land on foot now.

653
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,470
[Heng Yuan Group]

654
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:24,760
According to the bidding document,

655
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,839
Heng Yuan is planning to shift its headquarter.

656
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:27,839
Yes.

657
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,040
The new building will be on that piece of land.

658
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:34,079
It looks like Heng Yuan

659
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,319
is really serious with this project.

660
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,160
Yes.

661
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,040
Let's go.

662
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:39,839
Wait.

663
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,000
Your shoelaces are loose.

664
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,520
I...I'll do it myself.

665
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,079
It's alright.

666
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,640
Please.

667
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:04,040
When the construction is done,

668
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:05,680
it'll break the record of

669
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,800
the tallest building in the city, right?

670
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,400
Yang Yang.

671
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,599
This is the new commercial
building developed by Hong Yu.

672
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,920
It'll be the tallest building in the city.

673
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,520
How? Does it look good?

674
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,680
Yes.

675
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:22,239
Of course.

676
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,000
It was designed by your mum.

677
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,439
Both of you must take care of each other.

678
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,760
So that I don't have to be worried.

679
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,880
Hong Yu.

680
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:48,920
It was once a landmark of this city.

681
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:51,400
It's a pity.

682
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,119
It's going to be replaced.

683
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,839
Lin Miao.

684
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,400
Do you know what I majored in

685
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,760
at university?

686
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,719
Business.

687
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,719
Actually, I studied architecture too.

688
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:07,400
Because of your mum?

689
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:10,239
Hong Yu

690
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:12,439
is the effort of my parents.

691
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,439
My mum was an architect.

692
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:15,880
My dad is a property developer.

693
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,359
My dad loved my mum

694
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,520
through realizing

695
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,560
her designs into buildings.

696
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,599
They knew each other's dreams,

697
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,760
and they realized each other's dreams.

698
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,280
They showed me that

699
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:32,719
love

700
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,920
means to realize each other's dreams.

701
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,959
It's cool and romantic.

702
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,000
However, Jiao is old now.

703
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,839
Can I really protect Hong Yu?

704
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,680
Very soon,

705
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:54,760
it will lose its shine

706
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
when a new building is developed.

707
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,719
The record of the tallest building can be replaced.

708
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,880
However, nothing can replace

709
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,400
your desire to protect Hong Yu for your parents.

710
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,599
Although we have gone through a lot,

711
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,920
I'm still not a qualified captain

712
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,280
in leading Hong Yu.

713
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,560
I'm afraid that

714
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,479
Hong Yu will fall behind

715
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,400
under my management.

716
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,520
I'm afraid that I'll disappoint my parents

717
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,079
and you.

718
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,719
Lin Miao.

719
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,479
Are you willing to be with me

720
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,359
to protect Hong Yu?

721
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,879
I'll need to go back one day.

722
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:12,120
I...

723
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:23,239
Let's take down

724
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,679
the project of Heng Yuan first.

725
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,040
I'll win it with your support.

726
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:47,639
Although there's a time gap between us,

727
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,919
Lin Miao,

728
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:52,040
I'll make you stay willingly.

729
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,360
Jiao Yang.

730
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:57,159
If I really return...

731
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,680
[Business hotel]

732
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,480
[Resort hotel]

733
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,639
This is the proposal you made overnight?

734
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,159
Business hotel.

735
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,280
Resort hotel.

736
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:24,439
Extended stay hotel.

737
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,800
Thank you very much.

738
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,959
They are all craps.

739
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,679
Come in.

740
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,399
Hello, Leader Jiao.

741
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:45,439
Hello, Manager.

742
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,919
Regarding my application of operating budget

743
00:35:47,919 --> 00:35:49,120
using the OA system last time,

744
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,239
you've rejected it.

745
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:53,479
The template and content of the application

746
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,320
were incorrect.

747
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:55,439
They didn't meet the standard.

748
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,600
I got no choice but to reject it.

749
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,639
However, I did the same before.

750
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:01,439
You were the vice president.

751
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,959
Normally, your applications

752
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:05,040
were amended and corrected

753
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,159
by the workers of the president office.

754
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:07,879
However,

755
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,159
you have to do everything yourself now.

756
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:12,919
I just did it according to the rules.

757
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:22,760
Alright. I'll fill it again.

758
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,919
Why these people

759
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,479
are so inflexible?

760
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,560
What's the advantage
of being inflexible in works?

761
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,959
Can't they just give a chance?

762
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:37,040
President Jiao. I've asked you not to go.

763
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,760
Why must you go?

764
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,600
It's good for him to hit a snag.

765
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,639
Who knows

766
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,520
if it's a way to train him?

767
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,439
Oh, yes.

768
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,159
I used your account of OA system

769
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:51,120
and resubmitted the budget application

770
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,199
after linking it with the approval of Chairman.

771
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:58,720
[Approved]

772
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,919
It's passed.

773
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:03,080
It's not good to take a shortcut.

774
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,000
Do you know it?

775
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,560
Although my position has been downgraded...

776
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,560
It's to train you

777
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,679
not to cut your tie with your Dad.

778
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,479
Moreover, we have only one day

779
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,320
for the proposal preparation.

780
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,520
We have no time

781
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,840
for them.

782
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:17,760
The most important thing

783
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,120
is to bid the Heng Yuan's project.

784
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,080
Remember.

785
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,800
A winner has the say.

786
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:25,520
You're right.

787
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,000
Your words

788
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,760
have enlightened me.

789
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:31,479
Let's start the meeting.

790
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,280
You all have proved to me

791
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,199
the reason for Zhong Qing under Hong Yu.

792
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:38,919
Luckily,

793
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,239
I have my plan.

794
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,360
Your plan is...

795
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:45,439
Around the area of Heng Yuan's land,

796
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:47,560
the competition among hotels is tough.

797
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:49,639
Currently, there are three-star hotels

798
00:37:49,879 --> 00:37:51,080
and two medium-sized hotels.

799
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,159
We have to make a unique proposal

800
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,959
to win the bid.

801
00:37:56,439 --> 00:37:58,560
So, my proposal is...

802
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,120
An urban eco-hotel?

803
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:03,280
Besides being surrounded by hotels,

804
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,239
there's an abandoned
man-made lake and a small farm

805
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,479
near the land of Heng Yuan.

806
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,439
Based on the experience of

807
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:10,080
Yue Rong development,

808
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,439
the concept of humanity
and environmental sustainability

809
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:14,280
will be the main theme in future.

810
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:15,919
When we develop it,

811
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,399
if we include the man-made lake

812
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:20,320
and the small farm in our plan,

813
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,399
and combine our plan with the

814
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:23,719
urban concept of this city

815
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,280
to integrate the hotel environment and nature

816
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,520
in making a whole new concept of urban eco-hotel,

817
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,199
then our hotel will be the most outstanding

818
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:35,719
by that time.

819
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:36,520
Yes.

820
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,080
The proposal has a balance
of marketability and vision,

821
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,600
making it a competitive plan.

822
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,080
It's just a concept now.

823
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,919
It needs to be refined.

824
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:48,399
However, something is missing.

825
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,919
Don't worry. Take your time.

826
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:52,800
It's great.

827
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:53,840
Alright.

828
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,159
Let me ask you all.

829
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,280
How does

830
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:59,159
your ideal hotel look like?

831
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:00,919
Perfect hygiene.

832
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,199
International brands of
bathroom and bedroom facilities.

833
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,760
Free snacks and drinks in the hotel.

834
00:39:10,879 --> 00:39:11,840
What do you think, Assistant Lin?

835
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:17,280
Make guests feel at home.

836
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,239
However, a hotel is not a home.

837
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,919
Normally, I stayed in a hotel

838
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:23,239
because of business travel.
Everything was done in a hurry.

839
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:25,080
Sometimes,

840
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,199
I didn't even check the room details
when I checked out.

841
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,879
So, I can't answer it.

842
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:31,560
No.

843
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,000
Your answer was good.

844
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,399
Is the making of proposal alright?

845
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,199
Welcome, Director Zhao. Please take a seat.

846
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,320
We're discussing

847
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,000
how an ideal hotel

848
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,560
should look like.

849
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,840
What's the outcome?

850
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,520
Since we have different opinions,

851
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:51,919
we don't have

852
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:53,479
a common answer yet.

853
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,439
There are just a few workers
in the president's office.

854
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:57,959
What can you get?

855
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,199
We learned statistics, right?

856
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,639
In performing a survey,

857
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:03,679
the randomness and distinctiveness
of samples are important.

858
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,360
Yes.

859
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:10,080
That's right.

860
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:11,239
It's good to see you here.

861
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:14,479
There's something that will
decide the outcome of this case.

862
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,719
You must do it.

863
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,320
Really? What's that?

864
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:27,760
Count on me.

865
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,639
The public relations team

866
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,120
has an extremely important task.

867
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,439
It'll decide the future of Hong Yu Group.

868
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,760
Distribute the questionnaires

869
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,120
to every worker in the company.

870
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,159
Please return them to me

871
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:42,639
before getting off from work.

872
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,600
Understand?

873
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:44,439
Got it!

874
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:45,560
Alright. Do it now.

875
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:48,679
Jiao Yang.

876
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,560
Do I look attractive

877
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,080
when I'm working?

878
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,560
Great.

879
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,040
Oh, no, President Jiao.

880
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,479
