00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,839
I... I...

173
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,119
What have I done wrong?

174
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,479
Why was there nobody?

175
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:10,520
We learn how to say goodbye

176
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,919
throughout our lives.

177
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,960
Say goodbye to our childhood,
friends and family members.

178
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,119
Say goodbye to the world.

179
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,039
However, every farewell

180
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,479
is followed with a reunion.

181
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:38,000
You have to do your best

182
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:43,479
and wait for miracles.

183
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,159
Crying is a symbol of weakness.

184
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,880
No one would be able to protect you

185
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,679
if you're haunted by your nightmare.

186
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,799
It's my life principle in the past 10 years.

187
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:02,799
I thought

188
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,799
I was strong enough

189
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,599
to say goodbye to the past.

190
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,039
However, when I saw Grandma Chen on her sickbed,

191
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,799
I know that I'm just a joke.

192
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,400
Lin Wei Jun.

193
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,479
I couldn't help you.

194
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,320
What I can do

195
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,119
is to warm you when you had the nightmare

196
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:26,719
happened 10 years ago.

197
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,640
No matter who you are,

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,320
thank you for comforting me.

199
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:40,280
Thank you.

200
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,239
The dearest stranger.

201
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,280
Besides,

202
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,919
[The marketing case of the hotel experience]
We'll arrange a personal butler

203
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,919
to provide 24-hour assistance
to every businessman,

204
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,159
so that the customer experience officers

205
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:26,400
can get our best service.

206
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,479
Don't worry.

207
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,200
Your son is really smart.

208
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:31,080
Like father, like son.

209
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,479
You can rest assured.

210
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,919
Don't worry, Uncle Jiao.

211
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,239
Although it is only for three days,

212
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,559
we've referred to

213
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,960
many excellent overseas cases.

214
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,799
It won't affect the quality of the event.

215
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,599
Mhm.

216
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:47,080
However, I didn't see

217
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,520
the tasks delegated to Assistant Lin here.

218
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Assistant Lin won't be involved in this project.

219
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:52,840
Why?

220
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,000
The project's been well developed, Dad.

221
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,080
I can handle it.

222
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,119
Assistant Lin must oversee this project.

223
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,359
No excuse.

224
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:01,080
No, Dad.

225
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,960
No problem, Uncle Jiao.

226
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,320
I'll arrange a position

227
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,039
for Assistant Lin in this project now.

228
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,760
Alright, carry on

229
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,119
based on the proposal.

230
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,760
Okay.

231
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,119
Good job for these two days, everyone.

232
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,559
We'll work overnight

233
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,400
to perform a final check of Leisure.

234
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,719
Customer experience officers
will arrive tomorrow morning.

235
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Yes. Attention!

236
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,719
Excellent workers.

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,880
Sorry, I'm late again.

238
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,039
Ding Ding. Please check

239
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,400
the water temperature and quality
of the pool as well as guest pickups.

240
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:17,960
Got it.

241
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,119
Ying Jun. Jiang Rou.

242
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,840
Both of you will decorate
the venue and check the menu

243
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,760
for the gala dinner tomorrow night.

244
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,559
Assistant Lin. You'll be a personal butler

245
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,119
of one of the customer experience officers.

246
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:28,400
What?

247
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,119
-What?
-What?

248
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,880
Yes.

249
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,119
Assistant Lin

250
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:34,960
is a member of our department.

251
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,559
She should be part of the program.

252
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,440
However, she's just a newcomer.

253
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,599
According to the rules of the company,

254
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,679
she can't take up an important job.

255
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,840
After some consideration,

256
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,400
I think that being a personal butler

257
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,039
can be in the program

258
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,799
and work hard with everyone.

259
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,840
Besides, the task

260
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,400
is similar to her job role.

261
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,479
It won't be a challenge for Assistant Lin.

262
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:56,880
What's your opinion, everybody?

263
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,760
Personal butler.

264
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,080
It's like a babysitter who provides 24-hour care.

265
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,280
That's too unfair.

266
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,239
Shall we agree

267
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:09,719
or disagree?

268
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,559
We agree if President Jiao's no problem with it.

269
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,239
President Jiao didn't say anything.

270
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,679
Don't be such a silly.

271
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,239
Can't you see that President Jiao

272
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:19,559
is dissatisfied with Lin Miao for a long time.

273
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,440
This order

274
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,080
was very likely made by President Jiao.

275
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,880
What do you think, Assistant Lin?

276
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:27,159
I...

277
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,760
Got it.

278
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,760
Great!

279
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,320
You all will be given two hours

280
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,239
to pack your stuff.

281
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:42,520
Gather at Leisure at 8 p.m.

282
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,280
Got it.

283
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,039
They have left, President Jiao.

284
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,080
All clear.

285
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,400
Finally, they've left.

286
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,159
President Jiao. If you don't have time,

287
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,080
I can get your clothes for you.

288
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,640
No, no, no.

289
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,520
I mean,

290
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:08,159
it's inconvenient since you
don't know where my stuff.

291
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:09,840
Then, I'm going to pack my things, President Jiao.

292
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,760
See you later.

293
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,479
No.

294
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,440
Xin.

295
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,239
Do you think to be a personal butler

296
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,799
is a difficult job?

297
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,799
She should have left, right?

298
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,119
It's my house. Why should I sneak?

299
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,159
Welcome back.

300
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,400
You scared me.

301
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,559
What have you done, President Jiao?

302
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,440
You are frightened.

303
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,080
I'm afraid to be late.

304
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,520
I don't mind taking public transport there

305
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,559
as so to ask you something, President Jiao.

306
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,039
What's that?

307
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,719
President Jiao.

308
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,200
What do you think about my performance?

309
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,039
Passable.

310
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,400
What about my personality?

311
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:19,400
Not bad.

312
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,960
But why do you treat me like that?

313
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,119
How do I treat you?

314
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,919
Yes. You're the president.

315
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,880
You can reject

316
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,599
the proposal I made overnight.

317
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,200
You can also deny

318
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,919
the contract I verified.

319
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
If you have doubts about my personality,

320
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,840
you can exclude me

321
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,760
from your project.

322
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,239
Not long ago,

323
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:38,840
you asked me to do my job.

324
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,119
Then, you gave me

325
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:42,039
the task that I'm not familiar with.

326
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,119
Can you

327
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,520
respect me?

328
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,679
I don't expect to discuss everything with you.

329
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,960
However, can you inform me first?

330
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:51,760
I didn't mean not to discuss with you.

331
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,200
It is...

332
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,640
So, you made the decision

333
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,679
at the last minute, right?

334
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,599
It wasn't my order.

335
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,320
Whose? Director Zhao's?

336
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,799
Do you mean that

337
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,960
Director Zhao made the decision

338
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,760
without your consent?

339
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,760
And you couldn't reject it

340
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,959
due to unforeseen circumstances?

341
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,079
This...

342
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,760
President Jiao. Did you think properly?

343
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,800
I've never been a personal butler at a hotel.

344
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,199
If I couldn't handle it,

345
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,920
it would affect

346
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,680
the project that you've prepared for many days.

347
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,599
Do you think that it's good

348
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:19,839
if the entire team's effort

349
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,920
will be in vain

350
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,439
because of your mischief?

351
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,880
Assistant Lin.

352
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,439
Listen.

353
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:30,479
Firstly,

354
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,560
you shouldn't be worried

355
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,760
about the decision of your boss, right?

356
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,680
Secondly,

357
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,599
please recall

358

the mistakes you've done.

359
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,119
Thirdly,

360
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,719
if you're unhappy with my working state.

361
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:45,800
you may resign at any time.

362
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,959
You think that I don't want to resign?

363
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,199
I tell you! I stay here...

364
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,920
To help you become the president,

365
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,439
so that I can return to the year 2020.

366
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,079
What's that?

367
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,800
I want to tell you,

368
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,359
not everyone

369
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,560
can joke with his career as you do.

370
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,239
Mhm, got it.

371

Please continue

372
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:07,560
doing your work.

373
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,640
I will!

374
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,319
I'll move out after coming back.

375
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,760
I won't disturb you again.

Their feedback and satisfaction

will affect the reputation of Leisure.

383

Meanwhile,

384
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,839
we must do our best

385
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,560
to satisfy them.

Jiang Rou is distributing

387
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,680
the information of the customer experience officers

392
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:09,520
Assistant Lin.

393
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:12,319
This is your first time
being a full-time babysitter.

394
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,359
No, I mean a personal butler.

395
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,560
So, I asked Rou to get

396
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,520
detailed requirements of that customer for you.

397
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,040
I hope that it helps.

398
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,239
Okay. Thank you.

399
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,839
Not bad.

400
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,000
Not bad. Not bad.

401
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:28,239
Hello, President Jiao.

402
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,760
Thank you, everyone.

403
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,239
Any question?

404
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,520
No.

405
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:35,800
Alright, dismiss.

406
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,880
Please wait, Assistant Lin.

407
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:51,000
Yan. I think that it's better

408
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,599
not to appoint Assistant Lin
to be a personal butler.

409
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:55,040
She hasn't been trained professionally.

410
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,400
She would make things worse if she made any mistake.

411
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,800
So, I suggest having her back

412
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,439
to be my assistant.

413
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,880
Since you're not confident

414
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,560
with the performance of Assistant Lin,

415
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:08,520
you can get her

416
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,400
an easier job.

417
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,439
No need.

418
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:13,560
The guests are arriving soon.

419
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,239
If there are any changes in the personal butlers,

420
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,920
it'll affect the flow of the project.

421
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,319
Although I wasn't trained professionally

422
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,000
to be a personal butler,

423
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:23,239
Director Zhao has given me

424
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,839
the client's info in great detail.

425
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:26,680
In a sense,

426
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,439
a personal butler

427
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:29,400
is likely the same as a senior assistant.

428
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,359
With the support of President Jiao,

429
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,079
I believe that

430
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,880
I can handle it.

431
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,920
It's better not to change.

432
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,439
You think that I'm so free?

433
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,760
Seriously.

434
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,239
Well, Yan.

435
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,000

436
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,319
I need to do?

437
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,319

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,119
He's a dilemma of choosing things.

517
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,119
What are both of you doing?

518
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,439
Why does it take so long to get the information?

519
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:45,000
Alright. Go, go, go.

520
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,199
It really annoyed me.

521
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,239
How is it possible

522
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:51,280
to have someone pickier than me in the world?

523
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,640
Why isn't it possible?

524
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,079
Why are you here?

525
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,199
You've been in the washroom for a long time.

526
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,640
Director Zhao asked me to find you.

527
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:01,040
What a busybody.

528
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,560
Don't listen to her.

529
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,119
You help Lin Miao now.

530
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,319
And report

531
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,719
her action to me.

532
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,880
I have to do it?

533
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,359
If not? I do it?

534
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,280
I invited Mr. Sui.

535
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,760
What if Lin Miao doesn't serve him well,

536
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,560
and ruins Leisure's reputation?

537
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,760
Go.

538
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,640
Yes.

539
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:17,920
Wait.

540
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:22,160
That... Don't tell her about it.

541
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,000
What if Assistant Lin knows it?

542
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:24,959
You...

543
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,800
Are you silly?

544
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,839
Must you help her directly?

545
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,760
Can't you

546
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,359
help her coincidentally?

547
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,680
I don't know acting, President Jiao.

548
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,119
So, you two are here.

549
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:41,319
I thought both of you have disappeared.

550
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,119
Let's go and check out the banquet hall decoration.

551
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,640
Alright, we're going now.

552
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,760
Xin has an upset stomach.

553
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,959
Go to the toilet now. Don't hold it. Hurry up.

554
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:48,959
Are you okay?

555
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,079
Is he alright?

556
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,680
No problem. Just diarrhea.

557
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,520
Let's go.

558
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,880
An unhygienic toilet bowl

559
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,800
will easily result in constipation.

560
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,560
It's more challenging
than serving the picky Jiao Yang.

561
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,839
Hey, Assistant Lin! What a coincidence.

562
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,640
Yes.

563
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,359
Yes, it's really a coincidence.

564
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,680
I'm just passing by.

565
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:52,839
Is there anything I can help?

566
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:54,199
No!

567
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,680
I've mopped the floor.

568
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,439
I've checked with a magnifying glass. No dust at all.

569
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,680
Don't step in with your shoes on!

570
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,199
Let me take off my shoes and help you.

571
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:02,000
No need!

572
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,640
I've done cleaning it.

573
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,119
This room needs ventilation.

574
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,439
You get on with your job.

575
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,800
Is there anything else I can help?

576
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,439
Nothing.

577
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:12,040
Please leave.

578
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,160
Where are you going later, Assistant Lin?

579
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,560
Since we've met,

580
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,079
let me help you.

581
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,920
I've told you nothing you can help.

582
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,560
Wait.

583
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,599
You accidentally entered Mr. Sui's room,

584
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,479
and met me in the washroom?

585
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,040
This...

586
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,400
Did President Jiao ask you to come?

587
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,760
That...

588
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:40,719
What did he ask you to do?

589
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,800
Under this circumstance,
the most important thing is

590
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,160
not to embarrass President Jiao.

591
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,640
I need to find out

592
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,079
a way not to embarrass President Jiao.

593
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:46,920
That's...

594
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,959
I'm here to oversee your job,

595
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:50,880
so that President Jiao won't feel embarrassed.

596
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,239
I make a move first, Assistant Lin.

597
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:02,719
Xin.

598
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,239
As the personal secretary of President Jiao,

599
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:06,280
you must know

600
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,280
what I've done making
President Jiao unhappy, right?

601
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,599
You won't want to see me

602
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,160
clean a toilet bowl forever, right?

603
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,760
Give me some hints.

604
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Don't you remember it, Assistant Lin?

605
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,680
It's something related to "CI*".
[*Lit: Here means resignation]

606
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:27,640
Huh?

607
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,599
That's what I could tell you, Assistant Lin.

608
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:32,439
You need to figure out the rest.

609
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:33,439
I'm leaving now.

610
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
[Dirty toilet will cause constipation]

611
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,839
No.

612
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,520
Porcelain*?
[*Lit: The same sound in Chinese as "Resignation"]

613
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:51,959
Ding Ding.

614
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:54,160
Your mathematics was taught by Ying Jun?

615
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,319
A chair's missing!

616
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,560
Aww. I forgot about it.

617
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,479
Let me do it.

618
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,160
No.

619
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,160
You all must be tired.

620
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:08,800
I'll treat you all after the event.

621
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,640
A feast?

622
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,920
What about a vacation in Sanya?

623
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:14,959
Cool!

624
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,520
Assistant Lin didn't need my help, President Jiao.

625
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,280
She went to the pool.

626
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,800
Seriously. What's so good to be stubborn?

627
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:33,199
Where are you going, Jiao Yang?

628
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,800
I'm going to check the water quality of the pool.

629
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,400
I think the dining hall has been well decorated.

630
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:42,199
Alright. Let's go.

631
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,680
Okay. Let's go.

632
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,040
Let's go.

633
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,439
The water temperature has to be in the range of

634
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,079
26.5 to 27.3 degrees Celsius.

635
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,280
When can I go back?

636
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,040
I don't want to be at here anymore.

637
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,199
We've checked the water quality of the pool

638
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:13,079
for twice.

639
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,959
The pH value is between 6.5 and 8.5.

640
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,719
The urea level is less than 3.5mg/L.

641
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:17,880
The amount of ozone is less than 0.2mg.

642
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,839
It meets the standards of swimming pools

643
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,319
of the International Olympic Games.

644
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,800
Mhm. Great. You all must be exhausted.

645
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
Jiao Yang. Do you think that...

646
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,000
Jiao Yang.

647
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,199
Isn't she Assistant Lin?

648
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,199
What's she doing at the pool?

649
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,199
Mr. Sui is particular with

650
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:36,680
the water temperature of the pool.

651
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,599
So, Assistant Lin is making a final check.

652
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:41,239
Xin should be following her.

653
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,400
Where is he?

654
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,880
Let's take a look there.

655
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,319
Your knee will hurt, Assistant Lin.

656
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:54,160
Let me get you up, Assistant Lin.

657
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,199
Thank you.

658
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:57,640
Are you okay, Assistant Lin?

659
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,000
Don't force yourself

660
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,119
if you can't.

661
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,479
It's not too late to get a replacement.

662
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,640
President Jiao.

663
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,359
Anything, Assistant Lin?

664
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:12,119
You're blocking my way, President Jiao.

665
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,959
I'm going to check the water temperature over there.

666
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,839
If you want to enjoy the pool,

667
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,520
can you get another spot?

668
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,680
Assistant Lin. I'm afraid that
you didn't measure it accurately,

669
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:26,000
and our guests will be slighted.

670
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,079
Don't worry, President Jiao.

671
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,439
I'll do it carefully.

672
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,839
Pass by unintentionally. Pass by unintentionally.

673
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,599
Come on. I can do it.

674
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,439

Assistant Lin! President Jiao wanted to help you,

687
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,479
but you pushed him into the pool.

688

No... I...

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,040
You got it wrong. President Jiao's so careful.

690

He didn't fall into the pool

like a clumsy loach.

692

He must be not confident with my ability.

693
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,760
So, he dived into the pool to check himself.

694
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,880

President Jiao. You've worked so hard

707
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:13,359
for the event.

please ignore my request, okay?

Last task.

735
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:27,439
The shower temperature
has to be 38 degrees Celsius.

Yan Xin.

737
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:32,479

you have to clean the floor.

If I can prove that it's my room,

742
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,199
you have to admit that

743
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:43,040
you're a female pervert who peeps at people in a bath.

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,479
brain was damaged in the pool.

747
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,120
Please clean up your mess.

00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:12,520
Wait.

Please admit your mistake.

750
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:14,600
You're right.

751
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,679
This room is not 5016.

752
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,800
But you've forgotten something, Assistant Lin.

753
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:22,000
All the rooms in the hotel

754
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,520

President Jiao.

756
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,320
Please return to your room.

However, the most important task now

You think that you'll be fine

765

President Jiao. The pH value is between 6.5 and 8.5.

The urea level is less than 3.5mg/L.

The amount of ozone is less than 0.2mg.

Don't worry.

I didn't mean that.

773
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:15,840
I mean, you pushed me into the pool purposely, right?

774
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,959
It was obvious, right? Silly.

775
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:23,959
You pushed me into the pool, making me wet.

776
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:26,439
Then, you directed me to the wrong room.

777
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,840
When I was taking a shower,

778
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,679
you peeped at me.

779
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,120
What a skillful tactic.

780
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:34,800
Tell me what you saw.

Especially the guest of this suite, Mr. Sui.

If the room

784
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,360
isn't cleaned properly,

785
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:43,520
do you know

786
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,120
the consequence and impact on Leisure?

787
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,159
What I saw is not important.

788
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,439
Moreover,

789
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:51,080
do I have to peep at you in a bath?

790
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:53,399
What did you say?

791
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:55,600
What did you mean?

President Jiao.

793
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:59,800
Please clean the room immediately, okay?

794
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:01,639
I'm asking you. What did you mean by that?

795
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:02,840
Explain it!

796
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,280
President Jiao.

797

The temperature of this room is quite low.

Please wear your shirt properly.

Or else, you'd catch a cold easily.

800
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:10,199
Explain it. You aren't allowed to leave.

801
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,159
I...

802
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:22,080
You said that you didn't do it intentionally.

803
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,040
I really didn't do it intentionally.

804
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:31,959
Well...

805
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,360
You... You ask Xin.

Stay calm.

808
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:42,679
Leisure is equipped with
an emergency power system.

Moreover, the 50th floor is the admin department.

The power will resume within five minutes.

811
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:50,399
What are you going to say now?

812
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:54,520
No... You didn't wear your shirt properly.

813
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,879
Did I ask you to wear properly?

814
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:57,320
You didn't wear properly, and you are blaming me.

815
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,399
What are you doing?

816
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,360
No. Don't come! What are you doing?

817
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,199
Apologize.

818
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,639
Please wear your shirt first.

819
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,719
It's fine if you refuse to apologize, Assistant Lin.

820
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,320
You help me put on my shirt.

821
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,719
You dream.

822
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,840
Not willing to?

823
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,760
Think again.

824
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:17,560
Five minutes are about to end.

825
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,919
When the light of this room is on,

I'll let you see if it's...

when cleaning the room,

833
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,560
I'll take off my shirt if I'm hot.

834
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,840
I'll clean it, okay?

835
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,639
Put it on.

836
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:46,120
You don't simply touch me.

837
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:47,719
Where are you touching now?

838
00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:49,040
You asked me to put on your belt, right?

839
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,679
Don't move! I'm putting it on!

840
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:51,439
I'm putting it on!

841
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,239
You haven't eaten yet?

842
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,520
Meals have been prepared
for the workers at the cafeteria, right?

843
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,320
Did I have time to eat, President Jiao?

844
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:18,040
You told me that you could handle it.

845
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,800
Okay.

846
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,520
Don't act like I was abusing workers.

847
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:24,760
Eat this first.

848
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,479
No! No!

849
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,959
No. I've picked them for half an hour.

850
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:31,199

There are two more here, right?

852
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,399
Mr. Sui has a severe OCD.

853
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:39,520
He can only accept an
odd number of fruit in the plate.

854
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,439
No!

855
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,399
To keep it an odd number,

856
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:51,719
you have to eat another one.

857
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,280
Fine. I'll eat it.

858
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:01,120
It's your customer experience event
that will be affected.

President Jiao.

860
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,239
You can return to your own room now, right?

861
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:28,560
I'm going to clean up here.

862
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,600
Annoying.

863
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,399
I don't want to stay here either.

864
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,800
What's wrong?

865
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,000
Have you ever seen

866
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,879
a president who walks in a bathrobe?

867
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,000
What do you want?

868
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,800
It's simple.

869
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:46,959
Take my shirt for me.

870
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,679
Since so...

871
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,199
No!

872
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,360
I'll take it, okay?

873
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,199
Hurry up. I'll wait for you.

I didn't give him the resignation letter.

00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,000
Don't you remember it, Assistant Lin?

878
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,959
It's something related to resignation.

I didn't expect that you would

881
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,560
secretly check personal things
of your workers, President Jiao.

882
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:54,719
What? What secretly check?

883
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,800
It was an inspection. Inspection, got it?

884
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,159
A stranger came to my house.

885
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,719
I had to inspect her to check
if she brought a weapon.

886
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,080
That's normal, right?

Yes, it's.

No wonder

889
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:06,800
President Jiao isn't satisfied
with my performance recently.

890
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,080
So, you actually read my resignation letter.

891
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,600
I don't understand what you said.

Actually, I didn't intend

to submit the resignation letter to you.
