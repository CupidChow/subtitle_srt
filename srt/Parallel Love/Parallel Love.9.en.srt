33
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:12,839
Director Zhao,

34
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,720
Yue Rong Villa isn't as good as Leisure Hotel.

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
There's no banquet hall.

36
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:17,679
This conference hall

37
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,440
is already the biggest venue in Yue Rong.

38
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,720
Why don't you

39
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,440
just make do for a night?

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,399
That's not an issue.

41
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:24,839
I appreciate your effort.

42
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,720
When I played games

43
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,080
with Jiao Yang when I was small,

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,240
that was how we decorated things.

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,080
Jiao Yang was super arrogant back then.

46
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,399
He wasn't cooperative at all.

47
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:41,800
Assistant Lin,

48
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,720
how's this?

49
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,119
Isn't this a romantic way to confess?

50
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah.

51
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,520
There's plenty of effort involved.

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,520
Director Zhao,

53
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:00,520
I wish that I were as brave and brazen as you,

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,600
chasing after someone you like

55
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,000
without regards for anything.

56
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,360
If you like someone, you must let him know.

57
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,199
This place

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,720
can actually be considered
the first home for me and Jiao Yang.

59
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:10,839
Home?

60
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,919
Yeah.

61
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,240
When we were small,

62
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,800
we stayed here for some time.

63
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,639
Isn't the place where you stayed
with the one you like

64
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,679
called home?

65
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,320
What's going on?

66
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,960
Assistant Lin.

67
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,160
Jiao Yang.

68
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,720
No.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yan, what are you up to again?

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,399
How am I up to anything?

71
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,679
Have you forgotten what place

72
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,919
I base these decorations on?

73
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,199
These are the amendments made yesterday.

74
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,800
I think that this part
needs to be amended again.

75
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,679
Does she have so many things
to talk about to Su Cheng Jun?

76
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,119
Yes, yes. I do remember.

77
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,240
I knew that you wouldn't forget.

78
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,639
Jiao Yang,

79
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,119
I have something super important

80
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,039
to tell you.

81
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,600
It has something to do with our future.

82
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,399
Let's talk about what step to take next.

83
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,000
Alright, go ahead and tell me.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,919
We still have a meeting to attend.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,800
To make huge amendments.

86
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,199
It doesn't have to be huge.

87
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,639
It's like, we'll know what to amend at that time.

88
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,320
Yeah, in terms of some details.

89
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,399
Jiao Yang, I like you.

90
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,440
No, no, actually...

91
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,880
Actually, only this part needs to be amended.

92
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,919
Then let's go through it again.

93
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,720
This stupid woman.

94
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,399
Does she think that I'm invisible?

95
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,160
That will work too.

96
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,079
Yeah.

97
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,959
Jiao Yang,

98
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,279
I...

99
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,600
Alright, we'll do as you say.

100
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,720
Come, let's start the meeting.

101
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,600
Assistant Lin.

102
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,119
I, I...

103
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:28,920
Assistant Lin...

104
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,399
Assistant Lin, Assistant Lin...

105
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,119
All he cares about is Assistant Lin.

106
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,160
I decorated this place for nothing.

107
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Now, the problem

108
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,600
is that the hotel staff refuses to cooperate.

109
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,480
There must be a reason for it.

110
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,640
So, the solution is very simple.

111
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,679
Find out the reason
why they refuse to develop the villa,

112
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,200
and get them on our side.

113
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,359
If they weren't

114
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,720
so aversive toward you,

115
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,040
this would have been easier.

116
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,559
Considering the current situation,

117
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,399
I reckon that

118
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,160
they won't tell us the truth no matter what.

119
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,880
The year 2010...

120
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:20,839
Let's try investigating Tianya Club.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,600
Yeah.

122
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,320
Some people may have

123
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,640
posted on the forum

124
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,959
to voice out their dissatisfaction.

125
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,959
If there's really a clash

126
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,440
between these people and the group,

127
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,920
I believe that we will be able to find it out.

128
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,399
But even if

129
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,679
we find out the reason for their aversion,

130
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,720
how are we going to convince them to work with us?

131
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,920
Win them over one by one.

132
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,200
This is great, Assistant Lin.

133
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,839
After working for me for so long,

134
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,200
you have finally shown some improvements.

135
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,839
Then, Assistant Lin and I

136
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,239
will win Chef Liu over today.

137
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:07,640
Manager Su, you talk to Ji Zi from the bar.

138
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,440
No way.

139
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,200
Why?

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,399
I... I. Because I...

141
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,559
Because...

142
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,839
Why don't Assistant Lin and I look for Chef Liu,

143
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,119
while President Jiao look for Ji Zi?

144
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,679
Manager Su is right.

145
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,519
Assistant Lin, what do you think?

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I...

147
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:38,920
I think that Manager Su's idea is great.

148
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,279
Chef Liu obviously doesn't
like President Jiao that much.

149
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,880
But Miss Ji Zi

150
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,720
would certainly be very happy if President Jiao

151
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,799
goes to talk to her at the bar.

152
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,200
Besides, Chef Liu is an artist,

153
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,519
and Manager Su majored in design.

154
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,239
I'm sure the two of them will find common ground.

155
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,160
How do you know that he was a design student?

156
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,600
My colleague told me.

157
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,519
Who was that?

158
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,200
It doesn't matter. Just go to Ji Zi's bar.

159
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,399
I'll head to the
restaurant with Manager Su.

160
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,119
No way.

161
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,399
You're my assistant,

162
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,200
so you must be in the same team as me.

163
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,440
Chef Liu finds you old-fashioned.

164
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,600
He wouldn't buy what you say.

165
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,720
I don't care.

166
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,679
President Jiao,

167
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,839
as a leader,

168
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,119
shouldn't you assign the most

169
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,200
suitable people to solve

170
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,119
corresponding problems?

171
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:26,600
Don't you think so?

172
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,239
I agree.

173
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,239
I believe that someone who focuses
on the bigger picture like

174
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:32,000
President Jiao wouldn't lose his professionalism

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,519
because of such a small matter.

176
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,239
In short, there are two key factors

177
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,239
to this mission.

178
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:38,200
Number one, trust-building.

179
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,320
Number two, finding the right timing

180
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,239
to solve the problem quickly.

181
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
Come on, let's work hard!

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,839
Let's work hard!

183
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,119
Let's work hard!

184
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah, let's work hard.

185
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:08,600
I called you here today

186
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,760
because I want to talk to you.

187
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,519
I remind you not to forget

188
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,359
this should have been
your company to begin with.

189
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,200
Yue Rong Villa

190
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,920
is what your mother left you.

191
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,200
Don't you want all of this back?

192
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,239
President Li, by doing this,

193
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:30,640
what do you aim to achieve?

194
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,320
It's very simple, just do as I say,

195
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,280
and you'll get

196
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,760
what belongs to you

197
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,200
back from Jiao Yang.

198
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,239
Yue Rong Villa will be the
beginning of your revenge.

199
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,799
As for me,

200
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,799
I just hate the sight of them
bullying others with their power.

201
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,980
[Wife, Ling Yu Jun]

202
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,559
Manager Su, come over here.

203
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,119
Assistant Lin,

204
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,119
these are the daisies

205
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,440
I specially plucked just now.

206
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,640
I wonder if you like them.

207
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,679
How did you know that I like daisies?

208
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,320
They're pretty fresh.

209
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,840
I heard that Chef Liu likes drawing,

210
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:32,919
so

211
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,320
I specially went to pluck some daisies

212
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,919
for you to gain some inspiration.

213
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,000
You were asking Assistant Lin
if she likes them just now.

214
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,840
I thought that you were giving them to her.

215
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,239
Based on my judgment as an artist,

216
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,200
from the aura you emanate

217
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,679
to the way you look,

218
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,000
you are a great match.

219
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,880
It's a shame

220
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,799
that you aren't together.

221
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,520
Chef Liu,

222
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,719
Manager Su has a girlfriend already.

223
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,640
Yeah.

224
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,200
About that,

225
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,119
I... I was just asking

226
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,359
Assistant Lin if she likes them.

227
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,080
If she does,

228
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:07,679
we can use them to decorate the dining tables.

229
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,119
The vase is already full,

230
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:16,039
but there are so many daisies left.

231
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:18,400
Why don't we give some to Assistant Lin?

232
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,640
Sure.

233
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,039
But I don't know

234
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,520
if Assistant Lin likes daisies.

235
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,280
Why do you want to buy daisies all of a sudden?

236
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,960
Have you forgotten again?

237
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,119
On our first date,

238
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:33,000
you gave me daisies.

239
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,440
On our first anniversary of being together,

240
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
you even gave me this

241
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,119
bracelet with daisy charms.

242
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,840
Beautiful girl, you certainly have good taste.

243
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,000
Daisies symbolize

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,359
deep-hidden love in the heart.

245
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,520
Your boyfriend must love you a lot.

246
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,239
Really?

247
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,599
That's for sure!

248
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,719
Assistant Lin.

249
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:53,840
Thank you, Chef Liu.

250
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,559
I'm just re-gifting what Manager Su gave me.

251
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,159
You should thank him instead.

252
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Thank you, Manager Su.

253
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:04,159
I'm glad that you like it.

254
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,440
Chef Liu,

255
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,320
your cooking is really great

256
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,599
and you can draw well too.

257
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:21,400
It's such a pity for you

258
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,359
to work at such a lousy villa.

259
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,440
So what?

260
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,359
When I hold a pencil, all I want to draw is food.

261
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,960
But when I'm cooking, I feel like becoming an artist.

262
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:29,719
In the end,

263
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:31,119
no one appreciates my talents.

264
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,559
I've already arranged everything for you.

265
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,280
The rest is up to you.

266
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:46,080
For a very long time,

267
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,880
no one appreciated my talent either.

268
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,359
Someone else stole the proposal
I spent all night on.

269
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,799
I was the one working overtime,

270
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:54,440
but he got the promotion instead.

271
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,919
I also used to think that

272
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,119
I would never find my way

273
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,039
no matter how hard I work.

274
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,239
But look,

275
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,559
in the end, President Jiao noticed me.

276
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,640
He gave me a chance

277
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,760
and brought me to Yue Rong.

278
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,200
As long as you don't give up,

279
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,119
people will definitely notice you one day.

280
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,320
I didn't know that you had such a hard time.

281
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,200
Being it hard or not

282
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:29,320
depends on if we have the determination.

283
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,400
But how many people

284
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,320
persist till the end?

285
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,200
Chef Liu,

286
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,799
I heard that you had drawn a lot of portraits

287
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,280
for the guests of this villa.

288
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
I feel that

289
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,520
you must have missed those days

290
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,080
when the place was full of guests.

291
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,119
What I can do about that?

292
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,400
It's just like the choice between
making art and cooking.

293
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,000
I can only choose one

294
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,280
as my job.

295
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,679
In this world,

296
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,320
you can't have your cake and eat it.

297
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,280
I'm heading back to rest.

298
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,200
Chef Liu.

299
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:05,760
Give him some time.

300
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,520
I believe that he'll come round.

301
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:09,440
Give him some time?

302
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,960
I'm giving you time,

303
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,960
and waiting for you to defeat Jiao Yang with me.

304
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:24,400
I've been waiting for you all day, Boss.

305
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,039
How do you know that I'm coming?

306
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,479
Coming here out of the blue,

307
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:31,640
I believe that you want just a drink, right?

308
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,159
I'm not easy to deal with.

309
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,559
My lips are sealed tight.

310
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,200
Why don't we play a game?

311
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,320
For every shot you drink, I'll answer a question.

312
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,239
What do you think?

313
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,719
No problem.

314
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,039
You're prepared?

315
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,520
Come on, then.

316
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,479
Why does Manager Zhou

317
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,880
dislike me so much?

318
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,559
Several bosses came before you.

319
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,039
All of them either wanted to
destroy the environment around

320
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,840
or dismantle the villa

321
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,200
in the name of developing the village.

322
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,400
Of course, he hates businessmen like you.

323
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,880
Yue Rong Villa has been closed
for the past two years.

324
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,919
Why are you all still staying here?

325
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,320
Because there's no other place

326
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,080
we can stay in at all.

327
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,520
Manager Zhou is a straightforward person.

328
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,919
He doesn't know how to suck up to leaders.

329
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:30,960
As for Chef Liu,

330
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,400
he hates making the same dishes over and over again.

331
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,159
Shan Shan is always sleepwalking.

332
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:37,119
As for me, I can't live without alcohol.

333
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,559
Even if we leave this place,

334
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,799
we wouldn't find anywhere to go to.

335
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,919
Moreover,

336
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,520
the scenery here is nice, and we are free.

337
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,559
Every now and then, there are even sexy young bosses

338
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,200
coming here to have a drink with me.

339
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:48,840
Why would I leave?

340
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,280
Then why are you all

341
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,119
insist on chasing us away?

342
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,320
because

343
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,679
you're trying to fire us.

344
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:13,000
It's my turn to ask you a question, Boss.

345
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,159
Yue Rong is such a problematic place.

346
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,119
Why do you insist on developing it?

347
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,719
Because

348
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:28,919
Yue Rong Villa is a place I want to protect.

349
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,159
You want to protect this place?

350
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,400
Miss Ji Zi, let me tell you.

351
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,359
My mother was an architect.

352
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,960
She had poured all her heart

353
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,119
and soul into designing Yue Rong Villa.

354
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,719
I stayed here with her when I was small.

355
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:50,280
I watched Yue Rong Villa

356
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,919
slowly came into existence

357
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,919
from the blueprint she was holding.

358
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,359
This place carries

359
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:00,200
beautiful memories between me and my mother,

360
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,159
and I want to give it a new meaning

361
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,000
with my own hands.

362
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:14,239
I didn't expect you to be a responsible man, Boss.

363
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,200
Boss,

364
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,520
I'm really envious of your fiancee.

365
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,799
What fiancee?

366
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:34,119
Look at your reaction.

367
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:36,640
Are you putting on an act with Assistant Lin?

368
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,799
How is that possible?

369
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,320
We are truly in love.

370
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,000
In this world,

371
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,239
very few men are able to deceive me.

372
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,840
Why don't I make you a drink,

373
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,599
to test if you're lying?

374
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,800
Choose one.

375
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,520
Congratulations, Boss.

376
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,640
This drink is called "Destined Lovers".

377
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,000
Boss, it seems that your destined lover

378
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,439
has really appeared.

379
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,520
But

380
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,359
usually people who choose this drink

381
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,599
would meet a woman who's like a demon.

382
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
Demon?

383
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,439
The base consists of two kinds of
triple sec orange-flavored liquor,

384
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:41,079
which signifies an unexpected encounter.

385
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,040
Meanwhile, vodka signifies
a lover who's hard to control.

386
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:45,079
That woman

387
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,000
might change your life.

388
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,640
And this change

389
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,160
might be good or bad.

390
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,479
Then, where is she now?

391
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:57,439
Heaven's secret mustn't be divulged.

392
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Boss, come closer.

393
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,400
Come closer.

394
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:07,040
You might think she's far away,
but she's actually right by your side.

395
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,680
President Jiao.

396
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,959
President Jiao, you're here.

397
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,079
Demon, go away!

398
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,400
Demon?

399
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,719
Have I done something to enrage you?

400
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,439
No.

401
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,319
I'm having a good chat here

402
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,040
with Miss Ji Zi.

403
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,000
Why did you come over?

404
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,119
I've just finished talking to Chef Liu,

405
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,359
so I'm coming here to discuss

406
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,520
ways to get you out of the forced marriage.

407
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,359
You don't have to care about that.

408
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:34,000
Shan Shan isn't my destined lover, anyway.

409
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,520
Destined lover?

410
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,520
What... What's going on here?

411
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,839
What a busybody.

412
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,239
It's none of your business.

413
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,319
Well, I'm going to sleep.

414
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:44,520
Good night, Miss Ji.

415
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,119
Why is he acting so strange?

416
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,199
He must have drunk too much.

417
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,239
He is adorable, isn't he?

418
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:57,280
Assistant Lin,

419
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,040
I'm really quite envious of you.

420
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,119
Envious? What's there to be envious about?

421
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,119
Let me tell you.

422
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,400
If you have a picky and

423
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,599
obnoxious boss like him,

424
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,880
your lifespan would be shortened by ten years.

425
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,719
Miss Lin, your drink is called "Wheel of Fortune".

426
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,839
Judging from your unhappy expression,

427
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:17,079
it seems that your wheel of fortune

428
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,239
has stopped somewhere

429
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:19,880
you don't like.

430
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,040
That's absolutely right.

431
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:25,920
I really dislike it indeed.

432
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,319
Miss Lin, you're a clever woman.

433
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,880
Since you can't change it,

434
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:31,560
why don't you enjoy the present?

435
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,280
My mum is mine,

436
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,000
and all these are mine too.

437
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,239
My destined lover is a demon.

438
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,160
Isn't my life too miserable?

439
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:36,599
Enjoy the present?

440
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,479
No way.

441
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,560
I'll have to return three months later.

442
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,680
I have to hurry up and complete the mission.

443
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,880
Ji Zi must have been bullshitting.

444
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,800
It's definitely bullshit.

445
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:55,880
Go and die!

446
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:12,959
President Jiao,

447
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,560
if you dislike this soft toy,

448
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,640
I'll throw it away for you.

449
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:17,359
It isn't right.

450
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,199
I'm the president.

451
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,640
Why the heck am I scared of her?

452
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,439
Give Wang Cai back to me!

453
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,400
Childish!

454
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,719
Just you wait!

455
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,040
I'm so pissed.

456
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:37,119
Ji Zi is right.

457
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,520
You're a demon...

458
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
A demon!

459
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,599
Throwing a soft toy, are you three years old?

460
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,839
So childish!

461
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,199
-You're still here.
-I...

462
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,119
She really comes and goes like a ghost.

463
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,400
We'd better leave soon, or else...

464
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:46,719
Sorry, dad.

465
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,079
I haven't been able to find

466
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,800
your favorite althaea

467
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,520
and fulfill your dying wish.

468
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,640
Althaea?

469
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,800
A conservation park?

470
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:21,560
That's right.

471
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,479
Isn't this

472
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:25,599
Crosswaters Ecolodge and Spa

473
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,479
where we had visited for a summer camp?

474
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:29,800
Yes, this hotel

475
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,040
is ranked one of the top 50 eco-resorts

476
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,439
by National Geographic.

477
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,640
At the beginning of this year,

478
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:39,439
the American Society of Landscape
Architects even presented it

479
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,119
the Global Landscape Architectural Design Award.

480
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,980
♪Cool the dream chasers with icy soda♪

481
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,100
♪Fill myself with glamor, take off my disguise♪

482
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,239
It's situated in a valley

483
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:49,119
more than 500 metres above sea level.

484
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,359
Although the number of visitors is

485
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,439
restricted due to its secluded location,

486
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:53,839
it's extremely renowned,
and it's hard to book a stay there.

487
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:56,319
This shows that eco-resorts

488
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,520
are the consumer trend of the future.

489
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,160
We can modify this place

490
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,520
into an eco-resort.

491
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,239
Hong Yu Group might not

492
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:05,400
profit from it in the short term.

493
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
But from a long-term perspective,

494
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:09,680
whether it's for future economic benefits,

495
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,920
or for Hong Yu Group to

496
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,199
make a name in local and foreign markets,

497
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:14,319
it would be tremendously helpful.

498
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,839
This way,

499
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,640
we can answer to the board of directors

500
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,280
without changing anything about this place.

501
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,000
Jiao Yang,

502
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,839
your suggestion is amazing!

503
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,800
I'll immediately contact relevant departments

504
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,560
and associations.

505
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:28,199
As long as we get
official recognition and approval,

506
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:29,359
we can start preparing

507
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:31,000
to build an eco-resort.

508
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,920
I have a question.

509
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,599
We have a plan now.

510
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:37,439
But what right do we have

511
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:39,439
to apply to become an eco-resort?

512
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,800
I've prepared.

513
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,040
Take a look.

514
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,880
A rare plant,

515
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:47,719
althaea.

516
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Not only it is a rare plant,

517
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,439
but it's also a first-grade state protection plant.

518
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,400
Aside from being beautiful,

519
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:56,800
it also has strong medicinal properties.

520
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,439
This flower is very hard to find,

521
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,520
but I believe that

522
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,040
we'll definitely find it

523
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
if we work together.

524
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,079
No!

525
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,599
Jiao Yang, I don't agree with this suggestion.

526
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,520
Why?

527
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,040
Because...

528
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:18,839
Jun,

529
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:21,199
I'm your father's colleague from
the Institute of Biology.

530
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,719
Unfortunately,

531
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:24,599
while your father was looking for althaea,

532
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,760
he encountered a landslide

533
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,710
[Operation Room]

534
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,439
and passed away.

535
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,920
[Operation Room]
Dad!

536
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:37,319
No, Lin Miao,

537
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,599
why on earth are you against it?

538
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,920
President Jiao also said just now

539
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:44,000
according to the information he found,

540
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,640
althaea

541
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,239
is an extremely rare plant.

542
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,400
It's very hard to find.

543
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,640
How can you guarantee that

544
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,000
we can find it within the limited time

545
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,160
that the company gives us?

546
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,040
President Jiao,

547
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,640
what Assistant Lin said does make sense.

548
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,599
Assistant Lin, if there is a will, there is a way.

549
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:02,119
How can you give up

550
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,280
before we even start looking for it?

551
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,079
Jiao Yang.

552
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,680
I believe that you'll definitely be able to find it.

553
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,119
No one is able to find althaea.

554
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,079
Lin Miao,

555
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:11,199
are you looking down on me?

556
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,959
When my mum first started designing

557
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,959
and building Yue Rong Villa,

558
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,479
she heard from the residents nearby

559
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:18,560
that althaea can be found in the mountains.

560
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,239
And Shan Shan's photo

561
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,800
happened to serve as proof.

562
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,160
To protect Yue Rong,

563
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:25,719
finding althaea is our only way.

564
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,000
But all these are mere hearsay,

565
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,119
and no one has seen it before.

566
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,000
Whatever it is, I disagree

567
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,040
to spend time and energy

568
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,520
on a plan

569
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,319
with such a low success rate.

570
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,920
I object to this suggestion.

571
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,800
Lin Miao,

572
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,439
as my assistant,

573
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:39,839
why can't you support me?

574
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:41,920
It's okay if you don't want to participate in it.

575
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,359
Just wait and see.

576
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,439
I'll definitely find althaea,

577
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,959
bring it in front of you and tell you that

578
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,400
I've made the right decision.

579
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,520
Let's go.

580
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,560
Here you go.

581
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,160
Thank you, Manager Su.

582
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,400
Assistant Lin, why don't you take a break?

583
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,359
I feel like being alone for a while.

584
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,599
Assistant Lin,

585
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,400
actually I feel that what you said was right.

586
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,959
It's not only time-consuming to look for althaea,

587
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:29,959
but the chance of finding it is also little.

588
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,280
Even though President Jiao

589
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,839
doesn't understand your intention,

590
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,800
but we cannot fight an unprepared battle.

591
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,000
Then, what are you planning?

592
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,439
These two days, after conducting

593
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:41,760
an on-site investigation of Yue Rong Villa,

594
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,839
I made a proposal.

595
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,760
[Rebuilding proposal of Yue Rong Villa]

596
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,160
The village of the villa is quite inaccessible.

597
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:53,160
If we only modify the place

598
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,040
based on what's already here,

599
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,839
it's not meaningful.

600
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:57,560
It would be better to dismantle
the existing Yue Rong Villa

601
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,479
and build a luxurious casino,

602
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:01,000
bringing in a new kind of revenue.

603
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:03,520
In this way, this place might stand a chance.

604
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:04,920
To demolish and rebuild?

605
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,640
Yue Rong Villa was designed by the chairman's wife,

606
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,199
and it carries a special
meaning for President Jiao.

607
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:13,439
I'm afraid that he wouldn't agree with it.

608
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,079
Manager Su,

609
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,160
since you've already made this proposal,

610
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,599
why didn't you just tell President Jiao

611
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,319
about it in the meeting just now?

612
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,199
Assistant Lin, you've been in
the company for a long time.

613
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:31,000
You know that when it comes to
a proposal for such a big project,

614
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,959
aside from convincing President Jiao,

615
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,680
I'll also have to get the approval
from the board of directors,

616
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,439
especially the chairman.

617
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,599
Considering my position in the company,

618
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:40,239
I'm afraid that it'll be hard to be approved.

619
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,239
What's worse,

620
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:45,119
some people might think that
I have an ulterior motive.

621
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,000
Ulterior motive?

622
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:51,599
This is quite a complicated story.

623
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,479
I'll definitely tell you if there's a chance.

624
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,760
But we are racing against time now.

625
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:57,239
Our priority is to

626
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,000
help President Jiao complete this mission.

627
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:04,800
Alright, Manager Su.

628
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:07,199
I'll go back and take a good look at this proposal.

629
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,640
You should get some rest too.

630
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,520
Alright.

631
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:28,920
Hello,

632
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,239
is the suggestion you made earlier still valid?

633
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,839
Thank you, but there's no need.

634
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,439
I'm not interested in being the director of

635
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:37,319
the marketing department.

636
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,079
I just want to remind you that

637
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,400
the limited time given by the board of directors

638
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,079
seems to be a little too lax.

639
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,760
President Jiao!

640
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,400
Wake up, President Jiao!

641
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,520
President Jiao!

642
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:56,439
Who's that?

643
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:57,319
There's a problem, President Jiao.

644
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,800
Yue Rong Villa is being sold.

645
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:00,719
What?

646
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:04,160
I absoultely disagree to sell Yue Rong Villa.

647
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:05,280
Jiao Yang,

648
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:08,160
you've been in Yue Rong for quite a few days,

649
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,040
but there's no progress at all.

650
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,640
During the board meeting this morning,

651
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,680
President Li

652
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,079
openly questioned your capabilities.

653
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,479
He then said that

654
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,439
some companies were willing to purchase Yue Rong.

655
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
The board decided that

656
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,199
if you can't present a new proposal

657
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,040
within a limited time,

658
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,760
we would follow President Li's suggestion.

659
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,439
Dad,

660
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,199
you know very well

661
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:33,280
what Yue Rong Villa means to me

662
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,239
and mum.

663
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:37,199
How could you agree with that?

664
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,599
Jiao Yang.

665
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:40,959
I asked you to go to Yue Rong

666
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,719
to prove your capabilities,

667
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,800
not to reminisce the past.

668
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:48,199
Yue Rong Villa has a special meaning indeed.

669
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,239
But we have to learn how to look forward.

670
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,439
Both your mother

671
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:52,719
and I

672
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:55,599
hope that you would grow up as soon as possible,

673
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:57,520
and be independent.

674
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,160
If you can't protect Yue Rong Villa today,

675
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:02,680
you won't be able to protect
Hong Yu in the future either.

676
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:07,880
Dad,

677
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,719
I already have a proposal on how to

678
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:12,760
develop Yue Rong Villa.

679
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,719
Give me three more days.

680
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,920
This time, I definitely won't

681
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,359
disappoint you and mother.

682
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,479
Alright.

683
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,800
-Jiao Yang!
-Don't follow me.

684
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:38,560
Assistant Lin,

685
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,800
please follow him and check on him.

686
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,920
What are you doing here?

687
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,719
To tell me that I can't find althaea again?

688
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:48,160
Didn't I say not to simply touch my stuff?

689
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,839
It's supposed to go here,

690
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,400
not there.

691
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,400
Stupid.

692
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,239
I'm stupid,

693
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,839
so when it comes to risky stuff,

694
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,439
I prefer to solve them using stupid methods.

695
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,040
Jiao Yang,

696
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,680
it's almost impossible to find

697
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,839
althaea in such a short time.

698
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,040
Why don't we choose

699
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,400
a safer solution?

700
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,800
What safer solution?

701
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,440
[Rebuilding proposal of Yue Rong Villa]

702
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:52,520
Is this the better solution you are talking about?

703
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,199
Rebuilding it?

704
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,239
How is this to protect Yue Rong?

705
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,520
This plan will destroy it!

706
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:07,800
Jiao Yang,

707
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,239
I know that Yue Rong Villa

708
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,520
has a special meaning for

709
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,600
you and your mother.

710
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,000
But you have to be

711
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,239
more realistic.

712
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,120
The villa is old-fashioned and inaccessible.

713
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,919
There's no potential for tourism
development around it either.

714
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,199
Even if we modify the existing place,

715
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,479
it wouldn't really be meaningful.

716
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,399
And the board of director wouldn't agree

717
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,600
with an unprofitable venture.

718
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,800
Do you want to watch

719
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,879
Yue Rong be sold off?

720
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:27,919
Since you know

721
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:29,280
how meaningful Yue Rong Villa is to me,

722
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,760
why are you suggesting that we rebuild it?

723
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:31,879
Lin Miao,

724
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,600
I don't mind anyone raising this proposal,

725
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,639
but not you.

726
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,320
Yes, Jiao Yang, I understand.

727
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,399
That's why I don't want you to be stubborn.

728
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,520
Does rebuilding the villa

729
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,280
mean that the beautiful memories
between you and your mother

730
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,840
will disappear?

731
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,199
They won't.

732
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,919
But if you insist on looking for althaea,

733
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,600
I'm afraid that you'll have to
pay an unimaginable price.

734
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,840
I'm afraid that you'll regret it.

735
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,320
If I follow this proposal to rebuild this place

736
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,399
until it becomes unrecognizable,

737
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,840
I'll really regret it.

738
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,520
You know very well that
I must protect this place.

739
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,600
Jiao Yang, look at this model.

740
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,199
Why is it different from the other models sold

741
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,000
in a mall?

742
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,399
Why aren't you willing to throw it away

743
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:16,679
even though it's already worn and falling apart?

744
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,159
You're just used to reminding yourself
of people by looking at things.

745
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:20,639
Even if these things disappear,

746
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,479
would it mean that we don't
miss people from our past anymore?

747
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,120
Why don't we rebuild them

748
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,600
to make them better in reality?

749
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,360
This is the best way to honor

750
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,239
those we care about.

751
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,600
You haven't experienced
what I had been through,

752
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,560
so you don't know what althaea

753
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,600
means to me and understand how I feel!

754
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:52,239
There's no need to say anything else.

755
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,520
Thank you for the proposal.

756
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,000
But unfortunately,

757
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,199
I don't agree with you

758
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,719
on this matter.

759
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,080
Now, I'm telling you as the project manager

760
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,080
and the vice president that

761
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,000
you don't have to follow up

762
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,360
the work at Yue Rong Villa anymore.

763
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,399
I'll ask Xin to drive you back later.

764
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:36,080
Indeed, I don't know how you feel.

765
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,239
Jiao Yang,

766
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,800
do you know how much I yearned for a home

767
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,520
after I lost both parents?

768
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:47,959
Mum!

769
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,040
[Operation Room]

770
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,470
[Operation Room]
Mum!

771
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,159
Child,

772
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,639
your mum had terminal cancer.

773
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:58,800
We have already tried our best.

774
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,679
Alright, Chairman.

775
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,399
I feel at ease after hearing what you said.

776
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:15,600
Don't worry.

777
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:17,080
I'll defintiely help President Jiao

778
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,840
complete the mission in time.

779
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,000
See you.

780
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,639
Chef Liu, Manager Zhou,

781
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,560
I have something to discuss with you.

782
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,760
Oh, you found it.

783
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:38,639
This is my only photo with my dad.

784
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,239
That field of althaea

785
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,560
was on a hillside that faces the sun.

786
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,520
It was the most beautiful flower in the world.

787
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,639
Shan Shan,

788
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:50,719
do you want to look for it?

789
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:52,560
She doesn't.

790
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,639
Shan Shan, come over here.

791
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:56,479
Uncle.

792
00:37:57,439 --> 00:37:58,120
President Jiao,

793
00:37:58,439 --> 00:37:59,760
the chairman just called,

794
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,040
and he has agreed with the proposal

795
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,199
to demolish and rebuild Yue Rong Villa.

796
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,800
Assistant Lin.

797
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,639
President Jiao is your superior after all.

798
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,320
Look at you.

799
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,639
Don't tell me that you're staging a rebellion.

800
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,560
Director Zhao,

801
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,919
the board of directors has
agreed with the proposal.

802
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,120
Besides, rebuilding Yue Rong Villa

803
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,320
is the best, fastest and most efficient choice.

804
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,320
Assistant Lin, I reckon

805
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,000
that you don't want to go through the hardship

806
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,199
of looking for the flower,
so you found an easy way out.

807
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:44,120
Chef Liu.

808
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,679
Miss Ji Zi.

809
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,800
Manager Zhou,

810
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,120
after being in Yue Rong Villa for so many years,

811
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:51,399
you agreed with Lin Miao's proposal?

812
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:54,879
I only side those who share my taste.

813
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,199
I have spent half my life here,

814
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:01,000
and no one has ever found althaea.

815
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,399
You're probably buying time

816
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:04,199
and deceiving us with your proposal.

817
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,719
How about you, Miss Ji Zi?

818
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,000
I follow what everyone does.

819
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,919
But, Boss,

820
00:39:13,439 --> 00:39:15,360
to be betrayed by your destined lover,

821
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,840
I really feel bad for you.

822
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,760
What destined lover?

823
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,040
Shan Shan.

824
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,239
Don't you want to find

825
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,840
your father's favorite althaea?

826
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,040
I...

827
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:28,520
President Jiao,

828
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:30,399
all of us at Yue Rong are united,

829
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:31,639
so please stop trying to persuade us.

830
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,040
We are united too.

831
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,000
There are only four of you.

832
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,840
But with Assistant Lin on our side,

833
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,080
there are five of us.

834
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,199
Boss,

835
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:42,719
shouldn't we listen to the majority?

836
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:47,840
Shan Shan,

837
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,879
althaea is the only connection
you have with your father.

838
00:39:52,879 --> 00:39:53,719
Shan Shan.

839
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:55,439
This might be your only chance.

840
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:57,159
Jiao Yang,

841
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,120
I...

842
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,479
What's with you?

843
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:01,760
Hurry up and take our side.

844
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,239
Shan Shan, don't listen to him.

845
00:40:03,439 --> 00:40:04,360
Take Uncle's side.

846
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:04,959
Shan Shan,

847
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,639
you're already grown up.

848
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:08,639
You can make your own choice.

849
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,000
Don't be influenced by others.

850
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,760
Shan Shan,

851
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,479
I heard from Manager Zhou

852
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,280
that your father was a botanist.

853
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,399
Yeah, he was a botanist.

854
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,639
He brought me to many places when I was small.

855
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,040
But I was too young,

856
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,639
and I don't really remember.

857
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,040
After my dad passed away,

858
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,120
Uncle brought me to the villa,

859
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,800
and I've never left this place.

860
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:28,639
Then, don't you want to

861
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,159
take a look at the world outside?

862
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,520
It's okay,

863
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,719
since Shan Shan doesn't want to lead the way,

864
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:35,239
we'll look for it ourselves.

865
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,959
As the project manager,

866
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,159
I hereby guarantee

867
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,719
that I'll lead my team

868
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:41,800
and find althaea in 48 hours.

869
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,919
Xin and Yan, come with me.

870
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:46,280
Manager Su, since you are good at paperwork,

871
00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:48,199
stay here and keep in touch
with the investigation team

872
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:50,360
while gathering information about althaea.

873
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:51,879
Once we find althaea,

874
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:53,399
we will contact the
investigation team immediately,

875
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,520
and apply for an eco-resort for Yue Rong.

876
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,479
Let's go.

877
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,600
Assistant Lin,

878
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,879
President Jiao is so insistent.

879
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,479
Manager Zhou,

880
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,239
you mentioned that

881
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:24,040
there's only one way out of the villa, right?

882
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:27,080
President Jiao,

883
00:41:27,399 --> 00:41:29,120
I can't find information about althaea.

884
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,239
Jiao Yang, neither can I.

885
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:35,639
Could it be that it's just like what they said,

886
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:37,639
no one had ever seen this flower before?

887
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,080
Director Zhao,

888
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,000
since Shan Shan

889
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,879
has a photo with her father as proof,

890
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,719
I'm sure that it does exist somewhere.

891
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,399
But we don't have any clue.

892
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:48,520
It would help

893
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,439
if we roughly know where althaea grows.

894
00:41:50,879 --> 00:41:52,520
How are we going to look for it this way?

895
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,719
Are we going to search for hills one by one?

896
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,600
What did you say?

897
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,560
I said,

898
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,840
are we going to search for hills one by one?

899
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,639
No, the previous sentence.

900
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:00,439
The previous sentence?

901
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:03,600
It would help

902
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,639
if we roughly know where althaea grows.

903
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:05,560
Yeah.

904
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,040
I've done some research.

905
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,719
Althaea can only grow on

906
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:10,639
red soil 500 metres above sea level.

907
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:11,959
Xin, quickly search

908
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,639
for hills with 500 metres above
sea level with red soil

909
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,199
near Yue Rong Villa.

910
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,399
Yes, President Jiao.
