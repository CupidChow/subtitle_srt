There are fifteen minutes left
for the meeting to start.

34
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,319
We need eight minutes to go back.

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,440
Two minutes for waiting for the elevator.

36
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,399
Two minutes for going up.

37
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,600
One minute for him to tidy up.

one minute earlier...

Twenty seconds to choose skills.

-Twenty seconds to choose equipment.
-What is this?

44
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,839
Twenty seconds to fight. Just right.

00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,360
Awesome.

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,559

I'll go with you.

Assistant Lin really...

51
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,720
splashed dirty water on President Jiao.

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,839
President Jiao got angry and went away.

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,880
Well done!

54
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,559
Tell the accountant.

55
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,039
Give her a bonus this month.

56
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,639

to help me give this brat a lesson.

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080

during the lunch break

have seen it.

62
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:07,600
This Lin Miao,

63
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,360
usually likes to pretend

64
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,240
giving orders to people.

65
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,600
When President Jiao comes back, she must be fired.

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,720
Hello, Xin.

67
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,679
It's too late now.

68
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,119
Please print a copy of the document on my desk

69
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,279
and send it to the meeting room.

70
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,240
President Jiao and I will go there first.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Goodbye.

72
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,559
I feel that this Assistant Lin

73
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:32,759
doesn't seem to be fired.

74
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,440
I didn't expect that your equipment
in the game is quite valuable,

75
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,279
although you are penniless.

76
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,759
President Jiao, when we were young,

77
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,360
we've all gone through
the stage of being a loiterer.

78
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,279
You see if this works.

79
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,119
Next time, if there is a chance,

80
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,839
I'll bring you

81
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:54,960
to fight with my brothers again.

82
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,679
President Jiao, the meeting
with the board of directors

83
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,080
is very important to you.

84
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,839
Can you be more serious, President Jiao?

85
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,759
Enough.

86
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,800
You regret that you have resigned.

87
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,440
You are just afraid of being fired by my dad

88
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:17,559
President Jiao, come out.

89
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,119
No, I can't afford to embarrass myself.

90
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,760
President Jiao, it is not obvious.

91
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,480
Only the blind can't see it, okay?

92
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,320
I shouldn't splash water on his head
if I knew it earlier.

93
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:38,239
How can you come in the man's washroom?

94
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:39,239
Shut up, don't move.

95
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,839
What?

96
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,160
Fortunately, I put this in my bag every day

97
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,559
for me to use it when working overtime.

98
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,359
I didn't expect to use it now.

99
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,760
Perfect.

100
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,440
Chairman, do you want to make a phone call?

101
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,279
One minute left.

102
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,799
I'm not late.

103
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,880
Jiao Yang is here, sit down.

104
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,079
I'm still worried that you are away

105
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,640
because we are going to discuss
the wedding event at the hotel.

106
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,079
No one is clear about the incident.

107
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,480
After all, you are directly in charge of this matter.

108
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,959
I was meeting a client just now.

109
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,839
I only realized that

110
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,519
Xin called me several times
after the meeting ended.

111
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,440
Only then I realized that

112
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,119
President Li had changed
the meeting time temporarily.

113
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:46,720
I almost had a car accident on the way.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,559
President Li.

115
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,079
So I should blame this on Xin or

116
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,040
you?

117
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,160
This is not the first time
to encounter an incident like this.

118
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,720
For example, the conflict of
the wedding date at the hotel.

119
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,679
For example, today's meeting is
temporarily rescheduled.

120
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,640
After all, the problems

121
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,279
originate from the company's work-flow.

122
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,200
So I always advise the company

123
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,880
to introduce an automated office system

124
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,279
and to implement a paperless office.

125
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:15,959
So that in the future,

126
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,880
we can trace back if anything happens.

127
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,040
President Li, don't you think so?

128
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,239
Assistant Lin.

129
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,720
Aren't you already planning to resign?

130
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,040
You should not be qualified

131
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,079
to participate in the
board meeting of Hong Yu Group?

132
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,359
That is just a rumor fabricated by

133
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,720
those who are jealous of Assistant Lin's ability.

134
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,559
The purpose is to provoke
my relationship with Assistant Lin.

135
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,839
Assistant Lin, since you have resigned...

136
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,040
Enough, Li Dong Qiang.

137
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,640
You are a director.

138
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,959
Why are you trying to make a fuss
on an assistant?

139
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,200
You have nothing to do all day long.

140
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,239
But I'm very busy.

141
00:06:59,239 --> 00:06:59,920
Chairman.

142
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,119
The overseas project department that
the company plans to establish

143
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,279
encountered some problems.

144
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,799
I'm going to the United States
for support for two months.

145
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,279
All right.

146
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,160
We are done with this now.

147
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:10,079
Today's regular meeting
will have several important things

148
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,359
to tell you all.

149
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,760
Firstly,

150
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,679
there will be a new member

151
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,279
of the higher management team of the company.

152
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:18,519
Please come in.

153
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:47,160
Dear directors, good afternoon.

154
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,079
I am Zhao Yan.

155
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:50,279
Please offer me your kind advice in the future.

156
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:54,000
Yan is the daughter of President Zhao.

157
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,200
She is also a very good returnee.

158
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,760
Starting from tomorrow, she will be

159
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,359
the director of public relations.

160
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,160
She can be regarded as

161
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,040
the new blood of Hong Yu Group.

162
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,799
Please welcome her.

163
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,079
The second thing,

164
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
I know that the other day

165
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,320
when I appointed Jiao Yang directly

166
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,239
to take over the group's hotel business,

167
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,239
there is dissatisfaction within the company.

168
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,000
I also admit that

169
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:40,840
this appointment is indeed arbitrary.

170
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,440
But after this wedding incident,

171
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,479
I think Jiao Yang has proven that

172
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:49,119
he can take responsibility and solve problems.

173
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,479
So today,

174
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,159
I would like to invite the directors here

175
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,719
to express your stand clearly.

176
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,440
If anyone else

177
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,200
has doubts about Jiao Yang's ability,

178
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,880
please state it out clearly.

179
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:02,960
If there is not,

180
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,559
I also hope that in the future

181
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,679
no one should

182
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,479
gossip about this matter anymore.

183
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,559
Okay, since everyone...

184
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,400
My flight is two hours later.

185
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,840
If there is nothing else,

186
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,239
let's end the meeting.

187
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,880
This assistant Lin is really extraordinary.

188
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,359
Look at you.

189
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,039
President Jiao is different now.

190
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,440
You see how much he protects you.

191
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:03,960
Li.

192
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,039
Cheng Jun.

193
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,119
What are the people in the president's office?

194
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,359
Where is the seat of the new Assistant Lin?

195
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,159
You are looking for Assistant Lin?

196
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,960
I have some questions on

197
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,640
the planning of yesterday's hotel rooftop wedding...

198
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,880
Manager Wu has some questions
and he asked me to ask her.

199
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,719
They are in the pantry.

200
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,080
Assistant Lin and President Jiao

201
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,280
went to attend the board meeting.

202
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
It will take a while for them to come back.

203
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,640
An assistant attends a regular board meeting?

204
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,599
It doesn't sound right.

205
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,719
What are the rules?

206
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,239
The rule depends on the one who is in charge.

207
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,559
Let alone a little assistant.

208
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,479
Even...

209
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,119
Has she been assessed?

210
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,479
Did she start working from the base?

211
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,000
This year, we are fighting for reincarnation.

212
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,440
You will lose even you are
left behind just a little bit.

213
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:42,479
You will lose even you are
left behind just a little bit.

214
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:44,919
Yan.

215
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,559
I thought you will be assigned

216
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,799
to Jiao Yang's team after you came back.

217
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,559
It seems that your original position
is now occupied by someone.

218
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,880
I still can help Jiao Yang
in the public relations department.

219
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,359
And compared with an assistant,

220
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,239
a director is more qualified
to work together with a president.

221
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,239
Jiao Yang.

222
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,159
You behaved really well today.

223
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:04,280
Your father and I are very proud of you.

224
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,760
Jiao Yang.

225
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,359
Yan.

226
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,679
Don't be rude.

227
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,159
Call him President Jiao when you are in the company.

228
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,799
It's okay, Uncle Zhao.

229
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,679
Yan and I are used to
calling each other's name like this.

230
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,599
That's not okay.

231
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:17,919
After all, you need to be formal
when working in the company.

232
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:18,919
Okay.

233
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,039
President Jiao, President Jiao.

234
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,960
Dad.

235
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,840
Please go down first.

236
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,280
I'll just take another elevator.

237
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,159
Assistant Lin and I have something to talk about.

238
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,599
I'll take the same elevator with her.

239
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,840
Jiao Yang.

240
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,440
President Jiao, if you have any questions,

241
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,520
just ask.

242
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,000
I still have something to do later.

243
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:18,359
How did you know that the board meeting today

244
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,280
was going to be related to me?

245
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,479
Today, you locked the chairman in the elevator.

246
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,799
Theoretically,

247
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,239
he shouldn't even care about you.

248
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,880
But he tried every means to remind you.

249
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,880
I think there must be

250
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,239
a reason why you had to attend the meeting.

251
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,080
How did you know

252
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,919
President Li wanted me to talk about the plan?

253
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,400
You are all bosses.

254
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,599
It's just a normal work-flow.

255
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,159
But that's not right either.

256
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,039
You are busy serving for the whole day.

257
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,280
How can you have time to know all these?

258
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,640
When you were scolded by the chairman,

259
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,559
I had some time.

260
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,080
Of course.

261
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,679
This is the survival skill as an employee.

262
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,359
I'm afraid that President Jiao
won't be able to understand.

263
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:06,760
Not bad.

264
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,919
Unexpectedly, you are quite excellent.

265
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,640
No, I'm not.

266
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,119
Your performance today in the board meeting

267
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:13,359
impressed me.

268
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:16,520
Of course.

269
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,479
See who's the leader.

270
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,239
But you also have credit for this matter.

271
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:21,440
Thank you very much today

272
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,799
for calling me back in time.

273
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:25,359
You're welcome.

274
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:30,119
I want to thank President Jiao for the shoes.

275
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,039
So you wear it finally.

276
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,559
Isn't it comfortable?

277
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,239
No.

278
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,960
How did you know?

279
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,960
Why did you reject it at that time?

280
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,479
It's too comfortable.

281
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,479
What?

282
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,039
Once you get too comfortable,

283
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,840
eventually, you will have downhills.

284
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,440
Assistant Lin.

285
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:03,960
About breaking your thing...

286
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,359
I apologize to you.

287
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,159
I also brought the broken thing to K for repair.

288
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
But it was only because he is very interested in it.

289
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,479
And I just gave him

290
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:18,359
a chance to improve his business capability.

291
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:20,280
So you should not think more about it.

292
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,559
Don't get me wrong, okay?

293
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,760
Okay, President JIao.

294
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,960
Forget it.

295
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:31,280
Actually, I am responsible for it too.

296
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,280
If there is nothing else,

297
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,239
President Jiao, I'll do my work first.

298
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:38,840
Assistant Lin.

299
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,080
Are you still resigning?

300
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,719
I still have something to do.

301
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,440
Assistant Lin.

302
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,679
It seems that you finally understand something.

303
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,119
It is difficult to find

304
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:07,400
a boss like me elsewhere, right?

305
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:11,000
The phone is gone.

306
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,400
I can't act on impulse.

307
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,760
Anyway,

308
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,280
Staying here to complete the task
is the only possible way to go back.

309
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,760
But today your performance is excellent.

310
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,320
So I have decided

311
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
to cancel your overtime and send you home.

312
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,640
President Jiao.

313
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,559
I may not be the same as you.

314
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,840
You have much time, but I'm busy.

315
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,400
I have a lot of things to do.

316
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:34,119
I have to drag it to tomorrow
if I can't finish them today.

317
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:34,640
If I can't finish it tomorrow...

318
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,119
Assistant Lin.

319
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:37,640
Work is never going to be done, right?

320
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,080
Assistant Lin, please call back
when you see it, from Su Cheng Jun.

321
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,359
Yes, you are right.

322
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,559
You go to the basement to get the car.

323
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,159
I will wait for you at the intersection
where I got off this afternoon.

324
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,679
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

325
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,159
You lad.

326
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,280
You think swiftly.

327
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:58,799
I will wait for you.

328
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:13,640
Jiao Yang.

329
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,440
Yan, why are you here?

330
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
I am waiting for you.

331
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:20,400
Jiao Tang, you have taken over Leisure.

332
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,159
Should you

333
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,440
bring me to the rooftop restaurant of Leisure?

334
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:25,320
I have something to do today.

335
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,840
I've checked your itinerary.

336
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,719
You have no work tonight.

337
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,280
You have a date?

338
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Of course not.

339
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,039
Then it's okay!

340
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,520
You are requisitioned by me tonight.

341
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:44,840
It can't be him.

342
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,280
Miss, are you okay?

343
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,079
Jun?

344
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,040
Why don't you like me?

345
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,479
Which part I am not doing well?

346
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:27,959
Don't be childish.

347
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,319
From today,

348
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,400
my name changed from Lin Wei Jun to Lin Miao.

349
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:52,079
Everything has to start over.

350
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,359
Didn't she say to meet at the intersection?
Where is she?

351
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,040
Jiao Yang.

352
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,359
What happened?

353
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:12,800
Are you waiting for someone?

354
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,040
No.

355
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,839
Why are we staying here?

356
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:17,880
Nothing.

357
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,079
Really.

358
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,880
I took in a stray cat

359
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,239
and made myself like a spy connector.

360
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,500
[Xin, find Assistant Lin at the intersections within 1 mile
of the company. Tell her I have something to do tonight.]

361
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,880
Jun, why are you here?

362
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,439
You got the wrong person.

363
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,079
Jun, I know I'm too busy lately

364
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:33,680
and I left you aside.

365
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,839
But don't make trouble, okay?

366
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,959
Let's go to the hospital first.

367
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,280
Let go of me.

368
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:38,439
Do not touch me.

369
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,040
I said you got the wrong person.

370
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:51,800
Jun.

371
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,680
Assistant Lin.

372
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,319
President Jiao.

373
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,560
Are you picking up money on the ground?

374
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,560
President Jiao.

375
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,040
Assistant Lin?

376
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,719
You both know each other?

377
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:09,680
No.

378
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,439
This is the case, President Jiao.

379
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,599
I just said I'll wait for you
at the intersection downstairs.

380
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,359
I didn't see the traffic lights clearly

381
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,760
when I was crossing the road just now,

382
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,560
I almost bumped into his car.

383
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:23,719
Are you okay?

384
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:31,239
Jun?

385
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,319
Cheng Jun.

386
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,319
My game account was stolen.

387
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,839
Where are you?

388
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,359
I'm at home.

389
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,400
This afternoon,

390
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,239
I don't know who stole my account.

391
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,520
A lot of my equipment is gone.

392
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,719
Jun, I'm dealing with a traffic accident now.

393
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:53,760
Talk to you later.

394
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,560
You are Assistant Lin?

395
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,839
I'm sorry.

396
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:03,160
I mistook you as my girlfriend just now.

397
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,719
You both look so similar.

398
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,839
Girlfriend?

399
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:12,199
I'm so sorry.

400
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,280
Assistant Lin, did you hurt your leg?

401
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,319
I'll send you back home.

402
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,839
You are injured, let me take you to the hospital.

403
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,959
No need, no need.

404
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,920
Follow me to the hospital.

405
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,439
Really, really no need.

406
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,560
By the way, Yan.

407
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,359
I'm really not available today.

408
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,400
Let's meet next time, you decide
the location and time.

409
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,599
Jiao Yang, what about

410
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,239
I take Assistant Lin to the hospital with you.

411
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,239
After she is fine,

412
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:42,560
we will go for dinner then, okay?

413
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,439
Director Zhao.

414
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,040
President Jiao, you go and eat together.

415
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,959
I can take a taxi to the hospital by myself.

416
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:48,359
Okay, stop talking nonsense, let's go.

417
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,079
That's it, Yan.

418
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:49,680
Assistant Lin.

419
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,359
Assistant Lin.

420
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,280
Assistant Lin, I'm looking for you.

421
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:57,680
Xin, you came at the right time.

422
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,560
Assistant Lin broke her brain just now.

423
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,239
I'm sending her for inspection now.

424
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,920
Your mission is to send Director Zhao home.

425
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,199
Okay, President Jiao.

426
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:07,839
Let's go.

427
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,479
I really can...

428
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,000
Xin.

429
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,880
What is her name?

430
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,839
Lin Miao.

431
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,680
Lin Miao, I remember it.

432
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,640
Director Zhao.

433
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,280
Can we go now?

434
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:32,560
Director Zhao, wait for me.

435
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,599
Assistant Lin.

436
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,640
Director Zhao, let me inform you.

437
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,119
If the company's car crashes,

438
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:01,479
my salary is going to be deducted.

439
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,119
Lin Miao.

440
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:03,520
When did she come?

441
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:06,280
Assistant Lin? Just a week ago.

442
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,319
One week?

443
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,319
Why does President Jiao treat her so well?

444
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,599
Director Zhao, let me report to you.

445
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,280
President Jiao is always considerate
to his subordinates.

446
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,280
Look, he also treats me well.

447
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,319
Although my work is done,

448
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,800
he asked me to send you to Leisure for dinner.

449
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,920
Stop talking nonsense.

450
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,239
From now on,

451
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,880
tell me everything

452
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,400
that happened between
Lin Miao and President Jiao

453
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,479
since she joined the company.

454
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:28,119
Director Zhao, I'm just his secretary.

455
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:29,920
I'm not sure about a lot of things...

456
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,280
You don't really know?

457
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,839
Yes, yes, I don't really know.

458
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,400
It's okay, I will make you clear.

459
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,680
I know, I know.

460
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,560
What bad luck, why did it happen?

461
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,000
Fortunately, he didn't realize.

462
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,439
Assistant Lin, don't be shy.

463
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,239
Say it if you want to thank me.

464
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:58,839
I'm ready.

465
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,119
Why are you still spacing out?

466
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,239
It is because I hugged you

467
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,479
or your head is broken?

468
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
President Jiao, I was thinking

469
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,359
why you rejected Director Zhao's invitation?

470
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,800
She invited you for dinner

471
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,839
but you didn't go.

472
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,439
You two are actually a good match.

473
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:22,800
What nonsense?

474
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:26,599
Although I had eight ex-girlfriends,

475
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,439
but Yan and I

476
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,160
are just good friends since childhood.

477
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,599
Is it?

478
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,119
But I don't think Director Zhao

479
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,199
thinks the same way as you.

480
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:37,439
You have time to think about other people.

481
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:38,839
Why don't you think for yourself?

482
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,160
Is your leg really okay?

483
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,719
Do you need to go to the hospital?

484
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:44,439
It's really okay, no need to go to the hospital.

485
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,439
You and Manager Su...

486
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,680
really don't know each other?

487
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,760
He is the manager of the company.

488
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,760
Good.

489
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You really don't know?

490
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,479
Don't know, I really don't know him.

491
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,839
President Jiao, do you know him well?

492
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,040
The Manager Su just said that

493
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,839
I look like his girlfriend.

494
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,280
Why don't you introduce us to each other?

495
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:24,280
Maybe we will have a good conversation?

496
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,439
No need.

497
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,920
There are so many people in the company.

498
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
You don't have to deal with him.

499
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:31,920
Okay.

500
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:39,719
What did you say?

501
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,119
She stayed with Jiao Yang for all night?

502
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:44,199
Director Zhao, that's because
they had not enough time

503
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:45,119
to prepare for the wedding.

504
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,479
He also gave her shoes.

505
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:48,280
Director Zhao, that's because Assistant Lin...

506
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,640
He vomited and got diarrhea
after having 18 cups of coffee because of her?

507
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,119
Director Zhao, you misunderstood...

508
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,839
President Jiao didn't vomit, and...

509
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,239
He stopped playing games for her

510
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:56,439
and came back to join the board meeting?

511
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:57,520
That's because the chairman

512
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,319
acknowledges the capability of Assistant Lin.

513
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,280
So he specifically assigned

514
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,359
Assistant Lin to supervise President Jiao.

515
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:04,920
You mean

516
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,040
Uncle Jiao acknowledges her capability?

517
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,599
That's why she is staying with Jiao Yang every day?

518
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:10,959
Exactly.

519
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:13,959
Thank you, Xin.

520
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,239
This is easy to handle.

521

No.

No.

537

I will...

538

I'll cook soup for you, okay?

539
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,800
No, I'll just eat instant noodles later.

540
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:03,800
Instant noodles are not good for health.

541

I'll make tomato and egg soup for you.

542

who stole my gaming equipment.

00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,560
What about my taste?

674
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,360
Unbeatable.

675
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,439
Ability to work?

676
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,919
Un... Un...

677
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,479
President Jiao.

678
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:19,040
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

679
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,479
Don't ask me these nonsense questions.

680
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:21,639
What are you trying to say just now?

681
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,280
I can't describe it, President Jiao.

682
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,080
Take a look.

683
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,840
I have never seen

684
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,239
[Resignation]
such a woman that is so ungrateful.

685
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:36,520
I let her be my assistant.

686
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,800
She actually said that I am...

687
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,360
Reporting to President Jiao,
boring, incompetent, ineffective

688
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,959
incapable, has no achievement, im...

689
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,479
Did I ask you to repeat?

690
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,560
Xin, tell me.

691
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,879
What have I done

692
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,719
since I became the president.

693
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
You have done a lot, President Jiao.

694
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,919
For example, the rooftop wedding last time.

695
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,239
Everyone in the company

696
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,520
is praising you.

697
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:05,320
Yes.

698
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,199
But that was what Lin Miao's idea.

699
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:10,159
The...the board meeting!

700
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:12,159
Last time during the meeting,

701
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:14,679
you see President Li couldn't even
say a word about our proposal.

702
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,639
That's right.

703
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,639
But wasn't it Lin Miao's idea too?

704
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
President Jiao, think about it.

705
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:25,760
You were featured on the cover
of the Global Business Magazine

706
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,959
as a new talented businessman
at the age of 25.

707
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,439
You were also rated as one of the
top ten best male covers.

708
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:34,639
This is an unprecedented honor!

709
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,040
But my question is what is my talent?

710
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,840
Then...

711
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,040
Okay, stop.

712
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:45,879
Let's not talk about it.

713
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:48,639
From now on,

714
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,000
I want to prove to her

715
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,439
my charisma

716
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:55,439
as the youngest entrepreneur in this century.

717
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:58,280
Xin, bring all the planning documents

718
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,399
to me.

719
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:00,159
President Jiao.

720
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,320
All the documents have been
collated by Assistant Lin.

721
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,679
She has already done the proposal.

722
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,879
Is there anything for me to sign?

723
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:06,800
Bring it to me.

724
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,560
President Jiao.

725
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:09,879
All departments already sent their documents

726
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:12,439
directly to Assistant Lin
following your instructions.

727
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,959
Then Assistant Lin will verify the accuracy,

728
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,679
feasibility and operability
of the planning for you.

729
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,760
Then she will sign and cop on behalf of you.

730
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,320
Is there any meeting that I need to attend today?

731
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,439
President Jiao.

732
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,840
The company has no meeting today.

733
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,560
Is there any trouble that I have to solve?

734
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,879
President Jiao, none.

735
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,360
Usually the company encounters
a lot of problems

736
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:41,239
such as the wedding crash and the proposal, etc.

737
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,639
But why is there nothing going on today?

738
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,399
President Jiao.

739
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,199
If our company encounters
these situations every day,

740
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,639
our company is going to be closed down.

741
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,479
Xin.

742
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,560
Break down all the documents

743
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,239
that has been managed by Lin Miao

744
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,479
and send it all to me.

745
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:00,800
And tear all the contracts

746
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,040
that she has stamped on.

747
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,959
Tell everyone in the company

748
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,040
Assistant Lin can only do her own job in the future.

749
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,080
All the contracts must be sent

750
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,760
only to me, understand?

751
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,520
Yes, President Jiao.

752
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:11,959
One more.

753
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,280
Hello, Cheng Jun.

754
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,399
I put your lunch at the front desk.

755
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:20,639
Remember to get it.

756
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,560
I did it for you by skipping my work this morning.

757
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,040
You have to finish it.

758
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,199
I know, I will go to work.

759
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,719
You were bullied by the director,

760
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:35,120
by the director badly,

761
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,439
I feel sorry for you.

762
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:39,919
Yeah, yeah.

763
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:44,679
I hope you leave a spot
for yourself in your heart

764
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,639
other than Su Cheng Jun.

765
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,280
What? We can't mention about any "Wu" word?

766
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:50,639
Not only this word,

767
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,159
any phrases, idioms,

768
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,280
sentences containing the word,

769
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,360
and also including any words
that have the same pronunciation with "Wu".

770
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:59,040
None of the four tones can be mentioned.

771
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:01,159
From now on,

772
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:03,080
this word is a taboo on our floor.

773
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,120
Understand?

774
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,840
-Understood.
-Understood.

775
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:07,679
Assistant Lin is here.

776
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,879
Sorry, Secretary Yan, I'm late.

777
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,760
This is the proposal for this month.

778
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:17,000
Would you like to give it to President Jiao?

779
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,479
President Jiao is already doing it by himself.

780
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:20,959
But...

781
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,280
You don't need to do the one for the next month.

782
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,199
President Jiao also plans to do it by himself.

783
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:28,520
Oh, right.

784
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,439
I have stamped on all these contracts.

785
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:31,879
Would you like to bring them
to President Jiao to have a look?

786
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:34,239
Assistant Lin, these are no longer needed.

787
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,080
President Jiao thinks
these contracts are important.

788
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:40,159
So he plans to manage them by himself.

789
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,760
But I have already reviewed

790
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,439
these contracts in details by myself?

791
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:46,800
President Jiao thinks that

792
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:49,360
some terms in them are not strict enough.

793
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:08,479
President Jiao has been
interested in work recently.

794
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,800
Nothing.

795
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,560
As one of the youngest entrepreneurs in the city,

796
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,280
our President Jiao has always been hardworking.

797
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,239
You are so good at speaking.

798
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,239
Hello, President Jiao.

799
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,080
How is it, everyone?

800
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,199
Is there anything that

801
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,479
you need my help?

802
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,439
Hello, President Jiao.

803
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,600
No, we are all good.

804
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,639
President Jiao, don't worry.

805
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,560
There is nothing wrong with us,
everything is normal.

806
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,760
What are you doing?

807
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,639
I'm not like you.

808
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,919
Reading brainless novels
during working hours.

809
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,439
Ding Ding, why are you insulting me?

810
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,719
When did I do that?

811
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,000
President Jiao, please ignore her.

812
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,120
President Jiao.

813
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,439
Bye, President Jiao.

814
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:56,760
Xin.

815
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,080
Will the people in this world die without a word?

816
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,320
Of course not, President Jiao.

817
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,360
It is originally insignificant.

818
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,280
No, President Jiao, I mean...

819
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:08,000
which floors do you want to go now?

820
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:12,120
Go to the first floor.

821
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,199
Then go up floor by floor

822
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:16,159
until I find a place that needs me.

823
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:17,479
Yes, President Jiao.

824
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,879
It's already three o'clock.

825
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:25,879
I remember Grandma Chen
had an accident at 10:00 p.m.

826
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,120
This time,

827
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,840
I must rush to the welfare center before 10:00 p.m.

828
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:34,439
Assistant Lin.

829
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:36,080
Assistant Lin.

830
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:40,280
Hi.

831
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,879
I would like to introduce myself.

832
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,760
I am Su Cheng Jun, the marketing manager.

833
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:46,439
I am really sorry about yesterday.

834
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,560
It's okay.

835
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,719
I also have the responsibility.

836
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:49,959
I was not careful.

837
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,520
Do you have anything?

838
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,040
The documents arranged
by the planning department

839
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,679
about the rooftop wedding
are lack of details in some parts.

840
00:40:58,959 --> 00:40:59,760
I heard that Assistant Lin

841
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,080
participated in the planning
of the entire project.

842
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,719
I don't know if I can ask Assistant Lin

843
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:03,520
for some guidance?

844
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:04,800
I won't take too much of your time.

845
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,639
This matters actually...

846
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:09,679
This is the chairman's request.

847
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,040
We are also aiming to learn from

848
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,280
President Jiao's excellent performance
for this time.

849
00:41:16,439 --> 00:41:18,280
Okay, let me give you a simple briefing.

850
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,639
Okay, thank you.

851
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,959
It seems there is really no place for me.

852
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,560
President Jiao, do we still
carry on the inspection?

853
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:43,479
Yes, continue.

854
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:48,520
Hello, Chairman?

855
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,439
Yes.

856
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,199
President Jiao is outside now.

857
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
I will tell him later.

858
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:54,760
Okay, okay.

859
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,679
President Jiao, the chairman said that

860
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:57,840
he would like to invite you

861
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,360
to his office for some matters
which are related to work.

862
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,840
So today we are using plan A, B, C...

863
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,639
Things related to work?

864
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,360
