00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,040
Okay.

508
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,719
Hello, Lin Miao.

509
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,959
Welcome to join Soulmate.

510
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,239
Please remember this exciting moment.

511
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,079
Soulmate's two brightest stars

512
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,520
will be born tonight.

513
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:44,959
There is no problem with two stars.

514
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,359
But only one of them can be the brightest.

515
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:49,319
Rest early.

516
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,680
I still have a task for you tomorrow.

517
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,479
I didn't expect that

518
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,040
I would become the planner
of Soulmate after all these.

519
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:11,239
Okay, everything goes back
to the original point.

520
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,239
Maybe this is the best ending.

521
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,719
Yan.

522
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:58,199
Why are you here?

523
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,760
Stop drinking.

524
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,079
Jiao Yang, I heard from Xin that

525
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,319
you locked yourself at home

526
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,839
since yesterday afternoon.

527
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,880
You neither picked up the phone calls
nor went to the company.

528
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:33,359
Do you know how much Xin and I
are worrying about you?

529
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,640
Uncle Jiao is still in hospital.

530
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,800
The board of director is now aiming

531
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,359
to annex Li Dong Qiang's shares.

532
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,040
Didn't Assistant Lin just leave?

533
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,160
You are still getting emotional
for falling out of love

534
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,920
like a middle school student?

535
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,160
Jiao Yang.

536
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:55,839
You let me down.

537
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,920
I understand everything you said.

538
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:06,920
I also know what I am doing.

539
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,000
I am Jiao Yang.

540
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,319
I am Hong Yu's successor.

541
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,439
I only have one day

542
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,839
to drink my pain away.

543
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,359
I will be awake the next day.

544
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,359
So I plead to you.

545
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,599
Leave me alone today.

546
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,160
Oh, my god.

547
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,599
I heard that Assistant Lin had resigned.

548
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,400
Who is the troublemaker

549
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,839
that is spreading rumors
about the president office?

550
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,000
Wasn't Assistant Lin

551
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,359
still working yesterday?

552
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:06,079
How come Assistant Lin's desk is empty?

553
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:07,439
No way.

554
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,640
What's wrong with you?

555
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,760
I just received a resignation email
from Assistant Lin.

556
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,079
It is true.

557
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,839
Why did Assistant Lin resign

558
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:15,920
so suddenly?

559
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,040
Even if she wanted to resign
to let out her position,

560
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,800
I'm not ready to take it over yet.

561
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:25,680
How can Assistant Lin be like this?

562
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,479
She didn't tell us about this big news.

563
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,680
I'm afraid I can't be called

564
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:31,880
the gossiper of the company anymore.

565
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,800
I'm afraid these are not the main points, right?

566
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,199
Then the main point is...

567
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,479
-President Jiao!
-President Jiao!

568
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,800
President Jiao.

569
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:49,560
Jiao Yang, I haven't eaten breakfast

570
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,479
because I came to you in a hurry this morning.

571
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,319
Come down with me for a cup of coffee.

572
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,100
[Building A, Hong Yu Building]

573
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,959
This is the task that you said?

574
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:18,520
Yes, although you are the planner,
I am the manager,

575
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,119
we still have another identity,

576
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:22,239
that is a leaflet distributor.

577
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,959
I tell you I can't do this job.

578
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,280
I'll resign now.

579
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,880
Don't, don't, don't.

580
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,479
How can you resign?

581
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:28,800
-Planner Lin, let me do it.
-Yan.

582
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,079
Don't do it, let me do it.

583
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,719
Ying Jun and the others always joke around.

584
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,599
I hope you don't mind it.

585
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:34,079
Jiao Yang, let's get engaged.

586
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,119
I said, stop kidding.

587
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,000
It is impossible.

588
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,319
I said, let's get engaged.

589
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,400
I'm not kidding.

590
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,800
I'm confessing to you.

591
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:53,920
Jiao Yang.

592
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:55,439
Marry me.

593
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,000
So that Uncle Jiao can rest assured
to go abroad to get treatment.

594
00:32:58,239 --> 00:32:59,199
I know

595
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,280
you have someone in your heart now.

596
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,479
But I am willing to wait for you to forget her.

597
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:05,920
Mister, Miss.

598
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,000
You two are going to get engaged?

599
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:09,119
Soulmate Wedding Company
is having an opening promotion.

600
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:09,800
50% off for everything.

601
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,479
Mister, miss, are you interested in it?

602
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,319
Lin Miao.

603
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,359
Shout out your slogan!

604
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,599
They are waiting.

605
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,040
Planner Lin, why are you running away?

606
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,800
Lin Miao, stop running!

607
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,280
Jiao Yang.

608
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,959
Planner Lin, don't run, Planner Lin!

609
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,199
You once said that

610
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,599
you don't want to let anyone down again.

611
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,959
She is not anyone.

612
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,439
She is Lin Miao.

613
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,800
I know, she is Lin Miao.

614
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,920
But because she is Lin Miao,

615
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,439
you should promise to get engaged to me.

616
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,760
If we get married,

617
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:59,599
only then we can protect Hong Yu Group

618
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,880
and Uncle Jiao can go abroad to receive treatment.

619
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,880
I think...

620
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,840
this is what Lin Miao wants too, right?

621
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:15,919
Okay.

622
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,959
I agree with you.

623
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,600
But I have a condition.

624
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,660
[Soulmate]

625
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,080
This is our company's chief planner Lin Miao.

626
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,000
No need to introduce.

627
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,040
We are friends.

628
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,159
Since you two are familiar

629
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,840
with our Planner Lin,

630
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,840
it would be even better.

631
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,080
If Soulmate Company can manage

632
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,760
your engagement ceremony,

633
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,879
it will definitely get the whole city astir.

634
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
If you are satisfied with it,

635
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,199
we also organize your wedding ceremony.

636
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,760
Would like to know when is your
engagement and the wedding?

637
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,040
Have you chosen a wedding dress?

638
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:47,840
No.

639
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,080
What about the venue?

640
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,560
No.

641
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,800
I guess the engagement rings have been bought.

642
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,239
No.

643
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,439
It's OK.

644
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:09,000
As long as there is a couple,

645
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
Soulmate definitely can

646
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,000
organize a good wedding ceremony.

647
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,159
Planner Lin.

648
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,520
Please lead the bride
to choose a wedding dress.

649
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,000
Assistant Lin.

650
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:24,000
We are so familiar with each other

651
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,080
and you know Jiao Yang well.

652
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,800
I believe you definitely can plan

653
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,040
a perfect engagement ceremony for us.

654
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,600
Right?

655
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:33,199
Sorry.

656
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,520
I can't help.

657
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:41,600
Why you can't help?

658
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,199
Answer me.

659
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:54,560
Why?

660
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
There is no reason.

661
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,479
This is not my job.

662
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:08,560
Was it your job to organize a rooftop wedding?

663
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:14,159
Was the hotel housekeeper your job?

664
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:18,840
Was it your job to invite an inspection team?

665
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,800
Assistant Lin.

666
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:23,439
You suddenly stick to the principle.

667
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:25,840
The real reason for your rejection

668
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,439
is really doubtful.

669
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:37,199
President Jiao, whatever you are thinking of,

670
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,360
you are thinking too much.

671
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:39,439
Furthermore...

672
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,479
Since I have resigned,

673
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,919
please call me Miss Lin.

674
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,280
Okay.

675
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,120
Miss Lin.

676
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,120
It turns out that not only
you are good at leaving without notice,

677
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,239
you are also good at
turning against other people.

678
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,600
Since Miss Lin is so anxious
to make our relationship clear,

679
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:07,600
it really makes me doubt that

680
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,520
actually...

681
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,679
You still can't forget me.

682
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,679
President Jiao, do you know why I dumped you?

683
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:27,000
Because you are always

684
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,879
being such a narcissistic
and arrogant person.

685
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,439
It's so ridiculous.

686
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,199
Since you are so persistent,

687
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,120
then it's fine.

688
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,280
I will plan

689
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,320

690
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:46,320
