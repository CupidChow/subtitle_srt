00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,160
Is he going to show up at all?

168
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,640
We've been waiting for a few hours.

169
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,519
Is he coming at all?

170
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,519
If he doesn't show up, we shall leave.

171
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,239
Yeah!

172
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,000
Am I seeing this right?

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,079
He has decided to make his first

174
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,839
public appearance in such a shocking way.

175
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,440
The enigmatic heir of Hong Yu Group

176
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,799
is truly acting as he wishes.

177
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,320
He is arrogant.

178
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,840
First of all, Thank you all
for taking the time to

179
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,799
attend the ceremony
to welcome me into the company.

180
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,960
Do you make your appearance in this outfit

181
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,320
as a sign of disdain towards the media?

182
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,880
It's so disrespectful.

183
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Do you do this on purpose?

184
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Yes, I'm doing this on purpose.

185
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,719
He is?

186
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:53,960
It's outrageous.

187
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,359
I purposefully picked this outfit out of

188
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:59,359
respect for today's ceremony

189
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:01,119
and you all.

190
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,599
I'm sure everyone knows that

191
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,679
Hong Yu Group was founded

192
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,200
by my father and his peers.

193
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:10,520
They had worked hard all their life

194
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,840
to ensure Hong Yu Group's success.

195
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,559
I, Jiao Yang,

196
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,239
feel the heavy responsibility that I take over

197
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
as the vice president today.

198
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,840
Therefore, I choose to present myself to you

199
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,039
in a simple outfit.

200
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,000
It's also to remind myself that I'm

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,840
not a boss in a fancy suit

202
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,719
who sits comfortably in my office.

203
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,440
I'll be humble in order to blend

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,719
in with the staff of Hong Yu Group.

205
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,840
I also wish our consumers know that

206
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,239
we vow to serve you.

207
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,080
From now on, I'll lead Hong Yu Group to

208
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,599
a greater success.

209
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,679
Thank you all.

210
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,159
Brilliant.

211
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,559
This is the first time

212
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,880
I've heard such a good speech.

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,239
It's genuinely astounding.

214
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:52,760
President Jiao is so talented and well-mannered.

215
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,159
Feel free to take my pictures.

216
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,880
Please find a good angle for me.

217
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,400
Take good pictures only. Thank you.

218
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:03,280
President Jiao,

219
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,320
your speech earlier brilliant.

220
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,359
But your personal life is even more fascinating.

221
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,919
Quick, zoom in on the neck.

222
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,119
Take the picture.

223
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,719
The neck. The neck. Take the picture.

224
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,440
From this angle.

225
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,919
Aren't you going to comment on what

226
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,080
happen during the ceremony?

227
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,359
Xin, tell me. Do you think that sort of

228
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:36,400
woman is qualified to be my ninth girlfriend?

229
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,440
It might affect Hong Yu Group's reputation.

230
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,039
What's the company going to do about it?

231
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:40,799
I...

232
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,080
What are you doing, President Jiao?

233
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,559
I'll drag her back to clear my name.

234
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,919
President Jiao, you can't go out now.

235
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,280
The reporters are out there.

236
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,679
President Jiao, President Jiao.

237
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,320
Who told you to let her go?

238
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,840
Didn't you order us

239
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,599
to drag her out?

240
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,440
You're rude.

241
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,799
So rude!

242
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,320
What should we do then?

243
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,200
Just leave her be

244
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,960
and let the rumor spread?

245
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,159
President Jiao, please open the door.

246
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,599
Can you answer our question, President Jiao?

247
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,280
President Jiao, don't you know that

248
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,239
our venue

249
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,679
is surrounded by reporters waiting to

00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,200
ambush you when you show up?

251
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,840
I think you'd better think about

252
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,440
how to explain yourself to them.

Are you here for the blind date or just dropping by?

257
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,359
Are you playing a trick on me?

258

What happened to the company?

259
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,479
Where's President Che? Where's Xi Xi?

260
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,479
Where's everyone?

00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,719
Well... Ma'am, it's 2010.

266
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,440
Did I return to 10 years ago?

Mr. Jiao, Mr. Jiao.

268
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,760
Don't go, Mr. Jiao.

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,000
Please answer our questions.

Mr. Jiao.

271
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,039
Answer our questions.

00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,239
Calm down, everyone.

273
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,960
One question at a time.

274
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,440
It's impossible.

275
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,080
There must have been a mistake.

276
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,080
I've spent 10 years to

277
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,200
build a new life, status, and career.

278
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,080
I refuse to stay in 2010, when I had nothing!

279
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,400
I must be calm. There must be a way to return.

280
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,080
I rushed here from the cafe.

281
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,760
There must be a

282
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,679
time tunnel or wormhole.

283
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,400
Hawking's <A Brief History of Time> says

284
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,359
that the time tunnel goes both ways.

285
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:17,039
If I go back there

286
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,919
and try to reopen that door.

287
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,359
Maybe I'll return to the present.

288
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:23,880
There must be something strange about that cafe.

289
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,280
Is it because of the angle of which I open the door?

290
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,039
Or I just didn't push it hard enough?

291
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,679
Miss,

292
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,440
you've been doing this for dozens of times.

293
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:03,320
You're going to break the door.

294
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,840
No, I won't.

295
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,000
If it breaks, I'll compensate you

296

no matter how much it costs.

297

Please leave.

Leave.

I was bringing tea to the chairman.

He's in there.

312

He has been fuming in there
for the past half an hour.

invited the press,

317

and even wrote you a speech beforehand.

00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,719
In short, this is a baseless rumor.

336
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,760
But I have a reporter friend
who was there yesterday.

337
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,880
He saw President Jiao grappling with a woman.

338
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,640
He even said he had a video of them.

339
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,159
He didn't release it because we're friends.

340
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,359
He's sending the video to me.

341
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,200
Did he see it with his own eyes?

342
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,640
Even if he did, it doesn't mean it's true.

343
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,080
There must be more to the story.

344
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:06,000
Obviously, someone is envious of President Jiao

345
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,400
and trying to smear his name on purpose.

346
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,919
Poor President Jiao.

347
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,239
Because of this tabloid news,
he is scolded by the chairman

348
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,760
for half an hour on his first day of work.

349
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:15,000
I knew that you're not interested in work,

350
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,320
so I tried to find an assistant for you.

351
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,599
I want that person to watch you for me

352
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,320
so that you won't cause any trouble.

353
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,359
You make me so angry.

354
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,039
When Hong Yu Group
wants to hire new employees,

355
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
within a minute,

356
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,599
the applicants would line up
from here to the ground floor.

357
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,520
But when I

358
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,039
try to hire an assistant for you, no one

359
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,320
applies at all. Why?

360
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,599
Perhaps my performance
the other day was too brilliant.

361
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:35,119
And people are intimidated,

362
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:37,200
Right. Just you wait.

363
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,840
We're Hong Yu Group.

364
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,359
Why can't we hire an assistant?

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,719
Yes.

366
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,479
But...

367
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:44,400
But what?

368
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:49,640
The job posting is fake.

369
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:52,440
President Jiao ordered me to create a fake link,

370
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:54,919
so aside from the chairman and Secretary Hu,

371
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,640
no one can view the job posting.

372
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,599
President Jiao is so smart.

373
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,000
President Jiao will be in trouble.

374
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,760
Do you know that?

375
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,800
Turns out my house from 10 years ago

376
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,040
looks the same as I remember it.

377
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,959
Luckily, I have a habit of keeping the key here,

378
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,560
or else I don't even have somewhere to live.

379
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,439
I'm really back into my home from 10 years ago.

380
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,839
Everything seems so familiar,

381
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,079
and so warm.

382
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,560
I'm really back in the year 2010.

383
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,160
But I'm not becoming younger.

384
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:35,239
How can I go back?

385
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,000
Welcome back to the year 2010.

386
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,079
Only if you help Jiao Yang become the president

387
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,359
of Hong Yu Group within three months,

388
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,640
you'll be able to return to the year 2020.

389
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,400
Or else you'll disappear forever.

390
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,959
Who's Jiao Yang?

391
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,000
What group?

392
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,800
What?

393
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,239
Jiao Yang?

394
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,760
[Jiao Yang]

395
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Ahh!

396
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,319
Hey!

397
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,280
Why did she pass out?

398
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,719
Is it because I can't meet
another me in the same time line?

399
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,040
No. Why is there another me?

400
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:29,560
God, are you messing with me?

401
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,280
You made me go back to 10 years ago

402
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,400
to face myself.

403
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,880
Did I do something wrong?

404
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,719
Is it true that

405
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,079
I'll disappear?

406
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,959
No, I don't accept this fate.

407
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:45,959
I want to go back.

408
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,199
But how?

409
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:49,839
Oh, right.

410
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,079
Jiao... Jiao Yang.

411
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,119
Search "Hong Yu Group".

412
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,119
What the heck? Who's Jiao Yang?

413
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,560
What does he have anything to do with me?

414
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,800
Hong Yu Group.

415
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,839
Jiao Yang.

416
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,599
Why should I help him become the president

417
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,520
in order to return to the year 2020?

418
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,439
Ugh, whatever.

419
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,359
[A Brief History of Time]
As long as I can go back.

420
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,040
But at least I've learned that

421
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,000
Jiao Yang is the vice president of Hong Yu Group.

422
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,680
That's progress.

423
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,719
Whatever.

424
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,560
I'll locate him first.

425
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,920
I have to give it a try even if it seems impossible.

426
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,239
No matter what will happen next,

427
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:37,719
I must get into Hong Yu to learn what's going on.

428
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,199
One minute from now,

429
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,599
if President Jiao hasn't come out,

430
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,760
I'll walk in with a parcel addressed

431
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,680
to President Jiao

432
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,880
and observe the situation.

433
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,280
If things get better,

434
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,800
I'll enter with a document
for President Jiao to sign

435
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,280
and compliment President Jiao
for his hard work lately,

436
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:58,640
so that the chairman will cool down.

437
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,119
If things take a bad turn,

438
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,319
I'll enter with a laptop and

439
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,400
say that President Jiao needs
to review contracts now.

440
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,040
Then the chairman will stop scolding him.

441
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,280
If the chairman doesn't cool down,

442
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,000
I'll pretend that I have an
asthma attack and pass out.

443
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,239
You call the ambulance.

444
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:11,719
The bigger the commotion is, the better.

445
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:12,959
The chairman will surely cool down.

446
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,439
One minute is up.

447
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,640
My friends, I'm heading in.

448
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,000
Hi, Chairman.

449
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:32,000
It seems that you're ready to barge in anytime

450
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,640
to rescue your President Jiao.

451
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,920
It isn't like that, Chairman.

452
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,119
This is President Jiao's first day of work.

453
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,959
We all need to report to him about our work.

454
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,839
Has anyone come for the interview, Secretary Yan?

455
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,199
Chairman,

456
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,959
not...not yet.

457
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,199
Since President Jiao hasn't found an assistant,

458
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,680
I'll part-time as your President Jiao's

459
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,839
assistant today.

460
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,239
I want to see how

461
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,319
President Jiao does his job.

462
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:09,520
Hu.

463
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:09,920
Yes.

464
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,719
Go to the ground floor entrance.

465
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,000
If anyone comes for the interview,

466
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,239
I shall end this meeting.

467
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,319
Ying Jun, you go first.

468
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,839
Secretary Yan, you go first.

469
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,359
I've been yelled at for the entire morning.

470
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,040
There's nothing else I can say to help.

471
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,119
You're such cowards. Watch and learn.

472
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,199
Go ahead.

473
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,640
President Jiao,

474
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,280
there's a package sent to us via express mail

475
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,839
that requires your signature.

476
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:45,839
Open it.

477
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:54,839
Whoa.

478
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,839
President Jiao, the photographer
of <New Entrepreneur>

479
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,000
who has just returned from Milan

480
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,160
is already seated.

481
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,479
Once the press conference ends,

482
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,760
he'll enlarge the photo he takes

483
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,040
into a huge poster

484
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,359
and send it to our company.

485
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:18,520
I can tell right away that
this photographer is unprofessional.

486
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:20,520
He should've taken the picture from my left,

487
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,880
but this lipstick stain on my right cheek is...

488
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,119
President Jiao.

489
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,079
I have a very important document here.

490
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,920
Our business partner
cares much about your opinion.

491
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,599
They say that without President Jiao's approval,

492
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,719
they would not dare to execute the plan.

493
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,199
Let's take a look at it then.

494
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,800
You...

495
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,199
My shirt is ruined.

496
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,800
Security?

497
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,079
Security!

498
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,800
Ugh. Why does it freeze at this time?

499
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,000
Security! Security! Security! Security!

500
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,319
This room is so stuffy.

501
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,599
I...I can't breathe.

502
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,199
Are you ill?

503
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,160
Quick, take him to the hospital.

504
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,880
Carry him out of here.

505
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,040
To the hospital. Take him away.

506
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,000
Excuse me.

507
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,280
I'm here for the interview.

508
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,520
Come over then.

509
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:27,760
-It's you.
-It's you?

510
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:28,640
What?

511
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,520
Do you know each other?

512
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:31,920
No.

513
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,239
No, I do know her.

514
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:33,719
Dad, it was her.

515
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:34,760
She's that crazy woman.

516
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,199
So you're Jiao Yang?

517
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,680
What a little brat.

518
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,719
What's your name?

519
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:48,040
Hello, I'm Lin Miao.

520
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,280
This is my resume.

521
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:01,920
Why do you apply for this job?

522
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,520
It's because I have a lot of experience in

523
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,439
event planning and organization.

524
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:11,359
Moreover,

525
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,040
I'm a dependable and careful worker.

526
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:15,520
I can make up for what President Jiao lacks.

527
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,079
I hope that I'll be able to assist

528
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,680
President Jiao in the future.

529
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,199
You wish.

530
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:29,959
Secretary Yan,

531
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,400
process her paperwork.

532
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,079
Huh?

533
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,439
What?

534
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,400
No, I don't agree with it.

535
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:39,680
Chairman,

536
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,119
what President Jiao means is

537
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:43,760
that we should gather more
candidates for a group interview.

538
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,239
Okay.

539
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:48,680
If you object,

540
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,239
I'll give you another option.

541
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,040
From now on, I'll come by to be

542
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:55,719
your assistant and help you with

543
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,520
your work every day.

544
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:58,880
What do you think?

545
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,599
I think she'll do a good job.

546
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,040
I'm looking forward to working with you.

547
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,839
Sure, President Jiao.

548
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,239
See you around, Chairman.

549
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,160
See you later, Chairman.

550
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,439
Is this a joke?

551
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:26,239
He's the youngest vice president in the world?

552
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,000
What are you up to?

553
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,400
Isn't that my line?

554
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
What are you doing at Hong Yu?

555
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,040
I'm here to be your assistant.

556
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,560
I only say this once:

557
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,400
Your pursuit is pointless.

558
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,319
I'm not interested in women like you.

559
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,439
I'm also only saying this once:

560
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,640
I'm only

561
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,599
interested in the assistant position.

562
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,640
As for you,

563
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,800
I'm not very interested in you either.

564
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,079
That's great.

565
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,439
You should leave then.

566
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,599
Leave now.

567
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,959
No, if I leave now,

568
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,319
I won't be able to complete my mission

569
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,079
and I'll...

570
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,439
Why didn't you leave?

571
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,079
Don't you have dignity?

572
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,560
Since I've chosen this job,

573
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,000
I have to be responsible for it.

574
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:24,439
Since the chairman assigned
me to be your assistant,

575
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,280
I must answer to him as well.

576
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,319
You haven't even started working here,

577
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,119
but you've learned to threaten me with my dad.

578
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,760
No worries. You don't have to answer to him.

579
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,920
I'll help you with that.

580
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,239
I'm going to talk to him now.

581
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,040
No.

582
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,199
Why not?

583
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:43,160
It's because this job is important to me.

584
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,280
I need it to make a living.

585
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,719
That's not my concern.

586
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,599
No, you must not leave.

587
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,439
You can't go.

588
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,800
Miss, did you forget about one thing?

589
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:13,319
The chairman is my father.

590
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:15,280
If I want to talk to him, you can't stop me.

591
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,400
Vice President Jiao, I'm your assistant.

592
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,400
If you insist on firing me,

593
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,800
you'll have to let your father

594
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,079
continue to be your assistant.

595
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,239
You dare to threaten me again?

596
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,359
All I want to do is find a job

597
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,640
so that I can make a living.

598
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,520
It doesn't hurt you in any way.

599
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,920
Not hurt?

600
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:38,760
Alright.

601
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,239
You harassed me at the cafe all morning,

602
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,079
tore my shirt,

603
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,280
came all the way to my company

604
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,839
to be my assistant?

605
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,280
Okay. I'll grant your wish.

606
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:03,959
I'm officially making you

607
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:06,160
my ninth rumored girlfriend.

608
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,520
Consider it a consolation prize
for your elaborated scheme.

609
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,000
What do you say?

610
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:17,839
Oops.

611
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,119
President Jiao.

612
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,079
You might have pressed the emergency button.

613
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:24,920
Hurry. Get out of here.

614
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:26,079
Why are you back?

615
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,040
If they know that I made such a silly mistake,

616
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,160
it would be embarrassing for me.

617
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:30,760
Does it count as your first order

618
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,640
to your assistant?

619
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,400
Sure. Whatever you say.

620
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,959
I've checked. There's no one on the 15th floor.

621
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,599
I'm looking forward to working with you then,

622
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,719
Lin Shui Shui Shui*.
[*Lit: "Miao" in Chinese is formed of three"Shui (water)"]

623
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,839
No way.

624
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,640
That Lin Miao was the person who ruined

625
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,880
President Jiao's introduction ceremony.

626
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,000
How dare she came for the
interview to be your assistant

627
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,119
and threatened you.

628
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,280
That woman has given

629
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,680
President Jiao so much trouble.

630
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,560
We must avenge President Jiao.

631
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:10,719
That's right.

632
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:12,359
Good.

633
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,719
Your loyalty is commendable.

634
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:17,400
If you're able to get rid of that

635
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
Lin San Shui.

636
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:19,800
I promise I'll

637
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,959
promote you to special assistants.

638
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:25,040
President Jiao's bully doesn't
deserve to stay in Hong Yu.

639
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,280
You can depend on us.

640
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,400
Let's wait and see, Lin San Shui.

641
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:33,000
Hi, everyone.

642
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,839
May I introduce a new employee.

643
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:35,959
From today on,

644
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:38,400
Lin Miao will be President Jiao's new assistant.

645
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,160
Please, welcome.

646
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:44,000
Hi, everyone. I'm Lin Miao.

647
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,439
I'm looking forward to working with you.

648
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:47,400
Lin Miao, I'll process your request

649
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,640
for employee accommodation.

650
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,199
You'll be able to move in tonight.

651
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:51,920
That's great. Thank you, Manager.

652
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,160
I'll wait for your good news. Okay.

653
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,040
Thanks.

654
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,359
Where is my seat?

655
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,040
Although you passed the interview,

656
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,479
we still have a test for you.

657
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,520
These are the company's financial reports
for the past three years.

658
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,920
I expect Assistant Lin to organize
and archive them within an hour.

659
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,400
Alright. Hand them over

660
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:27,040
to me.

661
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,640
Ugh, why is the blind broken?

662
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,560
This blind...

663
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:42,599
President Jiao, this is Assistant Lin's

664
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,640
application to move into Hong Yu
Group condominium for employees.

665
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,880
The HR department has already approved.

666
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,719
We just need your signature.

667
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:48,800
Alright. Put it there for now

668
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,800
and get out.

669
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,680
I'm fixing the blind.

670
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,920
Okay.

671
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,959
I need to get someone to fix this blind.

672
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,520
I took 55 minutes.

673
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,600
Sorry for waiting.

674
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:27,639
Assistant Lin.

675
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,719
three years of reports can't give you a full picture

676
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,080
of the company's finance situation.

677
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,520
Well,

678
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,199
how many years of reports should I sort through?

679
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,600
Uh...

680
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,840
Manager Su, why are you here?

681
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,360
Manager Wu is busy with something else,

682
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,080
so I'm delivering the latest
project proposals on his behalf.

683
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:51,320
We should break up. This isn't working.

684
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:00,239
This is...

685
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,679
This is President Jiao's new assistant.

686
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,199
Hi, I'm Su Cheng Jun from the marketing department.

687
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,399
Assistant Lin,

688
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,159
President Jiao asks you to see him in his office.

689
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,520
Why do you look so pale?

690
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,560
Your phone is ringing.

691
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,520
President Jiao, is there anything
I can help you with?

692
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,159
Get out.

693
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,000
Didn't you ask me to come in?

694
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,000
I did.

695
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,719
But don't you know the basic workplace

696
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,719
etiquette?

697
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,199
President Jiao, may I come in?

698
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,439
Come in.

699
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,959
Is there anything I can
help you with, President Jiao?

700
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,159
Manager Su, sorry about that.

701
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,600
We had a small argument just now.

702
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,679
She seems to be angry.

703
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:18,919
Manager Su, Manager Su.

704
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,239
Sorry. I zoned out for a moment.

705
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:23,639
I should head back now.

706
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,439
Um, okay.

707
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,000
What?

708
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:36,719
Ding Ding,

709
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,239
this is the direct line from the president office.

710
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,159
You probably shouldn't answer it.

711
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,959
But if this is an important phone call,

712
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,199
and we missed it?

713
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,000
Important call?

714
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,639
They should call again later.

715
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,520
Today is Assistant Lin's first day of work.

716
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,760
It'll look bad on her if you answer it.

717
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,879
Okay.

718
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:00,520
So, Assistant Lin,

719
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,000
about your application for the
employee accommodation...

720
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:06,520
I've decided not to approve your application.

721
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,159
But the company states that employees

722
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,399
will be given accommodations

723
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:14,320
if needed.

724
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,719
Yeah. That's right.

725
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,320
The company offers to do that.

726
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,879
But as a vice president of the company,

727
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,840
I have to set a good example for others.

728
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:23,399
I try not to waste the company resources

729
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:25,199
if I don't need it.

730
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,840
I prefer to leave them to those in need

731
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,520
even if I'm inconvenienced.

732
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:29,639
Am I right?

733
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,719
Since you've decided to work with me,

734
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,199
you must adhere to my prime principle.

735
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,800
I hope you won't disappoint me.

736
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:37,600
President Jiao, I'm one of "those who in need".

737
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,879
I really need the accommodation.

738
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,199
By the way,

739
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,560
does this principle

740
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,600
only apply to me?

741
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:45,919
Assistant Lin, I've just explained to you.

742
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:48,040
Since you want to be my assistant,

743
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,959
I hope you'll stay true to my principle.

744
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,520
Assistant Lin,

745
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,040
the phone on your desk rang just now.

746
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,840
Ding Ding,

747
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,239
let's have hot pot later.

748
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,639
I found a nice hot pot restaurant.

749
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,679
And I have vouchers.

750
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,919
That's great. Take me there now.

751
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,199
You're going to break the door.

752
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,520
Let me try a couple more times, okay?

753
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,320
-Please leave now.
-One last time.

754
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,840
Just one last time.

755
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,399
Leave. Get out of here.

756
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:25,800
Just one more time.

757
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,120
Leave now. Get out of here.

758
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:29,360
Are you okay?

759
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,439
Sorry about that.

760
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,919
-It's you.
-It's you.

761
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:36,399
I've been looking everywhere for you.

762
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:37,760
You still have the guts to come back.

763
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,840
No. I was mistaken earlier on.

764
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,600
I didn't get it clear. It was a misunderstanding.

765
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,080
A misunderstanding?

766
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,040
That's it?

767
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,040
What do you want from me then?

768
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,840
What do you want?

769
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,479
Miss,

770
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,719
Do you know that

771
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:00,439
you had ruined my introduction ceremony
as the vice president of a company?

772
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:03,439
What a bluff. Why don't you just say

773
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:05,800
that I ruined your inauguration
as the vice president of a country?

774
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,800
Oh, by the way,

775
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,040
try bumping into me.

776
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,159
We'll do this right here at the cafe entrance, okay?

777
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,840
Did you hit your head or something?

778
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,399
Why do you seem a bit off?

779
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:22,600
I'm completely fine.

780
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:24,120
You just have to be here.

781
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,560
Here. Over here.

782
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,760
Let's get this over with.

783
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,199
This woman...

784
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,000
Let's do this.

785
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,199
Ah. I know.

786
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,120
It's all because of me.

787
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,199
Huh?

788
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:42,719
I think you must have fallen for me at first sight.

789
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:44,760
Nonsense.

790
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,800
Just do as I say. Then we're done.

791
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,639
No way.

792
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,239
I've already broken your heart.

793
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,479
How could I hurt you physically?

794
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,239
Listen to me.

795
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,399
Earlier on, I clutched at you and refused to let go

796
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,080
because I thought you were sent there by my rival

797
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,479
to jeopardize my work.

798
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:00,959
Ruining your shirt was an unfortunate accident.

799
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:02,679
It's also a misfortune to bump into you here.

800
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:03,199
I don't know

801
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,639
why everything goes horribly wrong for me.

802
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:06,000
I'm no longer a director.

803
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,800
All my effort has gone to waste.

804
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,560
I even had to run into you right here twice.

805
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,199
Are you done?

806
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,439
My shirt is custom-made.

807
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,679
So, are you going to bump into me or not?

808
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,719
Woman, are you crazy?

809
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:17,120
There are other ways to die.

810
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,080
Jump off a building. Drown yourself.
Get struck by lightning.

811
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:21,479
Don't drag someone else into this. What a psycho.

812
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,239
Struck by lightning seems like a good way.

813
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:40,399
Cab. Food. Clothes. Toiletries.

814
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:44,760
I used all my cash. My phone power ran out.

815
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:49,560
I can only stay in the office tonight.

816
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,800
You little brat.

817
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,439
Do you want a piece of me?

818
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,199
Dota-Dota-Dota.

819
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:19,239
Yeah.

820
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:21,719
Can you fight me?

821
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,520
I've just started to get serious.

822
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:25,879
It's late.

823
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,719
It's you again.

824
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,439
Why are you standing outside
the woman's bathroom late at night?

825
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,080
Are you a pervert?

826
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,800
You're the pervert, moping around
in the middle of the night.

827
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:32,919
You're washing up in the company
bathroom at this time.

828
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:34,600
Are you wasting the company's resources?

829
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,320
I'm just working overtime.

830
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,879
I want to freshen up.

831
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:39,199
Did I ask you to work overtime?

832
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,080
You plan to stay the night here?

833
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,639
No.

834
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,520
What are you doing in your hand then?

835
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,719
The company doesn't have the right to ask about

836
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:51,120
what the employees bring to the office, right?

837
00:42:51,439 --> 00:42:53,320
But the supervisors have the right to

838
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,360
ask their subordinates why they loiter
in the office after work.

839
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
Are you tongue-tied?

840
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,439
I'll leave right away.

841
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:37,159
Why is a lady

842
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:39,000
like you wandering on the street at night?

843
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,120
I'm talking to you. Did you just glare at me?

844
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,800
Are you deaf?

845
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,120
Or do you have something in your ears?

846
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:48,800
President Jiao, I don't wish to interact

847
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,479
with you except for office hours.

848
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,239
Besides, if your question isn't work-related,

849
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:53,800
I have the right not to answer you.

850
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,040
What are you up to?

851
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:00,719
You're my assistant,

852
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,199
who is wandering on the street at night.

853
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:03,639
If something bad happens,
I'm responsible for that.

854
00:44:03,919 --> 00:44:05,080
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

855
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,080
I don't have a home.

856
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,199
Nonsense.

857
00:44:08,919 --> 00:44:10,560
My lease is up. I got kicked out.

858
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,840
Where do you live now?

859
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,360
Nowhere.

860
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,320
Nowhere?

861
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,320
I have nowhere to stay.

862
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,000
Well.

863
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,280
When I denied your application for

864
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,959
the employee accommodation this morning,

865
00:44:30,399 --> 00:44:31,919
I wasn't aware of your situation.

866
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:33,080
Tomorrow,

867
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,399
I'll arrange accommodation for you.

868
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,320
You can find a place to stay for the night.

869
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,399
I'm penniless.

870
00:44:40,399 --> 00:44:41,800
Where do you think I should go?

871
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,719
Your house?

872
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,120
Let's go then.

873
00:44:46,479 --> 00:44:47,120
Let's go.
