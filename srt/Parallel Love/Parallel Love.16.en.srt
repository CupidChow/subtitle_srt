00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,880
How about I perform beat-box for you?

172
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,359
I don't show this to anyone.

173
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:56,919
Listen carefully.

174
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:19,039
Indeed, this is boring as well.

175
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,559
You're forcing me into my final trick.

176
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,520
Wait for me here.

177
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:32,279
[Arrogant]

178
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,039
Lin Miao.

179
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,000
Arrogant,

180
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,080
extremely arrogant,

181
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,000
arrogance breaking through the sky,

182
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,960
arrogance rushing out of the earth.

183
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,719
Arrogant dragon,

184
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:46,799
arrogant plum blossom,

185
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,679
arrogant.

186
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,719
Where did you get that?

187
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,960
Are you happy now?

188
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,239
I would like to tell you something.

189
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
No one is perfect.

190
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,359
Even an excellent person

191
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,000
would make mistakes sometimes,

192
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,280
but you have to always believe that

193
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,559
tomorrow will be better than today.

194
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:18,719
You know?

195
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,479
I know.

196
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:26,039
Thank you.

197
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,159
Why only chocolate flavored?

198
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,679
I don't eat chocolate flavor.

199
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,799
Do you have other flavors?

200
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,119
Don't eat if you don't like.

201
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,960
I only have this one flavor here,

202
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,280
Lin Miao only eats this one.

203
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,960
Are you a human?

204
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,239
I was just broken-hearted and you're
here showing off your relationship,

205
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,520
can you be kind?

206
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:01,960
Move.

207
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,880
Lin Miao bought this for you,

208
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,080
she said that you would surely love it.

209
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,640
I never knew that

210
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,479
she's quite humane after all.

211
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,840
You help me thank her.

212
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,520
Thank her yourself.

213
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,559
I don't want to.

214
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,960
What is it?

215
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:22,919
Thank her.

216
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,359
It's...Hey, hey!

217
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,119
Hello?

218
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Hello, Jiao Yang.

219
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,280
How is it? Did she eat the ice cream?

220
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,440
Is she feeling better now?

221
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,880
It's me.

222
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:41,880
I called because I wanted to say...

223
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,359
Say what?

224
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,200
I have eaten the ice cream,

225
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,039
but I'll pay you back no matter what.

226
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,679
Thank you.

227
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,840
Bye, I finished my lines. Bye bye.

228
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:57,440
Uhm, thank you for today.

229
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,640
Can't you thank me face-to-face?

230
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,159
So not sincere.

231
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,080
Who asked you to take a shower for so long?

232
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,840
If you want to hear it, come up then.

233
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:08,960
If I didn't do that,

234
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,559
how would you have time to date,

235
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,359
am I right?

236
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,559
But, let me give you a piece of advice.

237
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,840
Jiao Yang is really not bad.

238
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:20,080
Yes, he's always careless

239
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,039
and arrogant,

240
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,440
but I can feel that

241
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,880
you have a place in his heart.

242
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:27,840
Sometimes, when I see him be careful with you,

243
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,320
I would feel touched too.

244
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,320
Hearing this,

245
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,400
I feel like you're rather interested in him.

246
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,000
Why don't I say some good words for you?

247
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,479
Stop talking nonsense.

248
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Aren't you supposed to

249
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,640
rush down and beat me up?

250
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,039
But, it's really weird.

251
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:45,599
You say, we two

252
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,640
look quite alike

253
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,119
and our taste in men is quite alike too.

254
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:51,760
Yeah,

255
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,679
sometimes when I look at you,

256
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,559
I feel like I'm looking at the old me.

257
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,960
However...

258
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,679
However what?

259
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,239
Let me tell you,

260
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:04,559
I'm stronger than you for sure.

261
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,080
No matter what,

262
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:09,679
I, Lin Wei Jun,

263
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,440
will never

264
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,280
shed a single tear for Su Cheng Jun anymore.

265
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,880
However, you're better than how I used to be.

266
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,159
That's for certain.

267
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:23,159
This Su Cheng Jun couldn't even recognize me,

268
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,679
if I don't break up with such a man,

269
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,679
keeping him for the new year?

270
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,400
Right?

271
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,159
The more I think of it, the more I feel stupid.

272
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:33,440
Eat less ice cream,

273
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,280
or you'll get a stomachache.

274
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,000
I know,

275
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,039
I'll pay you back what I eat,

276
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,280
don't be so petty.

277
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,280
That's it, bye bye.

278
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,919
Su Cheng Jun now has the contract with Qin Ran,

279
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,960
we have to admit that

280
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,640
he has a great advantage.

281
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:02,719
But, Hong Yu surely wins!

282
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,440
Do you have any good ideas?

283
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:05,760
I...

284
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,960
Young one, silence is gold.

285
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,479
I'm just worried about President Jiao.

286
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:14,080
If we can't win this bid,

287
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Chairman Li and the others
will tear President Jiao apart for sure.

288
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,960
Silence is gold.

289
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:24,599
Not until the final moment,

290
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:26,080
we cannot give up.

291
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,599
Hello,

292
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,840
I know that you are working hard,

293
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,640
so I brought some soup with love.

294
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,559
Isn't this the...

295
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,479
This is.

296
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,840
Aunt Jiao taught me before she passed.

297
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,039
You still know this?

298
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,760
I know a lot.

299
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,559
Actually, I already knew
how to make it earlier on,

300
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,520
but you were studying overseas at the time.

301
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,359
When you were back, I left,

302
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:59,239
so I never had the chance to make it for you.

303
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,599
You all get to drink it because of Jiao Yang.

304
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,080
Thank you, Director Zhao.

305
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,679
Thank you, Director Zhao.

306
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,039
By the way,

307
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,159
when I came in just now,

308
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,960
you all looked so troubled,

309
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,679
what happened?

310
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,280
It's almost the last round of the bidding,

311
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,119
but our Infinite Home concept

312
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,840
does not have a competitive advantage yet.

313
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,159
Until today, we haven't
found any suitable designer.

314
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,880
Infinite Home?

315
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,640
Jiao Yang,

316
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,280
before Aunt Jiao passed,

317
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,799
she had a design about the concept of home.

318
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,679
What a pity,

319
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:53,880
before she could

320
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,239
finish the draft of the concept of home,

321
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,679
she started to feel sick.

322
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:01,359
It's so good,

323
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,199
it's really a pity.

324
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,280
But, this design is only half completed,

325
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,760
how can we win?

326
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,319
Jiao Yang,

327
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,800
didn't you learn architectural design before?

328
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:19,680
Can you finish it up?

329
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Me?

330
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,359
After I graduated from university,

331
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,760
I stopped designing.

332
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,640
But, among us,

333
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,479
you're the only one who
knows about the architectural design

334
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,319
and you definitely

335
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,079
understands Aunt Jiao's thinking the most.

336
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,319
The only way we could defeat Zhong Qing Group

337
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,680
and Su Cheng Jun now is to

338
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,920
finish this design.

339
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,920
I believe you can do it.

340
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,479
We believe in you too.

341
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,640
[Bad guy]

342
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,180
[Calling]

343
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,820
[Little Fool]

344
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,359
Hello,

345
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,719
do you eat durian-flavored ice cream?

346
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:40,520
Why are you hesitant about buying ice cream?

347
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
If you want it, then get it.

348
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,560
You're so scary.

349
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,680
Are you monitoring me?

350
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,920
Do I have to do that?

351
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,880
Oh, you are at the supermarket, right?

352
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,560
That's great.

353
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,680
Help me get some stuff

354
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,079
and send it to Hong Yu Group.

355
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,359
Jiao Yang and I need to work overtime today,

356
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,560
so we won't be able to go back.

357
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,000
You want me to run errands?

358
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,640
I'll need an errand fee.

359
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,560
Alright,

360
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,839
I'll buy ice cream for you this month, okay?

361
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,839
Really?

362
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,359
That's more like it.

363
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,680
Tell me, what do you need?

364
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,560
Just buy two sets of

365
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,359
disposable toiletries will do.

366
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,479
Toiletries.

367
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,199
Here's a couple of electric toothbrush

368
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:19,920
on discount,

369
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,959
the price is more or less the same.

370
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,560
Do you still want the disposable ones?

371
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,800
Isn't disposable one good enough?

372
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,880
Throw it away after using,

373
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,040
no worries at all.

374
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,199
It's not sustainable.

375
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:30,160
Besides,

376
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
you have to create some bondage and involvement

377
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,920
between you and Jiao Yang.

378
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,959
That way, you two could be closer,

379
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:37,439
do you understand?

380
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,439
Okay then.

381
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,400
Help me buy the electric toothbrushes then.

382
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,400
You changed your mind so fast?

383
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,959
Thanks to your reminder,

384
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,079
I understood many things instantly,

385
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:50,760
thank you.

386
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,800
I remind...

387
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,880

I see that she's quite busy,

408
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:51,119
could you help her to take it?

409
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:51,839
Sure, no problem.

410
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:52,959

416
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:25,160
Why don't you wash up?

417
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,839
With a clearer mind,

418
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,119
less stress,

419
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:31,239
maybe you'll get a new inspiration soon.

420
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,359
Don't you always use disposable toothbrushes?

421
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,560
It's not sustainable.

422
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:47,160
Besides,

423
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,760
people sometimes need a little change, right?

424
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:50,959
Change?

425
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:55,359
Within our own power, make little changes,

426
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,000
for example, starting from
an electric toothbrush.

427
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,839
Keep it up.

428
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,760
At first, I thought the time started over

429
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,439
was the unluckiest thing that happened to me.

430
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,280
I've lost the sense of security,

431
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:47,400
lost everything that I once had,

432
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,560
but now I realize that

433
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,640
everything has its two sides.

434
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,800
The starting over of time

435
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,640
might just be a gift to me from Heaven.

436
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,479
Jiao Yang,

437
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,520
all these are related to you.

438
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,319
Without you by my side,

439
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,800
I couldn't have done it.

440
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,199
In fact, you're the biggest gift

441
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:13,760
from the starting over of time,

442
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,439
but when the three-month limit is up,

443
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,079
what would happen then?

444
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,680
Director Su.

445
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:34,680
Leader Jiao.

446
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:02,640
Since everyone is here,

447
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,959
the last round of bidding officially starts now.

448
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,280
We will make the final assessment

449
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,199
according to the quotations

450
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,400
and designs of two companies.

451
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,880
Both companies will have
a single representative to voice out,

452
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,760
please prepare yourselves.

453
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,560
Are you nervous?

454
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Of course.

455
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,719
Isn't this...

456
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:55,119
You found it for me,

457
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:58,199
so now I give it to you.

458
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,560
Red symbolizes courage and victory,

459
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:05,839
I'm waiting for you to return with victory.

460
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,040
You're so confident?

461
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:17,680
In Su Cheng Jun's hands,
he has Qin Ran and Boss Chang

462
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,640
as his two trump cards,

463
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,079
but Hong Yu Group also
has designer Liang Yu Jun

464
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,319
to work with President Jiao,

465
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,160
so you will be unstoppable.

466
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,599
The above is the presentation
from Zhong Qing Group.

467
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:37,239
I believe everyone has witnessed

468
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:38,640
Zhong Qing's steady style

469
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,119
and sincerity in quotation

470
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,520
in the past few rounds.

471
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,079
However, today's main point

472
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,160
lies in the design of a young designer.

473
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:47,239
This designer

474
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,880
[Qin]
was unwilling to accept our invitation at first

475
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,319
due to some personal reasons,

476
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,079
but finally,

477
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:53,280
after several days
and nights of hard work without rest,

478
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,760
she managed to hand in a very satisfactory work.

479
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,319
I believe that this design

480
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:59,520
will move everyone present here.

481
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,920
From an architectural perspective,

482
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,079
it really does have the standard.

483
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:04,599
Director Su,

484
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,160
thank you for your hard work.

485
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,479
This is indeed a

486
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:10,439
very touching design.

487
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,160
Leader Jiao,

488
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:20,479
it's your turn now.

489
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,040
Good luck.

490
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,640
[Infinite Home]

491
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,160
This is our design,

492
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:31,680
it's a collaborative design by two designers.

493
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,280
Each independent space

494
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,920
represents a circle,

495
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,839
whereas the curved lumen windows

496
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:39,119
enable the tenants to fully enjoy the sunshine

497
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,920
and night view.

498
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:42,119
Each circle represents a family

499
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:44,079
and that is the main theme
of our Infinite Home project.

500
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,199
This is a place

501
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,319
where family members and couples are united.

502
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,839
Infinite Home is a possibility

503
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:52,800
provided for the young generation.

504
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,800
As long as we work hard,

505
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,680
we could build our own home

506
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,400
with our own hands.

507
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,280
This is exactly the meaning behind Infinite Home.

508
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,920
The design is the core,

509
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:04,599
and from the business perspective,

510
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,160
it is an idea that
extends from a traditional hotel

511
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,439
to long-term apartments.

512
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,160
If Heng Yuan and Hong Yu work together,

513
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,640
this concept could be extended to

514
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,359
any of the hotels under Heng Yuan,

515
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,640
or even Hong Yu Group in the future.

516
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,079
With the system advantages of the
cooperation of two major platforms,

517
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,160
in the future,

518
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,160
the concept

519
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,839
will bloom everywhere in the nation,
or even in the entire world.

520
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:26,880
I'm wondering if the above
additional information

521
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,280
answers the doubts of President Liu

522
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,760
and the panel from the last round?

523
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,359
Leader Jiao,

524
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,959
it seems like you didn't
make adjustments in the quotation.

525
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,400
Our current quotation is 435 million yuan.

526
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,760
Isn't that a draw with Zhong Qing Group's?

527
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,640
Leader Jiao,

528
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,319
don't make empty promises.

529
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,520
Of course not.

530
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,439
Not only have we further
reduced tens of millions of budget

531
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:50,239
from the indoors decoration,

532
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,560
we have also cut down the design expenses

533
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,439
to almost zero-cost.

534
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,040
Zero-cost?

535
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:56,839
Yes,

536
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,359
our design only used up one yuan.

537
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,439
Director Su,

538
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,239
you're very smart,

539
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:19,560
reasonable

540
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,880
and good at catching opportunities.

541
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,280
You have a bright future ahead of you.

542
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,959
Thank you, President Liu.

543
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,199
I believe we will have another

544
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:34,880
chance to cooperate in the future.

545
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,680
Leader Jiao,

546
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,239
your future is promising.

547
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,479
Your design skills are

548
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:50,319
as brilliant as your mother's.

549
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,959
I believe this masterpiece across time and space

550
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,880
completed by two excellent designers

551
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,319
will be the beginning of Heng Yuan
and Hong Yu Group's collaboration.

552
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,800
I'm looking forward to

553
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,239
the day when you lead Hong Yu Group.

554
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,079
Thank you.

555
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,760
To a pleasant cooperation.

556
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:04,880
Yes, indeed.

557
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,239
At that time, we only promised that

558
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,479
if Jiao Yang wins this bidding,

559
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
we will reconsider

560
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,520
his rights as the vice-president,

561
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:27,920
but everyone, may I ask,

562
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,839
with the frequency of Jiao Yang making mistakes,

563
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,839
a mistake after a glory, a mistake after a glory,

564
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:34,079
isn't it an endless loop?

565
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,239
I'm afraid the one who jeopardizes

566
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,439
the interests of the directors

567
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,680
is you, Chairman Li.

568
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:44,479
Chairman,

569
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,239
aren't you sick?

570
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:51,560
If it wasn't because I was ill,

571
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,359
could you have let down your guards

572
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:55,839
and be exposed?

573
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,479
Chairman, what do you mean by that?

574
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,479
Secretary Hu.

575
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:17,560
Isn't this Su Cheng Jun originally
from our marketing department?

576
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,280
I heard that he's representing Zhong Qing

577
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:23,400
in Heng Yuan's bidding this time.

578
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,640
Chairman Li,

579
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,959
how come you have contacted him?

580
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,000
I handled the marketing department before

581
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,199
and Su Cheng Jun was my subordinate.

582
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:36,160
Are common conversations not allowed too?

583
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,640
This is the bidding document that

584
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,239
the chairman had requested
every director to sign,

585
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:44,760
and Chairman Li leaked the bidding information

586
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,280
to our competitor,

587
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,719
what was your intention?

588
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,280
Jiao Yang,

589
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,359
you need to have evidence before you speak.

590
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,640
What proof do you have to say
that the document in the photo

591
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,640
is the bidding document?

592
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,920
How dare you still quibble at this time?

593
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,040
Director Wu is just outside,

594
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,239
do you want me to summon him in here?

595
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:10,520
This is slander.

596
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,680
I'm so loyal to Hong Yu Group,

597
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,319
how could I ever do such a thing?

598
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,640
Loyal?

599
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:21,160
Then, what are these?

600
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:24,040
These big clients

601
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,000
were signed into the company one by one

602
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:29,040
by me and Jiao Yang's mother

603
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:31,520
when Hong Yu Group was just established.

604
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,040
After that,

605
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,280
your father took over the management.

606
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:37,359
All these years,

607
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,439
the cooperation between
them and Hong Yu Group

608
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,920
have been smooth,

609
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,760
but after Li passed away

610
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:47,079
and you only took over
for less than two years,

611
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,359
why did they become Zhong Qing Group's clients?

612
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,680
The evidence is as solid as iron,

613
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:53,439
what else do you have to say?

614
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,359
Li Dong Qiang,

615
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,800
how could you commit embezzlement?

616
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,160
You stole confidential documents

617
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,319
and even committed embezzlement to

618
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,959
steal away the company's clients,

619
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,479
all the evidence is here.

620
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:07,199
Chairman,

621
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,079
this matter must be dealt with strictly.

622
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:09,839
I agree.

623
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:13,079
So much evidence?

624
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,920
You've been investigating me
since long ago, haven't you?

625
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,359
What a good show you've put on.

626
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,199
Let me tell you, Jiao Jun Hong,

627
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,800
I'll pull you down if I have to!

628
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,959
Li Dong Qiang,

629
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:29,719
if the chairman doesn't
care about past relationships,

630
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,959
all this evidence

631
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,959
is enough to put you in jail.

632
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,040
Hand over your share stocks nicely

633
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,040
and stop fighting.

634
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
My father played a part

635
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,839
in bringing Hong Yu Group to its glory.

636
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,800
He worked for you until his death,

637
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,239
you can't do this to me.

638
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,079
Thanks to your father,

639
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,880
as long as you hand over all the stocks you have

640
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,319
and resign by yourself,

641
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,199
I won't hold you accountable for your crimes.

642
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,319
I hope you know what's best for you.

643
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,880
What?

644
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:27,479
All the previous incidents
were caused by Chairman Li?

645
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:29,560
I was wondering why President Jiao was so unlucky.

646
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,119
Every time you were about to finish something big,

647
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:33,119
you would end up with a few mistakes.

648
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:36,160
So, the dismissal and office seal

649
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,199
are all part of the plan of you and Chairman?

650
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,079
President Jiao,

651
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,560
your trick of getting bullied this time

652
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,079
really got us all fooled.

653
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,839
Enough, let's not talk about this now.

654
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,359
During this period,

655
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,920
it has been hard on all of you.

656
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,079
Everybody, pack your things.

657
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:51,239
After work tonight, I'll treat you all to a big meal.

658
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,280
-Thank you, President Jiao.
-Long live, President Jiao.

659
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,680
Off to work, off to work, off to work.

660
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,280
Assistant Lin.

661
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,239
What's wrong, President Jiao?

662
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,719
I need to talk to you
about something in private.

663
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:09,840
Take a look at what this is.

664
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,679
This...

665
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,760
Isn't this the key

666
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,080
to the car you have sold back then?

667
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,639
Yes.

668
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,560
This is a reward from Jiao for my good performance.

669
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,280
Chairman.

670
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,120
Quick, quick, here.

671
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,579
Water, water, water.

672
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:54,040
Are you feeling better?

673
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,800
Chairman,

674
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:57,560
it's not good if you keep this up.

675
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,399
The doctor asked you to rest last time,

676
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,520
but you insisted on hiding it from President Jiao.

677
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,560
To catch Chairman Li, you also worked so hard.

678
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,199
The thing about having surgery overseas,

679
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,479
we really can't delay it anymore.

680
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,520
Li Dong Qiang, that stumbling block,

681
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,080
is finally out of the way,

682
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,840
but the influence among the director board
suddenly lost its balance.

683
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,439
If I leave now,

684
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,159
Jiao Yang won't be able to control the situation.

685
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,360
Something will happen sooner or later.

686
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,120
Isn't Chairman Zhao here too?

687
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:29,320
Director Zhao and President Jiao
grew up together,

688
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,639
he would surely give President Jiao a hand.

689
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,159
You're right,

690
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:37,360
there's still Zhao.

691
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,360
Maybe, at this very moment,

692
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:48,080
this would be the best way.

693
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,040
Okay, go busy with your things.

694
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,159
Okay, Director Zhao.

695
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,840
Director Zhao,

696
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,320
President Jiao said to buy us a big meal tonight

697
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,879
to celebrate the victory of taking down the bid.

698
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,840
You should come too.

699
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,520
I'm not going.

700
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:09,360
What does winning the bid
have anything to do with me?

701
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,159
The credit goes to the presidential office,

702
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,399
Jiao Yang and Assistant Lin.

703
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,280
I didn't do anything to help Jiao Yang,

704
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,360
I don't have the face to go.

705
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,439
How were you of no help?

706
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,840
You were the one
who distributed the questionnaires,

707
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,760
you were the one who found Qin Ran,

708
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:23,879
and you were also the one

709
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:26,159
who found the chairman's wife's design.

710
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,239
I was the one who sent out the questionnaires,

711
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:30,639
but the one who thought of
the home concept for Jiao Yang

712
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:31,679
was Assistant Lin.

713
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,919
I tried everything,

714
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,679
but Qin Ran ended up
signing the contract with Su Cheng Jun.

715
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,959
I found the design draft,

716
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,399
but in the end,

717
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:43,760
the one who gave Jiao Yang courage

718
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,439
was also Assistant Lin, wasn't it?

719
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:46,959
Frankly speaking,

720
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,360
I'm still not anyway better than her.

721
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,280
How could you be anyway less than her?

722
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,360
If you didn't find the design draft,

723
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,560
we wouldn't have the victory now.

724
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:59,360
Yan Xin, thank you.

725
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:02,639
For now,

726
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,520
I really want to be like an ostrich and

727
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:07,040
bury my head deep into the sand.

728
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,159
Maybe I need some time

729
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:12,159
to understand something.

730
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:15,520
She really left?

731
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,959
She left a note.

732
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,360
I left.

733
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,679
If you miss me, transfer me money. Jun.

734
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,560
What on earth is she up to?

735
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
You've seen the note already?

736
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,479
Why do you need to leave so suddenly?

737
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:42,239
Today, I received a notice from a law firm

738
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,959
saying that I can start work next week.

739
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,320
I also found a place to stay

740
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,600
near the law firm very smoothly.

741
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
So, I immediately moved there
to familiarize the environment.

742
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,280
Law firm?

743
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,000
Be a lawyer?

744
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,080
I have an advanced interpretation certificate.

745
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,560
Translation work in a small law firm
won't be too hard for me.

746
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:58,959
Actually, it was when

747
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:00,879
Su Cheng Jun was so
busy with the student union,

748
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:01,879
I was bored from waiting for him,

749
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,679
so I got myself a variety of certificates.

750
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:05,479
Who knows I would use one of them one day.

751
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,439
A lot of things are like this,

752
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,399
something unintentional might just
turn out being useful one day.

753
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,679
That day when I sent the things to you,

754
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:13,760
I saw you and the others being so busy.

755
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:15,399
I don't think I should

756
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,639
continue to blame myself anymore.

757
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,719
To be like you,

758
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,239
I want to be an office lady.

759
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,280
You can do it for sure.

760
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,959
Thank you

761
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,639
for starting a life different from mine.

762
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:38,239
What stupid act are you trying to pull?

763
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,399
Director Zhao,

764
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:41,760
I was just trying to bury my head in the sand

765
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,639
and see how it feels.

766
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,080
Report! Director Zhao,

767
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,959
After an experiment by myself,

768
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,239
burying your head deep in the sand

769
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,959
will not make you understand things.

770
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:53,679
Instead, it will only suffocate you.

771
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,439
Oh, right, Director Zhao,

772
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:02,120
I've prepared

773
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,320
a seaside barbecue for you there.

774
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,879
When your tummy's full and mind's blank,

775
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,760
you'll be happier.

776
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,479
Yan Xin,

777
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,840
how did you know I'm here?

778
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,679
The only place in this city where

779
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:21,639
there's enough sand to bury your head in

780
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:22,959
is here.

781
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,800
Do you think I'm really so stupid

782
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,280
that I would bury my head?

783
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:31,280
Xin,

784
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,080
I've thought it through.

785
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:36,080
I still don't want to give up on Jiao Yang.

786
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:40,560
Even though in terms of work,

787
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,479
I'm not as useful as Lin Miao,

788
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:45,719
I could take care of his

789
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,760
daily life,

790
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:47,879
right?

791
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:48,760
But Director Zhao,

792
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:50,159
I feel like,

793
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,120
I feel like you need someone

794
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,320
to take care of you more.

795
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,080
But, anyway,

796
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,600
as long as you're happy,

797
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,239
I'll support any decision

798
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,399
you make.

799
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,159
Let's go and eat the barbecue.

800
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,360
Okay.

801
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:22,919
Director Su,

802
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:25,919
weren't you so confident back then that

803
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:27,639
you could defeat Hong Yu Group?

804
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,040
I made a mistake in planning,

805
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:31,520
but we can't deny that

806
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:33,479
it was not a glorious win for Jiao Yang.

807
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,959
He won only because he had support from Hong Yu.

808
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:37,639
Don't you have Zhong Qing as support?

809
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:40,199
Are you thinking of getting away with this

810
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,439
by simply saying it's a mistake in planning?

811
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,439
I'm willing to take punishment.

812
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,879
Someone entrusted you to me,

813
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:53,719
so this time, I'll make sure
you don't get any punishment,

814
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:57,280
but starting from today, your fate in Zhong Qing

815
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,719
depends solely on yourself.

816
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,120
You're a clever person.

817
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,239
A clever person should know how to prove

818
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:10,040
that you have irreplaceable value.

819
00:41:16,439 --> 00:41:17,760
I've already warned you earlier

820
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:19,479
not to have those tricks.

821
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,800
Now you're in trouble.

822
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,679
You really have such a short sight.

823
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,479
Both the father and son
have forced me into a dead end.

824
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:27,840
I will never

825
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,080
forgive them easily.

826
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:31,600
Haven't you learnt the lesson yet?

827
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:33,679
Do you really want Hong Yu
to file an investigation against you?

828
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,040
Now, just keep a low profile overseas.

829
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,479
Before I contact you,

830
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,840
don't do anything rash.

831
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,360
Isn't this Chairman Li?

832
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,360
Cao Hua.

833
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:49,760
Li Dong Qiang,

834
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,080
you're so old now,

835
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:53,239
yet you couldn't even
settle a little brat like Jiao Yang,

836
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:54,159
aren't you embarrassed?

837
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,760
Those things you did,

838
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,000
if I were there, I would vote you out too.

839
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
The damage that you've caused

840
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:02,320
was not only inflicted on the Jiao family,

841
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,080
but all the directors, shareholders
and staff in Hong Yu Group

842
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,520
don't forgive you either.

843
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,800
You're talking as if your hands are so clean.

844
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:11,280
Just you wait,

845
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:12,760
after they got rid of me,

846
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:14,280
you'll be the next unlucky one.

847
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,479
I'm not like you,

848
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,280
to be chased out of the game so easily.

849
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,239
Jiao Jun Hong has aged,

850
00:42:20,439 --> 00:42:22,000
Zhao Zhen Chuan is a coward

851
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,639
and Jiao Yang is just a baby.

852
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,760
All the men are useless.

853
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,239
The future of Hong Yu Group

854
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,679
should be led by a woman now.

855
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,239
Only you?

856
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,040
When you're out of the country, let me know.

857
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,399
My plan

858
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,639
is not complete without you.
