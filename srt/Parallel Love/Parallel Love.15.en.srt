[Episode 15]

33
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,199
Is she sleeping?

34
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:09,960
I didn't contact you,

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,399
so you're not going to contact me either.

36
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,520
Do you think I can't leave you now?

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,919
How did I become like a miserable mistress now?

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,720
So frustrated.

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,600
Stop knocking, it's so noisy.

40
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,360
You're disturbing my sleeping.

41
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,360
Wait, you black-faced woman,

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,720
where did you get the face mask?

43
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,720
From the fridge.

44
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,800
I bought that for Lin Miao.

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,000
So what, I only used one piece.

46
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,320
Why are you being so petty?

47
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,160
Aren't you the bossy president?

48
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,160
Buy more.

49
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:57,960
Why don't you go up and accompany her?

50
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,360
I promised her to take good care of you.

51
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,240
I'm an adult,

52
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,160
I don't need your care.

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,279
I can tell

54
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,360
you are here downstairs physically,

55
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,520
but your heart is already upstairs.

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,479
Do you live near the sea?

57
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,199
Interfering with things as vast as the sea.

58
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,440
I need to remind you.

59
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,399
For her, Su Cheng Jun

60
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:24,000
is willing to give up our long relationship,

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,360
aren't you a little bit worried?

62
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,119
She's very good. She's a great woman.

63
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,399
So, it's normal for men

64
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:30,440
to like her.

65
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,600
Rather than thinking of

66
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,919
such a childish problem now,

67
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,119
I'd better think of ways

68
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,559
to win over her heart.

69
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,679
Men

70
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,199
always sound nice when they sweet-talk,

71
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,000
but when it comes to action, it's another thing.

72
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,440
Lin Wei Jun,

73
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,960
you kept saying that Lin Miao is a bad woman

74
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,440
who snatched away your man, right?

75
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,160
You have to think properly,

76
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,520
if Su Cheng Jun really likes you,

77
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:54,880
would he treat you like this?

78
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,600
Do you think everyone

79
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,279
looks for a boyfriend from a dumpster as you did?

80
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,119
For someone like Su Cheng Jun,

81
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,160
Lin Miao would never fall for him.

82
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,679
Besides,

83
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,600
Whenever there's a problem,

84
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:09,160
people would naturally blame the woman,

85
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,279
but I think it's not the woman's fault at all,

86
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,440
but the man's.

87
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,880
Not to mention a jerk like Su Cheng Jun,

88
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,559
understand?

89
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,720
The same as you?

90
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,160
Lin Miao has good taste,

91
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,559
there's only me in her eyes and her heart.

92
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,679
Bah!

93
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:27,040
Even a blind person can
see that you're in one-sided love.

94
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,679
Let's have a bet,

95
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,880
if you don't call her first,

96
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,000
let's see if she looks for you first

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,040
before midnight.

98
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,079
I bet she doesn't even remember

99
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,880
that you still exist.

100
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,839
Bah!

101
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
Let me tell you,

102
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,000
who calls first is a dog.

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,959
Good, I shall wait for you to bark like a dog.

104
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,480
What a black-faced green monster.

105
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,000
Black-faced green monster.

106
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,920
We've only been apart for two days,
I'm already not used to it?

107
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,359
Ring, ring, ring, ring!

108
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,320
Ring, ring, ring, ring!

109
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,519
Ring, ring, ring, ring!

110
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,640
Ring, ring, ring, ring!

111
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,040
Listen to me,

112
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,600
stop your magic.

113
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,160
Even if you stare at your phone all the time,

114
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,119
it's useless.

115
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,880
One-sided love is one-sided love.

116
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,679
How is it?

117
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,679
I have already finished my shower,

118
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,880
when will I hear your barks?

119
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,119
There are five minutes left,
why are you in such a hurry?

120
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:52,239
Are you afraid of losing,

121
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:53,760
so you want to end the bet earlier?

122
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,720
Did you cheat when I was

123
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,640
in the shower just now?

124
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,760
Am I that kind of person?

125
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,359
Lin Miao, Lin Miao, open the door.

126
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:07,760
I brought the white shoes for you.

127
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,200
Lin Miao, open the door.

128
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,959
It's so cold outside, let me in.

129
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,000
I have something for you.

130
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,079
Open the door, Lin Miao.

131
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,160
Open the door, open the door.

132
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,200
Door...

133
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,279
You're giving me shoes so late at night?

134
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:31,920
Yes.

135
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,320
But tomorrow's bidding is a formal event,

136
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,799
I normally wear high heels.

137
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,200
It's better to take precaution, right?

138
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,320
Here you go.

139
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,519
I've completed my task,

140
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,880
if you miss me, call me.

141
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,880
Lin Miao, open the door quickly.

142
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,679
It's only been five minutes,

143
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,040
why are you here again?

144
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:00,799
You moved in a hurry,

145
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:01,839
you forgot your face masks.

146
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,440
I was about to apply one.

147
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,160
No, there is a lot in the fridge.

148
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,440
You put them in there, you forgot already?

149
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,239
Really?

150
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,239
I can't remember clearly anymore.

151
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,079
I'm afraid that it's not enough for you.

152
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,119
Look at your skin condition lately,

153
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,440
look at those pores,

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,200
so big that even an elephant could fit in.

155
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,359
Quick, apply more.

156
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,720
It's better to apply one every ten minutes.

157
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,200
Take it,

158
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,600
apply more face masks, okay?

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,239
I've completed my task,

160
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,279
so I'll go down first.

161
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,880
If you miss me, call me.

162
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:34,799
Don't be shy.

163
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:35,920
Call me, okay?

164
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,679
Call me.

165
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,799
Lin Miao, are you hungry?

166
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,480
I'll cook delicious noodles for you,

167
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,000
with poached egg and vegetables.

168
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,320
Lin Miao, do you want some noodles?

169
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,920
Do you want some noodles?

170
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:52,480
I don't eat noodles at night.

171
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,200
Why?

172
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,440
Because it's not good for the skin.

173
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,079
How are noodles and your skin related?

174
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:58,320
I say they are related, then they are.

175
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,959
Then, you...

176
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,640
You really don't want to give it a try?

177
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,399
It's very delicious, my cooking's very good.

178
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,000
You really didn't do it?

179
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,200
Really.

180
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,360
[Receptionist]

181
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,920
Hello.

182
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,200
Mr. Jiao, Miss Lin from 3201

183
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,359
complained about you
disturbing her late at night,

184
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,160
but I remember that

185
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,320
3201 is also one of your units.

186
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:32,960
Brother,

187
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,200
you disturbed her?

188
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:36,799
No way, it's so funny.

189
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,359
My wrinkles are out, my wrinkles are out.

190
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,960
You have wrinkles even if you don't laugh.

191
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,080
Quick, bark now.

192
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,159
I'm still waiting.

193
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,039
Lin Miao,

194
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,599
you're such a heartless woman.

195
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,559
Apply more face masks, okay?

196
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,119
Leader Jiao,

197
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,760
from what I see,

198
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,479
your quotation

199
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,520
is 15 million yuan higher than Zhong Qing Group's.

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,080
15 million yuan?

201
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,400
We have clearly reduced it by 30 million yuan,

202
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,159
but why is it still 15 million yuan higher

203
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,440
than Zhong Qing Group's?

204
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,919
Director Su, what you mean is...

205
00:10:57,599 --> 00:11:00,200
I only want the standard purchase order.

206
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,440
As for the model number of steel...

207
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,280
Of course, there's no problem
with the model number of steel.

208
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,919
Director Su,

209
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,599
I, Chang, am willing to be your friend.

210
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,640
Jiao Yang,

211
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,559
I knew that you'd surely go and talk to Boss Chang.

212
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
I also knew that

213
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,799
you would surely disagree
with Boss Chang's methods.

214
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,520
I've seen your detailed cost budget.

215
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,520
You're able to save so much
in terms of construction materials,

216
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,000
you have been working hard, Director Su.

217
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,719
In terms of construction material?

218
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,200
The prices of construction materials are similar.

219
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,400
Director Su, how did you manage to

220
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,000
save up to 15 million yuan from there?

221
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,479
I have a friend

222
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:42,320
who is the largest distributor
for construction materials.

223
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,640
He's a loyal friend,

224
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,799
so he said that he must give me the cheapest price.

225
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:47,440
Above all, the most important thing is that

226
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,960
he's really interested in Heng Yuan's project

227
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,640
and would like to build his brand and reputation

228
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,440
through this collaboration.

229
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:55,239
Boss Chang.

230
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,000
You people from the Jiao family

231
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,000
always like to uphold the ridiculous bottom line.

232
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,799
If you hadn't rejected him so decisively,

233
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:07,359
Boss Chang would not have agreed so quickly.

234
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,679
Leader Jiao,

235
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,840
you're very young

236
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,000
and very creative,

237
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,520
but Heng Yuan

238
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,080
would not buy a concept that only sounds appealing

239
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,559
but is full of uncertainty.

240
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,239
So, I'm really sorry to say that

241
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,239
I choose Zhong Qing Group for this round.

242
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,400
Here I announce the

243
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,840
results of this round of bidding.

244
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,520
Zhong Qing Group, two votes.

245
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,359
Hong Yu Group, one vote.

246
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:33,000
New Century Group, zero vote,
directly disqualified.

247
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,159
As for Hong Yu Group...

248
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,679
Hong Yu Group can move to the next round.

249
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,400
Congratulations to Zhong Qing and
Hong Yu for the next round.

250
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,119
We will select the winner

251
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,440
in the last round of bidding.

252
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:57,239
What a coincidence.

253
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,080
Not a coincidence.

254
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:04,000
President Jiao,

255
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,760
you and I both know that

256
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,039
you have already lost

257
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,000
in this bidding.

258
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,359
This 15-million-yuan budget gap

259
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,919
will destroy you.

260
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,840
As for your Infinite Home Project,

261
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,239
it's just a fantasy.

262
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,799
Don't be too full of yourself.

263
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:21,679
Before the final bidding results,

264
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,799
everything remains unknown.

265
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,880
Is it?

266
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:26,000
Then, I'm really looking forward to

267
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,320
seeing how President Jiao turns the table.

268
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,559
It's really funny.

269
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,520
You have such a great
Hong Yu Group as a support behind you,

270
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,280
yet you still lost to me.

271
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,520
If our mother see this in Heaven,

272
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,719
she's more disappointed in you

273
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,239
or more pleased with me?

274
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,559
I'm warning you,

275
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,200
you don't have rights to mention her.

276
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,479
Jiao Yang, you're the one with no rights here.

277
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,679
You're doomed to be a mediocre coward.

278
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,080
Seeing that we worked together before,

279
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,039
I'll give you a piece of advice.

280
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,280
Rather than ability,

281
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,000
a person's character is the key

282
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,599
to his success in the future.

283
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,679
Lin Miao,

284
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,039
why are you protecting such a useless person?

285
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,400
He and Hong Yu Group have no future,

286
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,200
you will have nothing if you follow him.

287
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,400
Have nothing,

288
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,320
as you do?

289
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:21,400
Let's go, Lin Miao.

290
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,679
I thought when I presented
the Infinite Home proposal,

291
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,559
I would definitely win.

292
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,960
Actually, you've done a great job.

293
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,239
It's just that in business society,

294
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,960
not all hundred per cent hard work

295
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,640
would pay off with success.

296
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,559
The 15-million-yuan gap

297
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,799
is my dead spot.

298
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,039
We've not reached the final moment,

299
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,880
I will help you, we can win for sure.

300
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:08,359
This is a battle between me and Su Cheng Jun,

301
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:12,039
I want to win with my own power.

302
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,640
Their proposal

303
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,479
can indeed save up a lot of money,

304
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,559
but I've roughly calculated,

305
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,919
the project is unable to take up this much burden.

306
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:25,159
I'm worried if their proposal were implemented,

307
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,559
something bad would surely happen.

308
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,280
This might be our breakthrough.

309
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,239
This time, we can no longer act rashly.

310
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,679
Any mistakes

311
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,719
could give our opponent the chance to win.

312
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,119
Yeah.

313
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,520
You're back.

314
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,000
You came early,

315
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
did you skip work?

316
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,760
You're a leader,

317
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:00,359
you should mind your behaviors.

318
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,359
Is he insane?

319
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,000
Hello, why did you pick up the call so late?

320
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,280
What's the matter?
If there's nothing, I'm hanging up.

321
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,200
Don't, don't hang up.

322
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,280
Of course, I do.

323
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:40,960
Jiao Yang is back,

324
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:42,039
but he looks bad

325
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,359
and has a bad temper.

326
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,760
What's wrong with him?

327
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,320
This morning when he went out,

328
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,640
he was so energetic.

329
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,080
He even said if he got the project today,

330
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:50,479
he would treat me lobsters when he was back...

331
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:53,840
With him like that,

332
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:56,000
did my lobsters go down the drain?

333
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,919
Something went wrong.

334
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,119
Is it about work?

335
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,599
Why aren't you here to comfort him?

336
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,359
What are you doing?

337
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,079
Not good timing.

338
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,079
He's in such a bad mood now,

339
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,920
yet you're not here to coax him.

340
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,239
Why are you so petty?

341
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,040
It's not me being petty,

342
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:13,359
at this time,

343
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,160
it's not helpful

344
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,839
for anyone to comfort him.

345
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,479
It's better for him to

346
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,719
think things through by himself.

347
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,439
I don't understand what you're talking now,

348
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,640
but let me just tell you...

349
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,239
when I was with Su Cheng Jun,

350
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,359
I would never beat around the bush.

351
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,800
I would say whatever I wanted to say.

352
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,520
If you don't speak up now,

353
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,680
when there's nothing else to say anymore, you'll...

354
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:39,000
Let bygones be bygones,

355
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,119
you should focus on the future.

356
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,359
Stop telling me what to do,

357
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll live my life the way I want.

358
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:45,800
Your way of living is being innocent and rash,

359
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,239
if you don't get hurt, you'll never turn back.

360
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:48,119
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:50,319
I'm rash, I'm reckless,

362
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,959
if I don't get hurt, I'll never turn back.

363
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,359
Anyhow, I'm still better than you,

364
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,319
not speaking what your heart truly feels.

365
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,800
I just ask you one thing

366
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,560
whether you like Jiao Yang or not.

367
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,520
No comment.

368
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,479
So you do like him.

369
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,599
Jiao Yang told me that

370
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,560
the incident between me and Su Cheng Jun

371
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,640
is not your fault.

372
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,920
Although I don't really believe what he says,

373
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,640
I can see that

374
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,119
he really believes you,

375
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,040
loves you very much.

376
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,599
You've got the treasure
but you're calling yourself poor,

377
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,040
I really wish to hit you, do you know that?

378
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,520
Thank you.

379
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,280
Sometimes the person in the
game can't see the big picture,

380
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,439
you see more clearly than I could.

381
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,479
Don't shed tears of gratitude.

382
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:32,199
Let me tell you,

383
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,560
I'm doing this all for myself.

384
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:36,040
I don't want to get involved when

385
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,920
President Jiao gets angry.

386
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,040
I still want to eat lobsters,

387
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,599
stop talking and get over now.

388
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,640
Hello, chairman.

389
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,920
Chairman.

390
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,160
You're here.

391
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,439
The result of today's bidding is not so ideal.

392
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,199
I'm thinking

393
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,079
if you could

394
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,439
give Jiao Yang a call

395
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,959
and provide him with a little guidance?

396
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,359
Lin,

397
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,959
why don't you trust that Jiao Yang

398
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,319
could solve this problem by himself?

399
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,079
I...

400
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,400
I only wish that

401
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:51,319
when he's lost and suffering,

402
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,719
his most important person

403
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:53,839
could comfort him

404
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,560
and tell him, "You can do it".

405
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,680
Be it me

406
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,160
or you,

407
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,560
even if we said ten thousand times "you can do it",

408
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,119
it's not as useful as him
telling himself, "I can do it".

409
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,479
Let him make the decision

410
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,439
for the bidding.

411
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,000
Chairman,

412
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,359
why are you a little different from before?

413
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,359
In the past, I don't know much about this brat,

414
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,640
but lately, his performance has been good,

415
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,160
so now I'm starting to reflect on myself.

416
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,719
Forcing Jiao Yang to

417
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:31,000
live the way I've planned out for him

418
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,800
might not be a good thing after all.

419
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,359
Parents love their children,

420
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,280
so it's natural to plan ahead for them.

421
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,719
You're not wrong.

422
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,920
His mother once told me to

423
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,520
let go when it's time.

424
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
Only until today,

425
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,479
I've understood the meaning of this sentence.

426
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:52,760
Without my help,

427
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,640
Jiao Yang can still have achievements

428
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,800
with his own ways.

429
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
In future, I won't

430
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:00,800
meddle too much in his matters anymore.

431
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,359
I really envy Jiao Yang.

432
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,560
There's not one absolutely
correct education method,

433
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,000
but you and your wife

434
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,760
have been loving Jiao Yang
with your own ways.

435
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:16,640
You're now even willing to

436
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,119
change yourself voluntarily for him.

437
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,680
Not everyone

438
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,439
can grow up in such a loving environment.

439
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,599
Lin,

440
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,599
when you're at my age,

441
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,560
you will understand one thing.

442
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,280
In your life,

443
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:40,760
you should always continue forward,

444
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:42,640
everything in the past

445
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,439
is just a shadow.

446
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,280
By the way, Chairman.

447
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,160
I have one more question.

448
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,079
Please.

449
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,199
In today's bidding, the quotation
that Zhong Qing Group proposed

450
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:55,160
was abnormally low.

451
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:56,959
Su Cheng Jun said that it was because

452
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,319
he's close to Boss Chang,

453
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,199
so he got a very low price.

454
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,040
However, based on Boss Chang's

455
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,680
resourceful character,

456
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,680
he would never trade at a loss.

457
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,439
Chang,

458
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:11,319
had already been in the
construction materials market,

459
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:13,079
when Hong Yu Group was just established.

460
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,119
All these years,

461
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,319
he started from scratch
to accepting all sorts of businesses.

462
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,839
He's indeed a person with network and means.

463
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,000
So, I'm suspecting something fishy behind it.

464
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:29,319
And this might be the key to your success.

465
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,239
I will investigate it thoroughly.

466
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:33,040
Lin,

467
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,560
Jiao Yang is now at a critical moment,

468
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:38,560
so I wish you could be by his side.

469
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,040
Half of the three-month limit has already passed,

470
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,640
I can't stay here forever.

471
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:52,959
Director Su,

472
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:55,760
this is a list of top designers in the industry

473
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,280
that you've asked me to contact.

474
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,400
They're very interested in the proposal.

475
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,520
You have to follow up with this matter closely.

476
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,839
When it's necessary, you can

477
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,119
sign a trial contract with each of them.

478
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,920
The condition is that they are not allowed to

479
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,520
accept other company's orders in the meantime.

480
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:14,319
I'll never allow other designs

481
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,359
to be better than ours.

482
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,079
Director Su,

483
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,319
this is a taboo in the industry,

484
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,400
we'll offend a lot of people.

485
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:26,119
Yes, you're right.

486
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,280
Go and ask Wang to come in here.

487
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:36,560
Director Su.

488
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,479
Wang,

489
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,000
from today onwards,

490
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,319
you're fully responsible for Chen's tasks.

491
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,400
Director Su.

492
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,400
Chen has too big of his own mind,

493
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,599
I don't dare to have him by my side anymore.

494
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,319
You'll go through the
resignation formalities tomorrow.

495
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,640
Director Su,

496
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,359
I, I admit my mistake.

497
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:02,920
Director Su,

498
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,920
I will never doubt your decision anymore.

499
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,839
The things you order, I'll work on them right away.

500
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,239
Can, can you give me one more chance?

501
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,199
Then, I'll wait and see your performance.

502
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,680
Chairman,

503
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,199
the things that you want are all in here.

504
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,760
Is he here?

505
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,839
Do you want him to come in now?

506
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,319
Yes.

507
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,479
Come in.

508
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:36,280
Chairman.

[How to comfort a man when he's upset]

510
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,680
First,

511
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,479
speak nothing when meeting each other

512
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:49,640
and hug him directly.

513
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,280
While hugging,

514
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:53,439
don't forget to caress his hair.

515
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:55,680
Caress his hair?

516
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:00,920
The way you coax a child or a pet,

517
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,040
use it on him.

518
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,880
Then, hold his face,

519
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,839
look at him seriously

520
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,560
and tell him.

521
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:08,640
No, no.

522

"If you want to talk, I'll listen.

524
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:14,479
I won't ask anymore."

525
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,880
Don't forget to add one more sentence,

526
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,560
"No matter what,

527

I'll be with you.

I won't leave you, okay?"

529
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,040

I pressed the wrong bell.

536

Hold on,

537
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,160
I have something to say.

538
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
Say, say what?

539
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,760
Then, then caress his hair.

Caress his hair.

541

What does it mean by caress his hair?

542
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:10,880
Caress, caress, caress.

543
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,560
Caress, caress, caress.

544
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,000
What exactly are you doing?

545

Stop talking, I haven't finished yet.

If you want to talk, I'll listen.

If you don't want to talk about it,

I won't ask anymore.

549

don't you know?

Rest early then.

This is called caressing hair?

What is it?

570
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,199
Brown sugar ginger water.

571
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,319
You're on period,

572
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:00,280
so it's good for you.

573
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,479
How do you know that I'm on period?

574
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,359
Did you calculate my cycle in secret?

575
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,000
You're so scary.

576
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,400
I have no ill intention.

577
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,079
Seeing that you're doing good with a bad heart,

578
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,119
let me give it a try.

579
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,040
The ginger is very fine,

580
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,280
and it's 70 per cent sweet,

581
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,119
you know me very well.

582
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,319
But,

583
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,760
knowing something is
according to the situation.

584
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,599
You can know whatever you should know,

585
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,800
but for those that you shouldn't
know, seal your eyes and mouth tight.

586
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,119
I know my mistake already.

587
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:40,359
Never mind,

588
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,280
today I'm very generous,

589
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,640
so I'll forgive you this time.

590
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:46,239
Here you are,

591
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:47,479
have you seen Jiao Yang?

592
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,959
I haven't seen him the entire morning.

593
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:49,920
That's weird,

594
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,119
I thought he is never late anymore.

595
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,520
Bad news, bad news, bad news.

596
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,560
Have you heard of it?
Something happened to the chairman.

597
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,439
It's so early in the morning,

598
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:57,000
don't say such inauspicious words.

599
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,400
What's wrong with the chairman?

600
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
I heard that he fell sick,

601
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,959
but I'm not sure about the details.

602
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,800
Can you understand more before you come here?

603
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,160
Where should I go and find out?

604
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,199
I didn't hear anything about it...

605
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,359
Last night, the chairman passed out in his study,

606
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,000
but he's fine now.

607
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,319
The doctor said that the chairman
needs more rest lately,

608
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,359
so everything in our company

609
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,920
will be temporarily
taken over by Chairman Zhao.

610
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,920
Then, what about Jiao Yang?

611
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,439
I'll go look for him.

612
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:24,040
No need, I'm here.

613
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,439
President Jiao, based on your instructions,

614
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:32,560
I've already contacted all the
experienced designers in the industry,

615
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,680
but

616
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,719
they're all occupied for now.

617
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,800
Not even one?

618
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:39,079
Yes, what a bad coincidence.

619
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,599
-It's not a coincidence.
-It's not a coincidence.

620
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:53,160
Someone's trying to
cut off all the top designers,

621
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,920
so we won't be able to
hand in the design drafts in time.

622
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,319
Actually,

623
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,280
I was afraid that this might happen,

624
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,719
so I've prepared a copy of

625
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:01,800
designers' list.

626
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
They are all new designers

627
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,119
who got famous in the past two years.

628
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,959
Although they're not that experienced,

629
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:08,239
they're young and

630
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,000
innovative.

631
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,839
Assistant Lin is more thoughtful than us.

632
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,280
Our design this time

633
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,400
originally inclines towards

634
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,640
the young generation.

635
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:16,880
Using new and young designers might

636
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,880
really create some surprises.

637
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,520
That's right,

638
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,560
all the popular designers are too expensive

639
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,800
and their designs might not be that good.

640
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,000
It's already hard to consider these expenses.

641
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,760
Yes,

642
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,040
cutting down this part of the expenses

643
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
is very helpful to reduce the total cost.

644
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,199
Assistant Lin,

645
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,239
you're so awesome,

646
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,760
we all have to learn from you.

647
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,199
With Assistant Lin,

648
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,479
our President Jiao will definitely win.

649
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,319
Enough. Sit down and start the meeting.

650
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:41,400
Regarding the plan of

651
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,640
combining Infinite Home and traditional hotels,

652
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,319
we must focus on the industrial chain,

653
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:48,000
so that President Liu
can see the practical profit

654
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,439
and we can impress him.

655
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,839
Do you understand?

656
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,319
How about you? Never mind,

657
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,359
I don't even understand, how could you?

658
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,880
What President Jiao meant was

659
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:01,000
to have Heng Yuan working with Hong Yu

660
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,560
to develop this Infinite Home Project.

661
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,040
Yes.

662
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:05,479
Relying on the system
advantages of the two major groups,

663
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,959
the Infinite Home concept
can be extended to Heng Yuan,

664
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:10,199
or even to the hotels under Hong Yu Group.

665
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,920
By then, the return of investment

666
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,880
will not be as simple as
a five-floor condominium any more.

667
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,599
Yes, Assistant Lin is so smart.

668
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,280
No, President Jiao is the smart one.

669
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:19,800
President Jiao and Assistant Lin
really have such good chemistry,

670
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,719
not like us who can't understand a thing.

671
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,479
Yan Xin,

672
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:23,880
you've been working in Hong Yu Group for so long,

673
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,439
yet you don't understand President Jiao as much as

674
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:26,479
Assistant Lin who was just here for two months.

675
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,160
Assistant Lin is only here for two months.

676
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:29,319
I thought Assistant Lin was already

677
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,640
here for two years.

678
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,280
Enough, listen to me.

679
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,640
Now, besides the landing of the plan,

680
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,959
another key issue is that

681
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:36,920
Zhong Qing Group's quotation

682
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,040
is indeed 15 million yuan cheaper than ours,

683
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,079
but I've already done a rough calculation,

684
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,920
something is definitely wrong.

Now, let's divide the tasks.

you two continue to communicate
with the engineers about the budget.

688
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,319
Jiang Rou, you sort out the detailed information

of all the hotels under Hong Yu Group.

690

verify the issue on the designers.

you're dismissed.

693
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,000
President Jiao, since I don't have a task,

694
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,479
I'll go to Su Cheng Jun's

695

construction material market to have a look.

696
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:03,959
Maybe I'll find out

some little secrets in their quotation.

let me prove it to you.

Do you feel that

President Jiao is a little off today?

705
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,040
Even a blind person can see it.

706

This afternoon I have
some personal matters to attend to,

707

I'll apply for a half-day leave.

Okay.

710

did you and Assistant Lin get into a fight?

Wait, did you and Ding Ding
exchange bodies or what?

but I want to win once on my own.

I think you're already doing a great job.

my suggestion is,

729

Our club is professional in this field.

Director Zhao,

862
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:31,360
I have a small and immature suggestion.

863
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:31,919
Say it.

864

Boss Chang,

865
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,159
our President Jiao is too young

866
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,360
and has his own image,

867
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:52,239
so he couldn't bring himself here to beg you.

868

Can an image feed him?

Yes, yes, yes. Boss Chang, you're right.

871

At this time of the year,
who would find faults in money,

right?

873
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,959
See, we are relying on Boss Chang

874
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:07,399
to turn the table.

875

Is that okay?

877
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:18,600
Okay, okay.

878

We'll go with your plan,

879

but we need to inspect the stocks ourselves.

880
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,520
After all, this is the first time
President Jiao does this business,

881
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:28,840
so he's a little worried.

why don't you come with me and have a look?

890
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,560
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

Miss Qin must think that

you're not very confident with
