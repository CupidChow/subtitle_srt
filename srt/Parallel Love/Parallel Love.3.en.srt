ever since you broke up, right?

Yes.

chocolate before either?

I didn't expect that

148
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,119
you pushed me to one side immediately

149
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,840
and pressed on me for the whole night,
my arms feel sore now.

Really.

About your benefit of the staff dormitory,

164
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,239
I rejected it already.

165
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,359
I admit that

166
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,159
it is my fault.

167
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,799
But now the staff dormitory is full.

168
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,200
With your tragic situation now,

169
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,280
I am willing to take you in.

170
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,359
As an act of kindness,

171
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll send you to work

172
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:25,880
until one day your salary

173
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,039
is enough for you to rent a house.

174
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,960
What is he planning to do again?

175
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,039
Thank you for being considerate.

176
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,119
But...

177
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,840
Rules for free-living.

178
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,239
Firstly,

179
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,039
I will only take you in for a month

180
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,679
to avoid myself

181
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,400
from any scandals again.

182
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,119
After you receive your salary,

183
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:07,239
you have to go rent a place to stay.

184
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,719
Secondly,

185
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,599
you are responsible for the cleaning
and cooking housework at home.

186
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,119
Thirdly,

187
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,080
do not interrupt me when I am playing games.

188
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,239
Fourth,

189
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,840
this is also the most important point,

190
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,719
do not secretly tell my father

191
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:21,960
about my whereabouts.

192
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,479
If there is any violation,

193
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,039
I can make you homeless again.

194
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,960
Let's add another one, President Jiao.

195
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,679
Fifth,

196
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:31,719
to protect President Jiao's reputation,

197
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,479
do not let anyone know that

198
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,320
I am staying at your house temporarily.

199
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,000
Okay.

200
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:38,159
I'm having the same thought as well.

201
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,660
[Rules for free-living]

202
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,880
What an insensible woman.

203
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,840
I didn't even feel embarrassed yet.

204
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
She was already so anxious to request
keeping this matter as a secret.

205
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,119
Looking at the situation,

206
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,159
Jiao Yang

207
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,599
is certainly going to become the president.

208
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,239
But now my phone is out of battery.

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,840
How can people contact me

210
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,200
even if I completed the task ahead of time?

211
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,599
Stop dreaming, you can't go back.

212
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,400
What?

213
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,679
The situation you encountered

214
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,159
meets the basic conditions of a love break.

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,359
I guess your rental wasn't expired,

216
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,559
you were driven out by your boyfriend, right?

217
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,440
How was it?

218
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,359
I guessed it correctly, right?

219
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,320
I had eight girlfriends previously.

220
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,640
I am pretty clear of

221
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,400
what a man is thinking about.

222
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,919
But I assumed that he is not a good person too

223
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,440
since he drove you out of the house.

224
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,919
Be optimistic.

225
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,599
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,159
You think too much.

227
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,840
It's normal

228
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:01,880
to deny it.

229
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,640
I understand, I understand.

230
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:21,919
President Jiao, aren't we going to work?

231
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,000
Why do we come to the mall?

232
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,200
Are you planning to keep on using

233
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,400
the disposable product in my house?

234
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,880
Let's go.

235
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,919
But we are almost late.

236
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,719
Don't worry, I know you don't have any money.

237
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,840
I will give you some employee benefits in advance.

238
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,320
Miss.

239
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,239
I don't care about the quality of your life.

240
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:43,960
But your look will affect my aestheticism.

241
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,679
Okay.

242
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,679
You want to guard the car, right?

243
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,520
Please pay the parking fee for me

244
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,320
when the toll collector comes.

245
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,960
You...

246
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,280
So troublesome.

247
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,320
President Jiao, I'm done.

248
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,000
Following the rule No.3,

249
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,919
do not disturb me when I am playing games.

250
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,760
We are already one hour late.

251
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,159
You are the boss or I am the boss?

252
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,159
Wait for me aside.

253
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:27,440
I just slightly changed my perspective on him.

254
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,119
But immediately he managed to revert it.

255
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,359
President Jiao.

256
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,520
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,119
I think the game is over.

258
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,719
Can we go to checkout now?

259
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,000
Assistant Lin.

260
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,159
Did you take it with your eyes closed?

261
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,719
This toothbrush is bad.

262
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,799
It is designed with no layering.

263
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,440
The toothpaste and toothbrush
can't fit each other perfectly.

264
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,520
It is ineffective for cleaning the teeth.

265
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,919
Change it.

266
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,719
Change this cup too.

267
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,479
It doesn't match the style of my bathroom.

268
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,440
Change again.

269
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,039
Are you fooling me around?

270
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,359
President Jiao.

271
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,559
I am staying for one month only.

272
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,400
If you don't want to be absent from work,

273
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,640
do it as soon as possible.

274
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,599
And Assistant Lin, did you forget about

275
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,960
your trial period of three months?

276
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,599
You're to be expelled
if you're absent from work without a reason.

277
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,280
You must choose
a soft bamboo charcoal nano toothbrush.

278
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,559
It matches the colour of the basin of my house.

279
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,840
Got it, President Jiao.

280
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:02,919
Trying to fight with me?

281
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,400
Hello, hello, sorry.

282
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,840
Where is the soft bamboo
charcoal nano toothbrush?

283
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,599
Over there.

284
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:10,039
Thank you very much.

285
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,080
Oh, my god.

286
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,840
How do I give something to a female subordinate?

287
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,919
President Jiao, let's go.

288
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,440
Assistant Lin.

289
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:36,280
I just bought a box of chewing gum.

290
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,640
Please get it for me.

291
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,119
President Jiao, I have it here.

292
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,159
I suddenly don't want to eat it anymore.

293
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:46,000
Forget it.

294
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,520
Damn this Xin.

295
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,479
Who made him put the chewing gum there?

296
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:57,000
This is your reward.

297
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:59,640
What is this?

298
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,159
Open it yourself.

299
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,640
Tell me what it is first.

300
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,319
Never mind if you don't want it.

301
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,959
I am now taking back your gift.

302
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,959
-No, no, no.
-I'll take it back.

303
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,560
-I'll take a look.
-I'm not giving it to you anymore.

304
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,119
What is this?

305
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,839
What do you mean?

306
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,119
I saw your feet are hurt.

307
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,800
Then, this is a giveaway

308
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,520
from the supermarket's promotion.

309
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:37,439
Just give it to you

310
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,959
as your employee benefit.

311
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,599
I don't want it.

312
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,880
Are you sure what you are saying now?

313
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,920
This is...

314
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,119
This is a gift from me.

315
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,239
I give it to you.

316
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,119
It's eleven already, hurry and go to the company.

317
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,680
Can we stop discussing

318
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,640
a pair of sneaker that
an eighteen-year-old girl favors here?

319
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,599
Are you saying that my aestheticism is childish?

320
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,199
Are you serious?

321
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:04,239
This is the best-selling model of the year.

322
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:04,760
I...

323
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,439
Yes, it is childish and dumb.

324
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:07,239
Would you please send it

325
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:08,560
to your peers?

326
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,239
Thank you.

327
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:14,959
Get off.

328
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:17,119
Get off!

329
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:19,800
Faster!

330
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:36,920
Hello, Xin.

331
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,959
Come to me within five minutes.

332
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,400
I will give you a pair of

333
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,439
limited edition sneakers from Jiao Yang.

334
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,719
Bye.

335
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Grandma, I miss you so much.

336
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,719
The patient had a stroke.

337
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,640
Her brain nerve is damaged.

338
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,119
For a long time,

339
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,359
she will maintain this state.

340
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,640
She's unconscious when you communicate with her.

341
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,359
In the medical field,

342
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:24,400
we named this situation

343
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,199
as vegetative.

344
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:29,119
Grandma.

345
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:30,760
The child's parents are gone.

346
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,800
I was late.

347
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,119
So pity.

348
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,439
Jun.

349
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,599
Let grandma take care of you.

350
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:48,599
You...

351
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,520
You...talk to me.

352
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,520
I...I will accompany you more.

353
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:01,239
I will accompany you more.

354
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,920
Wake up, Grandma.

355
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:05,920
Wake up.

356
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,719
Please wake up, I will accompany you more.

357
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:13,359
Grandma, I will accompany you more.

358
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,239
I am working outside, Grandma.

359
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,640
The boss is satisfied with my work.

360
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,160
Who am I?

361
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,199
Your granddaughter

362
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,640
is the best among these graduates, right?

363
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,239
You are the best graduate?

364
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:32,119
Do you know you are getting fired?

365
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,160
Sorry, leader.

366
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,199
I really have an emergency.

367
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,680
Can I apply for leave when I am back?

368
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,560
I beg you.

369
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,359
No need.

370
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,319
Lin Wei Jun.

371
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,959
You are fired.

372
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
That day,

373
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,560
not only I didn't receive
the notification of permanent employment

374
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
that I have long-awaited,

375
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,040
but I also lost my family member

376
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,760
who treated me the best in the world.

377
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,400
25th.

378
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:00,920
Since I am back,

379
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,040
I will definitely change all these.

380
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,719
Grandma.

381
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,160
This time,

382
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,719
I will never let anything happen to you again.

383
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,040
President Jiao, I would like to tell you.

384
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,359
This pair of a globally limited edition
of customized sneakers

385
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,319
is indeed very unique.

386
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,800
But,

387
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,640
the size may be a bit too small for me.

388
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,640
Describe this pair of sneakers

389
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:29,920
with a word.

390
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:30,800
Handsome.

391
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,400
Two words.

392
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,160
Very perfect.

393
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,839
Four words.

394
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:33,719
It is so impeccable.

395
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,400
But when I took this pair of sneakers

396
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,160
to give it to that woman just now...

397
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,040
President Jiao, you gave a gift to a woman?

398
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,640
Don't be loud.

399
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:50,280
I saw her feet were hurt.

400
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,640
So I was trying to be kind.

401
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:54,479
I said it was a giveaway from
the supermarket promotion.

402
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,640
She rejected it.

403
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,920
President Jiao, you gave a gift to her

404
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,959
and you got rejected?

405
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,640
Did I ask you to repeat it?

406
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,040
President Jiao, why don't you just say that

407
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,920
it was a gift from you.

408
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,119
How could I do that?

409
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,719
How embarrassing it is if other people know that

410
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,640
I sent a pair of sneakers to an assistant

411
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,359
as a boss.

412
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,000
But comparing with that,

413
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,359
it is more embarrassing that it was your first time

414
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,199
sending a gift to a girl,

415
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:19,199
and yet you got rejected.

416
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,359
What are you talking about?

417
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,959
President Jiao, I meant

418
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:26,040
it is fine if she didn't want it.

419
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:27,880
I'll help you return it to the store.

420
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:28,680
No way.

421
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,959
This is my first time

422
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,880
to give something to a woman.

423
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,160
My reputation will be tarnished

424
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,160
if people know about this.

425
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:38,920
President Jiao.

426
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,040
Maybe she doesn't need this pair of sneakers?

427
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,119
You know nothing.

428
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,439
The key point is not this pair of sneakers.

429
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,959
The key point is that it was a gift from me.

430
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,640
Even if she doesn't wear it

431
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,599
and put it at a corner,

432
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,439
it is also an artwork.

433
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,839
But she rejected it without hesitation.

434
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:01,640
Fine.

435
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,239
I will make her beg me

436
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,040
to give this pair of sneakers to her.

437
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,620
[25th, August]

438
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,479
-Hi, President Jiao.
-Hi, President Jiao.

439
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,319
President Jiao.

440
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,920
Everyone in the company already knew
about the rooftop wedding yesterday.

441
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,560
President Jiao is indeed

442
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,920
very well experienced.

443
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,239
Of course, thanks to Assistant Lin too.

444
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,560
Assistant Lin.

445
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,839
I have something to discuss with Secretary Yan.

446
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,599
Can you get us two cups of coffee?

447
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,479
Okay.

448
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,160
President Jiao, is there anything else?

449
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,359
I just remembered.

450
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,680
Secretary Yan can't sleep well.

451
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,520
He can't drink coffee.

452
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,599
Please get him a glass of milk instead.

453
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:04,599
Go.

454
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,959
Okay, no problem.

455
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,719
Secretary Yan, please drink.

456
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,520
Thank you.

457
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:18,000
The colour of my cup is not nice.

458
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,560
Can you help me get another one?

459
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,199
Okay, no problem.

460
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:26,319
It is cold.

461
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,359
Get me a hot one.

462
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,719
President Jiao, I can't drink this.

463
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,880
Why you can't drink.

464
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,560
I am drinking with you.

465
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,359
President Jiao, how about you try this cup?

466
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:36,239
Just right.

467
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,400
Secretary Yan would like to
have another cup of milk.

468
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:42,880
What are you doing?

469
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,520
Didn't you just say you were thirsty?

470
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,239
Drink quickly.

471
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:45,880
President Jiao, I...

472
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,959
Don't let Assistant Lin stand here.

473
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,359
Drink it, quickly finish it.

474
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,560
Refill it.

475
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,520
Okay.

476
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:08,719
Refill it.

477
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,719
President Jiao, your coffee.

478
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,439
Secretary Yan, your cup of milk.

479
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,599
Thank you.

480
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:24,560
Assistant Lin.

481
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,800
Aren't you tired?

482
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,719
No.

483
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,040
President Jiao,
do you any thing else want me to do?

484
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,280
Okay, I'll go out first.

485
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:40,160
President Jiao, did you
drink too much black coffee?

486
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,160
I wanted to tell you from the beginning

487
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:44,079
that I am intolerant to lactose.

488
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:45,359
As soon as I drink milk, I will...

489
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,040
I'm going to get diarrhoea.

490
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,319
President Jiao.

491
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:07,040
I think let's just forget about it.

492
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,439
Hi, Ying Jun.

493
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,680
Yes, it's me.

494
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,319
Please inform Assistant Lin

495
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,760
to go to the publicity department on the 45th floor

496
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,800
and bring all the company's
publicity project planning

497
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,959
for the coming three months to my office.

498
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,319
Right now, immediately.

499
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,959
President Jiao, just give up.

500
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,599
Assistant Lin is a fast runner.

501
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,119
This trick is useless to her.

502
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,599
Go to the electric control room,

503
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,560
ask them to stop the elevator service
under my command.

504
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,560
President Jiao.

505
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,119
There are twenty floors from here
to the publicity department.

506
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,920
Isn't she a fast runner?

507
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:42,959
Chairman.

508
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,359
This time, President Jiao did a good job

509
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,839
on the event at Leisure Hotel.

510
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,479
He didn't disappoint you.

511
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,199
He finally works hard.

512
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,560
Let's go to his office

513
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,520
to see him first.

514
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:54,319
Okay.

515
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,640
President Jiao, the control room said

516
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,599
currently only C1 elevator is working.

517
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,239
President Jiao.

518
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,319
Assistant Lin is already
waiting for the elevator.

519
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,959
The elevator number is C1.

520
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:09,640
Okay, tell the control room

521
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,199
to stop the elevator for only two minutes.

522
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:13,199
I will recover the elevator service
when she starts climbing the stairs.

523
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,079
What happened?

524
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:26,560
Maybe the elevator is out of service.

525
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:27,520
Wait a moment.

526
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,119
I'll make a call to the electric control room.

527
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,119
Assistant Lin.

528
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,719
President Jiao called and said

529
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,119
that document is very important

530
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,599
and he hopes to see it in ten minutes.

531
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,040
Childish.

532
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:54,079
I don't believe that you can bear it

533
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:56,199
after climbing twenty floors of stairs.

534
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,640
President Jiao,

535
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
the electric control room
said there are people in the elevator.

536
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,079
Let them stay in the elevator

537
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,760
for another 18 minutes.

538
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,319
Tell them that the bonus
will be doubled this month.

539
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:06,920
Okay.

540
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,719
Tell them that

541
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:09,920
President Jiao asked them to stay in the elevator

542
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,040
for a few more minutes.

543
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,400
This month's bonus will be doubled.

544
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:16,920
President Jiao.

545
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:20,040
The chairman said he is
very grateful for your generosity.

546
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,119
But he didn't want to wait...

547
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,359
He has to wait no matter how.

548
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:24,760
Chairman?

549
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,959
Open the door quickly and let the chairman out.

550
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,520
President Jiao, the control room said that

551
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,839
once the elevator service is disabled,

552
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:39,040
it takes at least ten minutes to restart.

553
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:52,839
Old rules.

554
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,880
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

555
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:55,959
The loser

556
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:57,520
will have to take the document
and ask President Jiao to sign

557
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
to save him.

558
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:01,400
Come, rock-paper-scissors!

559
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,439
No way.

560
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:06,359
Jiang Rou.

561
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:09,000
It's time for you to show
your loyalty to President Jiao.

562
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:16,760
Assistant Lin.

563
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,959
Chairman invited you to see him.

564
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,479
Okay.

565
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,040
Dad, don't work too hard.

566
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:32,239
Chairman.

567
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:37,719
Lin.

568
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,280
I'll assign a job to you.

569
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:40,800
Please say.

570
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,439
Starting from today,

571
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
I give you the right

572
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,000
to supervise Jiao Yang's every action.

573
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,400
Stand straight.

574
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,640
If he makes another mistake again,

575
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,280
I will fire you.

576
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:02,599
His is such a troublesome.

577
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:05,040
It will be strange if one day
he doesn't get into any trouble.

578
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,640
I won't be able to go back if I don't care about him.

579
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,520
But, to supervise him, I...

580
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,160
What's the difference between
supervising him and torturing myself?

581
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:15,119
Chairman, actually...

582
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:16,880
President Jiao is an adult.

583
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,199
His behavior, I...

584
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:22,119
I'm afraid that I'm incompetent.

585
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,359
Do you mean that

586
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:25,280
you want to quit now?

587
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,959
This is not what I meant.

588
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,079
Good.

589
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,560
We had a deal.

590
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,920
It seems that not only I have to be a sister

591
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,079
but also a mother.

592
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:53,160
How could this kind of loser become the president?

593
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,839
Can I really go back after three months?

594
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,040
President Jiao.

595
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,160
Where are you going?

596
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,880
I want to go inspect the situation on each floor.

597
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,520
It's none of your business, do your own work.

598
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,640
I'll go with you.

599
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:24,400
No need.

600
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,560
You can do what you want.

601
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,319
The chairman said I have to supervise...

602
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,560
follow your every action.

603
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,719
Okay.

604
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,719
President Jiao, you are not going?

605
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,119
Hello, K.

606
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,839
Okay, stop rushing me, I'll come right away.

607
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:51,800
Bye.

608
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,160
Where is the hoverboard?

609
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:01,520
It's not here.

610
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,319
President Jiao.

611
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,760
Who asked you to mess with my stuff?

612
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,920
I heard that

613
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,000
in order to avoid the chairman to suspect you

614
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,239
skipping work,

615
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:19,800
so you usually use this, right?

616
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,439
You are looking for it?

617
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,640
Are you going out this afternoon?

618
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,800
Do you know if there is a meeting in the afternoon?

619
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,079
If you drive,

620
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,560
the security will tell the secretary.

621
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,800
The secretary will inform the chairman.

622
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,199
So you have to use the hoverboard

623
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:31,599
to sneak away from the side door.

624
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,319
Assistant Lin.

625
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,319
You are really competent.

626
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,479
Really? Thank you for your compliment.

627
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,640
If it wasn't for me to go back,

628
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,040
who wants to care about you?

629
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,479
Where are you going?

630
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:48,280
The restroom.

631
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,319
Let's go together, I'll wait for you at the door.

632
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,400
No need.

633
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,239
Let's go together.

634
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,580
[Proposal]

635
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,199
Not bad, very efficient.

636
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,040
Fill in the details later.

637
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,239
Put it on my desk tomorrow before the work starts.

638
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:02,760
Okay.

639
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,920
You can ask Lin, the one with President Jiao.

640
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,719
if you have any problem.

641
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,160
Lin?

642
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,640
Yes, the new assistant.

643
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,239
Who is this?

644
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,680
This is President Jiao's new assistant.

645
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:30,119
Hello, I am Su Cheng Jun
from the marketing department.

646
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:54,160
It has been 20 minutes and she is still not leaving.

647
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,160
President Jiao.

648
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,119
Can I go out?

649
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,840
No way.

650
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,760
I can't just get fully controlled by her.

651
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,919
I will show you how I'm going to fight back.

652
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:33,479
President Jiao.

653
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
My cell phone!

654
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:58,800
Assistant Lin.

655
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,120
Why did you slip?

656
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,439
I told you not to wear high heels.

657
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:03,439
But you never listen.

658
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,120
When you were studying,

659
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,439
are you part of the basketball team?

660
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,320
Your toss is quite accurate.

661
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,320
What is this?

662
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,360
How come I've never seen it before?

663
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:14,840
Come.

664
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,360
Nothing.

665
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,320
Is it something precious?

666
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:32,719
I'll pay for your loss.

667
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,040
I told you not to wear high heels.

668
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,159
That's why you slipped.

669
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,439
If you wear the sneakers that I gave you,

670
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,120
there will be no such an accident, right?

671
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,520
Are you listening?

672
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:57,439
Your brain is useless anyway.

673
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,560
I don't think it matters.

674
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,600
Do you think that you can solve anything with money?

675
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:02,800
You will compensate me?

676
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,439
What are you going to compensate with?

677
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:05,879
Do you know what that is?

678
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,479
You have never seen it!

679
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,040
You don't have to attack me personally.

680
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,280
You are the one following me.

681
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,760
Ridiculous, I following you?

682
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:15,040
What are you thinking?

683
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,600
Let me tell you,

684
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,879
I don't want to follow you at all.

685
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:18,360
I don't want to be your assistant either.

686
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:19,719
If it wasn't for me to go back home,

687
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,959
I won't spend time

688
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,080
accompanying you this childish kid

689
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,239
to play around.

690
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,159
Do you know what you are talking about?

691
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:29,000
Of course, I know what I'm talking about.

692
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,719
I tell you, Jiao Yang.

693
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,360
You are the most grumpy, the most boring,

694
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:34,879
and the most childish person I have ever met.

695
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:35,719
Okay.

696
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,280
Anyway, since now I can't go back anymore,

697
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:38,479
you can do whatever you want to.

698
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:39,719
Fire me, fire me!

699
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:41,639
This is not right.

700
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,520
Why should I wait for you to fire me?

701
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:45,639
I resign!

702
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:47,239
I will go home now to write my resignation.

703
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,520
Do whatever you want.

704
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,560
It seems that our President Jiao

705
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,760
couldn't sit still.

706
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:03,439
Speaking of this,

707
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:05,040
the newcomer, Assistant Lin is quite capable.

708
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,639
President Jiao is so lucky.

709
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,679
Notify the board of directors that

710
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,520
I have a sudden appointment with a client at night.

711
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,479
The meeting will be held one hour in advance.

712
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:18,719
Besides, you help me guard on Assistant Lin.

713
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:20,639
Report to me in time if anything happens.

714
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:21,520
Okay.

715
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:25,120
-President Li.
-President Li.

716
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,159
Do you think that I can only complete the task

717
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,439
by being your assistant?

718
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,399
Let me tell you.

719
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:32,439
I'm going to apply for
the assistant position of the chairman.

720
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:33,840
I'm not going to fool around with you.

721
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,280
President Jiao, President Jiao.

722
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,320
Assistant Lin, have you seen President Jiao?

723
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,000
He died.

724
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:44,320
What are you doing?

725
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,520
Don't pull me.

726
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,600
I'm going to resign.

727
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:48,120
I can't serve President Jiao anymore.

728
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,040
It's none of my business if he lives or dies.

729
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,679
Assistant Lin, you can't go now.

730
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:53,719
The board is going to have a meeting
one hour in advance today.

731
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,760
There are forty-five minutes left.

732
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,959
I couldn't find President Jiao.

733
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,919
What does that have to do with me?

734
00:37:58,439 --> 00:37:59,360
Assistant Lin, Assistant Lin.

735
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,560
You can't see just sit back and watch.

736
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,199
This morning,

737
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,959
President Jiao just made a big mess.

738
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,159
If the board of directors knows he skips work

739
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,520
in the afternoon,

740
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,360
the chairman will certainly not forgive him.

741
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,320
This way.

742
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,520
Isn't it good?

743
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,760
Assistant Lin.

744
00:38:11,879 --> 00:38:13,520
Can you help to look for President Jiao?

745
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,959
If something goes wrong with him,

746
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,360
I can't explain to the chairman.

747
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,159
You should find the police.

748
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:19,159
Why are you asking me for help?

749
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,959
Assistant Lin.

750
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,280
Assistant Lin, I admit that

751
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,840
the way President Jiao gave you that pair of shoe

752
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,760
was a bit perverted.

753
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,719
But you can't be so unforgiving.

754
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,040
What shoes?

755
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,919
The globally limited edition sneakers

756
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:30,040
from President Jiao.

757
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,800
So he had been getting me
into trouble for the whole day

758
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,760
just to give me a pair of shoes?

759
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:44,600
I know this sounds a bit stupid.

760
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,080
But it's true.

761
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,719
So these shoes are not giveaways
from the supermarket promotion.

762
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:56,040
He bought it for me personally?

763
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,159
I have no money.

764
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,239
Where do you want me to live?

765
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,239
Your house?

766
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:05,919
Let's go.

767
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,840
Did you hurt your foot? Put this on.

768
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,439
President Jiao is away and
his cell phone is turned off too.

769
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:23,760
What to do?

770
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,959
I just met Secretary Hu.

771
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:28,879
He said that President Jiao must not be late.

772
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:29,959
He can't make the chairman angry twice

773
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:31,399
in a day.

774
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:33,439
Assistant Lin, twice.

775
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:35,239
Get up first.

776
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,439
No, no, I...

777
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,639
Where does President Jiao usually like to go

778
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,639
when he skips work?

779
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,959
I'm not sure.

780
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,840
He goes to the karaoke when he is happy.

781
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,719
He goes to the basketball court when he is anxious.

782
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,159
He goes to the pet shop when he is upset.

783
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,360
What about when he is angry?

784
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,000
Don't scared, why are you scared of playing games

785
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,280
Go forward!

786
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:56,120
Jiao.

787
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,360
Why are you so angry today?

788
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,399
That keyboard is going to be broken.

789
00:39:58,399 --> 00:39:59,479
It's not that I'm grumpy.

790
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:00,360
These players are really lousy.

791
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,600
They even complained about me.

792
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:02,840
Look what they said about me.

793
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,080
They said I'm childish, I'm...

794
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,000
See what I did today.

795
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,919
Boss.

796
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,479
Don't talk nonsense, focus.

797
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,239
I am playing games.

798
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,080
Boss, behind you.

799
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,239
What's behind?

800
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,479
President Jiao.

801
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:13,360
The lunch break is almost over

802
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,239
When are you going back to the company?

803
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,719
How do you know that I am here?

804
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:21,040
There are not many cyber cafes near the company

805
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:21,919
that serve good coffee, open overnight

806
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,679
and have bubble milk tea too.

807
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:24,840
Just ask about it and I knew it.

808
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,800
But I think

809
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,919
President Jiao had enough

810
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:28,919
black coffee today.

811
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:31,040
So I got you a cup of bubble milk tea.

812
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,639
K, that...

813
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:33,840
Are you offline?

814
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,959
You went offline, hurry up, hurry up.

815
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:36,040
Mine is a bit lag here.

816
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:39,000
President Jiao.

817
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
The chairman asked you

818
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,959
to attend the meeting with
the board of directors today.

819
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:43,600
Pang.

820
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,639
If you came with the equipment,
then fight at the front.

821
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:48,000
They will kill me if you don't fight them.

822
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:50,959
President Jiao.

823
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,320
You are the one who is going to suffer

824
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,959
if you are absent from the meeting.

825
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,159
K, let me be frank.

826
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,639
Give me that equipment.

827
00:40:56,919 --> 00:40:58,000
It is more useful for me to use it.

828
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,520
Believe me.

829
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,080
Give it to me and I will kill them all.

830
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,800
President Jiao.

831
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:04,280
If I remember it correctly,

832
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,639
if you don't lose your memory,

833
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:06,560
this morning,

834
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,479
you just made the chairman angry.

835
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:11,439
You have already resigned.

836
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,320
This is not your job.

837
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:15,320
Say no more.

838
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,520
Since President Jiao likes to play games,

839
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:18,840
let's have a match.

840
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,120
Sorry.

841
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,520
I'm not interested in playing
mini games like minesweeper.

842
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:24,679
Are you scared, President Jiao?

843
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,719
I'm scared? Are you kidding?

844
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,399
I've never been afraid.

845
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,080
K, give her your computer.

846
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,800
I'll teach her how to be a man.

847
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,199
Sit there, sit there if you dare to.

848
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:36,439
President Jiao.

849
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,479
If you lose,

850
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:39,080
you need to go back to the company for the meeting.

851
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,719
Are you kidding?

852
00:41:40,919 --> 00:41:43,560
I don't understand what it means to lose.

853
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,320
I will give you five minutes.

854
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,800
If you win, I'll go with you.

855
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:48,679
If you lose, you disappear immediately.

856
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:49,320
Okay?

857
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,360
Five minutes is too much.

858
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,639
How arrogant you are, come on, choose your player.

859
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,159
There are fifteen minutes left
for the meeting to start.

860
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,120
We need eight minutes to go back.

861
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,239
Two minutes for waiting for the elevator.

862
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,040
Two minutes for going up.

863
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,360
One minute for him to tidy up.

864
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:08,840
To arrive at the meeting room one minute earlier...

865
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,199
15 minus 8 minus 2 minus 2...

866
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:11,159
minus 1 minus 1.

867
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:12,399
I only have one minute to get done.
