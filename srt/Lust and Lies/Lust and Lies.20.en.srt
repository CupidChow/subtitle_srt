00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,780
=Lust and Lies=

2
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,920
The Lion Seal is lost.

3
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,640
Huo Xiu has run away.

4
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,439
If so,

5
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,920
I'll look into it on your behalf.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,479
Yes, sir.

7
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,799
This was found in the account
at Henglong Bank.

8
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,000
Did you expect to see

9
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,079
some immeasurable wealth
in this account as well?

10
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,519
What's inside this briefcase

11
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,280
is the most important wealth to us.

12
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,680
My mother

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,840
never stopped trying
to clean my father's name

14
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,560
and exposing Huo Beishan.

15
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,280
She hid all evidence

16
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,400
in this briefcase.

17
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,879
That means

18
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:03,400
the rumor about the Lion Seal is fake.

19
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,879
Changqing.

20
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,280
I've spread the word about the Lion Seal.

21
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,280
The human heart is greedy.

22
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,879
Everyone will be greedy enough
to fight over the Lion Seal.

23
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,680
When the fortune is found,

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,800
that will be the day

25
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,240
the Huo family meets their demise.

26
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,160
Mother.

27
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,560
Mother.

28
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,639
Are you alright?

29
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,840
Xiu.

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,000
Listen up.

31
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,520
If I die,

32
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,400
you must keep searching for evidence.

33
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,719
You must watch the Huo family

34
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,039
fall into disgrace.

35
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,290
What a brilliant plot, you've managed
to keep your hands clean.

36
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,000
You've actually been doing this
for so many years.

37
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,790
You've put up with all
in the Huo Residence for so long

38
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,479
to search for evidence?

39
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,439
Boss Ruan

40
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,680
never told you what happened back then?

41
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,759
Father only said that Huo Beishan
wanted to silence witnesses,

42
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,759
so he set our house on fire.

43
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,439
As for the reason,

44
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,879
he never once mentioned it.

45
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,680
It's fortunate you're not Huo Qingwan.

46
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,719
And luckily, you don't bear the Huo name.

47
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,900
=Episode 20=

48
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,399
Mr. Sheng.

49
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:33,959
Mr. Sheng.

50
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,680
You know you adore Miss Qingwan.

51
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,000
Only you can save her now.

52
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,079
Why did you say so?

53
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,480
Governor has dispatched the hitmen.

54
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,800
The Huo Army is also on its way there.

55
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,959
You want me

56
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,199
to save Huo Xiu together?

57
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,000
Fine.

58
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll go save him.

59
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,279
Thank you.

60
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,600
You actually believed what I said.

61
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,839
With idiots like you around him,

62
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,439
no wonder Huo Xiu is all useless.

63
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,079
Don't you know

64
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,000
the one I hate most is Huo Xiu?

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,040
You heard it all on that day, no?

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,759
The conversation
between me and Governor.

67
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,079
You're going to silence me?

68
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,560
Young Marshal,
you're truly a skilled shooter.

69
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,680
Put the gun down slowly.

70
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Hurry up!

71
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,800
That's it.

72
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,600
Slowly.

73
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,279
That's the way it is.

74
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,600
Goodbye!

75
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,079

Cheng is missing.

He's the only one
I can trust in the residence.

94
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,360
He's my closest brother.

95
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,680

Huo Beishan.

100
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,120
He must pay for what he did to them.

101
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,200
These are the arms you moved

102
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,400
during the festival
to welcome the deity?

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,559

they'd end up in your hands?

Sucheng has descended into chaos.

124
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,159
We should leave together.

125
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,320
Here comes the best opportunity,

126
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,679
so I can't leave.

127
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,200
If so, we'll put it in the papers soon

128
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,490
and annul the engagement
with the Huo family.

129
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,679
We shall sever our ties.

130
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,360
No.

131
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,120
Let's

132
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,679
see how it goes and carry on
with the marriage alliance.

133
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,840
That's a risky move.

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,360
If we take a wrong step,

135
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,960
we will lose everything.

136
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,559

It's done for?

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,080
