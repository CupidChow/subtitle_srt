Young Master,

3
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,679
Huo Beishan found me…

4
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:53,439
The…

5
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,520
The young lady you love…

6
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,640
Is her name Huo Qingwan?

7
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,120
Remember,

8
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,159
everyone in the Huo family

9
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,280
is our enemy.

10
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,040
You can never be together…

11
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,319
Can we never be together, after all?

She was the only family
I had left in this world.

17
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,879
You can tell me her story.

18
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,680
You'll feel better.

19
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,759
She was my mother's maid.

20
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,560
They were like sisters.

21
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,199
She took care of me

22
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,639
after my mother passed away.

23
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,240
Young Master,

24
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,479
please bear with it.

25
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,520
Whenever I was mistreated
in the Huo family,

26
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,439
she was the one who stood by me.

27
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,520
Only she never

28
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,240

She loved chestnuts,

33
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,039
so I buried her under a chestnut tree.

34
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,319
I'm sure

35
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,000
Madam Li will be happy to see it

no matter how hard it gets,
you have to hold it together.

44
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,000
Governor can't find out.

45
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,839
I don't know

46
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,079
what happened to your mother,

47
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,160
but you have
to pretend everything's normal

48
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,720
if you want to stay safe.

49
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,079
Don't push me away.

50
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,150
You're the only one I have left.

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,360
Huang Li is dead.

00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:46,839
Weilian!

55
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,560
Weilian, I was wrong.

56
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,879
Please forgive me.

57
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,160
Is this all because of Huo Qingwan?

58
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,639
Sheng Weilian!

59
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,519
You ruined me!

60
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,240
You can't abandon me!

61
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,680
Leave me alone!

62
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,660
You'll actually do whatever it takes

63
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,120
to get into the Sheng family, huh?

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,279
I'll prove to you

65
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm better for you

66
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,639
than Huo Qingwan ever was.

67
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,800
Then, I'll be waiting to see

68
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:26,120
just how worthy you are of my love.

69
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,580
(Huo Residence)

70
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,360
Can't you tell me

71
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,319
who you really are?

72
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,759
Didn't you say

73
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,000
it didn't matter who I was?

74
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,480
I hate the Huo family.

75
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,360
But I think

76
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,519
you're different from the rest of them.

77
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,839
Maybe you and I

78
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,839
are alike in some ways.

79
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,279
I used to want

80
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,480
to do one thing above all else.

81
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,319
But now I realize

82
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,199
that thing

83
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,399
could cost me what matters most.

84
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,759
Do you think
I should go through with it?

85
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,519
If it's something

86
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,480
that has to be done, then you must accept
losing what matters to you.

87
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,240
Hurry up!

88
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,520

Cui.

90
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,970
Why are you moving all these things?

91
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,650
Governor wants
the warehouse demolished.

92
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,360
Miss, don't go over there.

93
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,600
Someone died here.

94
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,360
It's haunted.

95
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,759
