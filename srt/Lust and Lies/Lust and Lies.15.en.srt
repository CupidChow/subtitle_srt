Get rid of that warehouse at once.

3
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,840
I don't want

4
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,240
to get threatened again.

5
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,200
Yes, sir.

00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,679
However,

7
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,600
this storeroom matters a lot
to Young Marshal Huo.

8
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:54,719
I'm afraid

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,920
it's not easy to deal with it.

10
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:58,399
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,040
I dare you to move them!

12
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,159
No one

13
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,000
gets to mess with this storeroom,

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,159
including Governor!

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,359

Mother!

Ever since my mother went mad,

37
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,360
she'd been locked up in here.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,199
She was locked up here for five years.

39
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,919
So Mother was paying respect
to your mother

40
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,599
in the mountain.

41
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,280
But I only dared pay respect
to her in secret.

42
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,439
Sometimes I'd stay her for some time

43
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
until the incense went off.

44

I don't want to lose you.

From now on,

46
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,079
you're all I have.

47
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,480
Don't you ever leave me.

48
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,439
And don't betray me.

00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,040

Governor.

61

Tell them to forget about it.

62
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,439
I was going to get rid of it

63
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
after all.

64
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,959
Miss Qingwan did it.

65
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,600
How reckless of you!

66
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,079
I acted rather recklessly

67
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,990
to make the Governor believe
that I don't harbor any ill thoughts.

68
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
I'm just trying to ease his burden.

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,240
Moreover, that storeroom

70
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,120
always bothered him.

71
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,959
It was his weakness too.

72
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
Someone had to get rid of it for him.

73
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,839
Mother.

74
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,519
You fought with Governor
for times because of me.

75
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,800
Only when I gain a foothold

76
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,600
can I protect you.

77
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,839
In this family,

78
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,199
you need to learn

79
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,199
how to protect yourself first.

80
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,319
Got it, Mother.

81
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:38,759
Miss.

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,959
Governor asked for your presence
in the army headquarters.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,600
Please.

84
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,360
Careful, Miss.

85
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,240
Governor,

86
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,240
Miss Qingwan is here.

87
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,079
Aren't you scared?

88
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,199
I believe

89
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,519
you won't kill me.

90
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:15,879
Why?

91
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,399
It's because all fathers love their children.

92
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Don't kill me!

93
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,000
Governor.

94
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,560
Miss Qingwan is nowhere to be seen.

95
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Do we keep setting fire on it?

96
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,519
(Qingwan.)

97
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,240
(Don't blame me.)

98
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,279
(Find yourself a good family
in the next lifetime.)

99
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,199
After everything I've done
in the past few days,

100
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,000
don't you resent me?

101
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,199
It's all thanks to you

102
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,480
that I'm now free
of the Huofeng Gang's control.

103
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,319
Father, I just want you...

104
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,959
Governor, I just want you to be safe and sound.

105
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,240
If you want to call me Father,

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,959
just do it.

107
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,400
You've been wandering around
since you were young.

108
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,120
I haven't taught you anything.

109
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,639
Today,

110
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,360
I shall teach you how to use a gun.

111
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,440
Father...

112
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,159
Bear this in mind.

113
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,240
Don't ever let someone
point a gun to you.

114
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,159
Unless you're good enough to put up a fight.

115
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,440
Here.

116
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,440
Afraid not.

00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:14,919

119
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,120
Three.

120
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,120
Shoot.

121
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,679
Father!

122
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840

125
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,799
Head back and get some rest.

126
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,879
Thank you, Governor.

127
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,960
Today's the happiest day in my life.

128
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,000
Call me Father.

129
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,279
Thank you, Father.

130
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:01,759
She knows how to shoot a gun.

131
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,519
She'd have hid the fact
that she knows how to use a gun

132
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,240
or pretended she can't hold one steady

133
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,159
or even fired a near miss.

134
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,480
She would never hit the bullseye.

135
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,360
She's my daughter.
