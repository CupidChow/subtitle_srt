00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,780
=Lust and Lies=

2
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,159
(Young Marshal, that wound of yours.)

3
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,399
(Looks like the God of Love
pulled the wrong string.)

4
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,920
(I did a divination.)

5
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,359
(Our fate isn't settled yet.)

6
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,560
(I will be)

7
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,680
(looking forward to it.)

8
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,840
(We)

9
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,280
(won't be finished)

10
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,319
(until one of us is dead.)

11
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,860
=Episode 1=

12
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,000
With this makeover,

13
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,439
no one will recognize you.

14
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,879
It'll make your move easier.

15
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,560
Those who covet the Lion Seal

16
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,680
should be here by now.

17
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,120
Time to wrap up

18
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,159
the scheme you set.

19
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,380
(Huo Xiu, Young Marshal
of the Military Governor Residence)

20
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,199
I never expected the leader
of Qingfang Troupe

21
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,360
to be a woman.

22
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,639
Surrender the Lion Seal

23
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,199
you're about to trade tonight.

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,280
I don't want to be harsh on women.

25
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,439
Find the man with a hat.

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,960
Don't let them get the thing.

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,360
My apologies.

28
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,980
(Ruan Feifei,
Young Mistress of Huofeng Gang)

29
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,840
Boss,

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,639
there they are.

31
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,639
We were looking everywhere for you.

32
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,400
Hand over the Lion Seal.

33
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,060
(Huo)

34
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,520
You're from the Huo family.

35
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,680
Is this how you treat your life savior?

36
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,660
(Mr. Gu, the liaison)

37
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,680
I brought it here.

38
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,599
Where's the money?

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,879
Repeat after me.

40
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,439
Push the case over.

41
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,759
Push the case over.

42
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,240
No money,

43
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,439
no seal.

44
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,319
We don't need another corpse here.

45
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,399
It's inside the case.

46
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,399
The money's inside the vase
beside the door.

47
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,040
Thanks.

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,160
It was

49
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:58,959
a good collaboration.

50
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,240
Throw the gun out.

51
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,560
Do what I say,

52
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:12,360
and I might consider
stabbing you somewhere else.

53
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,240
Guess

54
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,600
if you'll walk out of here alive.

55
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,800
Sorry.

56
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,839
I don't like to make guesses.

57
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,120
Thanks.

58
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,759
I'll take the Lion Seal.

59
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,279
Father,

60
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,279
I'm back.

61
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,700
(Boss Ruan, leader of Huofeng Gang)

62
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,600
Darn the Huo family.

63
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,160
Huo Beishan again!

64
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,240
Back then,

65
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,600
the Huos wiped out our whole clan,

66
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,439
and now they meddle again.

67
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,000
Father,

68
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:35,759
rest assured.

69
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,560
I'll make the Huos

70
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,959
pay double for what they did.

71
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,439
You must find the Lion Seal.

72
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,519
Only then can we

73
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,040
bring the Huos down.

74
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,959
(In that case,)

75
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,959
(I must find a way to get into
the Huo Residence.)

76
00:06:57,318 --> 00:06:59,759
It's dangerous if you treat your wound yourself
every time.

77
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,560
All my life,

78
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,079
no one

79
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,480
has truly helped me.

80
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,000
Worthless trash!

81
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,720

Find this locksmith.

92
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:05,959
A Japanese?

93
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,959
Can he open Chinese locks?

94
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:08,879
Mind you.

95
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,160

is the star performer of Qingfang Troupe, Yan Qing.

101
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,590
Her pipa playing was peerless.

What a shame.

103
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,879
