Madam Huo

15
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,079
is dead.

16
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,400
I found Boss Ruan.

17
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,159
He's alive.

18
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm asking,

19
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,800
why did you make me stay here?

20
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,639
Huo Beishan is dead.

21
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,360
Who killed him?

22
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,400
Feifei did.

23
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,000
Good.

24
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,159
Huo Beishan was killed
by his own daughter.

25
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,919
All my years of careful planning

26
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,159
weren't in vain.

27
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,919
Father, what are you talking about?

28
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,120
What are you doing here?

29
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,080
It was you. Sheng Weilian,

30
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,199
you set me up!

31
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,919
What did you mean?

32
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,520
Now that it's come to this,

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,800
the Huo family is finished.

34
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,599
It's time I tell you the truth.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,039
The truth is…

36
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,520
You're the real Huo Qingwan,

37
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,199
Huo Beishan's biological daughter.

38
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
15 years ago,

39
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,759
your father, Huo Beishan,

40
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,759
framed the Gu family

41
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,680
and wiped them out.

42
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,840
I kidnapped you to use

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
as leverage against him.

44
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,400
But your father didn't care
about your life or death.

45
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,120
He burned the Ruan family to death.

46
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,000
Little girl,

47
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,920
as soon as your father
agrees to my terms,

48
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,240
I'll let you go.

49
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,600
Sir…

50
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,759
Who says the Governor's Residence
can't carry the Ruan name?

51
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,439
My daughter, Ruan Feifei,

52
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,720
was burned alive.

53
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,000
Then, I found you.

54
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,800
I wanted to turn you into Ruan Feifei

55
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,120
to avenge the Ruan family.

56
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,199
Huo Beishan's real daughter

57
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,920
wiped out the entire Huo family.

58
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
That's true revenge!

59
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,000
This is revenge at its finest!

60
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,319
Now,

61
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,879
you're the only one left

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,600
on the path to the afterlife.

63
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,360
The Huo family
may have lost their power,

64
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,959
but we did hold

65
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,959
an engagement banquet.

66
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,079
Qingwan belongs to the Sheng family.

67
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,639
You can't touch her.

68
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,600
I told you,

69
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,879
I'll be your weapon no matter

70
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,720
who your enemies are.

71
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,199
What's this?

72
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,879
You want to kill me?

73
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,439
Don't forget.

74
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,959
It was the Huo family

75
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,519
who destroyed the Ruan family first!

76
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,600
Besides,

77
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,079
I raised you for 15 years.

78
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,720
Leave.

79
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,000
Consider those 15 years

80
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,800
as fate run its course.

81
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,800
From now on,

82
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,759
we have nothing to do with each other.

83
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,160
I'm going to find Huo Xiu.

84
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,439
Why do you still want to go after him?

85
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,879
He killed your real parents.

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,200
He destroyed the entire Huo family!

87
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,319
I'm not Huo Qingwan.

88
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,319
I'm not Huo Qingwan!

89
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,920
I'm not!

90
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,439
Even if you don't believe it,

91
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
it's the truth.

92
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:29,800
I'm not her…

93
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,720
It's all right.

94
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,160
I'm here.

95
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:33,920
I'm here.

96
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:34,800
You have me.

97
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,240
Everything's all right.

98
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,279
It's all right.

99
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,800
I'm not her…

100
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,040
It's okay.

101
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,680
It's all right.

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,790
Everything's all right.

103
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,800
Have you found her yet?

104
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,040
Miss Ruan is still missing.

105
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,480
Young Marshal Huo, Adjutant Cheng has returned.

106
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,720
Cheng.

107
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,720
I barely escaped death,

108
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,720
and you've shaken up all of Sucheng.

109
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,350
Rumors are swirling that you fabricated
the truth about the Gu family

110
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,360
to cover up
your patricide and power grab.

111
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,919
If this keeps up,

112
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,399
you'll lose both the army's loyalty
and the people's support.

113
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,559
That won't end well for you.

114
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,120
The shareholders behind this newspaper

115
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,200
are the Sheng family.

116
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,440
No doubt the Sheng family
is controlling public opinion.

117
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,559
I have to let you know this.

118
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,679
The one who wants me dead
isn't Huo Beishan.

119
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
It's Sheng Weilian.

120
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,720
Your favorite biscuits.

121
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,440
Remember?

122
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,759
When we were on that boat,

123
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,159
you couldn't go anywhere.

124
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,200
You kept pestering me

125
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,440
to play cat's cradle with you.

126
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,600
We spent
the entire afternoon playing it.

127
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,960
You never got tired.

128
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,480
We missed out

129
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,759
on so much.

130
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,240
Let's start over,

131
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,919
shall we?

132
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,279
Are you still hung up on Huo Xiu?

133
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,159
He's now a Gu.

134
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,279
He killed your biological parents

135
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,360
and wiped out the Huo family.

136
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,799
There's no future for you two.

137
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,080
We share the blame for what happened

138
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,919
to the Huo family.

139
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,919
We should

140
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,759
atone for what we've done.

141
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,840
I can help you.

142
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,360
Qingwan.

143
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:35,879
Marry me.

144
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,080
I'll pour all
the Sheng family's resources

145
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,320
into helping you restore the Huo family

146
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,799
