00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,780
=Lust and Lies=

2
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:07,640
Step aside.

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,040
I can let you take her,

4
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,239
but you have

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,959
to cooperate with me.

6
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,100
=Episode 21=

7
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,190
This is a surprising turn of events.

8
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,400
It used to be

9
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,359
just Feifei and me meeting here.

10
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,480
But today,

11
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,840
it's the two of us.

12
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,439
She doesn't need to come to you anymore.

13
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,640
She's already told me everything between you two.

14
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,079
You're old news.

15
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,159
So, tell me.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How do you want to cooperate?

17
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,199
Even though
you exposed Huo Beishan's crimes,

18
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,240
he still commands
100,000 Huo Army soldiers.

19
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,080
Your chances of winning

20
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:36,960
aren't great.

21
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,919
I know.

22
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,780
You've already bribed
a good portion of the Huo Army.

23
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,280
I can send my troops to back you up.

24
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,680
What do you want in return?

25
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
I want

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,520
the Huo family to fall.

27
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,240
I want the Sheng family to gain

28
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,800
military power too.

29
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,919
With me on your side,

30
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,680
your odds will improve a lot.

31
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,240
This benefits both

32
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,479
you and me.

33
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,000
Deal.

34
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,159
Well then, here's to a successful partnership.

35
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,520
These belong to Feifei, right?

36
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,400
I'll take care of them for her.

37
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,120
Young Marshal Huo,

38
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,199
you shouldn't help yourself
to things that aren't yours.

39
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,879
Who are you to keep her things?

40
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,639
Where did all this come from?

41
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,439
These belong to you, right?

42
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,439
They were at Sheng Weilian's place.

43
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,639
These should be Liu Yiyi's.

44
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,080
They often met there in secret.

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
When I was a child,

46
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,800
I played with knives.

47
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,879
I never played with dolls.

48
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,839
We've grown up surrounded by hatred.

49
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,680
Marry me once all of this

50
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,879
is over.

51
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,680
We'll leave Sucheng to start a new life.

52
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,560
We'll buy a small house together.

53
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,319
Work at sunrise, rest at sunset.

54
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,680
Three simple meals a day,

55
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,759
plain and humble.

56
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,800
Living the simplest life.

57
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,399
Then, we'll have children

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,319
and grow old together.

Amitabha…

Amitabha…

85
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,120
Madam,

86
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,480
Miss Qingwan sent me.

87
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
Tell her

88
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,199
not to worry about me

89
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,959
and to take care of herself.

90
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,120
Madam, the Huo family is beyond saving.

91
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,000
I know.

92
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,600
I'm the lady of the Huo family.

93
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,120
I will never

94
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,559
leave the Huo family.

95
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,639
Since you've made up your mind,

96
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,799
once you step out that door,

97
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,000
there's no turning back.

98
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,120
May this help ease your suffering.

99
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,000
You're the only bloodline
your mother left behind.

100
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,559
Having you around

101
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,399
feels like she's still here.

102
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,799
But I still lost the gamble.

103
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,799
In the end,

104
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,879
I brought trouble upon myself.

105
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,039
You kept me close,

106
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,639
so you should've known
this day would come.

107
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,039
Huo Xiu,

108
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,120
I once considered

109
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,799
letting you take control
of the Huo Army.

110
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,720
The Huo Army?

111
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,279
This was once the Gu family.

112
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,039
Your Huo Army used to be the Gu Army!

113
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,799
And one more thing.

114
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,279
My family name is Gu,

115
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,279
not Huo.

116
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,080
If I'd known this,

117
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,360
I should have killed
all of you back then.

118
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,960
That Ruan Feifei,

119
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,600
is she already dead?

120
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,120
I won't give you
another chance to hurt her.

121
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,240
Why didn't you leave?

122
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,879
Get out of here!

123
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,639
Beishan…

124
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,399
Why didn't you leave?

125
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,679
We're husband and wife.

126
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,960
We share life and death.

127
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,360
And to think, my whole life

128
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,879
I never once looked you in the eye…

129
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:08,480
Madam.

130
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,159
Stay away.

131
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,600
Can you promise me one thing?

132
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,879
Name it.

133
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,840
Take care of Qingwan.

134
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,879
Protect her

135
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,279
for the rest of your life.

136
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,480
I will.
