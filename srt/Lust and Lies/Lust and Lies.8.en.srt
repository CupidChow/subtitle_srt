Rings puzzle for sale!

3
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,439
I want one.

4
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,200
If you solve it
before the temple fair ends,

5
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,240
there's a prize.

6
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,399
Here's the money.

7
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:45,560
Sure.

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,240
Here you go.

9
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,119
If you can open it,

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,840
you'll get a cute kitten.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,759
Come back to me when you've solved it.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,280
Here.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,759
Come take a look.

14
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,600
This is so difficult.

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
I guess I won't win the prize.

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,480
Mister, buy some fresh flowers.

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,920
Miss is so pretty.

18
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:07,920
Put me down.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,120
All right.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,079
Thank you, miss.

21
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:21,680
Lianhua

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,640
grows in the harshest places,

23
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,640
yet blooms the most beautifully.

24
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,319
I don't like Lianhua.

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,400
Why not?

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,760
Because

27
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,000
my mother died in Lianhua.

Let's go take a look.

The silver-throwing ceremony
is starting.

47
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,400
Miss Ruan sends out an order.

48
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,199
If the Huo Army intervenes,

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,560
kill Huo Xiu

50
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,479
and fall back.

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,080
Yes.

52
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,180
Let's wait a little longer.

53
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,400
Move out now.

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,919
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

55
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,680
Let's make a fortune.

Come on.

58
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,479
Spread the ingots.

59
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,039
May riches pour in!

60
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,240

63
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,360
Listen up.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,199
There must be no mistakes tonight.

65
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,759
Hold there.

66
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,279
Stay close to me.

67
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:37,800
Turn around.

68
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,480
Come.

69
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,000
Stand still.

70
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:39,879
Don't move.

71
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,680
Stand here.

72
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,319
Fire!

73
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:54,959
Fire!

74
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,800
Fire!

75
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,920
Fire!

76
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,040
Run!

77
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,439
Don't shoot!

78
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Don't hurt the people.

79
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,000
Huo Xiu,

80
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,680
my leg hurts.

81
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,399
Huo Xiu.

82
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,120
Retreat.

83
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:23,720
Go.

84
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,480
Young Marshal!

85
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:51,879
Young Marshal.

86
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,639
Young Marshal.

87
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,320
Find out

88
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,440
who sent

89
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,440
those assassins.

90
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,120
You were amazing, Miss Ruan.

91
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,039
Not only did we move the goods out,

92
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,039
but we also gave
the Huo Army a hard time.

93
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,720
Yeah.

94
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,399
Rework the gunpowder and weapons

95
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,600
as fast as possible.

96
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,960
Huo Beishan

97
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,320
will definitely track down
the smuggled goods.

98
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,799
Don't leave any traces.

99
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,360
Understood.

100
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,840
The Huo Army arrived too fast,

101
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,960
and Huo Xiu got away.

102
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,200
But

103
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,039
he's wounded.

104
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,399
Ever since you met her,

105
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,240
you've been getting hurt

106
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,200
nonstop.

107
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,279
The temple fair was ruined,

108
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,399
and the Huo Army took heavy losses.

109
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,679
You know

110
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:06,519
Governor

111
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,360
will come after you soon.

112
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,039
Drink it.

113
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,440
Where is she?

114
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,759
She disappeared after you got hurt.

115
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,200
You took the stab

116
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,039
for nothing.

117
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,639
She doesn't care about you at all.

118
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,320
