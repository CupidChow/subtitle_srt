00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:42,719
Qingwan.

3
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,799
Have a safe journey home.

4
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,439
What a shame.

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,679
Since your return,

6
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,479
I haven't managed to treat you well.

7
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,799
Do you still remember it?

8
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,439
When we were small,

9
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,120
we made a pledge

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,680
to visit so many places.

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,840
And I haven't taken you to any of them.

12
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,319
Don't cry.

13
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,840
Tears

14
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,840
will make you look bad.

15
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,640
Huo Jin?

16
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,239
Huo Jin?

17
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,840
Huo Jin...

18
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,920
Huo Jin!

19
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,920
Huo Jin!

20
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,959
Is this the ending that you want?

21
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,680
You kidnapped me here

22
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,319
to give yourself a way out, right?

23
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,919
Because you knew

24
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,199
I'd protect you.

25
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,919
And you knew I'd let the Huofeng Gang go

26
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,680
because of you.

27
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,520
You've manipulated me

28
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,120
using my love towards you.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,439
You're free to use me too.

30
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,800

We're one step closer to our vengeance.

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,079
Aren't you glad?

68
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,810
But I've caused
those innocent people's deaths.

Zhao Xun

70
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,959
and the Ruan family.

71
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
All of them were innocent too.

72
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,399
Living in this world,

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,500
we can't judge what is right
and what is wrong.

74
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,959
The only way

75
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,600
is an eye for an eye

76
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,720
and a tooth

77
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,720
for a tooth.

78
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,399
We shouldn't
have treated Liu Yiyi this way.

79
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,720
At least she's sincere with you.

80
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,120
Well,

81
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,759
all she cares about

82
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,240
is my family property, no?

83
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,879
There's nothing sincere about her.

84
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,079
Could it be

85
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,680
that you and Huo Xiu
are sincere with one another?

86
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,600
Huo Jin is dead.

87
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,519
Huo Beishan
has been postponing his burial

88
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,680
and insisted on having the banquet.

89
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,439
I can't help but find that fishy.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,900
What's there to be afraid of?

91
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,319
That's our engagement party.

92
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,120
We're the stars of the day.

93
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,439
Have you been waiting here for long?

94
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,879
You and Sheng Weilian

95
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,920
met there?

96
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,399
You seem to be all-knowing.

97
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,600
I know

98
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,000
more than you thought.

99
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,839
But I've chosen to be ignorant because of you.

100
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,120
But you've never believed me.

101
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,040
That's because you're full of secrets,

102
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,360
and I can't figure you out.

103
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,600
Don't stop me

104
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,920
from doing what I want.

105
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,439
Are you sure

106
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,519
Qingwan held the gun?

107
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,079
Uncle.

108
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,600
I swear.

109
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,399
She's had it all planned out.

110
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,000
I will kill you!

111
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,480
All the guests are almost here.

112
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,000
Hang in there.

113
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:08,480

114
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,879

Congratulations!

116
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,360
I have an announcement to make.

117
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,919
My daughter, Huo Qingwan,

118
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,590
and the Sheng family
will have a marriage alliance.

119
