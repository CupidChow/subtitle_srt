=Lust and Lies=

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:40,840
Qingwan.

3
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,190
I bought these

4
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,679
because I thought you'd like them.

5
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:47,600
Take a look.

6
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll marry you.

7
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,200
Really?

8
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,200
Huo Xiu and I are over.

9
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,000
You finally agreed to marry me.

10
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,480
Let my aunt go!

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,599
What's she doing here?

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,120
When I saw her in that state,

13
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
I brought her back.

14
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,200
Pretending to be crazy, are you?

15
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,319
Let her stay.

16
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,640
She's the only family I have left.

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,760
All right.

18
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,239
Well, you should get some rest.

19
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,879
Aunt.

20
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,239
Yiyi, put this away for me.

21
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,599
Okay.

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,360
Huo Xiu.

23
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,600
You left something behind again.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,380
I came to return it
to its rightful owner.

25
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,900
=Episode 23=

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,439
Now, whoever marries Huo Qingwan

27
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,680
will control the Huo Army

28
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,120
and become the Governor of Sucheng.

29
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,800
Do you think that if she found out
everything you've done,

30
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,439
she'd still marry you?

31
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,199
I want

32
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,680
half of Sucheng.

33
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,719
You've lost all your worth.

34
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,960
What do you even have
to bargain with me?

35
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,360
What if it's your life at stake?

36
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,500
All right.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,759
I'll agree to your terms.

38
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,159
Don't kill me.

39
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,400
You're just like your father.

40
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,879
An absolute coward.

41
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,199
Has anyone ever told you

42
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,639
that you talk too much?

43
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,120
Qingwan wanted to spare you,

44
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,199
but I think

45
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,199
you're better off dead.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,199
Didn't we agree that after we succeeded
in taking revenge,

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,759
you'd marry me

48
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,160
and we'd leave Sucheng together?

49
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,800
I joined the Huo family for revenge.

50
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,079
You don't actually think

51
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,959
I've fallen for you, do you?

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's best for us

53
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,480
to part on good terms.

54
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,360
Part on good terms?

55
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,480
I refuse.

56
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,199
Have you lost your mind?

57
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,399
This is the Sheng Residence.

58
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
I'm the Sheng family's bride.

59
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,839
Then, let him see us like this.

60
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,199
You're going to marry him?

61
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,959
Well, who is his future bride

62
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,720

claim a woman?

141
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:34,840
