=Lust and Lies=

2
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:49,840
Tell them to leave.

3
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,640
We'll carry on.

4
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,519
Qingwan.

5
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,920
From this day on,

6
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,359
Sucheng

7
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,159
belongs to just the two of us.

8
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,200
Qingwan?

9
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,560
To smoke out the spies
you planted around me,

10
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,560
I played along with this charade.

11
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,359
Did you enjoy it?

12
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,100
=Episode 24=

13
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,199
Cheng is back.

14
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,000
He told me

15
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,520
Sheng Weilian tried to kill him.

16
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,159
He caught Sheng Weilian

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,080
betraying the Huofeng Gang.

18
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,560
That means he planted men
in the ranks back then

19
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,759
to murder Huo Jin.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,039
He used Huo Beishan to wipe out

21
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,599
the Huofeng Gang,

22
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,360
then lent me soldiers so I could take revenge

23
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:38,840
and kill...

24
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,400
He must've known you were Huo Qingwan,

25
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,719
so he set it all up

26
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,199
to turn us into enemies.

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,159
He planned to use you to finish me off

28
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,759
and the Gu family.

29
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,400
One scheme after another.

30
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:00,790
Sucheng would have

31
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,000
nothing but the Sheng family.

32
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,560
He has people planted deep within

33
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,319
the Huo Army.

34
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,919
I can't act with that in mind.

35
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,560
Then, I need to stay close.

36
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,520
I'll marry him.

37
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,080
After all your scheming,

38
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,280
I was just another piece
on your board, wasn't I?

39
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,199
You know,

40
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,879
on the chessboard,

41
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,120
there are the king

42
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,479
and the queen.

43
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,360
The place I've always left for you

44
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,199
is the queen's seat.

45
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,080
I just want us
to win this game together.

46
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,800
Why won't you choose me?

47
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,360
The queen?

48
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,840
Isn't she the piece

49
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,439
that can be sacrificed
for the king at any moment?

50
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,879
But Huo Xiu is not like you.

51
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,360
That's exactly why I chose him.

52
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,399
All right.

53
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,600
Fine.

54
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,800
You know,

55
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,079
for the sake of this game...

56
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,040
I had to sacrifice so many people.

57
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,160
Huo Jin.

58
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,959
Mr. Ruan.

59
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,639
Zhao Xun.

60
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,920
Madam Huo.

61
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,959
The Huofeng Gang.

62
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,360
The Huo Army.

63
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,800
I've lost count at this point!

64
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,959
Zhao Xun and my mother...

65
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,279
Remember the earrings?

66
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,240
That was my idea.

67
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,800
That fool Zhao Xun.

68
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,079
I only said a few words
to instigate him,

69
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,240
and he actually went to Huo Xiu

70
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,399
and died for you.

71
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,839
And don't forget your useless mother.

72
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,000
I had someone slip her poison.

73
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,000
And she actually drank it.

74
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:24,800
Hate me.

75
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,040
Hate me all you want.

76
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,519
Then, you'll never forget me.

77
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,759
Want to kill me?

78
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,120
The Shengs won't let it slide.

79
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,519
Then, I'll wipe out the Sheng family.

80
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,680
Kill him.

81
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,120
I am the only one

82
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,079
who will ever love you.

83
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,759
Weilian.

84
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,920
If we can't be husband and wife in life,

85
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,639
then let's be lovers in death.

104
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,199
I've been living down in the cabin,

105
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,399

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,120
We'll leave Sucheng together.

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,960
You still have those men who follow you.

111
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,240
They stayed with you
in Sucheng for 15 years

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,320
for the Gu family's revenge.

113
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,080
You can't abandon them.

114
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,360
And the people of Sucheng

115
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,039
still need you to protect them.

116
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:14,000
I carry too much blood and too many lost souls.

117
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:19,279
I want to go where I'm needed and atone.

118
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,639
I wish you

119
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,519

130

131
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,320
Got it.

132
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,080
Here you go.

133
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,039
Mr. Gu.

134
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,200
With your donation,

135
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,720
the people in the disaster area
will get through this.

136

If you need anything,

137
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,000
just let me know.

138
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,200
You've always been so charitable.

139
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,960
You must have helped a lot of people.

140
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,480
All for good karma, right?

141
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,879
When you give to charity,

142
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,279
what do you pray for?

143
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,000
My wife?

144
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,559
All she does is pray
and light incense every day.

145
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,759
She always says

146
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,519
that if you want something,

147
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,279
you have to do more good deeds
and build up good karma.

148
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,519
But Mr. Gu,

149
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,799
you have everything.

150
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,039
If there's something you want,

151
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,559
you can get it in a heartbeat.

152
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,919
Yet, there are things beyond my reach.

153
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,919
Dr. Huo,

154
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,480
are you really going to the front?

155
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,639
They need me there.

156
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,519
I have to go.

157
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,320
But it's dangerous out there.

158
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,480
Even if it costs me my life,

159
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,759
I'll must save the people.

160
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:27,559
No.

161
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,519
You have to stay alive.

162
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,600
There is someone
you still want to see, right?

163
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,399
Maybe

164
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,039
