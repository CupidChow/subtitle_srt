00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,780
=Lust and Lies=

2
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,799
Uncle,

3
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,880
the person I have feelings for…

4
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:40,960
Come in.

5
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,000
Mr. Huo,

6
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,399
I never expected

7
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,479
our family driver to…

8
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,799
to actually be involved with Miss Yiyi.

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,399
What did you say?

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,240
Isn't he the one you have feelings for,

11
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,320
Miss Yiyi?

12
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,000
Yiyi,

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,200
Mr. Sheng caught me last night,

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,439
so I couldn't make it.

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,760
Yiyi,

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,879
is this true?

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,840
Mr. Huo,

18
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:14,799
this is

19
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,799
the Sheng family's fault.

20
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,359
The Sheng family will keep this quiet.

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,390
We won't let this
affect the Huo family's reputation.

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,200
You've disgraced

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,640
the Huo family,

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,719
you wench!

25
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,560
Qingwan,

26
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,040
are you all right?

27
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm fine.

28
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,439
Thank you for your concern.

29
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:47,840
I…

30
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,280
Sheng Weilian.

31
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,799
Why did you do this to me?

32
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,439
You think

33
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,359
hurting them and threatening me

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,799
into marrying you will work, don't you?

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,759
You won't fool anyone
with these petty tricks.

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,990
You'll only make a fool of yourself.

37
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,840
You really think my uncle

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,560
would believe you so easily?

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,199
Oh, I know he will.

40
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,199
Because you're the most worthless piece to him.

41
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,120
You're disposable.

42
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,940
=Episode 11=

43
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,560
She's usually acting
all high and mighty.

44
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,550
To think she was involved with
the Sheng family's driver all along.

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,439
I'm not surprised.

46
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,400
She has a lady's body,

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,120
but a servant's fate.

48
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,240
If Miss Qingwan
hadn't gone missing years ago,

49
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,879
she wouldn't be enjoying life
in the Huo family now.

50
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,639
We're no different.

51
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,439
Why is it that you get to be
the daughter of a rich family,

52
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,039
and I only get to be your stand-in?

53
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,400
We're no different,

54
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,840
but at least I don't stoop
to using underhanded tactics.

55
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,560
No matter what it takes
to win against you,

56
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,879
I'll do it.

57
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,000
We'll see

58
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,240
who gets the last laugh.

59
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,839
What are you playing at, Feifei?

60
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,240
Feifei.

61
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,279
It's so nice!

62
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,120
Thank you, Father.

63
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,000
Like it?

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,199
From now on,

65
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,399
you can be
the daughter of a rich family too.

66
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:38,759
But you have

67
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,160
to become Huo Qingwan.

68
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,750
Hold out your hand.

69
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,519
Hold it out!

70
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,839
I don't want to be anyone's substitute.

71
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,639
Only by becoming Huo Qingwan

72
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,519
can you get into the Huo family

73
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,680
and avenge the Ruan family's blood feud!

74
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,000
Have you forgotten about the fire?

75
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,079
Dozens of the Ruan family died

76
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,279
because of Huo Beishan!

77
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,000
Father, save me!

78
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,300
(Huo Residence)

79
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,160
Go.

80
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,839
Those appear to be items

81
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,120
meant for a woman's use.

82
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,120
Mind your own business.

83
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,839
If you're secretly seeing another woman,

84
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,240
I'm jealous.

85
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,959
It's not what you think.

86
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,920
I'm just saying.

87
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,160
There's no need
to explain yourself to me.

88
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,170
But I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

89
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:40,759
I didn't.

90
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,000
The Huo family is like
a stagnant pool of water.

91
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,120
In such water,

92
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,120
all the fish eventually drown.

93
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,720
You're the only fresh water flowing in,

94
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,040
the one that can save them all.

95
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,600
That's why

96
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,759
everyone wants to be around you.

97
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,600
By "everyone," you mean…

98
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,480
just you.

99
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,759
Leave the Huo family.

100
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,160
Weren't you begging me not to leave?

101
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
I know you're smart.

102
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,439
But this is the Huo family.

103
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,639
You're just not ruthless enough.

104
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,439
What you should do is

105
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,839
make sure I don't leave,

106
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,160
figure out my true intentions,

107
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,439
so you can report back to Governor.

108
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,639
What are you doing now?

109
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,519
You haven't actually
fallen for me, have you?

110
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,080
You're right on time.

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,360
When you gave me this watch,

112
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,919
I told you

113
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:45,960
I'd never be late.

114
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,080
You've been late plenty of times.

115
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,080
It seems another woman

116
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,840
lives in this residence.

117
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,080
What's this?

118
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,360
Are you jealous?

119
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,840
I remember us being happy before.

120
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
I must have been blind.

121
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,480
If you're this quick to show up now,

122
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,080
that means you've planted
quite a few spies in the Huo family.

123
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,320
I told you,

124
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,759
whenever you need me,

125
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
I'm here.

126
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,720
Then, where were you

127
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,279
when I needed you to help me leave three years ago?

128
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,600
Feifei,

129
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:26,279
I…

130
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,600
Don't tell me you've fallen for Huo Xiu?

131
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,039
He's your enemy.

132
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,720
It's none of your business.

133
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,279
We're just partners.

134
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,320
Focus on what you need to do.

135
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,919
Don't tell me you've fallen for Huo Xiu?

136
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,240
He's your enemy.

137
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,600
Huo Xiu…

138
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,639
Those clothes

139
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,759
were for her.

140
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,039
I'll kill him!

141
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,960
Huo Xiu!

142
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,240
Calm down.

143
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,320
How do you expect me to stay calm?

144
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,759
Revenge takes planning.

145
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,080
If you act recklessly,

146
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,480
her death would have been for nothing.
