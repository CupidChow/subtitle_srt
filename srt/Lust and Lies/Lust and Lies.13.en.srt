1
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,780
=Lust and Lies=

2
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,520
Miss.

3
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,399
First Madam told me to pass this to you.

4
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,880
What is this?

5
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,679
First Madam said
you lost a pair of earrings.

6
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:52,679
To cheer you up,

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,320
she got this especially for you.

8
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,100
=Episode 13=

9
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,359
She has the cheek to be staying here

10
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,319
after committing such a shameful act.

11
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,480
Did you stay out all night

12
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,879
to practice violin again?

13
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,040
We're having this again.

14
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,439
Instead of having your breakfast,

15
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,200
where are you going?

16
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,120
You're such a busybody.

17
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,159
You look all unkempt.

18
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,159
If Governor came home
and saw you in this state,

19
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,680
he'd scold you again.

20
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,280
Alright.

21
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,980
Go on and keep your violin away.

22
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,240
Pardon me, Governor!

23
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,360
The merchant ship was robbed

24
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,580
and the Sheng family offered
to pay five times the compensation.

25
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:50,960
The credit is all yours.

26
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,960
Thank you, Governor.

27
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,080
Let's dig in.

28
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,120
What are you doing?

29
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,400
Did you tie that?

30
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:03,719
Yes.

31
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:06,286
Qingwan liked to dress you up this way

32
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,759
when you were young.

33
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,639
Governor.

34
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,360
What is it?

35
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,719
Father!

36
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,400
Father!

37
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:41,800
Scram!

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,719
Tell me.

39
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,759
Where did you get this?

40
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,319
Miss.

41
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,439
Today,

42
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,280
you've upset Governor.

43
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,479
Because of that pair of earrings?

44
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,560
Listen here.

45
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,800
This pair of earrings

46
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,959
actually belonged to another madam.

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,120
Back then,

48
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,560
Governor married her.

49
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,160
She went crazy

50
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,000
not long after that.

51
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,399
She always tried
to get rid of Governor.

52
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,480
To our surprise, she eventually took her own life.

53
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,560
She even cursed Governor

54
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,800
an ugly death.

55
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,839
Finally, she tore off

56
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,399
part of Governor's arm.

57
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,680
Miss.

58
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,959
You must be cautious after this.

59
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,360
I'm off.

60
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,920
Those earrings belonged to your mother?

61
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,560
Yes.

62
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,319
Someone has tried to frame you

63
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,120
with my mother's tragedy.

64
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,439
Don't worry.

65
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,360
I'll help you.

66
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,399
Governor.

67
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,800
I've passed your message
to Miss Qingwan.

68
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,920
It's time to create chaos
in this household.

69
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,439
Only then do I get to know

70
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,199
whose side they're on.

71
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,839
Now,

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,839
let's see how we can turn the tables
with this white piece.

73
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,519
Do we join hands

74
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,959
or hurt each other?

75
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,540
(Huo Residence)

76
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,439
Governor.

77
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,279
Are you here to plead on her behalf?

78
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:08,759
No.

79
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,330
I've found out
that she's part of the Huofeng Gang.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,800
Huofeng Gang

81
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,560
are refugees stationed at sea.

82
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,160
And they robbed

83
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,279
the merchant ship full of arms.

84
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,660
(Huofeng Gang)

85
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,959
Where are those arms now?

86
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,439
I've sent our men to look for them.

87
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,920
Then

88
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,759
I'll sneak those arms back here.

89
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,040
Not only will we lose nothing,

90
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,400
but we'll also receive the five-time
compensation from the Sheng family.

91
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,079
As expected of my good son.

92
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,879
However, explain yourself.

93
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,240
Why are you doing this?

94
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,920
I know you've always
found her suspicious.

95
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,920
Thus, to figure out her identity,

96
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,720
I approached her on purpose.

97
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,079
You've raised me up.

98
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,480
Of course I'm always on your side.

99
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,000
Fine.

100
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,920
Bring that Huofeng Gang woman here

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and prove

102
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,600
whose side you're actually on.

103
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,160
Why?

104
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,560
You can't bring yourself to do so?

105
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,199
I won't let you down.

106
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,120
Great.

107
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,040
Xiu told me

108
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,600
that you're from the Huofeng Gang.

109
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,120
I know nothing about that.

110
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,600
This is salt water.

111
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,639
Once the whip has tore your flesh apart,

112
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,600
the salt water will enter your wound.

113
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,240
Since you refuse to come clean,

114
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,439
don't blame for what I'm about to do.

115
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,759
Let's see how long you can stay stubborn.

116
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,919
This dagger.

117
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,799
Do you recognize it?

118
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,320
Well, take good care of her.

119
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,440
Take him away.

120
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,919
So?

121
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,759
Have you made up your mind?

122
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,720
This man said he knows you.

123
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,320
Yes.

124
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,879
I'm part of the Huofeng Gang.

125
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,360
They turned me into a showgirl

126
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,240
to get them money

127
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,080
and be their mole.

128
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,039
If I didn't do as they said,

129
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,120
they'd hit me.

130
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,399
During the birthday banquet,
I sneaked into the Huo Residence

131
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,879
to get them intel.

132
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,799
To my surprise,

133
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,519
I'm the daughter of the Huo family.

134
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,279
If so,

135
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,240
this man is the one
who barged in to the residence.

136
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,960
That's right.

137
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,759
I thought

138
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,200
no one could bully me

139
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,799
when I found my parents.

140
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,519
Unexpectedly,

141
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,399
they caught me

142
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,399
and told me to assassinate you.

143
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,919
But how could I do so?

144
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,279
You're my father after all!

145
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,360
Tell me.

146
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,840
Who's the leader of the Huofeng Gang?

147
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,039
Who's the leader

148
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,799
of the Huofeng Gang?

149
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,320
I don't know either.

150
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,559
Its leader rarely made an appearance.

151
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,639
She's nothing but an ungrateful orphan!

152
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,440
She didn't have the right
to meet the leader!
