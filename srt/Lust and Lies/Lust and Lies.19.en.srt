Here.

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,399
Here.

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,540
=Episode 19=

5
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,400
Put me down!

6
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,680
Let go of me!

7
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,040
Why?

8
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,480
Are you trying to hold me captive?

9
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,680
If you dare try anything funny again,

10
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,439
I don't mind holding you captive here.

11
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,080
It should be the other way around, no?

12
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:20,759
That way,

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,759
at least you won't betray me.

14
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,120
Is your engagement with Sheng Weilian

15
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,000
considered a betrayal?

16
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,199
The Lion Seal?

17
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,800
Didn't you warn me?

18
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
A true revenge

19
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,080
is not without a plan.

20
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,080
And we shouldn't act recklessly.

21
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,199
This shall be your bargaining chip.

22
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,159
And this is my reward for you.

He's not back yet.

32

If he doesn't return with her body,

you'll go

But

36
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,759
Governor,

37
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,919
the Huo family and the Sheng family

38
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,840
have had a marriage alliance, no?

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,879
Mr. Sheng.

40
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,120
You won't mind

41
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,680
having a dead bride, do you?

42
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:23,680
Not at all.

43
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,879
Everyone in Sucheng

44
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,399
is aware of our marriage alliance.

45
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,240
Our families

46
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,879
are

47
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,920
on the same boat.

48
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,279
It doesn't matter

49
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,360
if the bride is dead or alive.

50
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,360
You're right, Governor.

51
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,560
I'm feeling kind of unwell.

52
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,360
I need to head back now.

53
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,480
Hold on.

54
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,040
You should pay respect to my son first.

55
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,839
Do you still remember it?

56
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,959
Back then,

57
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,720
you blindfolded me and told me

58
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,240
it's just a killing act.

59
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,199
You're here to kill me, no?

60
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,040
I won't do that.

61
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,680
But if one of us

62
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,079
must die today,

63
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,279
you should do it.

64
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,399
You're not Huo Qingwan.

65
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,399
Am I right?

66
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,639
I'm the Huofeng Gang's mistress.

67
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,480
My surname is Ruan.

68
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,480
My name is Ruan Feifei.

69
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,759
I can now

70
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,279
tell you who I am.

71
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,800
This is the Lion Seal?

72
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,920
It's just an ordinary pebble.

73
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,959
And this is the Lion Seal.

74
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,240
The former governor of Sucheng

75
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,560
died fifteen years ago.

76
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,199
I've heard of him.

77
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,160
He collaborated with the Japanese

78
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,839
and sold our country out.

79
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,839
Here's the treaty signed
with the Japanese under the table.

80
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,440
It's all about interests

81
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,080
and treasonous terms.

82
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,000
Huo Beishan?

83
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,919
Huo Beishan

84
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,840
was a mere dock worker.

85
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:50,792
He gained Gu Changqing's favour

86
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,080
and joined the the Gu Army.

87
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,519
Who would've thought
he'd laid the entire Gu to family waste?

88
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,039
He even forcibly married Madam Gu.

89
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,120
Madam.

90
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,679
Don't be afraid.

91
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,679
I won't hurt you.

92
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,039
You animal!

93
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,320
You planted all those crimes
on the Gu family!

94
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,200
You even plotted to kill Changqing...

95
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,080
If I hadn't destroyed the Gu family,

96
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,320
how could I have
become Sucheng's governor?

97
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,200
Let me go!

98
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,080
Let go!

99
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,159
Can you bring yourself

100
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,559
to kill Gu Changqing's child?

101
00:09:45,813 --> 00:09:47,000
You should stay alive

102
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,720
and be my wife.

103
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,360
Then you can get back at me.

Madam Gu was your mother?

108
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,159
You were Gu Changqing's son?

109
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,639
Now you know why

110
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,799
Huo Beishan got upset

over your earrings.

112
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,120

Huo Beishan

114
