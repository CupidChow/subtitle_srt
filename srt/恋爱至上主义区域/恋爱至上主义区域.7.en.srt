00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,080

I have to pick apricots.

There's no picking
apricots, Grandma.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,600
They all fell because of the rain.

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,270
You went and checked?
How did you know?

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,060
Um, I went and checked.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,560
The place where I pick apricots?

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,043
I knew even if I hadn't checked.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,740
You have school. Go home already.

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,870
I'll stay until you're discharged.

17

You don't have to.

Myung-ha,

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,070
don't get too attached.

If you can't take care of yourself,
how can you take care of others?

Myung-ha,

89
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,820
hypothetically,

90
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:16,934
between breaking up right away
and delaying it,

91
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,700
what would you choose?

92
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,580
Like in movies?

93
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,580
Imagine you have limited time.

94
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,290
Like lives are at risk?

95
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,500
Isn't that too tragic?

96
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,500
Hear me out.

97
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,880
You can break up without pain,

98
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,340
which is considered
an amicable breakup.

99
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,600
But it can go another way.

100
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:42,060
Which is a painful way, leaving
each other scars and regrets.

101
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,350
But if you choose this way,

102
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,690
you get to be with the person
you like a bit longer.

103
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,780
But what's the point of staying
together if you're in pain?

104
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,160
To still be together.

105
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,370
I would break up

106
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,950
because it could be
an amicable breakup.

107
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,409
Although breaking up while
still liking each other isn't easy,

108
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,250
it's what's best, isn't it?

109
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,750
Is that so?

110
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,380
I think delaying it
would be painful.

111
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,220
I would let the other go.

112
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,060
People can't stay together
forever anyway.

113
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,140
It's better to break up
at the right time.

00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,550
I'm happy just thinking about it.

182
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,010
Bad things always happen
to people around me.

183
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,980
Don't say that.

184
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,230
Are you focusing on practicing?

185
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,070
So I'll do everything
to protect you, Senior.

186
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,990
Just protect yourself.

187
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,870
For me, I only have you, Senior.

188
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,380
Please stay by my side
for a long time.

189
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,230
Don't think you're alone.

190
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:00,753
There are things you are good at.

191
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,440
You have generous friends

192
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,860
and people who support you.

193
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,200
If I say I can manage without you,

194
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,780
does that mean we're broken up?

195
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,710
What?

196
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,290
You don't like me.

197
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,420
What do you mean?

198
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,800
Do you like me
the way I like you?

199
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,670
You don't.

200
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,140
Why do you think that?

201
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,560
It's fine even if
you don't like me.

202
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,150
But I want you
to rely on me sometimes.

203
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,790
I love you.

204
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,330
(A system error has occurred.)

205
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,600
I have a meeting
with Team Leader Jinjo today.

206
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,310
I'm gonna go.

207
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,560
(Reward: ability to change
what you want)

208
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,560
(Please check your pant pocket.)

209
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,000
Senior?

210
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,420
You startled me.

211
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,250
Why? You thought I was Yeo-woon?

212
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,670
What are you doing here?

213
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,670
School's out.

214
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,970
Is that so?

215
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,890
What's wrong?

216
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,060
Are you okay?

217
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,440
- I'm fine.
- No way you're fine.

218
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,860
You're burning up.

219
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,610
I'm fine.

220
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,910
This is bad.

221
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,340
Long time no see.

222
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,140
We caught your stalker.

223
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,140
How?

224
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,690
He wasn't as careful as he thought.

225
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,560
And there was an arrest warrant
out for him previously.

226
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,270
So it's been handled.

227
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,980
Why?

228
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,360
What do you mean?

229
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,610
Why did you go out
of your way to help me?

230
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,820
We didn't want you to be in danger

231
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,200
and bad things to damage
your image, Mr. Yeo-woon.

232
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,660
Then,

233
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,660
I'll be your model.

234
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,670
And I'll race in the meet
sponsored by Swoony.

235
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,170
Didn't you decide too quickly?

236
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,550
Because something
happened unexpectedly.

237
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,640
It's true we want you,
Mr. Yeo-woon,

238
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,600
but we don't want to force you.

239
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,770
And there's Mr. Myung-ha's request.

240
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,020
Senior?

241
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,980
Recently Mr. Myung-ha asked me

242
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,190
to make sure that you get
to do what you want to do

243
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,740
and keep an eye on you
until you grow up.

244
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,370
School, running and racing, they're
things I've forced myself to do.

245
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,250
But I don't feel forced
about this at all.

246
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,490
The number you dialed
cannot be reached...

247
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,570
Why aren't you picking up?

248
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,160
Is there something wrong, Senior?

249
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,710
I got a place in a race.

250
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,710
August 14.

251
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,710
I want you to come.

252
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,970
I miss you.

253
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,240
What are you doing here?

254
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,240
Go to class.

255
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,240
Get back to your classroom.

256
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,180
Hey, Cha Yeo-woon.

257
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,310
Why did Cheon Sang-won skip school?

258
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,270
- Why are you asking me?
- You two are always together.

259
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,785
- Probably in his classroom.
- If he was, I wouldn't have asked.

260
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,110
He missed practice today too.

261
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,030
Do you have his number?

262
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,030
Yeah. Why?

263
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,620
Send it to me.

264
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,410
Where are you going?

265
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,340
The number you dialed
cannot be reached...

266
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,370
Ma'am!

267
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,240
Are you home, ma'am?!

268
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,210
Where is he?

269
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,420
The number you dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.

270
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,950
Cha Yeo-woon.

271
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,160
Why are you so late?

272
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,990
What's going on?

273
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,250
What?

274
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,250
I couldn't reach you all day.

275
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,420
Here. Take it.

276
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,420
What's this?

277
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,380
Did I say I wanted this?

278
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,180
But it's a record
of all your efforts.

279
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,140
I didn't want it at all.

280
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,810
You were sick and with Cheon
Sang-won. You think I didn't know?

281
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,360
- About that...
- Senior,

282
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,320
why won't you rely on me?

283
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,723
You relied on Cheon Sang-won
but why couldn't you do that with me?

284
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,040
Why must you always
manage everything alone?

285
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,040
Why won't you tell me things?

286
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,040
Why am I the only one doing this?

287
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,140
Whenever I see you,
I both feel good and want to cry.

288
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,100
I feel so much
about every little thing.

289
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,900
But I'm not happy at all right now.

290
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,840
Where are you going?

291
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,840
Just go tomorrow.

292
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,260
- It's fine.
- Why are you in such a hurry?

293
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,760
You still feel hot.

294
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,430
You wanna faint or something?

295
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,390
- There's not much time left.
- What?

296
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,230
I have to find Yeo-woon.

297
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,640
(Mission: Make Cha Yeo-woon happy)

298
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,470

299
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,520
(Penalty: death)

300
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,330
Bad things always happen
to people around me.

301
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,500
So I'll do everything
to protect you, Senior.

302
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:11,630
I want to spend my remaining time
making Yeo-woon happy as best as I can.

303
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,220
But it seems the more I try,

304
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,470
the more unhappy I make Yeo-woon.

305
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,560
Whenever I see you,
I both feel good and want to cry.

306
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,980
I feel so much
about every little thing.

307
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,900
But I'm not happy at all right now.

308
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,240
Why did I think

309
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,620
I could make you happy?

310
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,500
(Final exam D-10)

(Final exam D-6)

315
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,796
I changed my thought to someone's
waiting for me at the finish line.

316
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,290
I have practice.

317
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,920
Yeo-woon.

318
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,710
I'm exhausted.

319
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,590
Please leave me alone.

320
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,210
I think we have to break up.

321
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,970
I don't know what to do
when I like someone.

322
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,180
What are you talking about?

323
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,230
I've been alone for so long

324
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,150
I get used to that kind of life.

325
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,770
I don't know how to stay
by your side.

326
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,440
Stop talking.

327
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,700
I know you think I don't fancy you.

328
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,620
It's my fault.

329
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,370
Why are you saying this?
Stop talking. I won't listen.

330
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,370
Let's break up.

331
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,550
What do you mean?

332
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,680
I mean what I said.

333
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,680
Let's stop acting like a couple.

334
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,940
Why are you saying this?
What did I do wrong?

335
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,400
You didn't do anything wrong.

336
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,900
Listen carefully, Cha Yeo-woon.

337
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,607
I'm not doing this because
you did something wrong.

338
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,410
We met by chance like you said.

339
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,330
It's time for us
to go our separate ways.

340
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,790
What happened?

341
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,790
Why are you telling me this?

342
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,590
I just...

343
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:45,640
- I shouldn't have come into your life.
- I won't agree until you explain.

344
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,545
If you say we break up,
I have to follow your order?

345
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,153
If this was your plan,
why did you date me?

346
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,940
Why?

347
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,940
Do you hate me?

348
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,700
You must have thought
about breaking up all along.

349
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,330
But I'll be better.
Can we not break up?

350
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,330
I won't be annoying at all.

351
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,830
I'll do anything you want,
so please.

352
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,380
No need.

353
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,800
Senior, please.

354
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,300
Don't cry.

355
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,300
I'll stop.

356
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,430
I'll stop whatever you
forbid me to do, so please.

357
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,900
I was wrong.

358
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,280
I love you.
