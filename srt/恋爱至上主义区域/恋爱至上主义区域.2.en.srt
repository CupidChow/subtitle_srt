00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,970
These punks...

181
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,900
Don't you know you can't come up
to the rooftop without permission?

182
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,090
Go down now!

183
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,730
What was that?

184
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,700
You told on us?

185
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,070
Cha Yeowoon?

186
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,210
Just like the rumors,
you sure are a loyal friend.

187
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,380
I'll get going, bro.
See you again.

188
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,700
He's really a weirdo.

189
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,380
I'll get going.

190
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,490
Let's go.

191
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,690
I'm sorry for
dragging you into this.

192
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,840
There's nothing to
be sorry about.

193
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,730
But why did they
take your phone?

194
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,230
They didn't take it.

195
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,450
Sangwon wanted to
borrow my phone.

196
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,980
Sangwon? That
weirdo just now?

197
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,970
Yes.

198
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,570
Our parents
know each other.

199
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,590
Who the hell is he?

200
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,440
Isn't it a given that you should
wear your sports attire for PE class?

201
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,970
His mother owns
a sports brand.

202
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,910
And he's been good at fighting
since he was in middle school.

203
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,620
Be careful.

204
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,340
So he's just a rich
second-generation thug.

205
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,960
Well... But he's a kind guy.

206
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,490
Kyunghoon, you have
such a warm heart.

207
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,020
Let's go.

208
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,580
Hi.

209
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,660
Are you close to
Tae Myungha?

210
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,310
Why are you two close?

211
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,220
What's your relationship
with Tae Myungha?

212
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,710
He's my senior.

213
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,270
He's just a senior.

214
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,150
Fine.

215
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,350
Tae Myungha,
my bro.

216
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,440
Why does he
take care of you?

217
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,890
Because I'm your fan.

218
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,490
Because you're
a track star.

219
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,090
I just like you
as a runner.

220
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,280
I don't know.
Ask him yourself.

221
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,370
He's getting
on my nerves.

222
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,720
Aren't you going to
study in school tonight?

223
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,710
No.

224
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,940
My mom gets worried
when I get home late.

225
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,300
I see.

226
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,670
Do you want
to watch that?

227
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,860
What?

228
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,650
[You're 30 m away from the Love Supremacy Zone.]

229
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,170
Let's just watch
for a while.

230
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Don't you want to
go closer to watch?

231
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,510
Okay.

232
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,030
Hey, Cha Yeowoon!

233
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,869
Get it together.

234
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,339
I'm sorry.

235
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:14,400
Do you only know
how to be apologetic?

236
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,560
No, I'm sorry.

237
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,690
Hey, take a break.

238
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,080
Look at his shoes.

239
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,820
Why doesn't he go out
to make money instead?

240
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,550
Why is he trying to be an
athlete when he's so poor?

241
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,760
[You've received a sidequest!!]

242
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,010
[Question: What is necessary for a happy life?
Answer: Like-minded friends]

243
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,370
Isn't that my handwriting?

244
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,990
[Sidequest: Make other friends with Cha Yeowoon.]

245
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,480
Friends?

246
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,770
We're not even close yet.
How can we make other friends?

247
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,960
[You've received a hint!!]

248
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,230
[You can see how much Cha Yeowoon likes others.]

249
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,060
[Accumulated affection level: 15]

250
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,180
Myungha.

251
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,310
Myungha!

252
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,900
Yeah?

253
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,900
[Affection level: -20]

254
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,550
[Affection level: -30] [Affection level: -40] [Affection level: -50]

255
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,640
[Affection level: -60]

256
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,960
[Affection level: -100]

257
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,660
Myungha,
are you okay?

258
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,540
What's wrong?

259
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,930
Nothing.

260
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,560
Kyunghoon.

261
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,360
Do you want to
make more friends?

262
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,250
What?

263
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,080
Let's have dinner
together tonight.

264
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,250
No.

265
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,530
I said no.

266
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,300
Since you're already
here, let's go inside.

267
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,640
I told you I didn't want to come,
but you dragged me here.

268
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,170
Right, since you were
forced to come,

269
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,860
can't you just have some
tteokbokki against your will?

270
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,090
Well, Myungha, I
can just head home...

271
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,380
I don't like
tteokbokki.

272
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,260
You like it.

273
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,170
-I don't like it.
-You like it.

274
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,840
Enough. Go in.

275
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,350
[A debuff is cast because of a negative affection level.]

276
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,370
Well...

277
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,670
Yeowoon.

278
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,420
Thank you for
this afternoon.

279
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,160
This meal is on me.

280
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,030
You're my senior,
so just speak casually.

281
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,540
That's right. This isn't
some blind date.

282
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,520
Yeowoon, try
some tteokbokki.

283
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,890
Hey, what's wrong?
Have some water.

284
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,380
What's wrong with you?

285
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,910
Why didn't you tell me earlier
that you can't handle spicy food?

286
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,990
That's not it...
this is... kinda...

287
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,830
Why are you laughing?

288
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,190
That's not what I meant.

289
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,030
Why are you laughing?

290
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,670
Yeowoon,
are you dead?

291
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,920
Have you come
back to life?

292
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,280
Watch your words!

293
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,660
Okay.

294
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,780
You watched my
afternoon training today, right?

295
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,600
When did you
notice that?

296
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,280
Don't come to
watch me again.

297
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,980
I'm going to
quit anyway.

298
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,540
Actually, I didn't even start
running because I liked it.

299
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,000
Now, there's no reason
to continue anymore.

300
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,930
It's just a
temporary slump.

301
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,230
Why would you give up?

302
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,130
I haven't been doing well
since my grandma got sick.

303
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,370
Now I don't even have an excuse
for my bad performance.

304
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,650
Cha Yeowoon.

305
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,570
Has there really never been once

306
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,150
when you were happy running?

307
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,350
Yes.

308
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,150
Really?

309
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,540
You're really...

310
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,960
bad at lying.

311
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,400
Yes, Mom.
I just got home.

312
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,790
Yes, I'm fine.

313
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,200
I had tteokbokki
with my friends.

314
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,190
Okay, bye.

315
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,490
Friends? You don't
have any friends.

316
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,680
I have friends too.

317
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,970
Who?

318
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,260
Are you really going
to give up running?

319
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,910
If I give it up, I won't have my scholarship
and won't make it to college.

320
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,570
I wouldn't be able to
attend high school either.

321
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,430
You should go home
now. It's late.

322
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,650
Okay.

323
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,080
Yeowoon.

324
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,250
Tell me if you
want to quit.

325
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,360
When you really
want to quit

326
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,080
to the point of forsaking
your scholarship, tell me.

327
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,560
I'll help you
no matter what.

328
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,730
I'll get going.

329
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,980
[Affection level: 0]

330
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,390
It's so hard.

331
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,340
I'll help you
no matter what.

332
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,380
Why are you
helping me?

333
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,310
I clearly left my
bankbook here.

334
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,780
Where is it?

335
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,530
It's here.

336
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,070
I guess I overestimated
my ability to help him.

337
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,510
Gosh.

338
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,350
A part-time job?

339
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,080
Yeah.

340
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,900
Wow, your house
is so nice.

341
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,930
Thank you.
Have a seat.

342
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,140
How much
do you need?

343
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,640
If it's urgent,
I can help you.

344
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,060
I saved up quite a bit of
money here and there.

345
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,170
Well, no, it's
not that urgent.

346
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,040
Or I can introduce you
to a part-time job.

347
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,930
A part-time job?

348
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,910
But you need to move heavy
equipment around. Is that okay?

349
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,980
Hey! I'm great at that!

350
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,180
Okay, then...

351
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,310
Myungha, my bro?
What brings you here?

352
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,550
Are you here to hang out
with Mr. Four Eyes?

353
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,400
No wonder I wanted
to come here today.

354
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,030
Hey, I told you not to
call my brother that.

355
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,450
Are you...
Tae Myungha?

356
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,650
I told her
you're my friend.

357
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,040
Are you really his friend?

358
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,570
Do you want to fight?

359
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,510
Do you know him?

360
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,600
Of course.

361
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,320
How can I not know
Shinyeop's Mad Dog?

362
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,540
Hey, stop talking
nonsense.

363
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,570
What? Are you
bullying my brother?

364
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,730
Kyunghoon and
I are friends.

365
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,940
Kyunghoon, let's continue our
conversation over the phone. Bye.

366
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,760
Why? Stay a
little longer.

367
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,550
Is this your house?

368
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,260
No, it is
Ahn Shi-a's house.

369
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,450
Then am I your friend?

370
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,100
No, I'm your junior.

371
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,050
Sangwon, are you crazy?
What are you doing?

372
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,750
Don't butt in.

373
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,550
I'm just very
interested in him.

374
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,870
Why are you showing
your interest in my house?

375
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,360
Bro, what are you
going to do today?

376
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,120
[Cha Yeowoon]

377
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,270
Hello?

378
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,250
Did he call me
by mistake?

379
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,740
-Senior...
-Hey.

380
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,150
What's wrong?
Are you sick?

381
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,700
Yeowoon,
say something!

382
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,070
Where are you?
Are you home?

383
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,960
It's been a while since I've been
ignored by someone like that.

384
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,640
I want to be
friends with you.

385
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,930
How are you going
to get there?

386
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,600
By bus or taxi?

387
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,230
Let me give you a ride.

388
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,240
Forget it. Just go.

389
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,670
It should be faster
if I send you there.

390
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,730
Didn't you say
you're in a rush?

391
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,720
[Sidequest: Make other friends with Cha Yeowoon.]

392
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,670
Don't let me catch you riding it again
when you don't have a license.

393
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,690
Yeowoon!

394
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,490
Yeowoon, are you
okay? Yeowoon!

395
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,160
What a high fever!
Call an ambulance!

396
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,920
An ambulance?
What's the address?

397
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,620
Forget it.
Yeowoon, wake up.

398
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,620
Yeowoon,
are you okay?

399
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,540
[Emergency Medical Center]

400
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
The doctor said
it's malnutrition.

401
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,780
Cha Yeowoon.

402
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,720
Stay at my place
for the time being.

403
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,080
If you don't want to,
I can stay at your place.

404
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,920
Why would you do that?

405
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,180
-That's because...
-Do you pity me?

406
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,270
Is it that odd for me
to care about you?

407
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,150
One doesn't always need a reason
to be nice to someone else.

408
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,400
But why?

409
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,120
Why do you have
so much doubt?

410
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,930
If I had a reason,
I'd tell you.

411
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,130
If someone cares about you,
just accept it. Why are you...

412
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,720
Yeowoon.

413
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,620
It's just something
that happens.

414
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:22,000
It's like how something
bad can happen suddenly.

415
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,790
Sometimes, one might just want
to care about you unconditionally.

416
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,180
Let's go eat
after the IV.

417
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,490
It's fine, I'll
just go home.

418
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,730
I'll take you
home then.

419
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,670
I can go back
by myself.

420
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,290
Hey. What if
you faint again?

421
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,250
I can't save you twice.

422
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,930
Do you want to go
for some ice cream?

423
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,030
Why do you like
ice cream so much?

424
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,510
I like you,
not ice cream.

425
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,970
Do you really not
want ice cream?

426
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,300
Yes.

427
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,460
Really?

428
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,620
Yes.

429
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,260
Wow. You're
finally back.

430
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,300
Bro, what took
you so long?
