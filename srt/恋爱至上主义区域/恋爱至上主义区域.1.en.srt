00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,560
No.

181
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,750
That's unexpected. You act just
like my condescending seniors.

182
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,240
Kids nowadays
sure are rude.

183
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,569
Senior, how
old are you?

184
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,980
Me? 20...

185
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,190
19.

186
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,450
I'm 18.

187
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,960
That's why...
you're a kid.

188
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,060
Be on your way then.

189
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,660
Hey. Hey!

190
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,540
[Affection level: -20]

191
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,860
[A debuff is cast because of a negative affection level.]

192
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,500
A debuff?

193
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,460
There's even that?

194
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,110
Can I sleep at
your place tonight?

195
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,130
No.

196
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,590
Then why don't you
sleep at my place?

197
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,130
I know what you're thinking,

198
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,800
but I won't kill myself.
So just leave.

199
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,690
This won't do.
Let's go together.

200
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,650
Bus driver!
Wait up!

201
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,300
Do you have money
for the bus fare?

202
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,840
Are you extorting
money from me?

203
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,880
Bus fare for two.

204
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,600
I'll pay you back
once I get home.

205
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,400
Really.

206
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,570
We could have just sat
in the back together.

207
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,690
[You're 40 cm away from the Love Supremacy Zone.]

208
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,370
What Love Supremacy Zone?

209
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,820
It's clearly a Hedgehog
Supremacy Zone.

210
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,060
What's the standard for it?

211
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,530
40 cm?

212
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,650
Oh?

213
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,220
[You're entering the Love Supremacy Zone.]

214
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,680
What are you doing?

215
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,970
I'm sorry.

216
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,200
[You're 40 cm away from the Love Supremacy Zone.]

217
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,760
Zone?

218
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,820
Is this the distance between
me and Cha Yeowoon?

219
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,590
Love Supremacy?

220
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,080
[Love Supremacy]

221

[Love Supremacy: An attitude or tendency that posits
being in love as the highest goal in life and the only core condition for marriage]

222
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,090
Being in love?

223
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,000
With him?

224
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,950
[Unknown number: Now that I've tried red bean ice cream,
I prefer chestnut-flavored ice cream. Why does anyone eat this?]

225
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,120
Huh? Was this text sent
to me by mistake?

226
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,400
Why are you
spacing out?

227
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,720
What? Oh.

228
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,670
Nothing.

229
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,620
But it'll take a while
to get to my house.

230
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,820
Wow.

231
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,640
It hasn't changed at all.

232
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,660
I'm home.

233
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,490
Now you don't even tell me when
you're going to be home late?

234
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,960
Grandma.

235
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,140
Ouch!

236
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,120
Why are you always
picking fights unnecessarily?

237
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,400
Why must you hit me?

238
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,720
When I'm civil with you,
you disregard me, don't you?

239
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,300
-Gosh.
-Please.

240
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,600
Who's that tagging
along with you?

241

Oh.

242

Hello.

243
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,530
Why are you dressed
for a funeral?

244
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,570
He's a close
friend of mine.

245
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,570
He's sleeping at
our place tonight.

246
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,360
That's fine, right?

247
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,030
He's handsome.

248
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,750
Right?

249
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,770
Give it to me,
Grandma.

250
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,100
Hurry and come in.

251
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,670
What are you
doing here?

252
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,320
Do you live with just
your grandma too?

253
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,190
Yeah.

254
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,120
Is that why you're poking
your nose into my business?

255
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:22,410
This might be your first time
meeting me, but I know you well.

256
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,650
Because you've heard about
me from my grandma?

257
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,130
Because I'm your fan.

258
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,650
A fan?

259
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,860
Aren't you
a track star?

260
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,620
What do you know?

You're rude, but
you're quite cute.

263

Have you always
been like this,

If you're grateful,
just say thank you.

267
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,150
Grandma, what
are you doing?

268
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,250
Why are you sitting so close
to me? Why are you still up?

269
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,950
I just came because
I missed you.

270
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,420
Goodness... What's
wrong with you?

271
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,690
You lost a fight
today, right?

272
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,400
I said I missed you.

273
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,170
Are you talking nonsense
because it's about time to die?

274
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,460
How is it nonsense
that I missed you?

275
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,400
Gosh.

276
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,100
Give it to me.

277
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,560
Come to think of it,

278
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,560
I was really happy when I
was with you during this time.

279
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,340
I don't think it's about losing
a fight. Did you get possessed?

280
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,660
I'm completely sane.

281
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,380
Your grandson is fine!

282
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,000
I think he's done
with his shower.

283
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,670
I'll go back now.
Sleep early.

284
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,870
Myungha.

285
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,710
Are you really okay?

286
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,060
Sleep early.

[Affection level: -10]

288
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,040
Cha Yeowoon,
you're still up, right?

289
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,690
Are you thinking about me?

290
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,090
What are you talking about?
You're really weird.

291
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,740
Gosh, that
temper of yours.

292
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,540
Good night.

293
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,050
Hey, what should we do about you
not having a change of clothes?

294
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,310
I'll take care of it.

295
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,800
Okay.

296
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,110
The bus is here.

297
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,420
[Affection level: -10]

298
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,950
[A debuff is cast because of a negative affection level.]

299
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,320
What?

300
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,030
Oh... Who is this?
It's Cha Yeowoon.

301
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,330
Are you
ignoring me?

302
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,370
Hey.

303
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,420
Why are you
so noisy?

304
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,480
I barely said a few
words. How is it...

305
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,060
Tak Joonkyung.

306
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,750
Let's just go in silence.

307
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,740
So, to sum it up...

308
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,460
First,

309
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,960
the so-called zone isn't
as wide as I thought.

310
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,480
It's the area of a five-meter
radius around Cha Yeowoon.

311
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:59,360
[You're 1 m away from the Love Supremacy Zone]

312
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,770
Second, when Cha Yeowoon has
a negative affection level for me,

313
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,780
me being near him

314
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,040
would cause a debuff and
something bad would happen to him.

315
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,370
So until the affection
level reaches zero,

316
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,310
I need to keep a
distance from him.

317
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,040
Third,

318
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:28,160
would something good happen
to Cha Yeowoon if he likes me?

319
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,070
Why is he avoiding
me after all that?

320
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,190
Hey! Are you playing around?
Get yourself together!

321
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,710
I'm sorry.

322
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,300
One more lap.

323
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,830
Cha Yeowoon is all haughty because
he has Tae Myungha's backing.

324
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,110
How did Cha Yeowoon get
acquainted with Tae Myungha?

325
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,610
They couldn't have
known each other for long.

326
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,690
Who cares?

327
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,640
I have to teach him a
lesson to humble him.

328
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,800
He's dead.

329
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,300
But then... shouldn't
we ask Sangwon?

330
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,410
Yeah. Sangwon hates it
when people do things

331
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,840
without telling him.

332
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,470
[Sangwon]

333
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,810
[Cheon Sangwon]

334
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,400
Kyunghoon, are
you studying?

335
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,470
The answer for this
is number two.

336
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,880
Oh? How did you know?

337
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,740
Hey. Do you know
Cha Yeowoon well?

338
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,690
Yeah, because my younger
sister is a fan of his.

339
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,890
Do other students
bully him?

340
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,420
Probably.

341
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,470
As far as I know, the
track team is bullying him.

342
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,650
Why? Because
he's the best?

343
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,840
I'm not sure about that.

344
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,130
But it'd be better
not provoke them.

345
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,710
Don't worry.
I don't hit kids.

346
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,020
Hey, Cha Yeowoon!

347
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,940
Are you close to
Tae Myungha?

348
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,240
How does that
concern you?

349
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,310
Forget it.

350
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,170
How does a loser like you
know Tae Myungha?

351
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,810
Then how do
you know him?

352
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,810
How could I not know him? He is
the infamous Mad Dog of our school.

353
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,870
You didn't know
about that? Really?

354
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,220
He's Tae Myungha.

355
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,460
He's been famous in this area
since he was in middle school.

356
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,620
What a bunch of pathetic losers.

357
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,660
Hey!

358
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,590
Hit me if you want.

359
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,350
Hey, Cha Yeowoon!

360
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,230
Will you die if you don't
bully others constantly?

361
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,980
I'm sorry
about the past.

362
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,830
I said I'm sorry.

363
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,230
I've apologized,

364
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,570
so you must tell
Senior Tae Myungha

365
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,810
that I've apologized.

366
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,180
Hey, Tak Joonkyung.

367
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,420
What class is Senior
Tae Myungha in?

368
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,690
[Shinyeop Boys' High School; Year 3, Class 5]

369
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,810
Don't tell me he's
running away from me?

370
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,690
Hey, you can't run
in the corridor!

371
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,350
Then why are you
running away?

372
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,490
Because I can't be
near you right now.

373
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,980
Why did you
run away?

374
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,150
Me?

375
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,460
You ran away because you
were avoiding me. Why?

376
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:32,380
Well, for me to
be near you,

377
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,800
you have to
like me more.

378
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,450
What do you mean?

379
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,920
There are things that
kids won't understand.

380
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:49,740
Anyway, don't run around.
Take care of your legs.

381
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,760
Don't follow me.

382
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,610
This is nice.

383
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,930
This place is better than reality.
Should I just stay here?

384
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:09,400
Hello...

385
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,580
What did you mean just now
about our relationship?

386
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,750
Cha Yeowoon?

387
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,100
Do you like me?

388
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,449
What?

389
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:16,719
Stop laughing.

390
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,610
But how did you
know my number?

391
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,710
Just answer my question.

392
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,340
Also, did you hit
Tak Joonkyung?

393
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,100
Hey. Do I look like the kind
who beats others up?

394
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,880
In my eyes?
Yes.

395
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,469
Yeowoon.

396
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:37,840
Shouldn't you at least be
polite if you made the call?

397
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:41,489
So you didn't
hit him, right?

398
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:43,389
That's all then. Bye.

399
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,780
What?

400
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,710
Was he worrying about
me or Joonkyung?
