00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,028
I was wondering
how long you'd last.

2
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,540
I'm teasing.
Stop tensing your lips.

3
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,920
Don't laugh.

4
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,470
I'm not laughing.

5
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,380
But you really have to
stop tensing your lips.

6
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,220
I'm going back to my place.

7
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,350
Why's that?

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,298
I teased you because you were cute.

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,980
You're my first everything.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,350
I never liked anyone.

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,980
I'll get better with more practice.

12
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,360
I'm good at that.

00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,140
I'm on a date with a boy.

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,760
A date.

23
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,390
Is this the right thing to do?

25
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,530

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,930
Have you been waiting long?

27
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,930
Huh?

28
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,770
No.

What's...

31
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,830
- this?
- I'm told I must give you a sunflower

32
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,330

33
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,410
- First date?
- Um.

34
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,630
- You must give him a sunflower.
- A sunflower.

35
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,040
What's the meaning of a sunflower?

36
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,920
"To have eyes
only for that person."

37
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,800
It will show your determination.

38
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,640
- A sunflower?
- Um.

39
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,220
This is my conviction

40

and determination.

41
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,020

Was it that sad?

45
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,880
No, it wasn't. It wasn't that sad.

46
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,643
I just got a little teary.
I wasn't in the mood for popcorn.

I know. Dry your tears first.
I'll do it for you.

48
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,180
So who won? The gorilla zombie
or the crocodile demon?

49
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,730
Didn't you watch the movie?

50
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,060
I kept watching you.

51
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,392
Well, it was the first time someone
beside me cried for a gorilla zombie.

52
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:16,236
What did you expect me to do?

53
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,150
Do you know how epic this movie is?

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,120
The crocodile was actually
an extraterrestrial.

55
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,580
He met the gorilla here
and joined him to save the world.

56
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,080
It's an epic story.

57
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,920
The plot is really strange.

58
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,790
It was very moving.

59
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,010
Senior.

60
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,970
You have strange taste.

61
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,220
But being strange makes you cute.

62
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,230
Give me the popcorn.

63
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,810

64
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,070
Can I do it again?

65
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,700
What do you mean?

66
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,200
Kiss.

67
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,870
You can't.

68
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,210
Hello?

69
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,210
How much do three pairs
of cargo pants cost?

70

What?

71
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,310
Bro, I deserve to die
for my mistake.

72
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,190
But now that I think about it,
it wasn't my fault, but my finger...

73
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,190
I'll cut off my finger.

74
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,030
I'll cut my finger
so I won't make the same mistake.

75
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,150
Explain what happened.

76
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,830
Your photos on my shopping website with
your face cropped out got a lot of attention.

77
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,620
Since my shopping website
is already famous,

78
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,040
and you have an IG account,
people started following you.

79
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,500
But I never uploaded pictures
with my face in them.

80
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,920
That's why people are obsessed.

81
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,840
The pictures with only your profile
make people especially curious.

82
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,600

works very well.

- You didn't know about his IG account?

87
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,950
He looks so good in these pictures.

88
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,700
He's famous now.

89
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,370
You're not on IG?

90
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,790
Never seen that photo?

91
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,620
What should you do?

92
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,750
But he's so cool.
I'll save it for later.

93
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,460
I can't help you.

94
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,420

your face from the start.

- Yeo-woon.

102
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,860

If a regular person

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,670

what must he do?

108

No.

Si-a,

113
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,690
you owe me for your mistake, right?

114

Well... Yes.

115
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,030

Why are you filming this?

118
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,860
To promote you as an athlete.

119
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,450
If you're promoting me as an athlete,
why do you need to use my IG?

120
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,450
Let me give you a kiss first.

121
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:35,830
Jeez, unbelievable.

123
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,460
will you dare kiss me?

124
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,130
Go ahead.

00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,490
We're looking for
a up and coming model.

184
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,370
So it's not me.

185
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,160
Cha Yeo-woon?

186
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,870
You're quick.

187
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,120
I heard you're closest
to Athlete Cha Yeo-woon.

188
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,790
I actually contacted
Athlete Cha Yeo-woon last year,

189
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,630
but he refused.

190
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,800
But you're back.

191
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,850
Are you the one
who created this account?

192
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,720
Si-a said you wanted
around 100,000 followers.

193
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,520
What do you say?
You want me to arrange it?

194
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,360
I'll try talking to Yeo-woon.

195
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,910
Talk it over.

196
00:14:56,543 --> 00:14:57,710
Senior!

197
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:13,882
Why did you have to run like that?

198
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,600
I was rushing to see you.

199
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,860
Hey.

200
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,520
Don't go around smiling like that.

201
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,520
I won't. Let's go.

202
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,700
Hey, are you Athlete Cha Yeo-woon?

203
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,040
You're him, right? You must be.

204
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,170
Right? Right?

205
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,710
- Awesome.
- So handsome.

206
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,340
Take a picture with me.

207
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,650
Remember. You're mine alone.

208
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,060
Am I yours?

209
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,120
Is it usually this easy?

210
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,790
She can walk the walk I guess.

211
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,090
(Comments)

212
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,890
(Cha Yeo-woon got first place
in a 100m high school track race.)

213
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,890
A fan club?

214
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,890
(In the 2022
national spring competition, )

215
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,140
(a newcoming athlete
became a rising star.)

216
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,280
(Once it's turned into a game, lots of things
need to be fixed. You got my clues, right?)

217
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,780
(Cha Yeo-woon's leg isn't injured.
Tae Myung-ha has friends.)

218
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,200
(Cha Yeo-woon doesn't quit track.
Tae Myung-ha has 300,000 won.)

219
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,460
(Cha Yeo-woon falls in love for the first time.
Tae Myung-ha has a fan club.)

220
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,670
(NEW)

221
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,050
(Cha Yeo-woon's enemy)

222
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,720
(A server error occurred
due to abrupt changes.)

223
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,640
(Stop ongoing operations.
The server rollback must be performed.)

224
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,310
(Proceed with only stable activities
until the server is stabilized.)

225
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,310
Stable activities?

226
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,770
(Compensating due to server errors)

227
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,030
(Retrieving partial memory
of Tae Myung-ha)

228
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,570
I don't like stuff about fate.

229
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,120
Why not?

230
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,330
Because it means
everything's predetermined.

231
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,380
So you don't believe in destiny?

232
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,460
Fate or destiny,
they're all the same.

233
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,130
It's like what my grandma said.

234
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,090
Life is like a written book.

235
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,390
How we live and die
is predetermined.

236
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,429
If we do good, we'll be
reborn lucky in the next life.

237
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,400
But if we do bad things, we'll be
reborn with a horrible fate.

238
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,150
I don't like that at all.

239
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,490
I think even though it's predetermined,
we can still change it.

240
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,280
Or every effort
would have been in vain.

241
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
Is that so?

242
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,170
Then, Myung-ha...

243
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,220
(I hope you find a happy ending.)

244
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,770
(Tae Myung-ha, go to hell.)

245
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,560
Grandma, I gotta go.

246
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,060
Have breakfast first.

247
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,570
It's okay. You go ahead.

248
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,200
(Please explain Cha Yeo-woon's
habits described as "too much.")

249
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,370
A lot of nasty comments
were left on purpose.

250
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:30,980
- Have you put them in PDF files?
- Um.

251
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,420
I'll send them to you.

252
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,130
Okay. I'm gonna send all of them
to Myung-ha and Jinjo in one go.

253
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:39,372
What's this? They made news.

254
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,970
(High School Track Champion
Reveals He is "Being Stalked")

255
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,180
What?!

256
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,480
It's gonna be hectic
for Senior again.

257
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,690
I know he's famous

258
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,560
but I didn't think he'd be stalked.

259
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,690
And it's been going on
since last year.

260
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,213
When did Myung-ha say he'd be here?

261
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,565
He should have already arrived.

262
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,740
I'll go get him.

263
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,870
Understood?

264
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,460
Don't respond to nasty messages.
Make screenshots and send them to me.

265
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,130
I was practicing so I didn't look.
I'll check again later.

266
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,210
Yeo-woon, you should have told me
this had been going on.

267
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,550
I had no idea.

268
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,800
No. I was the one
who agreed to do it.

269
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,220
It's fine.

270
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,564
That thread was made
by your stalker from last year?

271
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,270
Yes. The word choice in consistent.

272
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,440
I see. I'm on my way
to see those guys.

273
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,867
They asked
the department head for help.

274
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,610
- Okay.
- Um.

275
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,290
(Create Cha Yeo-woon's fan club
100,000 fans (60,000 fans))

276
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,040
(The total has reached 60,000.)

277
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,790
(People are aware of Cha Yeo-woon.)

278
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,290
(His influence has slightly increased.)

279
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,170
I should be happy, right?

280
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,010
(A system error has occurred.)

281
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,350
(Yeo-woon)

282
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,610
- Yeah?
- Senior, I couldn't log in.

283
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,610
Eh? Cha Yeo-woon's
account disappeared.

284
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,940
Huh?

285
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,320
What? Why is this happening?

286
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,040
Has his account been hacked?

287
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,520
That bastard.

288
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,770
Hey! Hey! Cheon Sang-won, don't!

289
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,860
I said don't!

290
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,150
Get it together, kid!

291
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,320
What are you doing?!

292
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,120
I should be asking you that.

293
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,790
What were you doing?

294
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,949
If I didn't stop you, you would
have fought him and gotten hurt.

295
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,580
Then let us fight!

296
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,420
That psycho might come back
and do God knows what.

297
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,220
What if I didn't come get you
and you were pushed into traffic?

298
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,357
Did it never occur to you?

299
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,180
Didn't you know
how serious this is?

300
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,270
People like that, when they plan
something, they go through with it.

301
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,600
How many lives
do you think you have?

302
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,900
I appreciate your help.

303
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,440
But this isn't
your concern, Sang-won.

304
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,190
What if something happened to you?

305
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,660
Then whose concern is it?

306
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,580
What just happened,

307
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,450
you couldn't do anything about it.

308
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So,

309
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,710
do you consider what just happened
your fault because you'd ignored it?

310
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,680
You...

311
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,564
seem like someone
who doesn't know how to be loved.

312
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,150
Let's break up.

313
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,570
You know, right?

314
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,660
You don't know how to love anyone.

315
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,510
Senior!

316
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,190
You said you'd see Si-a today.

317
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,070
- Finished your practice?
- Yes.

318
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,490
Let's go. I'll see you home.

319
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,780
Is there something wrong?

320
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,370
No.

321
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,660
Oh, Yeo-woon.

322
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,290
You should crash at my place today.

323
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,830
Today?

324
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,080
Nice. I'll go.
