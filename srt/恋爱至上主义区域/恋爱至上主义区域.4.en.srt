My homeroom teacher keeps treating me like a thug.

188
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,000
Looks like I should study hard.

189
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,200
Okay, let's study together.

190
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,350
Let's go to college together

191
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,020

198

I was wondering why you two keep following each other.

203
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,720

214
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,500
Why am I the only one who's gay?

Don't swear.

Shut up, you gay bastard.

220
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,160
If you say I'm gay again, I'll really kiss you properly.

221
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,370
Just because I sad that you got scared?

What's going on? Huh?

224
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,930
It's all because of Tak Joonho that I have to go through this pain.

Something just happened. You don't need to know.

Why won't you answer me once something like this happens?

234

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,760
There's a sea nearby too.

367
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,420
Oh.

368
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,260
Sure, let's go.

369
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,590
Really?

370
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,560
Boss.

371
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,870
Why are you here?

372
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,930
You must be busy.

373
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,050
I'm always busy. I'm the boss after all.

374
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,470
What brings you here? You didn't even contact me.

375
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,620
Here's the thing.

376
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,630
I need your help.

377
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,480
Do it with me too. The kiss.

378
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,960
Kiss?

379
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,880
Why?

380

[Side Mission: Kiss Cha Yeowoon]

381
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,190
You said men can... can do that too, no?

382
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,700
What?

383
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,820
It's not about men, but you.

384
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,110
Crazy bastard.

[I heard it takes an hour to get to Seonyu Island]
[4 a.m.]

386
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,440
He woke up at 4 a.m.?

[But no time for me to meet you]
[4 a.m.]

388
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,340
Huh? Who is this?

389
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,080
Oh.

390
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
Hey.

391
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,100
Why are you here?

392
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,600
I got up early, so I came to pick... you up.

393
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,890
Let's go.

394
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,450
Okay.

395
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,260
For the two of us.

396
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,280
Wow, it's the sea.

397
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,370
Senior. Look at the seagulls.

398
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,370
Isn't the weather nice?

399
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,100
I should've bought a pack of shrimp chips.

400
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,960
Senior. Have you ever fed shrimp chips to seagulls?

401
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,980
Yeah.

402
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,260
Do you like the sea?

403
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,150
Well...

404
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,790
To be honest,

405
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,720
I like mountains more than the sea.

406
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,400
Really? Let's go climb mountains next time.

407
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,530
Really?

408
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,930
I want to try climbing Kongryung Mountain.

409
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,700
No matter what,

410
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,070
isn't the first place you want to go being

411
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,350
Kongryung Mountain a little...

412
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,030
I'm happy to be with you.

413
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,790
Have you been here before?

414
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,720
No. It's my first time.

415
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,230
There's a famous kal-guksu restaurant here.

416
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,670
Kal-guksu sounds good.

417
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,720
Is it clam kal-guksu?

418
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,520
Don't you not like seafood?

419
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,530
How did you know?

420
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,230
Huh?

421
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,600
Just looking at you, I know.

422
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,570
You can tell I don't like seafood just by looking at me?

423
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,770
You said you like mountains more than the sea, that's why.

424
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,110
Sometimes it feels like you're someone that knows me.

425
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:07,630
Or should I say you're like someone who has known me since a long time ago.

426
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,720
I've never met someone like you.

427
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,600
Shall we go eat?

428
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,700
Senior.

429
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,750
Mm?

430
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,600
I think I know why you like the sea.

431
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,480
I've come to like it too.
