00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,320
Senior!

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,490
Why am I here?

3
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,920
Kids like chocolate, right?

4
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,150
You're going straight home?

5
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,700
You have practice?

6
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,200
He's not going, so I'm gonna skip.

7
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:57,782
And Ahn Si-a just said
she had to go somewhere.

8
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,870
What's this?

9
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,830
Since when did I leave with them?

10
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,130
Are you coming too?

11
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,130
We have a shoot tomorrow.

12
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,390
Splint off already?

13
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,230
How did you hurt yourself?

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
I wonder.

15
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,770
No idea.

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,770
Who would know except you?

17
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,770
Never mind.

18
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,370
This upcoming race,

19
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,280
Ahn Si-a asked
if she could come see you.

20
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,990
Don't come.

21
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,540
I'm not Ahn Si-a.

22
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,540
You can't forbid me to come.

23
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,130
Our conversations
always end like this

24
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,710
but I don't know
why I keep talking to you.

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,380
Then don't talk to me.

26
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,766
But how did you join
the track and field club?

27
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,560
Well...

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,890
I just did.

29
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,350
Hey, do I need to remember
all the details in my life?

30
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,690
Where are you going?

31
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,570
The infirmary.

32
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,840
There's no teacher here.

33
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,890
What's that?

34
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,390
Whose voice is that?

35

(Episode 8: The Answer)

41
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,720
Go on and eat.

42
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,050
You want more?

43
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,650
- Are you well?
- Yes.

44
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,150
- What about you?
- So-so.

45
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,700
I'm calling to let you know
the stalker problem is almost over.

46
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,740
You can practice for your race
without worries.

47
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,540
Thank you for taking care of it.

48
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,790
Is Mr. Myung-ha doing well?

49
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,540
Myung...

50
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,920
Who?

51
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,130
Myung-ha. Tae Myung-ha.

52
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,130
Tae Myung-ha...

53
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,050
Cha Yeo-woon!

54
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,680
Cha Yeo-woon!

55
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,970
There's no "only" about it.

56
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,600
You did great, Yeo-woon.

57
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,600
Come on.

58
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,150
Apply it already.

59
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,150
Let's go.

60
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,240
Spring has just turned into summer,

61
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,790
but it's weird that
my life has changed so much.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,210
I love you.

63
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,180
Cha Yeo-woon!

64
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,430
Mr. Yeo-woon?

65
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,430
Mr. Yeo-woon?

66
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,430
Are you okay?

67
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,900
Are you there?

68
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,610
I'm sorry. I'll call you back.

69
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,490
Hello?

70
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,700
It's...

71
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,450
- Senior.
- Huh?

72
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,870
- Myung-ha. You know Tae Myung-ha?
- What?

73
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,870
- Who?
- Tae Myung-ha!

74
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,750
Who is he?

75
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,370
Where are you guys now?

76
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,220
Brother!

77
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,550
Take a look.

78
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,930
From this photo,
he should move to this side a bit.

79
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,260
Have Sang-won stand here...

80
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,180
- Hey, is there something wrong?
- Myung-ha.

81
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,157
Have you seen Senior Tae Myung-ha?

82
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,650
- Where is he?
- Who is he?

83
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,400
- What?
- Who?

84
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,980
Who's Tae Myung-ha?

85
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,110
Bro, he's your classmate.

86
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,740
There's no one by that name.

87
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,540
Explain who he is.

88
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:48,930
Ma'am.

89
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,720
Goodness, what's wrong?
Why are you soaked with sweat?

90
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,350
Where's Senior Myung-ha?

91
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,730
Myung... Myung-ha?

92
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,820
Where is he?

93
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,820
When was the last time you saw him?

94
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Ma'am, may I go inside for a bit?

95
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,830
Please excuse me.

96
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760

97
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,560
Everyone, look at the camera.

98
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,440
Here we go.

99

Making a wish?

124
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,550
I'm gonna wish for that star
to fall on my company

125
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,350
- so I don't have to go to work.
- That's so you.

126
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,120
Oh, it's coming.

127
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,980

who can't see it?

128
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,270
- Don't close your eyes then.
- Don't close my eyes?

129
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,690
- My eyes are open.
- Next year,

130
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,900

131
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,200

- Yes?

140
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,930
My...

141
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,930
name is Tae Myung-ha.

142
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,900
Mommy!

143
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,936
I'm not her. I think
you came to the wrong place.

144

My love, give me a hug.

145
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,350
The answer I got after I'd been
mustering the courage all my life

146
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,940
was a rejection.

147
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,860
That was why...

148
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,360
I decided to abandon myself.

149
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,580
And I died like that on that day.

150
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,040
But I regretted it
in the last minute.

151
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,170
Regretting everything.

152
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,550
How did I get here?

153
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,520
This is death.

154
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,690
Once you gave up,
you can't go back.

155
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,730
What's next?

156
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,110
You should have let it end there.

157
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,950
Now...

158
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,570
- what's all this for?
- You regretted it.

159
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,450
I'm just giving you a chance.

160
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:19,343
I was hoping if you saw yourself
from someone else's perspective,

161
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,420
you would learn to love yourself.

162
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,481
I thought if you learned
to love someone,

163
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,260
you...

164
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,510
would be a little happier.

165
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,140
Learned to love and then what?

166
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,060
Everything was over.

167
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,570
Both my lives at 29 and 19.

168
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,320
If I tell you it's over,

169
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,790
will you let it end?

170
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,090
I want to stay.

171
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,300
I want to stay.

172
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,130

(Please make Tae Myung-ha happy.)

176
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,650
Myung-ha,

177
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,690
you don't have to go through
everything by yourself anymore.

178
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,530
This time around

179
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,040
you must be happy.

180
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,250
Senior,

181
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,880
who are you exactly?

182

184
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,200
I hope that place sparks your hope.

185
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,700
From Senior.

186
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,040

187
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,540
(Synchronizing)

188
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,170
(The Dating Zone is activated.)

189
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,380
Cha Yeo-woon.

190
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,180
(Myung-ha)

191
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,100
- Hello?
- Where are you?

192
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,350
Senior, I should be
asking you that!

193
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,850
Do you have any idea
how worried I've been?

194
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,250
Where have you been?
Why didn't you tell me?

195
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,400
It's a long story.
Just tell me where you are.

196
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,860
- The movie theater.
- Huh?

197
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,070
Why are you there?

198
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,820
I didn't know where to find you
so I came here.

199
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,490
What do I do?

200
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,240
I'll be right there.

201
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,240
Don't go anywhere. Wait there.

202
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,420
Where are you?

203
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,010
The box office.

204
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,800
I don't see you.

205
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,890
I'm in front of the box office.

206
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,600
Don't you see me?

207
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,190
Cha Yeo-woon?

208
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,940
Did you hear me call you?

209
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,020
I didn't.

210
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,530
Are you at the right place?

211
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,410
Or...

212
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,200
What is today's date?

213
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,910
- August 12.
- Yeo-woon,

214
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,910
the race you asked me to come,

215
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,540
when is that?

216
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,540
August 14.

217
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,090
I already told you...

218
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:59,300
(Monday, August 14
Saturday, August 12)

219
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,260
- Why did you ask about the dates?
- Where's the race?

220
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,230
Gunsan-ri, the Seosin side.

221
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,100
You have to be there.

222
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,770
You have to be there
on that day, understood?

223
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:15,311
Don't look for me in weird places.
Don't look for me anywhere else.

224
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,070
You have to be there.

225
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,280
Why's that?

226
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,200
Because I'm going there right now.

227
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,500
Cha Yeo-woon?

228
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,920
Yes?

229
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,470
I miss you.

230
00:20:49,325 --> 00:20:52,375
(3 hours 23 minutes remaining)

231
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,570
(Time remaining)

232
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,380
Why is this happening again?

233
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,390
The engine's acting up again.

234
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,190
I'm sorry, everyone.

235
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,520
I have to stop for a bit.

236
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,650
Mister, let me out.

237
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,710
Where are you going?

238
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,010
To see my main.

239
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,850
Cha Yeo-woon!

240
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,350
(100 m to the Dating Zone)

241
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,770
(Remaining time)
Senior!

242
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,940
(Remaining time)

243
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,290
It would be nice to have someone.

244
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,250
Someone who cares by my side.

245
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,430
Someone who gives me chances
when I fail and feel hopeless.

246
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,930
It would be nice to have someone
who always gives me love.

247
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,270
(Mission: Make Tae Myung-ha happy)

248
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,400
(Q: What's crucial
to a happy life?)

249
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,470
I got you.

250
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,260
Um.

251
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,310
I got you, Senior.

252
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,350
You're not going anywhere, right?

253
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,350
I'm not going anywhere.

254
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,290
(END)

255
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,420
(Thank you for loving
"Love for Love's Sake")

256
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,460
(Would you like to go
to the final scene?)

257
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,540
(Will you claim
the finale's reward?)

258
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,170
Grandma, I gotta go.

259
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,800
Jeez, give it to me.

260
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,470
Don't get into trouble.
Don't drink.

261
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,350
And be careful at the sea.

262
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,350
Jeez, I won't get into trouble.

263
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,873
And I'm gonna play in the sea
but you tell me to be careful?

264
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,980
Here.

265
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,650
You brat.
Listen to me for a change.

266
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,940
I always listen to you.

267
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,280
Bye, Grandma!

268
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,450
- Be careful.
- Call me if there's a problem.

269
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,620
Goodness, this kid.

270
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,370
Cha Yeo-woon!

271
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,290
Senior, why did you come here?

272
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,630
So we can leave together.
Come on already.

273
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,300
Walk carefully.

274
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,170
Here.

275
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,080
Everyone must be waiting.
Let's get going.

276
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,640
Let's go!

277
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,300
(Yeo-woon loves Myung-ha)

278
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,810
I finally realized that

279
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,810
every answer I had hoped for

280
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,030
was in everyday life
that's too mundane to be "fate,"

281
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,070
yet too beautiful to be "chance."

282
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,160
Happiness must be

283
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,785
hidden somewhere
in each of our days.

284
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:14,550
(Thank you for watching
"Love for Love's Sake.")

285
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:21,550
(We wish you all happiness.)

286
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,480
(Love for Love's Sake)
