Nothing. I just feel like you care about him a lot.

367
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,470
Anyway, I'm sure he'll be happy if he receives this.

368
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,660
Cha Yeowoon!

369
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,430
Hey, I've been looking for you since yesterday–

370
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,680
Hey! Hey, where are you going?

371
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,820
You're not going to stop?

372
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,160
Here's the thing.

373
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,220
What is this?

374
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,280
You have a competition next week.

375
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,400
Though you can't wear new shoes during the competition,

376
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,560
take them.

377
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,590
Here.

378
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,400
Why are you giving me this?

379
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,830
I thought you might need it.

380
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,900
[Calculating how much Cha Yeowoon likes you]

381
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,940
[Affection level: -10]

382
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,100
-Yeowoon, wait.
-Let go.

383
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,380
What's wrong?

384
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,080
Senior.

385
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,290
[Affection level: –60]

386
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,310
Senior, you know nothing.

387
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,700
[Affection level: –99]

388
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,590
Why didn't you tell me you were coming to my school?

389
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,720
Isn't it class time? Go to your class.

390
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,030
I heard you're going to hire Cha Yeowoon as a model.

391
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,560
It's none of your business.

392
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,070
Now I'm jealous of Cha Yeowoon.

393
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,560
Instead of making a scene with me,

394
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,650
you should sell your motorcycle and go to school properly.

395
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,650
I sold my motorcycle a long time ago.

396
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,530
I guess I didn't study hard enough.

397
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,780
Take care.

398
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,330
What are you doing?

399
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,250
Hello.

400
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,050
These are new shoes.

401
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,110
Did you buy them yourself?

402
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,270
Move.

403
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,070
Right.

404
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,580
You're a poor beggar. How would you have money?

405
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,880
Hey, stop picking a fight and get lost.

406
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,150
It must be from someone else.

407
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,710
It's my mom's brand.

408
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,020
So?

409
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,640
If I knew this, I should've joined the track and field team.

410
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,870
That if you act pitiful, someone will give you shoes.

411
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,270
You want to hit me?

412
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,130
If you don't get good results, you will only embarrass yourself on the competition.

413
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,590
Why don't you punch me and get suspended from the competition?

414
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,470
This is the school. What are you doing?

415
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,510
Did you get hit?

416
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,270
Not yet.

417
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,040
Don't follow me.

418
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,110
I said don't come near me.

419
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,310
Warm up when you get there.

420
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,920
Don't think I can't see you and just walk around.

421
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,410
Continue physical training.

422
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,440
Yes.

423
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,390
Get ready to warm up.

424
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:41,440
[I will now announce the result of the 200m high school girls.] The result of the qualifiers.

425
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,790
I will now announce The result of the qualifiers.

426
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,080
Cha Yeo-woon!

427
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,470
Cha Yeo-Woon!

428
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,190
Get ready.

429
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,160
Yes.

430
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,130
Have you ever been happy

431
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,050
Have you never been happy?

432
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,430
Cha Yeo-Woon!

433
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,710
Cha Yeo-woon!

434
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,380
Run!
