00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
Thanks for the food!

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,160
I told you we could
eat something else.

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,410
- You barely ate.
- They say this shop is the best.

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,750
You didn't like the food?

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,488
I did. It

6
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:21,460
was good.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,340
I'm happy as long as you liked it.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,590
Let's go to a café.
There's a famous one nearby.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,970
Don't get coffee.
Let's go for something else.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,403
We're going to Yongma Land.
Let's get our drinks there.

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,810
We can get them first and go.

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,990
They serve other things too,
not just coffee.

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,930

dishes are famous.

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,230
Okay.

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,780
Let's go.

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,150
What to get? Ashotshu?

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,820
That sounds good.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,580
Wow, pretty.

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,040
Senior, it's right there.

20
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,870
Beautiful, isn't it?

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,880
Come on!

22
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,850
- Welcome.
- Hello.

23
00:01:26,312 --> 00:01:27,972
Senior, what would you like?

24
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,900
Huh?

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,280
- Americano.
- America...?

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,240
Don't you want clam cookies
or mugwort latte?

27
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,950
They're their signature menus.

28
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,870
Just get me something.
I'm gonna go outside.

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,710
- Are you ready to order?
- Excuse me.

30
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,430
What's wrong?

31
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,100
Are you okay?

32
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,100
Um.

33
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,430
I'm okay.

34
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,890
But you don't look okay.

35
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,770
I feel dizzy.

36
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,050
We didn't travel by car or boat.
What made you dizzy?

37
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:07,440
Can you give me a minute?

38
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,610
Can you leave me alone
for a minute?

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,660
Senior?

40
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,120

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,930
Sorry.

49
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,430
I should have told you.

50
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,480
I thought we'd pop in and out,
that I'd be all right.

51
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,020
Did you ever look for her?

52
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,530
What's the point?
I would just bother her.

53
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,280
It was all my fault.

54
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,740
I'm sorry for not knowing.

55
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,580

this would happen?

56
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,580

No.

I'm sorry for not noticing.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,130
Would you tell me?

If you tell me about yourself,
I'd never hurt your feelings again.

64

That's because you don't
know what I'm thinking.

65
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,580
That's why you said that.

You startled me.

93
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,800
Hey, why didn't you say where
you were? You ignored my calls.

94
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,550
You made me cancel the shoot...

95
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,760
What happened to your face?

96
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,140
You expected me to show up
for a shoot like this?

97
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,230
Was it your dad?

98
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,610

99

- I got into a fight.
- Why did you?

100

- You find out and then what?
- I just want to know why.

101

102

107
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,680

look for me first anyway.

Aren't we?

122
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,290

You're home.

126
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,610
- You're still up?
- The noise you made woke me up.

127
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,780
The door is old.

128
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,780
- It makes noise no matter what.
- Ow.

132
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,760
What did she say?

133
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,600
I didn't greet her.

134
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,600
She opened a café

135

put away and don't look back.

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,340
She was just trying to avoid that.

143
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,520

144
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,730

confess their love?

152

Why do you assume
I'm good at love confessing?

153
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,390
Don't I look more like someone
who only gets confessed to?

154
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,770
I wouldn't know.

155
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,310
But you're the only one I can ask.

156
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,280
Myung-ha has no desire
for a relationship at the moment.

157
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,990
- Not at all?
- Um.

158
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,530
Not at all. Never. No way.

159
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,070
- But he's nice to me.
- That's the problem.

160
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,450
From what I've seen,
he looks after you like you're a kid.

161
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,210
Not like a younger schoolmate.
More like his little brother.

162
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,920
- Or a nephew.
- He's only one year older than me.

163

I know that,
but you two don't look that way.

there's no hope for you.

165

It's okay if he doesn't fancy me.

166
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,100
You must fancy Myung-ha a lot.

167
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,480
It's understandable.

168
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,190
- If I were you, I'd fancy him too.
- You can't.

169
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,480
I just said, "If I were you."

170
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,480

- Help me.

171

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
(Check it out now?)

182
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,550
Sang-won.

183
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,550
What are you doing?

184
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,550
You've mistaken me
for someone else.

185
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,060
Are you crying?

186
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,948
It's so embarrassing.

187
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,390
Couldn't you just walk past me?

188
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,860
I would have if you weren't
smoking in a playground.

189
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,480
Understood.

190
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,860
You're not of age.
Don't smoke yet, even if just a little.

191
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,910
It's not good for you.

192
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,530
You're so frustrating,
you know that?

193
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,040
Why were you crying?

194
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,050
Seulgi is sick.

195
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,390
What?

196
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,390
What's wrong with him?

197
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,230
Cancer.

198
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,900
You must be very sad.

199
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,070
Is Seulgi your brother?
Is he very young?

200
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,660
My grandpa.

201
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,870
My Seulgi is my grandpa.

202
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,040
Your grandpa.

203
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,630
Sang-won, I'm sorry
if I get this wrong, but...

204
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,630
Seulgi's not a person, is he?

205
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,010
He's a white poodle.

206
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,310
Twelve years old.

207
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,370
You must be worried sick

208
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,856
since he's been
with you for so long.

209
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,870
It must have shocked you.

210
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Bro,

211
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,550
I think I'm in love.

212
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,010
What?

213
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,010
For real this time.

214
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,590
It's never been real in the past?

215
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,260
If I'm being honest,

216
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,060
will you accept it?

217
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,770
Stop being weird and go home.

218
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,730
I said I was being honest.

219
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,820
I joined the track and field club.

220
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,990
You have that much free time?

221
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,441
You think I did it
because I had free time?

222
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,526
Come see after school
if you don't believe me.

223
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,660
I'm not going.

224
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,207
You don't have
morning practice today?

225
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,020
I'm on my way to school.

226
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,478
What do you sound like that?
Are you sick?

227
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,820
No, I just slept in.

228
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,190
Where are you? Home?

229
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,700
Riding a bus.

230
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,910
You're really not sick?

231
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,647
Tell me if you are. I'll go to you.

232
00:16:56,005 --> 00:16:58,515
I'm fine. I'm on my way to school.

233
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,317
I have to get there
for us to see each other.

234
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,920
You mean it?

235
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,550
I miss you, Senior.

236
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,380
I have to go to class now.

237
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,250
Let me know when you get here.

238
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,510
Watch out for cars.

239
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,010
I will.

240
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,580
Don't leave
the bottles around, please.

241
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,640
Do you still run in those races?

242
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,390
Haven't they given you prize money?

243
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,390
I don't have money.

244
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,700
When Grandma got sick,
you didn't visit her once.

245
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,870
You didn't show up
even after she died.

246
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,870
But you've come now?

247
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,040
Don't come for money
when you're broke...

248
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,630
You little piece of shit.

249
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,750
I told you not to slap my face.

250
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,840
- Are you insane?
- That's enough. That's enough!

251
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,490
Why isn't he picking up?

252
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,530
Did he get to school or not?

253
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,500
(You have a secondary mission.)

254
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,920
(Q: What's crucial to a happy life?)

255
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,340
(A: Every worry-free day.)

256
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,460
(Secondary Mission:
Saving up 3,000,000 won)

257
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,510
One, ten, hundred, thousand,
ten thousand, hundred thousand, million?

258
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,720
Are you crazy? I'm in high school.

259
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,140
Senior!

260
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,350
I'm not of age yet!

261
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,190
Orientation?

262
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,159
I have a provincial competition next month,
so I've gone to an orientation with my coach.

263
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,570
See you tomorrow.

264
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,450
(Really? Okay.
Take care. See you tomorrow.)

265
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,050
He said they'd gone
to an orientation.

266
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,050
Bro,

267
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,380
you finished your classes?

268
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,390
You did too. Weird question.

269
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,180
Uh, it's Seulgi.

270
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,508
He has to go to a hospital, but a guardian
must come too. Come with me, please.

271
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,730
- You're not a guardian?
- Huh?

272
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,030
Oh, I meant my guardian.

273
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,150
What's with you again?

274
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,820
You've been acting strange lately.

275
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,450
How am I strange?

276
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,830
My grandpa is very sick right now.

277
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,370
You brat, what's with you today?

278
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,500
Didn't you have to go to the orientation
with Yeo-woon and the coach today?

279
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,920
- Isn't that the coach?
- What?

280
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,920
The coach? Where?

281
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,130
I haven't seen him.

282
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,970
We must go now.
The hospital will close soon.

283
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,180
Really?

284
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,470
Fine. Lead the way.

285
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,230
(You have entered the Dating Zone.)

286
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,150
Hey.

287
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,150
Where's Cha Yeo-woon?

288
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,900
- Maybe he went home.
- He said he went to an orientation.

289
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,530
He must have gone home after that.

290
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,950
What are you guys up to?

291
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,350
Cheon Sang-won.

292
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,980
Do me a favor.

293
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,980
What?

294
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,110
I didn't hear...

295
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,480
What happened to your face?

296
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,990
Keep Senior Myung-ha away from me.

297
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,900
Why?

298
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,700
Just do me a favor.

299
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,040
Even though I don't know why,

300
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,450
I'll do it. It'll benefit me.

301
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,513
Something happened
to him, didn't it?

302
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Never mind.

303
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,560
Where are you going?

304
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,060
He's not picking up, right?

305
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,110
That's fine with me.

306
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,070
I'll find him
since he's Cha Yeo-woon.

307
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,740
Look at me for once.

308
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,400
You're not Cha Yeo-woon.

309
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,660
If I were pitiful like him,

310
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,410
would you accept my feelings?

311
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,580
Can you think before you speak?

312
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,862
And I'm not doing this
because I pity him.

313
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,630
Why then?

314
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,380
Or because it's me?

315
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,050
You really can't accept me?

316
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,340
No, I can't.

317
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,720
What if I wait
until you change your mind?

318
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,850
There's no way. Please stop.

319
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,720
Go date a good man.

320
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,730
You're so frustrating!

321
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,320
Until now I only ever liked girls!

322
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,700
(You have entered the Dating Zone.)

323
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,200
Cha Yeo-woon!

324
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,290
What's wrong? You said you went
to an orientation. Cheon Sang...

325
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,300
Hey, what happened?

326
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,300
It's not a big deal. You can go.

327
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,800
Just tell me what happened.

328
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,800
I'll take care of it.

329
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,680
Take care of what and how?

330
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,597
Stop treating me like a kid.
It's my business. I can handle it myself.

331
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,850
Yeo-woon,

332
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,900
don't be stubborn. Tell me.

333
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,820
- Tell me so I can understand.
- I fancy...

334
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,160
I like you.

335
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,960
You don't like me, right?

336
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,380
But that's okay.

337
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,340
I like you anyway.

Please like anyone but me.

340
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,900
I'll do what you say

341
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,570
and try to be your friend.

342
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,580
So,

343
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,580
please don't ignore me.

344
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,120
Please don't avoid me.

345
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,920

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,690
(278 days remaining)

362
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,030
But that's okay.

363
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,910
I like you anyway.

364
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,830
I gave you my love
and got your heart in return.

365
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,540
Why am I not someone
from Cha Yeo-woon's world?

366
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,390
Jeez, Tae Myung-ha.

367
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,390
You're sitting alone again.

368
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:05,730
(Secondary Mission: 3,000,000 won
(2,603,120 won))

369
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,940
You are so mean.

370
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,693
How could you ask the guy you rejected
to keep an eye on another guy for you?

371
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,290
I'm a bad man like that.

372
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,960
Hey,

373
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,670
was Cha Yeo-woon
doing okay in class today?

374
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,590
He paid attention in class.

375
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,590
And at the club?

376
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,800
He ran very hard.

377
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,550
How was his mood?

378
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,430
You're asking the wrong person.

379
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,640
He's in a bad mood
whenever he's around me.

380
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,690
Hey,

381
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,980
did the coach
or one of you guys slap him?

382
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,820
I don't know who slapped him

383
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,820
but it wasn't anyone in the club.

384
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,790
You don't suspect anyone at all?

385
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,790
The guys who always bully him?

386
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,920
Ask him yourself
if you want to know.

387
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,590
Never mind.

388
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,420
- Tell me if you get bullied, okay?
- Huh?

389
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,720
I'll tell them off for you.

390
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,770
Why does he keep working
and not eating?

391
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,650
Does he have a big debt?

392
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,150
I asked. He wouldn't answer.

393
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,480
He's working
three part-time jobs now.

394
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,240
Something wrong?

395
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,990
Oh, you want your laptop back?

396
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,990
No. We were just wondering
what you were up to.

397
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,160
Oh, writing a paper.

398
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,090
How could you write that?

399
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,760
I just did.

400
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,970
Done.

401
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,720
Si-a, I just opened
a new IG account. Follow me.

402
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,930
Why? Don't tell me...

403
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,913
I'll collect followers
and sell the account.

404
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,520
Bro, you're really
pressed for money?

405
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,650
I can lend you some.

406
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,280
- It's fine. That won't work.
- Why not?

407
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,440
Because I tried that.

408
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,530
Grandma,

409
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,860
lend me 10,000 won?

410
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,950
(Secondary Mission: 3,000,000 won
(500,000 won))

411
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,240
Here.

412
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,790
Doesn't work.

413
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,580
(Secondary Mission: 3,000,000 won
(500,000 won))

414
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,510
Kyung-hun, why are you so happy?

415
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,140
That friend abroad said
they'd visit this summer.

416
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,020
Friend my ass. It's his boyfriend.

417
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,480
I see. The friend who studies abroad
you told me about is your boyfriend.

418
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,480
Um.

419
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,770
But you're far apart.
Can you still date each other?

420
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,650
Well, I like him.

421
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,860
You've been together long?

422
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,830
I've liked him
since I was little.

423
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,830
Even when you knew he'd go abroad,
you still liked him?

424
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,500
You weren't thinking,

425
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,042
"I have to like him
because we'll break up soon"?

426
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,050
That's why I thought I had to
like him as much as I could

427
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,720
because we might not
see each other again.

428
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,650
Damn it. There's not
one won in this place.

429
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,320
What are you doing?

430
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,070
You can't take that.

431
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,530
Give it back.

432
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,910
- It's Grandma's, please!
- You're not letting go?

433
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,160
You're not letting go?!

434
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,780
Cha Yeo-woon.

435
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,040
You'll cut your hand.

436
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,460
What are you doing here?

437
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,090
Yeo-woon.

438
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,170
Cha Yeo-woon.

439
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,010
Buy this for 500 won.

440
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:53,970
Buy it.

441
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,230
(Secondary Mission: 3,000,000 won
(2,999,500 won))

442
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,900
(Secondary Mission: 3,000,000 won
(3,000,000 won))

443
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,940
(Secondary Mission Accomplished)

444
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,570
(You'll learn what currently
makes Cha Yeo-woon the saddest.)

445
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,110
(Check it out now?)

446
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,740
What's wrong with you?!

447
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,620
I told you not to slap my face.

448
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,330
I wish I could run away.

449
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,510
What would you do, Senior?

450
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,440
Cha Yeo-woon,

451
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,230
- if you're pressed for money...
- Senior.

452
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,610
I asked because
I thought you were struggling,

453
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,860
not because I pitied you.

454
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,160
I know that
you're nice to everyone.

455
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,363
But I don't wanna be
nice to anyone.

456
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,050
I'm going in.
