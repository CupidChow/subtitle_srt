It's my turn!

Why are you asking me for a chance?

43
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,958
Vincent goes straight to Gemma himself.

44
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,961
Miss Li, that's exactly my point.

00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:53,298
That guy with the mustache
always has the opportunities,

46
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,301

Remember what we talked about before?

50

I said next time,
I hope the fight is fair.

Remember?

52
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,231
- We agreed that, Miss Li.
- Yeah, but…

53
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,110

really like Gemma anymore.

- [quirky music continues]
- Miss Li, what are you saying?

55
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,825
Would I be this upset
if Gemma wasn't in my heart?

56
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,911
You take that.

57
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,914
Because if you really love Gemma,

58
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,041
then you should be
putting in extra effort.

Okay, let's just do this.

No.

187
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,865
Why?

188
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:45,413
Be-Because the mother duck accepted

189
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,125
her child, even though it was different.

190
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,922
[Patpat] <i>I hope all adults</i>
<i>learn how to accept the younger ones.</i>

191
00:11:55,506 --> 00:12:00,136
<i>So that those without a mom,</i>
<i>or dad, or relatives</i>

192
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,763
<i>won't be sad for being alone.</i>

193
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,140
You're here.

194
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,477
[Matmat] Careful, Mia, you might fall.

195
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,647
[Patrick] Matmat is right.

196
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,941
Mia, look.

197
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:23,492
[sentimental music playing]

198
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,582
Let's go inside.

199
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,254
[Mia, Matmat giggling]

200
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,215
[Mia] Thank you, Matmat.

201
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,758
[Matmat] You're welcome, Mia.

202
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:45,723

00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:59,361

[haunting tone, whispers]

206
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,821
- Morning!
- [Matmat] It's not good when it's burnt.

207
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,784
What happened here?

208
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,788
T-The bread is burnt. The food is burnt.

209
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:54,041
You told me it's important
to have breakfast before work.

210
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,627
So here, I prepared breakfast.

211
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,922
You should have
woken me up so I could cook.

212
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,591
I tried to wake you up, Patpat.

213
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,177
But you wouldn't wake up.

214
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,680
- I didn't wake up?
- No.

215
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,223
Even I tried to wake you up.

216
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,809
I even shouted at you,
but you were so out of it.

217
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,729
You slapped Patpat.

218
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,942
Next time, don't slap. That's bad.

219
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,861
I just did it to wake him up.

220
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,699
Did you have a beautiful dream?

221
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,617
That's why you wouldn't wake up?

222
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,454
[playful music playing]

223
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,957
Matmat, I'll cook. What do you want?

224
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,462
P-People in books should have names.

225
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,547
Okay.

226
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:46,051
The Masked Boy, Mister Box,

227
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:50,139
and the Princess Without Feelings.

228
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,266
[Matmat] T-That's not what I mean.

229
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,394
Matthew Gonzales, Mia Hernandez…

230
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,062
Names like that.

231
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,440
[huffs] I don't like that.
It's too predictable.

232
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,026
In all my books,
the characters don't have names.

233
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:05,988
No Edgar, no Richard, no Satsat…

234
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,448
No names.

235
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,826
But if they're people,
they should have names.

236
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,037
Mia! Matmat!

237
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:14,914
What do you want to eat?

238
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,167
M-Matmat is full, Patpat.

239
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,251
No, I'm okay.

240
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,879
Alright.

241
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,172
I'll just eat outside.

242
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,633
Matmat, do you want some <i>batchoy?</i>

243
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,801
Matmat, I'm the writer,

244
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,262
so you should listen to me when I say

245
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,889
they don't have names.

246
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,642
I'm your older brother,
so you listen to me.

247
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,936
[Patrick] Okay, I'll go take a shower.

248
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,437
Just message me if you need anything.

249
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,189
Matmat, you have a session later.

250
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,191
I-I'll go see the doctor this afternoon.

251
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,026
I won't forget.

252
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,570
Matmat, happy day?

253
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,324
[chuckles excitedly] H-Happy day!

254
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,533
[bright music playing]

255
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,785
- Happy day!
- Happy day!

256
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,286
Happy day!

257
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,915
It's a happy day if Mia listens.

258
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,209
I-I'm your older brother.

259
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,879
You're my older brother,
but you should listen to me

260
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,590
because I'm being very objective here.

261
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,926
They shouldn't have names, Matmat.

262
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,220
T-That's not good.

263
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,889
I've been writing for a long time,
so listen to me.

264
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,767
Yes, I will be there.

265
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,685
Okay, I'll see you.

266
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,811
Okay, bye.

267
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,439
Madeth! Madeth!

268
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,900
Come here, come to me!

269
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,362
The fruit of my labor
is finally happening!

270
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,197
Hey, Boss V!

271
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,449
The fruit of "our" labor
are finally paying off!

272
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,702
- I'm part of this, too!
- Right, right.

273
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,578
The fruits of our labor.

274
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,997
Because you'll be working.

275
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,957
What kind of work, Boss V?

276
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,500
Mia has a new endorsement!

277
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,211
- Endorsement!
- Hey, good news! [claps]

278
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,462
What endorsement?

279
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,505
[Vincent] A cellphone.

280
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,758
They saw Mia's post
that she's writing a new book,

281
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,969
and they want to be part of it.

282
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,221
- Cellphone?
- Mm-hmm.

283
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,765
Boss V, is that with Miss Erica?

284
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,434
Yes, it's her.

285
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,977
- She's the one I talked to.
- Oh!

286
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,645
Mm-hmm.

287
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,024
And as early as now,
she wants Mia to post

288
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,444
about a day in the life of a writer,
using their latest phone.

289
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,114
Hey, I like that, Boss V! [clapping]

290
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,782
When do we start work?

291
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,367
- Today.
- Today?

292
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:19,455
Go to their merchant
and pick up the cellphone

293
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,123
so you and Mia can shoot today.

294
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,167
Oh, Miss Erica!

295
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,087
Gemma, I hope it's okay
that I head back to Manila.

296
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,465
I'll message you.

297
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,593
That's your job.
Go ahead. Take care of it.

298
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,261
[soft music playing]

299
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,638
Miss Li, I'll book my ticket now, okay?

300
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,307
I won't be able to go with you.

301
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,684
Alright, I'll prepare something
for you to take on the plane.

302
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,603
- Okay, thank you.
- Take care, Boss V!

303
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,439
- Do what I told you.
- I got this, Boss V!

304
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,149
Ooh!

305
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,734
This is it. This is really it!

306
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,819
Back to work! This is it!

307
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,155
Looks like a special client, huh?

308
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,783
Vincent's really going back to Manila?

309
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,036
Oh yes, Gemma, it's very special.

310
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,246
Because aside from
it being Mia's first time

311
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,502
endorsing a cellphone,
the client is special, too.

312
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,089
You see, Miss Erica has
known Boss V for a long time.

313
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,674
- She's his ex.
- His ex?

314
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,177
- Yes, Nanay.
- Why did they break up?

315
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,345
When?

316
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,430
Ma.

317
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,390
Oh.

318
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,059
I'm just curious, dear.

319
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,895
You know me, I'm a responsible gossip…

320
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:29,191
- [uneasy music playing]
- "CARESS THE SHADOW"

321
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,820
[Olivia] "In every moment,

322
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:38,784
time will water the hope that at last,

323
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:44,248
our hearts will finally be together."

324
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:53,090
It's different when you
read poetry from before to now.

325
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,636
It's different if you read it here

326
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,429
or at the mansion.

327
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,181
[tense music sting]

328
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,724
I hope…

329
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,310
you and I can be
together at the mansion.

330
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:11,441
[unsettling music continues]

331
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,321
Here you are again.

332
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,575
You only come to see me
when you need something.

333
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,828
You said I can visit
when I have nothing to do?

334
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,122
Of course, because
your number one and two aren't here.

335
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,334
I know I'm only your number three.

336
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,253
[Patrick] You're being dramatic again.

337
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,674
Actually,

338
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,468
what if you help me out today?

339
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,054
- Huh?
- Look at those two.

340
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,851
You're making me work on my day off?

341
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,645
It's okay. Come on, same old…

342
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,522
[Jason] Hello, ladies!

343
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,900
[chuckles] Welcome to Jason's <i>Inasal.</i>

344
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,985
What would you like to order today?

345
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,278
Um…

346
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,905
We'll have whatever he orders.

347
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,199
Oh. [chuckles]

348
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,825
What's your order, bro?

349
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,036
Just offer them your best seller.

350
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,413
Double chicken breast with heart, ma'am.

351
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,040
- Let me write that down.
- Just chicken breast.

352
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,209
I don't want it with heart.

353
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,044
Okay. Then give us the
chicken breast, please.

354
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,254
[chuckles] Okay. How many orders?

355
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,923
Oh, one, two

356
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,050
Okay. One, two. [chuckles]

357
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,468
Okay. Coming right up.

358
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,762
Help me out here, man.

[quirky music playing]

360
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,517
Hello!

361
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,478
Are you alone?

362
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,064

that will give us inspiration.

Hmm…

00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,840

"Inspiration exists,

448
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,178
but it has to find you working."

449
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,057

I want published the most.

Why is that?

458

Because inspired by the three of us.
You, Matmat, and me.

459
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,792
Do it because the story is beautiful,

460
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,252
not because of us.

461
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:09,090

that I won't pay you

474
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,885

a butterfly in your mural?

the people around us.

494
