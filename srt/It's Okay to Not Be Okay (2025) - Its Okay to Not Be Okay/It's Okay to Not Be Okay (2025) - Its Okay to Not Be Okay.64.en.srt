How come Matmat
isn't joining our meeting?

It's for a new endorsement.
And…[clears throat]

Wrong? What's-- There's nothing wrong.

51

There's nothing
wrong with the endorsement.

00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,560
You're like a
seven-year-old kid in a toy store

whenever I get a new endorsement.

54

You can't stop talking about it.

55

And I'm talking about it now.

Vincent, you know me.

Do not lie to me.

Mia, please!
I'm taking you to the airport!

64
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,920
I'm taking you back to Manila,
away from here!

65
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,297
Away from here? Why?

66
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,049
Because of my mom?

67
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,051
Vincent, I'm not afraid of her.

68
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,595
Mia, your life's in danger.
She killed Ma'am Olivia.

to take you away from here!

My mother?

72
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,311
I don't know!

73
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,022
How about Matmat?

74
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,190
Where are they?

75
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,276
I will not leave without them!

76
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,529
Patrick said he'd pick
up Matmat at the mansion.

77
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,571
- That's it.
- No.

78
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,031
- No--Mia!
- Go back!

79
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,450
- I don't know Patrick's plan!
- I said, turn around!

80
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,493
Mia, stop it!

81
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,704
- I said, turn around!
- I don't know his plan!

82
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,330
He asked me to take you somewhere!

83
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,041
- He'll take care of Matmat!
- You're ganging up on me!

84
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,544
Of course not!
We're trying to protect you!

85
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,004
Mia, stop it!

86
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,215
Turn around, or else…

87
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,508
No! No!

Fine.

I'll give you three options.

First, leave.

171
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,037
Never show your faces around Mia again.

172
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,914
Get far away from her.

173
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,042
- Just leave my daughter alone.
- We won't leave Mia.

Option two…

[uneasy music continues]

176
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,173

Not only will
you avenge your mother's death,

179
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:01,934
but once Mia sees me dead,
she'll be so broken

180
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,728
that she'll go back to her old self.

00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,111
[uneasy music continues]

184
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,451
I'm doing neither of those.

185
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,578
Mia and I have accepted our pasts.

186
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,912
So leave her alone!

187
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,916
Then that leaves us
with option number three.

188
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,462
Die!

189
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,213
[ominous music sting]

190
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,382
You and your brother die!

191
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,303
Hmm?

192
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:41,432
But, aw, wait, wait, wait, wait.

193
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:46,646
That is just way too easy, no?

194
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,148
- Like where's the fun in that?
- [foreboding music playing]

195
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,108
Fun?

196
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,735
You think it's fun to kill people?

197
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,195
Well, it might as well be!

198
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,949
Is it better than to worry
about you getting in my way?

199
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,409
Yes!

200
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,913
The both of you are
ruining my daughter's life!

201
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,750
How is that possible
when all we've done is love Mia?

202
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,877
Who said you could do that?!

203
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,421
Who said that?!

204
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,716
Stupid.

205
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,926
Stupid!

206
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,806
You and your mother are both stupid!

207
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,810
[foreboding music continues]

208
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,437
Oh, that's an idea.

209
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,108
Ooh… [chuckles] Bright!

210
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,401
What if…

211
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,030
I do to you,

212
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,617
what I did to your mother?

213
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,245
Hmm?

214
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,289
Hmm…

215
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,376
What did you do to Mama? Huh?

216
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,089
[unsettling music playing]

217
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,007
You don't know?

218
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,593
Your mother died…

219
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,680
because of Mia.

220
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,349
Aw…

221
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,524
[young Samuel] I want
to send Mia to a writing camp.

222
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,403
Or any other workshop she wants.

223
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,989
What for?

224
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,160
[Young Samuel] So she'll meet new people?

225
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,786
Make new playmates?

226
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,746
New friends.

227
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:33,377
Her teacher said she's not
close with any of her classmates.

228
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,922
If Mia can't make friends at school,

229
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,551
what makes you think she will elsewhere?

230
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,929
A new place equals new people.

231
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,308
What matters is
we expose Mia to new things.

232
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,143
We also need
to get her assessed by a doctor--

233
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,521
There's nothing wrong, with my child.

234
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,940
[knocking]

235
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,235
[Tessie] Good afternoon.

236
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,572
Sir Samuel, I'm done cleaning.

237
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,823
Ah, yes.

238
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,575
Uh, Ingrid?

239
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,121
This is Tessie, our new housekeeper.

240
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,499
She won't be staying with us.

241
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,627
Good afternoon, ma'am.

242
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,338
[tense music playing]

243
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,760
[young Samuel] Um, Tessie,

244
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:27,097
Could you make Mia
a snack for after school?

245
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,058
You can go home after you're done.

246
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,768
[Tessie] Thank you, sir.

247
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:35,272
[morose music playing]

248
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,452
[Tessie] Mia, are you okay?

249
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,749
Oh, what's that?

250
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:58,045
[unsettling music playing]

251
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,631
- Oh…
- No!

252
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,883
Leave it alone.

253
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,095
The poor thing could still be alive.

254
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,515
Its wing is hurt, it won't be able to fly.

255
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,892
Just let it die.

256
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,644
Mia!

257
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,357
Or I can end its suffering.

258
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,028
Mia, my dear<i>,</i>

259
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,156
every creature's life is important.

260
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,826
Why do you want to kill it?

261
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,620
[unsettling music continues]

262
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,039
[car door closes, opens]

263
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,000
[car door closes]

264
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,129
Mia?

265
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,424
Sir…Good day, sir.

266
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:48,429
[unsettling music continues]

267
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,770
Uh, Mia? Sweetie?

268
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,064
Go inside, dear.

269
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,866
I'm sorry if my
daughter comes across as strange.

270
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,703
Sir, if you don't mind me asking,

271
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,705
is Mia a special child?

272
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,250
I want to have
her checked by a specialist,

273
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,710
but Ingrid doesn't want to.

274
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,963
I think Mia and my
youngest son are the same age.

275
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,924
If it's okay with you,

276
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,801
I can bring my kids
here to play with Mia.

277
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,721
[unsettling music continues

278
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,224
Thank you, Tessie.

279
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,523
- Could you give me a hand?
- Oh, yes, sir.

280
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,279
[unsettling music continues]

281
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,825
You can take these
extra crops for your kids.

282
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,661
Sir, this is too much.

283
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,329
But, thank you.

284
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:58,123
[tense music sting]

285
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,169
[Tessie] Sorry I took so long.

286
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,546
- [young Matmat grunts]
- It took forever…

287
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,882
to clean the room of my boss's daughter.

288
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:12,096
- [Tessie] Let's go, Patpat.
- [young Matmat mumbles]

289

[tense music swells]

290
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,150
[Tessie] Watch your step.

291
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,819
[young Matmat] Yes, Mama!

292
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,070
[young Patpat] Mama!

293
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,657
Go ahead, I'll catch up later.

294
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,828
Alright, don't take long.

295
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,789
Don't take long, Patpat! Don't take long!

296
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,541
Come on. Be careful.

297
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,875
P-Patpat!

[ominous music continues]

301
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,776
[Ingrid] Your children left you.

302
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,196
Ma'am Ingrid.

303
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,865
What are you doing out here?

304
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,325
[young Ingrid inhales, exhales sharply]

305
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,244
I just want to talk to you.

306
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,620
What?

307
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,705
Why?

308
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,959
How long have you been
fooling around with my husband?

309
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,546
Ma'am, what are you saying?

310
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,006
- Don't lie!
- Ouch!

311
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,466
You are Samuel's mistress!

312
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,884
No, I am not!

313
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,844
He gave you fruits.

314
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:38,223
That means you get all the extra crops!

315
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,226
Ma'am, that was only one time.
Please let me go.

316
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,728
You're the one he's hiding in that hut?

317
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,688
No, ma'am!

318
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:50,152
He wants Mia to be
friends with your sons?

319
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,862
Ma'am, no, it's not--

320
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,282
Your dirty, filthy boys

321
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,868
with my precious baby girl?

322
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,621
Ma'am, I'm not having
relationship with Sir Samuel!

323
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,164
I'm telling the truth!

324
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,333
- Please let me go--
- I hate it…

325
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,795
when someone takes away what's mine!

326
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,171
[Tessie] Ma'am, please stop!

327
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,090
[ominous music continues]

328
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,299
Mama?

Mama!

00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,429
Mama!

00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,224
[Matmat] Mama!

332
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,684
- Ma'am, ma'am…
- Mama!

333
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,645
I'm begging you.

334
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,980
Please don't hurt my son.

335
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,066
Are you going to confess,

336
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,776
or do you want me to hurt him?

337
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,278
Ma'am, please don't hurt my son.

338
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,447
- I'm begging you!
- [Matmat] Mama?

339
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,282
- Last chance!
- Ma'am!

340
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,952
- Please don't hurt my son.
- Are you…

341
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,247
the woman my husband is seeing?

342
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,417
Ma'am, please don't hurt my son!

[Tessie] M-Matmat…

347
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,609
[Ingrid] That's what you deserve…

348
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,654
…for meddling with my daughter.

349
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,200
Especially for
trying to steal my husband!

[Ingrid] Did you see what happened?

Mm-hmm.

[ominous music continues]

360
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,105
[Ingrid] You will not tell anyone.

361
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,773
Okay?

362
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,941
Mm-hmm.

363
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,613
If I find out…

364
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,365
