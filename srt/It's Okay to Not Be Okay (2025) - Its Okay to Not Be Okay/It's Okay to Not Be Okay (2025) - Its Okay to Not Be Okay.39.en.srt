- [tense music continues]
- [sighs sharply]

182
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,535
I'm warning you, Olivia.

183
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,414
I told you,

184
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,668
I see everything.

185
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,296
You can't hide anything from me. Hmm?

186
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,676
[tense music continues]

187
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,682
[tense music crescendos]

188
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,397
- I got it.
- Kai…

189
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,026
Kai, at least you got
to see Bella for one night.

190
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:39,240
And you were able to stay sober!

191
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,202
It was hard to resist, Mister Tommy.

192
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:47,832
Mia left the liquor she bought outside.

193
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,209
- [Tommy] Mia? Mia?
- [playful music playing]

194
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,628
Mia was with you and Patrick?

195
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,963
[Kai] Yes.

196
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,674
And she was supportive of Bella and me.

197
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,677
She didn't mind me
and Bella sharing a room,

198
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,762
her and Patrick shared one too.

199
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,766
Then she gave us money
before we left in the morning.

200
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,103
And you know like
when they're here at the hospital,

201
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,521
they don't seem like a good fit?

202
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,773
- Oh?
- But out there,

203
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,776
Mister Tommy, they had a spark!

204
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,736
[Tommy chuckles]

205
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,572
- A spark?
- [Tommy] Really?

206
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,658
You should've seen them! [chuckles]

[playful music continues]

208
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,706
I'm telling everyone! They have a spark?

213

Have you been here long, Patpat?

214
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,394
[chuckles softly]
I just got here, Matmat.

215
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,147
Hmm…

216
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,775
Why didn't you tell me
you were home already?

217
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:01,155
Why didn't you call? Matmat called you…

218

[unsettling music continues]

219
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,075

[unsettling music fades]

221
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,583
Sorry, Matmat, my phone's got no charge.

222
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,792
Hmm?

223
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,254
Didn't… Didn't
you get to charge your phone?

224
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,256
Where you were?

225
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,259
I forgot to.

226
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,221
Nobody,

227
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,973
Nobody reminded you to charge your phone?

[pensive music playing]

229
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,895
[Matmat] Go home now.

230
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,481
You're suspended,
so you shouldn't be here.

231
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,983
Matmat's here because he has work.

232
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,026
I'll help you.

233
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,278
Matmat can do this, it's his work.

234
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,905
Matmat doesn't need your help.

- What?
- I have something to tell you.

240
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,535
Pogi.

241
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,997
- Don't bother if it isn't about work--
- Just hear me out. This one's juicy.

242
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,499
It's about Patrick and Miss Mia.

243
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,169
- Really? What is it? Come on, spill.
- [mischievous music playing]

244
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,256
- I overheard Kai…
- [Tommy] <i>They stayed overnight there, too?</i>

245
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,425
[Kai] <i>They were so sweet</i>
<i>with each other, Mister Tommy.</i>

246
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:49,763
[Tommy] <i>Miss Mia and</i>
<i>Patrick shared a room together?</i>

247
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,559
<i>Sounds like a married couple.</i>
<i>Maybe they were honeymooning, too.</i>

248
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,770
[Kai] <i>I wouldn't be surprised</i>
<i>if they were to get married soon.</i>

Miss Mia's his girlfriend!

252

Miss Mia!

253
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,488
He's dating Mia?

254
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,742
I'm not sure about that.
But according to Kai,

255
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,494
Patrick and Mia stayed overnight, too,

256
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,371
in the same place he and Bella stayed.

257
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,415
They stayed together in one room.

258
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:17,958
Really?

259
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,377
- Maybe Kai just assumed.
- [mischievous music ends]

260
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,171
Doc, just think about it.

261
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,174
Would you share a room
with a girl who's not your girlfriend?

262
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,092
So…

263
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,763
Patrick was with Mia in Montanesa
when Kai and Bella were there?

264
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,348
Exactly.

Why didn't you tell me Matmat's here?

274
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,949
How would I know!
You're the one itching to spill.

275
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,951
You didn't even check
if anyone else was around.

[exhales, clicks tongue]

277

Mm, no.

We never been in a camping van.

286
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,996
Maybe it's his dream,

287
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,956
to travel with you.

288
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,586
Or maybe that's Mia.

289
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,131
Oh, no.

290
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,762
Well, your overnight stay with Mia
doesn't really count as travel--

291
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,430
- Mia and I weren't together.
- [pail clatters]

292
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,223
Liar.

You're lying again.

294
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,652

296
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,323
You were with Mia.

You're a liar!

303
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,184
[sobbing] Why do always you lie?

304
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,771
When Mia came to the apartment,

305
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,107
you lied about that too!
[breathing heavily]

You want to be with Miss Mia.

[somber music continues]

398
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,731
<i>People like him shut</i>
<i>themselves off from the world</i>

399
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,859
<i>when they feel</i>
<i>emotions they can't explain.</i>

<i>Talk to your brothers</i>
<i>so they can make up.</i>

401
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,158
<i>He first needs to forgive himself.</i>

402
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,368

404
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,413
<i>You didn't expect</i>
<i>your brother would be angry?</i>

405
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,957
<i>It's just your usual</i>
<i>fight between siblings.</i>

406
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,710
<i>Don't belittle misunderstandings.</i>

407
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,713
<i>It could cost a life.</i>
