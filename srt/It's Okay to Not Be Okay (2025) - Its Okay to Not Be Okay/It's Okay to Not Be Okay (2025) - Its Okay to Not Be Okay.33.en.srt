00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,336
Miss Mia, I'm sorry about last night.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,550
Because I hit you with
a pillow and pulled your hair.

3
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:11,428
I'm sorry, too. Because I also hurt you.

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,930
You can keep Satsat.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,642
But that's the last thing
you can take from Matmat.

6
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,144
- Okay?
- [Mia] Okay.

7
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:19,978
Welcome back!

8
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:23,064
I thought you wouldn't
want to teach here again.

9
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,567
I heard the patients love my stories.

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,943
I thought you only agreed

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,654
because you found out
Patrick had requested it.

12
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,407
He requested for me to come back.

13
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,993
Hey! That's sweet.

14
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,119
Do you know who left this?

15
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,120
There's two possibilities.

16
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,998
Either they're into you
or they've got beef with you.

17
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:47,255
[theme music playing]

18
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,054
[Kai] Why? What's going on?

19
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,391
[Patrick] Is this a bribe?

20
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:46,356
Hey, Ma'am Eden might see it.
It's not allowed for patients.

21
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,067
I just snuck it in for your locker.

22
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,611
You're not supposed to sneak that in.

23
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,906
Why do other rooms get snacks?
Can't I have any?

24
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,117
Kai, don't change the subject.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,619
- That piaya--
- Fine, bro.

26
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:01,871
Err.

27
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,458
I only did it to make it up to you…

28
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:10,713
since you haven't yet told
Doc about me and Bella.

29
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,968
I'm still thinking about it.

30
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,598
Come on, don't tell him.

31
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:26,437
Bella and I decided
to just get better first.

32
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,567
And when we get out, we'll be together.

33
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,486
Really? What if I catch you again?

34
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,574
I'm trying…

35
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,617
[acknowledging smirk]

36
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,078
but it's hard.

37
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,748
I really fell for her.

38
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,877
You know?
No matter how hard I try to focus,

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,005
her face is always on my mind.

Even if I tell myself to stay away…

00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:02,181
Get out! She'll kill you!

43
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,643
- Mia, you're just dreaming!
- Get out now!

44
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,146
I'm here. I'm not leaving, okay?

Uh…

48
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,365
I'd run away with you.

49
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,078
Just say when and I'll drop everything.

52
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,976
[Kai] Just one look from her…

53
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,607
and you're already affected.

that you shouldn't follow your heart.

But what can you do?

58

When your head…

59

["Being With You" fades]

67
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,710
Everyone knows "Beauty and the Beast"
as a classic romantic love story.

68
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,504
Well, I'm sorry to burst your bubble.

69
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,425
For me, it's Stockholm syndrome.

70
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,802
What's Stockholm syndrome?

71
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,929
Stockholm syndrome…

72
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,601
Imagine a kidnapper and his victim.

73
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,189
Usually, the victim hates the kidnapper--

74
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,442
Because she was taken by force.

75
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,444
And the kidnapper could hurt her.

76
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,862
Correct.

77
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,156
But with Stockholm syndrome,

78
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,909
the kidnapper acts kind,

79
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,205
is caring, talks to you.

80
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,167
He wins over the victim,

81
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,755
until the victim's view
of the kidnapper changes.

82
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,799
Same with the Beast.

83
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:56,564
Huh? The Beast wasn't a kidnapper.

84
00:05:56,647 --> 00:06:02,945
He locked Beauty in the palace
in exchange for her father's freedom.

85
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,907
Then he ordered
her around and yelled at her.

86
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,827
That's a beast for you.

87
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,329
[Tommy] Mm-hmm.

88
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,040
But Belle wondered

89
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,376
- about the Beast…
- ["Being With You" instrumental resumes]

90
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,213
When he's alone, he's gentle.

91

"What if he's just lonely?"

92
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,513
"What if I love him?
Maybe I can change him."

93
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,432
That's how she got trapped.

94
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,059
That's the wrong mindset.

95
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:38,439
Her brain tricked her
into thinking that it's love.

96
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:45,113
But truth is, she was in survival mode.

97
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,783
That's Stockholm syndrome.

98
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,992
Exactly.

when recommending
someone for the manager position.

And Olivia, I only agreed to this turnover

184

because I want
the best outcome for Samuel.

Him?

We were informed that another nurse,

will be in charge of Mister Samuel
instead of Nurse Eden from now on.

- Well, how have you been?
- [Tommy] Doc.

283
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,321
Doc, is it really okay for
Bella to meet her ex boyfriend?

284
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,490
She agreed to meet him.

285
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,118
[Cynthia] But didn't he used to abuse her?

286
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,578
She shouldn't meet him again.

287
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:28,125
So, he's the reason
Bella's traumatized and staying here now.

288
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,376
You're right, Mister Tommy.

289
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,628
Bella should file
a restraining order against him

290
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,088
so he can't get near her again.

291
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,966
But, Cynthia,

292
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:40,220
It's not easy to cut off
someone whom you thought

293
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,139
really loved you.

294
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,434
Bella's parents been working
abroad ever since she was young.

295
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,188
She lived with her ex-boyfriend
because she thought

296
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,815
he could be her family.

297
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,651
Someone who'd always be there for her.

298
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,989
Jerome, I'll never believe you again.

299
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,952
Bella.

300
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,164
Bella, don't walk out on me.

301
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,084
Bella!

302
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,047
[Jerome] Bella!

303
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,341
[Bella] Can you leave? There's nothing
we need to talk about anymore!

304
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,800
[Jerome] Come on, Bella!

305
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,385
- Leave--
- You're coming with me!

306
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,346
- Ow!
- We're going home, okay?!

307
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,472
It hurts…

308
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,141
[Jerome] Does your family
think they can keep you from me?

309
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,019
At least my family doesn't hurt me.

310
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,438
[huffs] How are they going to hurt you?

311
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,981
When they live so far away!

312
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,400
Why is it my fault?

313
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,277
And tell me.

314
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,529
Tell me why we always reach the point

315
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,115
- of hurting each other!
- Jerome, stop it!

316
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,450
[Jerome] You're the problem!

317
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,868
It's your fault…

318
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,119
- Whatever--
- for making me angry!

319
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,455
Whatever you say,
I'm not coming back to you!

320
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,332
Don't you understand that, huh?!

321
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,295
Looks like you've gotten braver!

322
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,922
Why? You have a new boyfriend now?!

323
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,091

only insecure men, hurt women.

331
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,534
Stay out of our business.

332
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,245
I want to know what you're insecure about.

333
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,206
Is it because that thing

334
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,500
in your pants is small?

[foreboding music continues]

336
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,046

so I don't have a choice…

00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,612
I'm sorry. Am I
the reason you lost your job?

364
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,614
You really did it for Mia.

365
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,784
You said you'll leave everything behind

366
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,495
if I ask you to run away with me.

367
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,496
You mean…

368
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,414
Shall we run away?

369
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,000
We can't spend the night out.
I'm worried about Matmat.

370
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,168
What?

371
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,671
- Mia, what are you doing?
- I'll drive us off the road!

372
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,214
Mia!
