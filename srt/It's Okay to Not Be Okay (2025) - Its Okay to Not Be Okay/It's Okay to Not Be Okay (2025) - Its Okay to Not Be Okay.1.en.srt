1
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,577
<i>In the middle of the forest,</i>

2
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,539
<i>a princess lives in a castle.</i>

3
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,878
<i>She feels lonely</i>

4
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,755
<i>because she's always alone.</i>

5
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,888
<i>So one day,</i>

6
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,808
<i>the princess left went out of the castle</i>

7
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,310
<i>to make friends with the other kids.</i>

8
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,192
<i>She tried to play with the other kids.</i>

9
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,200
<i>But they all rejected her.</i>

10
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,869
<i>And because of that,</i>

11
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,914
<i>the princess' twin would come out.</i>

12
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,042
<i>The shadow of darkness.</i>

13
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,089
<i>The princess was furious.</i>

14
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,509
<i>She threw a rock at anything she sees.</i>

15
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,968
<i>In the farm.</i>

16
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,012
<i>In the forest.</i>

17
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,933
<i>As the princess kept throwing rocks,</i>

18
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,520
<i>she didn't expect</i>
<i>to hit something in the river.</i>

19
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,451
<i>A boy.</i>

20
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,584
<i>The princess unknowingly saved the boy.</i>

21
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,761
<i>Because of this,</i>

22
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:21,516
<i>the shadow of darkness</i>
<i>looming over the princess would disappear.</i>

23
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,353
<i>And it seemed like</i>
<i>the boy replaced the shadow</i>

24
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,021
<i>that kept following the princess.</i>

25
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,108
<i>No matter where they go...</i>

26
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,739
<i>even under</i>
<i>the scorching heat of the sun...</i>

27
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,077
<i>or when the rain unexpectedly comes...</i>

28
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,998
<i>...their footsteps are</i>
<i>always next to each other.</i>

29
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,856
<i>The princess was alone again.</i>

30
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,943
<i>The shadow of darkness would return.</i>

31
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,366
<i>And it would whisper...</i>

32
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,540
<i>Don't you ever forget.</i>

33
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,960
<i>No one will ever love you</i>

34
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,837
<i>because you're different.</i>

35
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,258
<i>Someone like you</i>
<i>doesn't deserve to be loved.</i>

36
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,385
<i>A monster.</i>

37
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,596
Yes, Mama.

38
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:48,478
"THE PRINCESS
AND THE SHADOW OF DARKNESS"

39
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,938
If you need anything, just come inside.

40
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,275
- Thank you.
- I'll be here.

41
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,177
- Matmat! Matmat!
- They're here!

42
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,887
- Matmat!
- They're here, Patpat!

43
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,848
- They're here! They're here!
- Matmat!

44
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,850
The butterflies!

45
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,144
- The butterflies are here!
- Matmat!

46
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,603
- They're coming, Patpat!
- Matmat!

47
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,480
Patpat, the butterflies!

48
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,191
Are you awake?

49
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,860
Patpat, wake up.

50
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,612
Patpat, wake up.

51
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,867
Wake up.
Matmat and Patpat are going to be late.

52
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,077
Wake up.

53
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,913
Matmat and Patpat are going to be late.

54
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,374
Wake up, Patpat.

55
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,376
Matmat and Patpat are going to be late.

56
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,586
Wake up.

57
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,796
- Wake up.
- Happy day?

58
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,884
- Ha... Happy day!
- Happy day!

59
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,385
Happy day.

60
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,595
Come on.

61
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,806
You should take a bath, Matmat.

62
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,059
I will make us breakfast.

63
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,442
Matmat... Matmat and
Patpat are going to be late.

64
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,903
- I need to get ready.
- Matmat.

65
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,613
Matmat, wait. Hold on!

66
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,615
Matmat is going to get dressed.

67
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,660
Yes, but I need
to put a towel on your back.

68
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,413
So you won't get sweaty.

69
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,165
There we go.

70
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,458
Alright.

71
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,584
Where's your jacket?

72
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,004
- There.
- T-tu...

73
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,964
- Tuck it in.
- I'll tuck it in.

74
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,427
Let me fix it, Matmat.

75
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,976
Your packed lunch is in your bag.

76
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,647
Matmat will have
chicken <i>adobo </i>and tomatoes.

77
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,817
Later, call me at--

78
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,155
Matmat has 30 minutes to eat,

79
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,367
and 25 minutes to talk to Patpat.

80
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,327
Huh? Why is it five minutes short?

81
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,579
Mat... Matmat needs to use the restroom

82
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,623
before going back to work.

83
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,209
Matmat will call Patpat.

84
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,294
Patpat is persistent.
He's persistent.

85
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,255
Matmat, have a happy day, okay?

86
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,636
Go to work.

87
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,434
You're going to be late.
You're going to be late.

88
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,996
- This is done.
- Arrange all of it.

89
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,042
Matmat, are you done with these?

90
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,044
- Yes. Matmat is done.
- I'll take these then.

91
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,338
Okay. I'll take these with me.

92
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,432
Butterflies!

93
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,590
Seems like the rainy season is here.

94
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,259
The butterflies are
starting to seek shelter.

95
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,641
Butterflies! No! Matmat hates butterflies!

96
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,893
- What happened?
- Matmat hates butterflies!

97
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,645
Butterflies! Aah!

98
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,355
- I hate butterflies!
- Matmat, are you okay?

99
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,940
I hate butterflies!

100
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,525
I hate butterflies!

101
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,070
- I hate butterflies!
- What happened?

102
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,197
What's happening to him?

103
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,115
I hate butterflies!

104
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,618
Matmat.

105
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,453
Don't touch my head! Don't touch my head!

106
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,086
He's bleeding.

107
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:36,284
can we ask for your autograph
and a photo with my daughter?

108
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,497
Your books are her favorites.

109
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,499
- What's your name?
- Miss Mia, I'm so sorry.

110
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,334
- Ma'am, you can't--
- It's okay, Cecil.

111
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,670
Go, dear.

112
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,607
Miss Mia is so pretty!

113
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,359
She's like a princess from a fairytale!

114
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,911
You're so pretty in person!

115
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,882
Come. Let's take a picture.

116
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,893
"Like a princess".

117
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,562
Is that what your mommy tells you?

118
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,609
I guess you're not really a fan.

119
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,570
Because if you really were my fan,

120
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,658
you'd know who's
the prettiest in all my stories.

121
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,078
What?

122
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,213
Princesses aren't pretty.

123
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,314
- Wait, what's wrong?!
- I want to go home, Mommy!

124
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,567
What did you do this time?

125
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,657
Oh, okay.

126
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,908
I guess that's good.

127
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,160
It's only right to educate children early.

128
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,745
Let's open their eyes.

129
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,039
There should be no
judgment when it comes to views,

130
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,374
beliefs, and how people look.

131
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,088
Gosh, there are so
many scammers these days!

132
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,757
I keep getting anonymous calls!

133
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,817
Mia, you have to change,
or you'll scare the kids.

134
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,119
Okay! Fine! Fine!

135
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,049
The steak, right?

136
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,349
Goodness, Mia.

137
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,861
This is to cover Mia's bill.

138
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,322
And this is for your silence. Okay?

139
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,661
Wait! It's pouring! You might get sick!

140
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,332
Hurry with the umbrella, Madeth! Faster!

141
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,125
Now, go get the car!

142
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,294
- Okay.
- Hurry, Madeth!

143
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,712
Ay ay ay!

144
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,923
Let's wait here.

145
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,591
Okay.

146
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,176
Madeth, faster!

147
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,179
What a hassle.

148
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,080
What?

149
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,623
<i>Bert told me...</i>

150
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,668
<i>...that you said</i>
<i>your brother can work fine!</i>

151
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,628
Is Patpat mad?

152
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,130
<i>You know</i>
<i>he's on the autism spectrum, sir.</i>

153
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,549
<i>Maybe something triggered him.</i>

154
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,717
<i>But your retarded brother</i>

155
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,219
<i>caused a huge damage!</i>

156
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,054
<i>You can't call him that, sir.</i>

157
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,014
Is Patpat mad?

158
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,475
<i>Whatever! He's fired!</i>

159
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,185
<i>And he won't be getting his pay.</i>

160
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,563
<i>It's not even enough</i>
<i>to cover for the damages he caused.</i>

161
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,982
<i>I don't know why companies</i>

162
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,484
<i>bother hiring people like your brother.</i>

163
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,789
Patpat is mad. Patpat is mad.

164
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,103
Shall we eat?

165
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,856
Where do you want to eat?

166
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,817
Patpat...

167
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,738
Patpat is not mad at Matmat? Not anymore?

168
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,032
- He's not mad?
- Patpat isn't mad.

169
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,452
Just forget about that boss.

170
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,120
You won't be working for him anymore.

171
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,332
That place sucks anyway.

172
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,001
We'll find you a job
where you'll have fun.

173
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,503
So Matmat can be happy!

174
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,799
I can always have a...

175
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,475
<i>Batchoy! </i>I want <i>batchoy!</i>

176
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,144
I'm tired of <i>pares. </i>No more <i>pares.</i>

177
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,980
Okay, let's go eat some <i>batchoy!</i>

178
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,608
<i>- Batchoy!</i>
<i>- Batchoy!</i>

179
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,079
Is it good?

180
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,540
It's good! The <i>batchoy </i>is good!

181
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,460
I told you so. Want more garlic?

182
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,676
Here's your bill, sir.
Your total is 245 pesos.

183
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,513
Have you applied...

184
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,057
...the discount for PWDs?

185
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,892
Yes, sir.
That's the discounted price.

186
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,105
Hmm... Patpat?

187
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:26,026
You haven't given Matmat his salary.

188
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:31,573
That's 1,433.50 pesos.

189
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,743
Right.

190
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,082
Here.

191
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,793
I added some extra.

192
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,420
Hm!

193
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,093
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

194
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,177
It's so good!

195
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,932
The <i>batchoy </i>is delicious!

196
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,606
- Mm!
- Eat up, Matmat.

197
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,983
No leftovers, okay?

198
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,583
This is my stop!

199
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,727
- Hey, Patrick.
- Hi, CJ.

200
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,533
- She won't let anyone near her.
- Where is she?

201
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,534
Follow me.

202
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,162
Jillian found the meal cart.

203
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,955
That triggered her eating disorder.

204
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,416
You know what happens when she eats.

205
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,753
You're the only one who can calm her down.

206
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,387
Jillian.

207
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,981
That's enough, okay?
Too much food is bad for you.

208
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,152
I thought you said...

209
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,948
I look cute when I eat.

210
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,576
You like that, right?

211
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:47,167
There are situations
when we start to like the things

212
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,211
that our loved ones do.

213
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,844
You came back for me, hubby.

214
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,053
Of course.

215
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,431
But why did you leave me...

216
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,060
to be with that sexy model?

217
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,857
Why didn't you choose me, hubby?

218
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,127
Did I get your clothes dirty?

219
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,174
It's okay.

220
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,345
Stop smiling like that.

221
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,264
It's annoying.

222
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,437
- Take a video. Hurry.
- Alright. I'm on it.

223
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,150
- Miss Mia!
- Hi, welcome!

224
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,696
Hello, everyone!
We'll have the book signing later.

225
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,407
- Please join us later.
- I'm a big fan!

226
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,368
Thank you so much for coming.

227
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,621
We have a scheduled autograph signing

228
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,665
and photo opportunity later.

229
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,709
We hope
to see you there later, okay?

230
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,168
Please join us later.

231
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,837
- Excuse us.
- Miss Mia!

232
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,714
See you at
the autograph signing later.

233
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,591
- Thank you. See you later.
- Miss Mia, smile.

234
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,884
Thank you very much.

235
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:51,268
"I HOPE YOU NOTICE ME.
I SAW YOU AT ST. BENEDICT."

236
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,447
Are you okay? No scratches?

237
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,782
We're sorry the security
couldn't handle the crowd.

238
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,492
That was a huge crowd.

239
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,219
Patrick is
really good and patient.

240
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,138
I wonder why
he doesn't last long at his jobs.

241
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,224
Really?

242
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,643
- Haven't you heard?
- No.

243
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,729
Patrick has worked at many hospitals.

244
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,398
But he never lasted a year at any of them.

245
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,112
I wonder what the reason is.

246
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,385
Matmat.

247
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,719
How are you?

248
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,222
<i>I'm okay. Matmat is okay.</i>

249
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,224
<i>What are you doing?</i>

250
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,685
I'm drawing.

251
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,063
<i>I bet you're enhancing the illustrations</i>

252
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,314
on Mia's books again.

253
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,738
Did you already eat?

254
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,327
What did you eat?

255
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,584
- <i>I'm not a dinosaur. My name is Trexy.</i>
- I'm not a dinosaur. My name is Trexy.

256
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,711
<i>- A talking dinosaur!</i>
- A talking dinosaur!

257
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,423
<i>I won't allow it.</i>

258
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,634
<i>Please let us take care of Trexy!</i>

259
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,180
Matmat, guess what?
Mia's coming to the hospital.

260
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,056
<i>We'll take good care of Trexy.</i>

261
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,562
<i>She's having</i>
<i>a book reading session for kids.</i>

262
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,819
Matmat is going there

263
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,280
<i>- to ask for an autograph</i>
- Hold on. Wait, Matmat.

264
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,616
<i>- from Mia Hernandez.</i>
- Calm down. Relax.

265
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,993
Matmat is going to ask for a picture, too.

266
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,455
I'm coming to St. Benedict Hospital
on Dewey Avenue.

267
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,415
<i>- I'm going to ride an e-jeep</i>
- Matmat.

268
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,541
heading to Manggahan.

269
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,295
Then I'll get off there and ride
another e-jeep heading to the hospital.

270
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,338
Matmat is coming there.

271
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,048
<i>- I'm coming.</i>
- Matmat.

272
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,345
Breathe.

273
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,113
Three. Matmat is coming there.

274
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,365
I'm coming.

275
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:38,203
Matmat, even if you leave now,
you won't make it in time.

276
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,747
<i>And what did I tell you?</i>

277
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,790
<i>The book reading session</i>

278
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,208
is for kids only.

279
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,418
Are you a kid?

280
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,301
I look like a kid.

281
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,179
But Matthew Gonzales
is already 35 years old.

282
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,432
Exactly.

283
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,565
Alright, I have an idea.

284
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,361
I'll get you an autograph from her.

285
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,490
Patpat, you promise
to get me an autograph?

286
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,200
I promise.

287
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,744
So, who's your favorite now?

288
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,997
Me or Mia?

289
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,967
Matmat.

290
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,802
Miss, smoking's not
allowed inside the facility.

291
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,022
How about your cigarette?

292
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,816
Is it also destined to die?

293
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,716
A children's book author.

294
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,101
I have a book
reading at the auditorium later.

295
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:38,169
<i>Butterfly! Butterfly!</i>

296
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,046
<i>Butterfly!</i>

297
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,509
<i>The butterfly will come back!</i>

298
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,846
<i>Mama! Mama!</i>

299
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,682
- <i>Mama! Mama!</i>
- <i>Aah!</i>

300
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:58,606
- <i>The butterfly!</i>
- <i>Mama!</i>

301
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,108
<i>Mama!</i>

302
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,569
- <i>They'll return!</i>
- <i>Mama!</i>

303
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,173
<i>We need Mia's consent now.</i>

304
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,718
<i>My father's been dead for a long time.</i>

305
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,678
<i>- Is he a new patient?</i>
<i>- He's dangerous.</i>

306
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,722
<i>He might hurt someone if he escapes.</i>

307
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,391
<i>There are many bad people in this world.</i>

308
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,645
<i>You can't live without me, dear.</i>

309
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,147
<i>You'll kill your daughter</i>

310
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,398
<i>because you don't want to leave her.</i>

311
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,442
<i>If you want to die, do it alone.</i>

312
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,902
<i>- I'll even watch you.</i>
<i>- Wait!</i>

313
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:44,986
<i>Which am I?</i>
