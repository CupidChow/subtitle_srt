1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,169
Why don't you
you consider conducting a seminar

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,422
on literature for the patients here?

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,423
[Patrick] A new patient?

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,008
A regular patient who keeps coming back.

5
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,926
[Gemma] He's the son
of Congressman Martinez.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,470
His admission here remains a secret,

7
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,223
because his family
doesn't want the public to know.

8
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,975
Matmat, don't forget
your appointment, okay?

9
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,436
Matmat won't forget.

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,187
3 PM, OK Hospital.

11
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,647
Okay, then.

12
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,941
Finally, we meet again.

13
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,527
You were the little boy I met back then.

14
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,154
It's already in the past, Mia.

15
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,323
I want you.

16
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:45,670
[theme music playing]

17
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,386
Who among you believes in fairy tales?

18
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,514
[Bella whispers] Fairy tales.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,016
I'll answer this one.

20
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,434
I do!

21
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,644
Me!

22
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,687
Why?

23
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:47,816
Because…

24
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,151
I'm a romantic.

25
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,655
And fairytales teach their readers

26
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,573
that true love conquers all.

27
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,658
- That's true!
- Right?

28
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,118
[patients squealing]

29
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,786
[sheepishly] Oh, stop it!

30
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,247
[chuckling]

31
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,248
Wrong.

32
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,795
Fairy tales are proof
that we like to run away from reality.

33
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,506
Let's face it.

34
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,509
Most of us…

35
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,428
find it hard to be our true selves.

36
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,392
- [murmuring]
- [awkward chuckle]

37
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,727
For example, Cinderella.

38
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,105
- Cinderella!
- Your favorite.

39
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,232
- Raise your hand.
- Sure.

40
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,943
[chalk scraping]

41
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:35,071
What's a lesson
we can learn from Cinderella?

42
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,406
[Bella] Here we go!

43
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,200
[Kai] Uh, miss! I know the answer.

44
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,371
It's all about destiny.

45
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,249
How we must discover it ourselves
and choose to live it.

46
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,959
- Am I right?
- You're so smart!

47
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,043
No.

48
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,920
[Mia] I'll tell you the truth.

49
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,091
Cinderella deserved
everything that happened to her.

50
00:02:56,426 --> 00:03:00,889
She harbored hatred toward
her stepmother and stepsisters

51
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,557
but what she should've done…

52
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,894
was kick them out from the start.

53
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,270
- But--
- What?

54
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,271
[laughter]

55
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,856
It was her fault all along?

56
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,985
[unsettling music playing]

57
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,738
What about Pinocchio?

58
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,073
Don't ever lie!

59
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,700
- Right on the spot!
- Absolutely!

60
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,535
Be true to yourself.

61
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,245
If you're a human, you're a human.

62
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,705
If you're merely wood, accept it.

63
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,792
No one will judge
you if that's your truth.

64
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,628
[unsettling music continues]

65
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,839
We should all be living our truths.

66
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:42,388
[unsettling music swells]

67
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,307
To summarize.

68
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,353
Fairy tales don't exist to make us believe

69
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:52,607
that life is all about
rainbows and butterflies.

70
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,448
True love is an illusion.

71
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:10,625
And these stories should serve
as a reminder of our reality.

72
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,794
So, yes.

73
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,423
Read your fairy tales.

74
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,303
So you can finally wake up to reality.

75
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,019
Mia!

76
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:36,651
[unsettling music continues]

77
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,860
[chuckles softly]

78
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,530
[music ends]

79
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,990
[Ada] Good morning, Doctor.

80
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,702
What's this meeting about?

81
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,288
Well, as you both know,

82
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:53,835
I haven't yet found a replacement
for Nurse Ice as the nurse manager.

83
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,504
As senior nurses,

84
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,300
I'm considering
either of you for the position.

85
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,178
Thank you, Doctor.

86
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,431
Thanks, Doctor.

87
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,974
I will not disappoint.

88
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,150
[Mia] Patrick, are you seriously
just going to ignore me?

89
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,402
No, Mister Tommy.
We'll do breathing exercises.

90
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,446
[Mia] Patrick. Talk to me!

91
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,489
- I can do that.
- Very good.

92
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,033
[Patrick] Have
you wheeled your dad around?

93
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,659
[Mia] No. Why would I do that?

94
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,827
[Patty] Focus.

95
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,828
That's what we--

96
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,121
[Mia] Talked about with Doctor Anok.

97
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:34,083
That's what everybody keeps telling me,
but clearly, I didn't say yes to anything.

98
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,210
Isn't it obvious?

99
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,547
The only reason I agreed to do the
literature sessions was because of you.

100
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,465
[Patty] Inhale.

101
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,884
Exhale.

102
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,969
Okay, let's take another deep inhale.

103
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,679
You said it yourself in class.

104
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,224
- [Patty] Exhale.
- No one should be living in an illusion.

105
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,517
Face the reality.

106
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,186
I did say that.

107
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,438
That's why I'm here, remember?

108
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,732
No matter how many
times you tried to push me away.

109
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,110
How is that living your truth?

110
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,032
Because I can see it in your eyes.

111
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,036
You want me, too.

112
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,371
It's true, isn't it?

113
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,709
[tender music playing]

114
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,420
You have a hidden desire for me.

115
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,672
[Patty] Exhale.

116
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,258
Okay, let's take another deep inhale.

117
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:25,885
Mia.

118
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,637
[Mia sighs]

119
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,888
[Patty] And then let's now--

120
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,932
I know you're capable of smiling.

121
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,976
I've seen you do it with your patients.

122
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,562
So, why can't you smile for me again?

123
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,815
"Again"?

124
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,733
I did that before?

125
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,069
- [Patty] Breathe out.
- [sighs]

126
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,655
You were so warm to me that night.

127
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,825
[tender music continues]

128
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,951
When?

129
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,413
In my dreams.

130
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,751
[gentle taps]

131
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,837
[Mia] The other night, I had a bad dream.

132
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,464
And you were so comforting.

133
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,926
[tender music continues]

134
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,010
[Patrick huffs]

135
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,266
[moans]

136
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,144
[gentle taps]

137
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:22,191
[moans becoming louder]

138
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,901
Mia, stop this.

139
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,028
You're distracting the patients.

140
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,822
What?

141
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,324
- It was so nice and comforting.
- Mia, just stop it.

142
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,534
- Patrick.
- Please.

143
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,997
Patrick, let's have a one-night stand.

144
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,878
[quirky music playing]

145
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:43,963
- Hey!
- Psst!

146
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,548
- Cynthia. Cynthia…
- Oh.

147
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,008
[Patty] How embarrassing.

148
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,136
[Mia grunting]

149
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,638
Why are you taking me into the woods?

150
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,806
Patrick.

151
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,684
You really won't listen, will you?

152
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,978
I'm not in the mood for all this nonsense.

153
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,646
But once you're in the mood…

154
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,356
You want to have fun with me, Patrick?

155
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,275
Patrick, let's have fun together.

156
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,444
When will you leave me alone?

157
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,908
When you stop being a hypocrite.

158
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,999
I can see it.

159
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:26,005
You have some kind of
hatred or feeling bottled inside.

160
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,304
But you show the opposite to everyone.

161
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,224
That you're fine.

162
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,100
That you're good.

163
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,061
That you're okay.

164
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,066
Well?

165
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,693
What's with that look on your face?

166
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,322
I'm right.

167
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,824
You're guilty.

168
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,368
You don't know me.

169
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,537
Come on, Patrick.

170
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,081
Everybody is a hypocrite.

171
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,502
We all put on an act for our own reasons.

172
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,296
In your case,

173
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,093
you're pretending
that you don't want to enjoy,

174
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,972
but that's what you really want to do.

175
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:26,732
[footsteps receding]

176
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:38,661
[whimsical music playing]

177
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:59,724
[music becomes tense]

178
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:17,742
[uneasy whimpering]

179
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,578
[Gemma] Mister Samuel, are you in pain?

180
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,914
Mister Samuel.

181
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,459
Mister Samuel, does anything hurt?

182
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,670
[tense music continues]

183
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,089
Patty, please assist Mister Samuel.

184
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:38,638
[continues whimpering]

185
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,140
[tense music crescendos]

186
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,398
Doc, Matmat will be here soon.

187
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,318
Ah, okay. Come with me, Patrick.

188
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,156
How was Mia's class?

189
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,240
You attended it, right?

190
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,534
Yes, doctor.

191
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,830
Some of the things
she discussed were kind of strange

192
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,416
but the patients seemed interested.

193
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,127
Strange?

194
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,048
Well, she said…

195
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:20,262
fairytales should serve
as a reminder of our reality.

196
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,181
[chuckles]

197
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,727
Looks like Mia takes after
her mother in being creative.

198
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,730
You knew her mother?

199
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,190
Yes.

200
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,691
Oh.

201
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,654
You and Mia have known each other for
a while, even before you came here.

202
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:41,534
I saw a video on the internet of
the two of you at her book-signing.

203
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,704
So you saw that, doctor.

204
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,373
Yeah.

205
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,582
There were so many comments.

206
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,793
They say Mia is a violent person.

207
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,837
Is that true, Patrick?

208
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:58,008
[unsettling tone plays]

209
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,428
He's the one who
disrupted your event, not me!

210
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,680
- Ow! Ouch!
- Does it hurt?

211
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:05,099
- It hurts! [screams in pain]
- Daddy!

212
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:14,650
[body thudding]

213
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,281
Why do you ask, doc?

214
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,119
Are you afraid Mia
might hurt our patients here?

215
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,288
[chuckles softly]

216
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,665
We should always be cautious here.

217
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,961
I won't judge Mia just
because of that incident.

218
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:39,758
But some think she has
antisocial personality disorder.

219
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,052
Is that true, doc?

220
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,556
If someone is violent, does that mean
they have antisocial personality disorder?

221
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,434
Well, not necessarily.

222
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,436
There are many signs.

223
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,646
One sign alone isn't enough to say

224
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,566
that someone has that medical condition.

225
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,151
What are the signs?

226
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:02,364
Well, one sign is
they don't follow rules and regulations.

227
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,785
They don't care about
the consequences of their actions.

228
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,704
[Patrick] Miss.

229
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,289
[eerie music playing]

230
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,541
Miss, smoking's not
allowed inside the facility.

231
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,961
[Anok] Another sign is that
they do dangerous things

232
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:20,007
without regard for the safety of others
or themselves.

233
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,094
[eerie music continues]

234
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,141
For example,

235
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,185
you're not doing anything wrong,

236
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,811
but they suddenly slap you.

237
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,190
They don't care if you get hurt.

238
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,943
What matters is they get to slap you.

239
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,487
They don't feel
remorse about hurting others.

240
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,991
Why?

241
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,202
Do you think Mia is like that?

242
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,664
Uh…

243
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,749
I see some of the signs, but…

244
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,546
how does one end up with the condition?

245
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,801
According to studies,
there are many factors,

246
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,470
It could be in their genes

247
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,015
as well as life
situations and experiences.

248
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,311
But Mia hasn't told me or you

249
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:18,148
that she has
antisocial personality disorder.

250
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,860
So, I need to assess her first.

251
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,030
You look worried, Patrick.

252
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,245
I'm only now
beginning to understand clearly

253
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,205
antisocial personality disorder, doc.

254
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,333
But remember,

255
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,711
this condition is incurable.

256
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,921
It can be treated,

257
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,257
but it requires lifelong management.

258
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:49,722
As people who interact with individuals
with antisocial personality disorder,

259
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:54,602
we shouldn't engage them
or enable their behavior.

260
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,397
It all seems complicated.

261
00:14:59,023 --> 00:14:59,857
Yes.

262
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,152
We don't know what they're going through,

263
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,905
or if they have
a condition we don't understand.

264
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,573
[pensive music playing]

265
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,367
Does that mean Mia
should get checked by you?

266
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,536
Well, that's up to her.

267
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,829
As the saying goes,

268
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,833
"Help is always available
for those who are willing to accept it."

269
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,253
Bring Matmat in, alright?

270
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,379
Yes, doc.

271
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:29,595
[pensive music continues, fades]

272
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,055
[Gemma] Mia!

273
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,474
Mia, wait!

274
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,060
Mia, you can't go yet.

275
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,272
My class is done.
The patients are satisfied. I'm done here.

276
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,900
You haven't visited Mister Samuel yet.

277
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,360
And why would I do that?

278
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,821
[huffs] Mia, that was the agreement.

279
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,573
I only agreed to the lectures.

280
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,451
I never agreed
to spend time with that person.

281
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,620
[huffs]

282
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,164
So, you didn't have
to be here in the first place?

283
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,415
[scoffs]

284
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,377
Hmm…

285
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,629
But I want to be here.

286
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,342
Do you want to know why?

287
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,637
[quirky music playing]

288
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,721
Oh…

289
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:15,766
[chuckles softly]

290
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,227
You're not ready for the truth.

291
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,855
Because the truth will only hurt you.

292
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,693
[quirky music continues]

293
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,777
Fine.

294
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,656
If you don't want
to visit your own father,

295
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,366
then don't.

296
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,577
It only shows what
kind of daughter you are.

297
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,246
[snickers]

298
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,123
I know.

299
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,167
[inhales, sighs deeply]

300
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,461
Satisfied?

301
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,171
[huffs]

302
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:51,593
[quirky music continues]

303
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,222
[exhales heavily]

00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,851
[quirky music swells, ends]

305
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,977
[door opens]

306
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,439
Doc? Matmat's here.

307
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,858
- Ah, great.
- Sorry for the wait.

308
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,943
Oh, it's alright! Come, come.

309
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,695
- Come over here.
- Matmat.

310
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,779
Follow me.

311
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:12,823
Come on.

312
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:17,036
[waves lapping]

313
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,707
Look at this breathtaking view.

314
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,167
Look.

315
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,210
It's beautiful, right?

316
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,714
It's beautiful.
It's colorful, it's colorful, doc.

317
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,886
What if we bring this
view inside the hospital?

318
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,228
How do we do that, doc?

319
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,023
You'll drag it in?

320
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,900
[chuckling]

321
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,736
[Anok] Here.

322
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,364
This is where I want
to put that beautiful view.

323
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,750
Patpat, is he alright?

324
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,752
I don't think he is.

325
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,129
I don't think he is okay.

326
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,214
I don't…

327
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,759
I'm okay, Matmat.

328
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:18,305
But I would be much
better if you accept my offer

329
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:22,309
to draw that beautiful view on this wall.

330
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,689
[chuckles]

331
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:30,901

[light-hearted music playing]

333
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,949
Big, big painting.

334
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,160
Big wall for a big painting.

335
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,662
[chuckles]

336
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,039
Doc, are you sure about this?

337
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,291
Yes, Patrick.

338
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,418
This is part of his therapy.

339
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:52,172
Besides, Matmat is a talented artist.

340
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,007
What do you say, Matmat?

341
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,970
[light-hearted music continues]

342
00:18:59,096 --> 00:18:59,972
How much?

343
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,431
[chuckles]

344
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:06,645
How much will
Doc, Doc Anok pay for the painting?

345
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,482
Of course I'll pay you, but…

346
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,401
that depends on the outcome.

347
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,278
[chuckles]

348
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:19,449
Wow! A big painting means a lot of money.

349
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,160
[chuckles]

350
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,246
Patpat, Matmat will have money now!

351
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,331
[chuckles]

352
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:30,127

[thud]

354
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,142
Wow!

355
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,728
That's all yours? You're rich, Matmat!

356
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,231
No, this is not enough, Patpat.

357
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,858
That's a lot already. I'll count it.

358
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:53,817
[slams]

359
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,612
Really?

360
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,488
You're keeping it secret?

361
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,618
Are you saving up for something?

362
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,040
Okay.

363
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,499
Suit yourself!

00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,461
[Patrick grunts softly]

365
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,346
A car.

366
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:28,060
Matmat wants a real car.

367
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:32,773
[hesitates]
Matthew Gonzales is 35 years old.

368
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:36,526
I'm too old to be playing with toy cars.

369
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,247
Here, Patpat.

370
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,758
[snickers]

371
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,760
A camping car?

372
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,303
Is this what you want?

373
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,891
We can… We can live in there.

374
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:14,690
Did you, did you see? The car has a bed.

375
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,110
It has a bathroom. It has a stove.

376
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,569
You can cook.

377
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,115
- We won't go hungry.
- [gentle music playing]

378
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:27,160
We can live there when we leave here.

379
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:34,126
When the butterfly comes.

380
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:39,006
[gentle music continues]

381
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,299
Matmat…

382
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,926
No matter where we go,

383
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,180
I don't need anything else…

384
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,224
but you.

385
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,269
I mean it.

386
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,107
All that matters to me is we're together.

387
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:02,863
[gentle music continues]

388
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,239
Because…

389
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,285
it's Matmat and Patpat forever?

390
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:14,207
[gentle music continues]

391
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,626
Yes.

392
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,297
Matmat and Patpat forever.

393
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,634
But…

394
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:28,680
Matmat's money is still not enough.

395
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,059
The camping car is expensive.

396
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:37,397
It's 4,535,000 pesos.

397
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:42,235
Matmat has to work hard to save up.

398
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:47,282
[gentle music continues]

399
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,742
[music fades]

400
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,511
Miss Mia?

401
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,474
Where's Patrick?

402
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,975
Uh, he's not here yet.

403
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,562
He's on his way here with Nurse Gemma.

404
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,358
- They're together?
- Mm-hmm.

405
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,365
[reporter]
Congressman Benjamin Martinez Sr.,

406
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:31,159
or Cong. Ben,
has begun his campaign in Maravida.

407
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,787
[crowd cheering]

408
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,498
[Ben] Thank you for your support.
Thank you so much.

409
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,918
Thank you! Thank you so much!

410
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:43,421
- Thank you.
- Remember, Ben Martinez.

411
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,799
[Ben] Thank you. I expect your vote.

412
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,301
- [crowd] Congressman!
- [Ben] Thank you so much!

413
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,719
Pogi.

414
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,596
[Ben] Thank you for your support.

415
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,517
Ben Martinez. Vote for me in the election.

416
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,436
- What is it?
- Inform the orderly and staff.

417
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,982
A patient escaped,
so they have to block the hallways.

418
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,651
[sighs sharply] Junjun
is giving me a headache.

419
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,069
You mean, Congressman's son?

420
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,072
- Yes.
- Shoot! Patrick's not here.

421
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,242
- [Junjun] Whoo! [laughs]
- There he is!

422
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,828
There's that troublemaker
son of Congressman Ben.

423
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:15,996
- Me?
- Go handle it.

424
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,666
- [quirky music playing]
- [Junjun whooping]

425
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,750
[Junjun] Whoo!

426
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:30,635
[quirky music continues]

427
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,766
Hey, ladies!

428
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,602
- I have a surprise for you.
- Junjun.

429
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,937
- [patients screaming]
- Junjun! Wait!

430
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,522
Stop it! Cover that up.

431
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,065
[Pogi] Junjun! Hey!

432
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,359
Come here! Go back inside!

433
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,694
[screaming]

434
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,487
[Pogi] What are you doing?!

435
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,532
[nurse] Help! We need assistance please!

436
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,825
Come back here!

437
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,702
[quirky music continues]

438
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,288
[Junjun laughs] Come and get me!

439
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,207
[playful music continues]

440
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,750
- Junjun!
- Oops!

441
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,335
[Junjun laughs]

442
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,586
[Junjun] Come on!

443
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,087
[Junjun grunts]

444
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,006
- [water splashes]
- [Junjun laughing]

445
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,466
Sorry, bro.

446
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,634
- Enjoy the water.
- [Pogi] Junjun!

447
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,303
[quirky music continues]

448
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,763
- [Pogi] Come back here!
- [Junjun laughing]

449
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:20,560
[quirky music continues]

450
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,565
[quirky music ends]

451
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,985
[traffic noises]

452
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,159
Is that a camping car?

453
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,664
Yeah, I saw it and got interested.

454
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,667
I have a godfather who rents out vehicles.

455
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,545
Well, they're mostly vans,
but I'm sure he has a camping car.

456
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:53,301
Do you want me to rent one and we'll go on
a vacation with your brother?

457
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,270
[phone ringing]

458
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,897
Hello, Pogi?

459
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,359
Patrick, Junjun is causing a scene again.

460
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,319
Are you and Gemma still on the road?

461
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,238
[Patrick] Yes,
we're on our way to the hospital.

462
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,284
Which nurses were conducting the rounds?

463
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,371
How did Junjun escape
while using the restroom?

464
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,000
That's not our priority, Olivia.

465
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,794
We have to find
Junjun and get him back here.

466
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:31,256
And I… will handle my nurses later.

467
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,467
Can you really handle them, Eden?

468
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:40,807
[tense music playing]

469
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,061
What are you trying to say?

470
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,773
This isn't the first time
your group had a problem.

471
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,608
- If it were us--
- Oh, really?

472
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,403
You're really blaming us now, Olivia?

473
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,405
[Patty] Ma'am, Ma'am!

474
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,116
- I found Junjun.
- We found him, Patrick.

475
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,952
Whose car is that?

476
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,331
Do we have a scheduled visitor today?

477
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,082
I don't think that's a visitor.

478
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,126
I've seen that car in
the parking lot several times.

479
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:14,466
[tense music continues]

480
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,967
Don't tell me…

481
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,969
You!

482
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,514
I have something special for you.

483
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:26,269
[quirky music playing]

484
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,854
[elephant trumpeting]

485
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,109
[car door opens]

486
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:40,200
[quirky music continues]

487
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,160
Is that it?

488
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,828
[elephant trumpeting softly]

489
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,416
It's small.

490
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,253
[quirky music continues]

491
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,797
Don't insult my manhood!

492
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,927
I have an idea.

493
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,596
- Get in the car.
- What?

494
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,515
Get in the car.

495
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:08,520
[quirky music continues]

496
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,188
Close your jacket.

497
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,233
I don't want
your manhood all over my seats.

498
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,153
- [car door closes]
- [car door opens]

499
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,238
[car door closes]

500
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,869
It's Mia. It's Mia again.

501
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,623
What? Mia took Junjun?

502
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:33,211
[dramatic music playing]

503
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,796

[dramatic music crescendos]

505
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,721
Best day ever!

506
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:43,972
Mia, stop the car!

507
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,807
Catch me if you can.

508
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,393
[Mia] We're here to have fun.

509
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,563
- [car horns honking]
- [tires screeching]

510
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,649
You don't understand why Mia did that.

511
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,609
Be careful or your words

512
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,863
might reveal
the secret that you're hiding.

513
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:00,905
[Gemma] Patrick, come on!

514
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:01,781
Watch out!

515
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,241
Mia, stop!

516
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,952
[engine revving]
