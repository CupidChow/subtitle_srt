- [Patrick] <i>We're family, right?</i>

6
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,429
<i>And family loves each other.</i>

7
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,055
<i>I love Mia.</i>

8
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,058

[Patrick] <i>Why didn't you tell Mia</i>

13
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,862
<i>Because Ingrid will come back.</i>

14

[theme music playing]

17
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,885
That's so easy to do now.

18
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,930
- [tense music playing]
- She's doing that for her own advantage.

19
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,681
Just to get what she wants.

20
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,977
That's why she wanted
Mister Samuel under her care.

21
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,730
Because she wanted Papa under her control.

22
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,273
That's why she came back…

23
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,318
to do the same thing to me.

24
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,362
[tense music continues]

25
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,655
[Mia exhales]

26
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,031
I'll call Vincent.

27
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,158
- So he can alert the police.
- Mia.

28
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,288
I read in the book "Dalagita."

29
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,083
It said,

30
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:09,129
"A worthless child
should be thrown into the sea."

[tense music continues]

32
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,508
That's a threat, Mia.

33
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,511
That's why I want you to think

34
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,471
of what she'll do if she gets near you.

35
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,266
[sobs]

36
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,978
I won't let her ruin the life I have now.

47
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:29,292
Wasn't the value of
the ring I gave you enough?

48
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,089
So you sided with someone else.

49
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,719
Surprise.

50
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:45,767

a traitor.

[unsettling music playing]

77
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,889
What are you doing here?

78
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,226
He's no longer in the hospital,

79
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,312
and you're still visiting him?

80
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,817
You've gone that far,

81
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,652
Olivia?

82
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,280
Eden…

83
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,824
[Eden] Just so you can be

84
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,077
with my,

85
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,496
…husband.

[cackles]

89
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,303
He never even mention your name.

90
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,973
That's how badly he wanted to forget you.

91
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,437
I knew he was in love with someone
else when he studied in New York,

92
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,148
but I thought to myself,

93
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,026
why would I even bother?

94
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,113
It was an arranged marriage anyway.

95
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,282
You know what I can't forgive?

96
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,786
From the moment
you set foot in OK Hospital,

97
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,580
you made me look like a fool!

What if you don't go to the interview?

103
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,931
We can't just stop living
our lives just because of her.

104
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,809
Anyway, the police are looking for her.

105
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,313
Okay, fine. But be vigilant, okay?

106
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,150
After the meetings,
we'll head home straight away.

107
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,862
We'll be home by
the time your shift ends.

109
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,035
Matmat, let's go.

110
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,413
Good luck with your meeting, Matmat.

111
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,957
It's okay to be nervous.
Just don't be shy.

112
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,419
Mia will help you.

113
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,505
Matmat,

114
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,548
I got you.

[tender music continues]

116
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,889
[stuttering] Matmat will
do his best at the meeting,

117
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,682
and with the interview.

118
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,851
Okay, Matmat.

119
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,311
Happy day.

00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,578
Madeth, was the interviewer
briefed on Matmat's condition?

130
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,872
Yes, Boss V.
She's actually excited to meet him.

131
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,542
Okay. Good. Mia doesn't
want Matmat to be uncomfortable.

132
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,502
Yes, Boss V. I prepared for that.

133
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,713
Okay, it needs to be smooth.
This is the first interview

134
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,214
of Mia in such a long time.

135
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,049
And everything should be perfect.

136
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,468
Boss V, I got this.
Okay? Everything's prepared.

137
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,304
Impressive! You got everything covered!

138
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,432
That's why I think you deserve this.

139
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,892
Boss V, what's this?

140
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,940
[quirky music playing]

141
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,693
Boss V, we have money now!

142
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,986
That's from Erica's investment.

143
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,363
Of course,
I should be investing in people too.

144
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,034
So that's your salary for
the past months, plus a bonus.

145
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,703
Oh gosh, Boss V!

146
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,957
I can't believe you do have
a heart somewhere down there!

147
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,002
I think Gemma's really
been good for you. [squeals]

148
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,922
Of course,
we have to give as much as we're getting.

149
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:36,510
That's what you get for
your good work and honesty.

150
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,554
Come on. Let's go.

151
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,891
- Boss V…
- [quirky music continues]

152
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,184
What?

153
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,393
Let's go.

154
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,563
Uh,

155
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,148
Boss V.

156
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,942
Speaking of honesty,

157
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,152
very honest.

158
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,696
- What's this?
- [music ends]

159
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,701
Madeth!

160
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,703
You've had this all along?!

161
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:06,123
You made me go through the bins,
I was swimming through trash,

162
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,249
and you had it all along?!

163
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,086
Boss V, you just said,

164
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,755
"We have to give as
much as we're getting."

165
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,215
[quirky music resumes]

166

[exhales heavily]

167
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,052
Okay. Good job.

168
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,221
Thank you for safekeeping this, but,

169
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,390
don't ever do this again, okay?

170
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,225
Y-Yes, Boss V. Sorry!

171
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,810
Okay. Very good. Let's go.

172
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:26,852
Yes, Boss V.

173
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,229
[music fades]

174
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,272
[interviewer] Mia, many have been waiting

175
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,318
for your new book,
"Have You Seen My Face?"

176
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,904
Mia, you've written many books.

177
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,449
What makes this one special?

178
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,452
[Mia breathes deeply]

179
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,289
This one is special to me because…

180
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,126
when I was writing this book,

181
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,796

That's right.

194
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:52,605

Matmat, you drew wonderfully.
