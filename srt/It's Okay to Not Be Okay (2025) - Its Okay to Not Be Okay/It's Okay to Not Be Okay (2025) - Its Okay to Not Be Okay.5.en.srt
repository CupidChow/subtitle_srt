1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,045
Nurse Patrick,
have you had Miss Mia sign your book yet?

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,463
Who is this for?

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,215
For you, Patrick?

4
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:08,091
Matmat.

5
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,384
- "Matmat"?
- "Matmat"?

6
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,761
It's for my older brother, Matmat.

7
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,012
Here.

8
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,432
Thanks, but this will be
the last time we ever meet.

9
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,516
"Matmat…

10
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,977
I'm inviting
you to come to my book signing."

11
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,353
This is my stop.

12
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,605
"I'll see you there. Matmat."

13
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,191
[Mia] Pretty, pretty boy.

14
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,193
[loud thumping]

15
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,654
I'm running a background check on him.

16
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:33,825
He's actually even
harder to trace than most criminals.

17
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,535
I don't care how you'll do it,

18
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,787
but I want all the information about him.

19
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,957
Don't you miss our old town?

20
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,876
- Matmat!
- The butterflies--

21
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,754
- Matmat, tell them already!
- Shh, shh!

22
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,423
What does our mother's killer look like?

23
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,674
- No--
- Matmat!

24
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,759
No!

25
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,844
Matmat, I'm here.

26
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,012
I'm right here.

27
00:00:54,471 --> 00:01:01,644
[theme music playing]

28
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:51,903
[somber music playing]

29
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,034
[yawns]

30
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,371
[thunder rumbling]

31
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,254
[lightning crashes]

32
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:14,509
[somber music continues]

33
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,428
[thunder clapping]

34
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,226
[thunder rumbling]

35
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:28,356
[somber music continues]

36
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,447
[footsteps approaching]

37
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,044
[officer] They have no
other relatives here in Maravida.

38
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,298
We haven't been able
to reach their family in Manila either.

39
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,466
[social worker]
We'll take in the younger one.

40
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,261
As for his brother,
we'll turn him over to a mental facility.

41
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,014
[officer] Alright.
We'll leave the talking to you.

42
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,515
[social worker]
We'll talk to them tomorrow.

43
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:08,563
[music becomes unsettling]

44
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,064
Matmat. Matmat…

45
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,608
Come on, wake up.

46
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,110
You need to wake up.

47
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,696
- Why, Patpat?
- We have to go.

48
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,239
Let's go.

49
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,532
- We have to--
- Shh!

50
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,950
[both shushing]

51
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,911
- Grab your stuff.
- We're leaving--

52
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,413
[unsettling music continues]

53
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,040
[thunder rumbling]

54
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,167
- Okay, Patpat.
- Come on.

55
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:31,961
Follow me.

56
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,296
Come on, hurry!

57
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,547
[thunder claps]

58
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,926
Faster! We need to hurry!

59
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,803
[unsettling music continues, fades]

60
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,847
[cicadas chirping]

61
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,600
Patpat, where are we going?

62
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,101
[Patrick] To…

63
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,479
To Olivares.

64
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,607
Where's Olivares, Patpat?

65
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,192
Somewhere far away.

66
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,653
Far from here.

67
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,863
There are buildings
over there, unlike here.

68
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,951
Buildings? Trixie lives in one of those!

69
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,702
Yeah, those buildings.

70
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,873
I can finally see where Trixie lives!
[clapping, giggling]

71
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,876
Yeah. And her friends live nearby right?

72
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,919
Mm-hmm!

73
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,879
We're going to a place like that.

74
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,799
Where's Mama, Patpat?

75
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,426
Aren't we going with her?

76
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,720
- Uh…
- Patpat!

77
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,431
Mama wants to see Trixie, too!

78
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,141
Where is she, Patpat?

79
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,893
Listen, Matmat…

80
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,437
- A bus!
- Bus?

81
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,315
Bus! Bus!

82
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,317
Bus!

83
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,117
[Matmat exclaiming]

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,535
[door creaks, clicks]

85
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,829
- [Matmat exclaiming excitedly]
- [Patrick puffing]

86
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,504
[door creaks, thuds]

87
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,842
- Matmat!
- We're coming, Trixie!

88
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,510
Patpat, it's Trixie!

89
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,970
Trixie!

90
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,596
Trixie?

91
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,181
Trixie…

92
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,892
I'm sorry, Matmat.

93
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,895
That's not Trixie's house.

94
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,525
Trixie's not here? She's not here?

95
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,237
Why?

96
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,783
What are we doing here, Patpat?

97
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,413
Batchoy!

98
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,957
Let's get some batchoy.

99
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,710
Let's eat with Mama.

100
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,005
Let's go have pork noodle soup with her.

101
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,840
Matmat.

102
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,721
Mama won't be joining us anytime soon.

103
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,182
Why?

104
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,808
Why, Patpat?

105
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,810
Where is Mama?

106
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,065
[voice breaking] Listen, Matmat…

107
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,317
Mama is in heaven now.

108
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,320
[mellow music playing]

109
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,821
Heaven?

110
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:08,409
But we left her in Maravida, remember?

111
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,619
Patpat…

112
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,913
You didn't leave her.

113
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,124
She's in heaven now.

114
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,421
[mellow music continues]

115
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,506
[sniffles softly]

116
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,719
Mama is in heaven now?

117
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,389
She left Matmat.

118
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,767
She left me… [thudding]

119
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,310
- Matmat--
- She left me…

120
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,436
Matmat.

121
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,562
She left…

122
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,022
She never really left you.

123
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,733
She'll keep watching over you,
even from heaven.

124
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,693
[mellow music continues]

125
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,530
But she won't be here with us anymore.

126
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,202
She won't be by our side?

127
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,996
Like Trixie's mother.

128
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,126
Trixie…

129
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,295
Her mother left her.

130
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,090
- But…
- Just like Matmat's mother did.

131
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,842
His mother left him, too.

132
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,510
- I'm still here, Matmat.
- She left--

133
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,512
Look at me. You still have me.

134
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,431
It's going to be the two of us now.

135
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,018
She didn't leave you.

136
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,062
And I won't leave you either.

137
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,106
I'll be with you wherever you go.

138
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,110
Y-You and me together, Patpat?

139
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,404
Yes.

140
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,033
Matmat and Patpat, right?

141
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,661
Matmat and Patpat.

142
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,079
[Matmat chuckles]

143
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,711
[mellow music continues]

144
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,504
Happy day.

145
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,094
[tender music playing]

146
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,345
Happy day.

147
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,892
Happy day.

148
00:07:55,975 --> 00:08:01,522
[tender music continues]

149
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,157
[Gemma] Patrick!

150
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,826
[tender music fades]

151
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,954
I just mentioned going home to Maravida

152
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,373
and that seemed to shut you off.

153
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,583
[chuckles]

154
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,502
It's not like that, Gemma.

155
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,505
To Maravida! To Maravida! Bus to Maravida!

156
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,465
[bus honks]

157
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,134
That's your ride.

158
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,391
[Gemma] You really have
no plans to go back to Maravida?

159
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,022
Do you think that it's still
the same old-fashioned town?

160
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,067
[Patrick] That's not it.

161
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,363
Is it because of…

162
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,241
of your mom?

163
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,247
Do you get sad returning

164
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,875
to the place where she died?

165
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,839
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

166
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,675
I shouldn't assume things. I'm sorry.

167
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,469
Don't apologize.

168
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,349
No, I've just realized that it's been
so long since I visited Mama.

169
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:21,978
So…

170
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,355
Maybe it's time.

171
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,149
And if you go back there,

172
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,236
you and Matmat can rent our place.

173
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,905
Mom will surely give you a rent discount.

174
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,950
Gemma…

175
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,793
I understand that you're just concerned.

176
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,298
But…

177
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,217
Matmat and I wouldn't
be going there anytime soon.

178
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,388
Is that so?

179
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,100
I understand.

180
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,356
But if God makes a miracle
or if you change your mind…

181
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,610
just call me, okay?

182
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,364
[man] To Maravida,
to Maravida! The bus leaves soon!

183
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,616
You might miss the bus.

184
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:22,163
[gentle music playing]

185
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,501
Call me.

[soft music continues]

187
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,593
[Mia] You remember her

188
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,012
not because of the beautiful,

189
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,099
but because of all the painful memories

190
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,393
that stayed there.

191
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:53,861
[music turns unsettling]

192

197
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,391
[ominous tone playing]

198
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:09,770
[Mia] A little boy
woke up from a nightmare.

199
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,315
Because Batibat visited him.

200
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,401
Batibats are creatures of nightmares.

201
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:19,280
They bring back
memories that you try hard to forget.

202
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,032
- [ominous music continues]
- [Batibat growls]

203
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:26,412
He was so afraid of
Batibat that he didn't want to sleep.

204
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:32,460
One day, he went to a witch to seek help.

205
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:37,673
"Powerful witch,
I'm tired of having nightmares.

206
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:41,844
I'll do everything you want.
Just help me get rid of them."

207
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,681
The witch granted his little wish.

208
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:49,602
She'll meet him again
to get what's promised in return.

209
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,812
Many years have passed,

210
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,190
with no Batibat in sight.

211
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,860
And the nightmares are gone.

212
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,154
But he wondered,

213
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,406
why can't he feel any joy?

214
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,578
One night when the moon
and the sky are as red as blood,

215
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,248
the powerful witch returned.

216
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,334
She's back to get what the boy owed her.

217
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,795
But he only acted displeased.

218
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,965
"The Batibat's gone
together with the bad memories.

219
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,801
But why am I still unhappy?"

220
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,722
The witch ignored
the hurtful things he had said.

221
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,850
She sucked the soul out of the young man

222
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,895
and all that was left
was a significant reminder.

223
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:38,400
"The painful
memories shape one's existence.

224
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,569
[ominous music continues]

225
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,365
You can't distinguish pain from relief,

226
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,618
happiness from sorrow,

227
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,371
if one of them ceases to exist."

228
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:54,166
That's why these
memories shouldn't vanish.

229
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,295
One should go through it in all its might.

230
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,132
The more you ignore and avoid them,

231
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:08,264
you will keep living in
loneliness and darkness.

232
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,977

Matmat, is it okay if
we pass by Jason's stall?

258
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,353
He's not picking up.

259
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,065
Matmat can't be late to see Miss Mia.

260
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,278
Matmat and Dino Boy are ready.

Wait for me, Matmat!

We're here to witness
the most magical moment of the year!

It's the book launch of
our favorite girl, Mia Hernandez.

288

As you can see, the venue is amazing.

00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,466
It's really amazing.

[cartoon jingle playing]

368
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,523

[giggles]

370
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,532
T-Tyrannosaurus rex.

[cartoon jingle ends]

373
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,538
[Patrick] What are
you saying? Stop it, Jason.

374
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,624
[Jason] Bro,
I'm on my way. I'm almost there…

375
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,127
I won't even bother brushing my teeth.
I'll just use mouthwash.

376
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,545
It'll be quick.

377
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,797
It's okay. I'm already here.

378
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,007
I'll just wait for
Matmat to finish inside.

379
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,634
So, don't bother coming, Jason.

380
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,636
[water splashes]

381
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,720
Jason?

382
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,889
Why are you calling me by my name?

383
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,724
Is our friendship over?

384
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,893
What are you even talking about?

385
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,395
[snickers]

386
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,813
Just open your restaurant already.

387
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,691
Sorry, bro. I love you.

388
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,067
I'll make it up to you.

389
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,736
One whole week of beef
stew for you and your brother.

390
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,905
I'll even scrub
your back for a week if you want--

391
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,407
It's okay.

392
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,409
Leave my back out of this.

393
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:14,870
But, bro…

394
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,955
I'm begging you.

395
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,999
Please don't stay too long.

396
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,418
We're avoiding that Mia, remember?

397
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,004
I'm not even going to see her.

398
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,423
[indistinct chattering]

399
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,134
What matters is that she and Matmat meet.

400
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:32,888
Alright, I have to go.

401
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,724
[phone beeps]

402
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,475
[giggles]

403
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,438
T-Tyrannosaurus rex.

404
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,106
Tyrannosaurus!

405
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,733
- Mommy!
- D-Dinosaur.

406
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,110
Hey, pervert! Get away from my daughter!

407
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,945
[foreboding music playing]

408
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,363
[Matmat] Tyrannosaurus…

409
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:54,284
L-Latin for "king of the tyrant lizards."

410
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,662
L-Lived during the end of the…the

411
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,081
Cretaceous period.

412
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,917
Can, can measure up to…

413
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,254
to 12 meters long and can weigh up to…

414
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,966
4,000 to 7,000 kilograms.

415
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,635
What nonsense are you saying?

416
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,969
You creep!

417
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,347
H-Her head looks similar to…

418
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,473
[Matmat giggles]

419
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,807
…that of a Tyrannosaurus--

420
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,893
- Mommy!
- Don't touch my daughter!

421
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,186
- [body thuds]
- [camera shutter clicks]

422

M-Matmat said…

424
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:30,111
her head looks similar
to that of a Tyrannosaurus rex,

425
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,280
just like Dino Boy…

426
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,824
I told you not to touch her!

427
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,826
- Not the head!
- What's wrong with you?

428
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,248
[tense music continues]

429
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,041
- Huh? Huh?
- Don't touch my head!

430
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,001
Let go! Let go!

431
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,920
- [man] Guard!
- Not the head!

432
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:47,921
I said not the head!

438
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,394
N-Not the head!

439

[Matmat screaming]

440
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,359
[man] Pervert! You freak!

441
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,610
Pervert!

442
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:14,197
- [tense music continues]
- [Matmat screaming]

443
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,615
Not my head!

444
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,034
[man] Pervert! You freak!

445
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,911
No! Not the head!

446
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,037
[man] Pervert!

447
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,165

450
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,467

[whimpering]

452
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,681
Matmat, I'm here now. Patpat's here.

[unsettling music continues]

461
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,356
[man] Hey!

462
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,609
- Is that your brother?
- [Matmat whimpering]

463
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,444
You better talk to him.

464
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,154
He harassed my daughter.

465
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,280
My brother is not a pervert!

466
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,656
What do you mean he's not?

467
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,327
Everyone saw it!
He touched my daughter twice!

- [unsettling music continues]
- [camera shutters clicking]

469
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:54,214
[man] Your brother is a pervert!

470
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,257
A lot of people saw it!

471
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,968
Why did you even let him out in public?

472
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,346
He should be locked up at home.

473
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,849
He's a menace to society.

474
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:09,104
[unsettling music crescendos]

475
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,106
Apologize.

476
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:15,402
[tense music continues]

477
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,656
[crowd murmuring]

478
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,866
She's right.

479
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,035
You owe my daughter an apology.

480
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:29,666
- [camera shutters clicking]
- [crowd murmuring]

481
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:39,134
[tense music builds]

482
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,303
You cause so much trouble.

483
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,431
You're just hiding behind your influence.

484
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,016
People like him deserve to die.

485
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,019
You're going to hold me
back when I feel like exploding.

486
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,312
I'm not interested.

487
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,440
It's better if I just stay away from you.

488
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,482
Stay away?

489
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,608
Or are you just running away

490
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:59,112
because you don't want
to face what you can't handle?

491
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,822
[screaming] Aah!

492
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,949
They're going to take Matmat!

493
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,659
They're not taking you!
We're leaving this place!

494
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,328
Welcome back to Maravida!

495
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,913
Sir Nurse works

496
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,166
at the hospital
where your dad is confined.

497
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,460
Maybe you're the one
who can give me the answers I need.

498
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,712
Where art thou, my lovely, lovely writer?

499
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,840
He's not going to get away from me.

500
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,133
What are you doing here?

501
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,968
Destiny brings us together.
