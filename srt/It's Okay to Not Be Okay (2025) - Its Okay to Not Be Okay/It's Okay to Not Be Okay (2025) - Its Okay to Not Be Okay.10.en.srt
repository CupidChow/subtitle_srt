He's still in
recovery after the operation.

There's already
a standing order for his medication,

it for his surgeons' consultations.

[Gemma] He's the son
of Congressman Martinez.

87
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,468
His admission here remains a secret,

88
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,888
because his family
doesn't want the public to know.

89
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,266
What's his condition?

90
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,768

Not only that.
What if a patient catches you doing it?

96
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,866
She's right.

97
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,701

Nurse Cynthia, let's go.

107

Where are Patient 344's meds?

108
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,475
- It's time for her meds.
- [Gemma] We'll get them now.

[sighs deeply]

121
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,469
I wonder where it went.

122
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,803
It has to be here.

123
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,098
- There's no way I'd put it on my desk.
- [desk clatters]

124
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,392
- Where is it?
- [object clatters, scrapes]

125
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,520
Where exactly did I put it?

126
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,104
[quizzical music continues]

127
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,940
Goodness. I need to find it.

128
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,441
Could it be here?

129
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,735
I left it right here.

130
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,238
[woman] What are you looking for?

131
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,739
- Ow!
- Oops.

132
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,283
[breathes awkwardly] That hurt.

133
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,202
[chuckles] It didn't hurt.

134
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,578
Are you okay?

135
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,706
Do you want us to do it again?
No, I mean…

136
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,250
Why are you here?

137
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,169
Of course, I'm here for you.

138
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,712
For me?

139
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,340
I mean, I brought your lunch.

140
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,341
Ah…

141
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,885
You usually eat here, right?

142
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,221
[chuckles] I almost forgot.

143
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,639
Time to eat.

144
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,391
Alright. J-Join me.

145
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,644
- That's all for you. Eat up.
- A-Alright.

146
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,687
What's…

147
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,565
What's going on here? It's so messy.

148
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,275
[Anok] Well… Tsk!

149
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,361
I can't find my amulet.

150
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,990
That I got during my
medical mission at Mount Mukuna.

151
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,951
They say it can ward off evil spirits.

152
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,287
You believe in that?

153
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,788
Uh…

154
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,458
Well, it has sentimental value to me.

155
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,918
I…

156
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,545
I just put it here,

157
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,171
but it suddenly disappeared.

158
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,840
I wonder where it went.

159
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,927
Everything that is lost

160
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,972
finds its way back
when it's needed the most.

161
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,976
Go on and eat.

162
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,730
[Eden] Nurse Pogi,

163
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,441
I expect you to be professional.

164
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:13,571
No matter how entertaining Junjun's
actions are, he's still a patient.

165
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,698
Sorry, ma'am.

166
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,616
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:21,078
Are you forgetting his condition?
Is that why you're entertained?

168
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,582
Uh, ma'am, he has a manic syndrome.

169
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,752
He experiences abnormal,
elevated, or extreme changes

170
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,295
in his mood, emotions,

171
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,922
and energy or activity levels.

172
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,091
And in Junjun's case,

173
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:38,054
his manic episodes are
marked by exhibitionist behavior,

174
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,431
such as flashing people.

175
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,851
You're lucky Dr. Emman helped you.

176
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:47,021
What do we have
to remember when dealing with Junjun?

177
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,278
We have to have
eyes on Junjun at all times

178
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,155
because he keeps trying to escape.

179
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,199
It's hard to catch and restrain him.

180
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,493
You've seen how strong he is.

181
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,080
I remember now, ma'am.

182
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,291
I'll tell the orderlies
so they can be aware.

183

that a congressman's son

would have a condition like that?

188
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,223
Hey, Nurse Pogi!

189
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,853
Congressmen and

Patpat that you're drawing here.

Yes?

Of course not, Matmat!

00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,831
What if I pay you 50 pesos per drawing?

357
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,916
Well? That's 50 pesos.

358
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,212
Fifty pesos each! You want money, right?

359
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,047
- Fifty pesos?
- Yes.

360
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,841
If…

361
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,221
If Matmat receives a lot of 50 pesos,
he'll have more money.

362
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,639
- Yes, Matmat!
- [light-hearted music playing]

363
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,642
That's how business negotiations work.
Very good!

364
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,560
So?

365
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,979
You'll tell Patpat?

366
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,815
Here, I'll teach
you another business lesson.

367
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,733
This is a down payment.

368
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,987
See? Put it in your little pocket.

369
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,073
Now, take your art supplies.

370
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,033
Alright. Now, go draw them.

371
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,076
Go. Very good.

372
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,412
Draw a stegosaurus if you want.
That's your favorite, right?

373
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,789
Sir, here's our artist!

374
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,915
Alright.

375
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,835
- What do you say?
- Welcome to Jason's Inasal!

376
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,253
Welcome to Jason's Inasal!

377
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,131
Matmat, have a seat.
Don't worry. I got you.

378
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,091
Sir, I'll leave you and our artist.

379
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,093
He's a good boy. He only bites sometimes.

380
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,595
Just kidding! I'm kidding.

381
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,888
Go, Matmat! Do your magic.

382
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,514
[light-hearted music ends]

383
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,435
[Mia] Who here believes in fairytales?

384
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,022
Me! I do!

385
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,608
[Mia] Why?

386
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,736
[Bella] Because…

387
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,238
I'm a romantic.

388
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:03,577
And fairytales teach their readers
that true love conquers all!

389
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,453
- That's right.
- Right?

390
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,996
[patients gushing]

391
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,456
[Bella] Don't tease me!

392
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,042
[Tommy chuckles]

393
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:16,006
[enthralling music playing]

394
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:39,947
[enthralling music continues]

395
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,373
[Mia] <i>Open your eyes to the real world.</i>

396
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,292
<i>We should all be living our truths.</i>

397
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,543
[Patrick] <i>Mia.</i>

398
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,546
<i>I see it in your eyes. You like me too.</i>

399
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,798
<i>When will you leave me alone?</i>

400
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,341
<i>When you stop being a hypocrite.</i>

401
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,301
<i>I need nothing else.</i>

402
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,303
<i>Matmat and Patpat forever.</i>

403
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,515
[Mia] <i>You're jealous.</i>
<i>Because he let himself have fun.</i>

404
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,766
<i>You don't know me.</i>

405
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,602
<i>Why are you always angry at me?</i>

406
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,146
<i>Because you keep making me angry!</i>

407
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,357
<i>That means I have an effect on you.</i>

408
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,234
<i>A patient escaped.</i>

409
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,570
<i>Maravida! Freedom!</i>

410
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:24,116
[Mia] <i>That feeling that you can</i>
<i>leave everything behind to be happy…</i>

411
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:24,950
<i>Mia, stop!</i>

412
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,743
[Mia] <i>Let's go have some fun.</i>

413
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,245
