[Mia] Patrick?

Patrick, I'm in here--

18
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,268
Were you home all day?
Did you go outside?

19

Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,398
Vincent was here earlier.
We talked about the publishing--

21
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,025
Mia, there's something
more important that happened.

22
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,487
Is there anything more
important than my writing career--

Sir Samuel is missing.

Like gone?

27
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,745
Someone helped him
escape from the hospital.

28
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,415
And so?

I put him there so

That person definitely
knows the ins and outs here.

49
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,192
- Mia was home the whole day.
- So she knows?

50
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,111
Yes, but you know her.

- Where's Ma'am Eden?

52
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,906
Does she know of this?

53
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:22,118
She's not here yet.
Doc is also looking for her.

54
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,494

I don't know.

She's not here.

58

- She's also not here?
- Yes.

59
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,545
I can't reach them.
I called and texted them many times.

[Eden] Trust me.

63

I think I know who took Samuel.

Patrick, come with me.

65
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,648
I'll need a nurse aide to help get Samuel.

66
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,652
Uh, doc. With your permission.

67
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,362

I'll take you to the farmhouse
that I bought for us.

00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,292
I purchased it in installments.

73
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,045
I knew you wanted that.

74
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:20,009
You wanted to live in the countryside.
Tending to plants.

Busy during the harvest season.

[uneasy music continues]

78
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,520
And you're right.

79
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,816
You shouldn't die in
a place you don't like.

80
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,194
That's why I bought the farmhouse.

81
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,826
I'll be the last person you'll be with

82
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,495

00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,056
I know that Samuel is here.

88
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,641
I don't know what you're talking about.

89
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,560
- Get out of here!
- Stop lying!

- Patrick--
- You're trespassing!

91
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,356
- I'll file a case against you!
- I'll sue you for kidnapping!

92

Send an ambulance to Ma'am Olivia's.
Sir Samuel is here.

[Olivia grunts] No!

97

No! You don't know
what Samuel really wants!

- Just leave!
- Olivia!

99
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,303
You don't have
the right to do this to Samuel!

100

You're just a nurse!

101

I am not just a nurse!

102
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,852

cares about him so just leave!

- Take care.
- Yes, I will.

Is it true?

107
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,701
It was Ma'am Olivia?

108
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,953
Why would she take Sir Samuel?

109
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,623
And she even had
an accomplice who was also inside.

110
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,334
Let's not worry about that for now.

111
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,837
Pogi, call the cops.
Tell them to go to Olivia's home.

Okay, doc.

Miss Olivia Jose,

123
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,165
did you have an accomplice help you
take Samuel Hernandez out of the hospital?

124
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,167
Where is this person? Who is it?

125
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,169
It's a man.

126
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,963
And you need to find him.

127
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,715
So he can't take Samuel
out of the hospital again.

128
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,094
Why did you do this, Ma'am Olivia?

129

[somber music continues]

130
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,473
I can't leave you.

131
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,351
Because your soul

132
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,769
and my soul,

133
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,316

Take her with you.

[officer]
We still haven't arrested her accomplice.

142
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,058
But you can sue
Ms. Jose for illegal detention.

143
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,018
[Mia] No.

144
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,061
I don't care about him.

145
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,689
Mia, what do you mean?
You're not going to sue her?

146
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,066
No. It's a waste of time.

147
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,694
- You can let Olivia go.
- Mia--

148
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:07,904
- Just a second.
- [officer] Yes, sir.

149
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,491
- What happened to him is a serious matter.
- Patrick, I'm also serious.

150
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,243
- [sullen music playing]
- I don't care about him.

151
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,204
And to be honest,

152
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,080
I wish you'd have just let her have him.

153
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,042
At least there's someone
who wants to take care of that man.

154
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,920
Something I cannot commit to.

155
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,256
What if she's your mom?

156
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,968
- [sullen music continues]
- Are you seriously thinking that?

157
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,845
Don't you think it's
odd that of all people,

158
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,639
she wants to have Sir Samuel with her?

159
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,807
Why is she so interested in your dad?

You shouldn't care about--

166
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,282
I do care because
what if he hurts you again?

168
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,328
Mia, you need to face him.

So we can find out the truth.

you leave Maravida.

00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,620
So you won't be stressed anymore.

181
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,542
What if you move to Manila?

182
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,085
How about that?

183
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,046
It's more toxic there.

184
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,965
I'd be even more stressed out.

185
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,217
Then don't work in a hospital.

186
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,845
You can work in my office.
It's pretty chill there.

187
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,848
- I can make you my assistant.
- [soft music playing]

188
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,683
So you want me to take Madeth's job?

189
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,436
Don't worry about Madeth! I'm kidding.

190
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,146
I'd give her a different job.

191
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,522
- Vincent.
- Oh?

192
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,399
Why are we even talking about this?

193
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,277
I just want to…

194
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,404
I mean--

195
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,118
Are you open to living in Manila?

196
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:25,249
[soft music continues, fades]

197
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,294
What Olivia did was so shocking!

198
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,129
You're right.

199
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,840
I didn't think she could do such a thing.

200
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,509
It's a good thing you didn't promote her.

201
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,472
Thank God Samuel's back in the hospital.

202
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,184
So, Eden was the one
who knew where he was?

203
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,854
You gave the promotion
to the right person.

204
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,190
She found your patient so easily.

205
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,941
That's the thing, Li.

206
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,195
I think Eden found
him a little too quickly.

207
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,991
It's like she instantly knew
that Olivia was with Samuel.

208
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,785
How is that suspicious?

209
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,371
Shouldn't you just be thankful?

210
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,083
But Li, I have my doubts.

211
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,588
I know that Olivia and Eden
are hiding things from me.

Patrick…

223
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,785
Now's the time to inform Mia.

224
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:13,542
[somber music continues]

225
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,882
- Let go of me!
- You can't, ma'am.

226
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,219
- Samuel! Let go of me!
- You can't come in, ma'am.

227
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,553
- Ma'am--
- Samuel!

228
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,680
- Samuel!
- Ma'am Olivia!

229
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,266
Dr. Anok said you can't come here.

230
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,935
You're no longer part
of the hospital's staff.

231
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,646
I just want to see Samuel,
even for just a moment!

232
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,191
Ma'am. Ma'am, don't cause a scene.
The patients might see you.

233
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,651
I don't care!

234
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,320
I just want to see him! Samuel!

235
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,863
Samuel!

236
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,657
There's nothing for you here.

237
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,243
You can't visit him,
because he's already gone.

238
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,120
Huh? No!

239
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,705
That's not true.

240
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,583
You're just saying
that to make me go away--

241
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,751
Olivia!

242
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,128
The doctor already
announced his time of death, Olivia.

243
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,630
They're already prepping him.

244
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,008
No… Samuel!

245
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,094
- Samuel!
- This is all your fault.

246
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:10,933
If you hadn't taken him,
he might still be alive.

247
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,687
- [sobbing]
- This is your fault, Olivia.

248
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,232
Samuel died because of you.

249
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:22,069
[sobbing] No… No!

250
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,115
- Samuel! Samuel!
- Get her out of here.

251
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,117
Samuel!

252
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,288
Samuel!

253
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,081
Patrick.

254
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,876
Didn't I ask you to inform Mia?

255
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,629
Yes, ma'am.

256
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,756
[music fades]

257
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,554
What happened to Samuel was so tragic.

258
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,600
I thought that once he got back here,

259
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,728
he'd have a better
chance at living a long life.

260
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,647
I thought so too, Mama Li.

261
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,191
[melancholic music playing]

262
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:05,446
Is what I heard from
the security outside true?

263
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,740
Olivia was here and made a scene?

264
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,784
Mm-hmm.

265
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,329
And Eden is blaming
her for Samuel's death?

266
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,041
That seems to be the case.

267
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,501
[melancholic music continues]

268
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,671
I guess Miss Olivia is just sad.

269
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,800
All of the nurses here
grew fond of Mister Samuel.

270
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,182
Patrick, we…

271
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,311
We appreciate
you telling us before telling Mia.

272
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,774
It's important for me
to know this before her.

273
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,695
Vincent, I think you should
take care of Samuel's burial.

274
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,531
I'll tell Mia.

275
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,661
[melancholic music continues]

276
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,079
This is just…

277
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,707
This is just so heartbreaking because…

278
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,252
Mia really is an orphan now.

279
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:07,174
[melancholic music continues]

280
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,931
- Mia--
- I heard you the 1st time, Patrick

281
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,225
Is that all?

282
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,272
Mia…

283
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,941
Nothing changes.

284
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,651
I feel the same.

285
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,613
The man that I used to call my father,

286
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,865
is long dead to me.

287
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,703
Don't you have any requests?

288
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,207
Is there anything
you want for your papa's funeral?

289
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,252
Just do what needs to be done.

Of course.

00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,010
[Matmat] You're going to teach here again?

359
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:34,097
You're going to teach
while writing the book, Mia?

360
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,141
It's not yet final, Matmat.

361
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,642
And don't worry.

362
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,394
Our book is my priority.

363
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,397
We're about to finish it, Mia.

364
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,733
We're about to finish it, Patpat.

365
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,194
[Tommy] Matmat!

366
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,946
You're so impressive. You finally did it!

367
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:55,285
[hesitates]
What did Matmat do, Mister Tommy?

368
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,329
What we've talked about.

369
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,123
You finally found the door

370
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,417
that leads outside the box.

371
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,924
Matmat hasn't found it yet, Mister Tommy.

372
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:13,261
Because Matmat hasn't drawn
the butterfly yet.

373
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,055
Huh?

374
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,932
It wasn't you?

375
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,851
I thought… I thought…

376
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:24,481
[foreboding music playing]

377
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:44,417
[foreboding music intensifies]

378
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,379
Your suffering has finally ended.

379
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,515
[ominous music sting]

380
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:06,439
[ominous music playing]

381
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,733
[whimpers] No…

382
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,904
Matmat didn't… draw that.

383
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,866
That's not Matmat's drawing.

384
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,370
The butterfly has found Matmat.

385
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:25,458
[ominous music continues]

386
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,421
The butterfly has found Matmat.

387
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,965
- They've found me!
- [Patrick] Matmat.

388
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,758
The butterfly that killed Mama!

389
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,262
- Matmat, breathe.
- They killed Mama!

390
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,763
[cries]

391
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,849
- I don't like it, Patpat!
- [Patrick] Matmat.

392
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,934
- [Matmat] They'll kill us!
- [Patrick] No, Matmat.

393
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,228
- They won't.
- [Matmat] They'll kill us!

394
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,646
[Patrick] Matmat, I'm here.

395
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,316
- I won't leave you.
- That's what the lady…

396
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,067
That was what the lady was wearing.

397
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,111
- We'll overcome it, right?
- [Matmat whimpers]

398
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,488
- Matmat… Matmat.
- I don't like it, Patpat.

399
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,365
I don't like it.

400
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,201
[ominous music continues]

401
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,996
<i>Only the two of us</i>
<i>know about that design.</i>

402
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,914
<i>And now Matmat is saying</i>

403
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,000
<i>that she killed your mother?</i>

404
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,793
<i>Has the butterfly arrived?</i>

405
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,128
[Mia] <i>You knew.</i>

406
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,421
[Patrick] <i>Mia, it's not like that.</i>

407
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,423
[Mia] <i>I don't want her back to my life.</i>

408
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,008
<i>Do you not like Matmat?</i>

409
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,469
<i>Do you not like your big brother?</i>

410
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,470
<i>Leave!</i>

411
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,888
<i>If your mom is alive,</i>

412
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,139
<i>the more we need to stay with you.</i>

413
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,475
<i>All of us are just going to get hurt.</i>
