he's been holding a grudge against you,

I'm only saying what I see!

your past with your brother?!

[somber music continues]

Now it's my fault…

167

because when I'm with you,
it's like he doesn't exist.

[somber music continues]

169

It was a mistake that I ever entertained
having you in my life when we met again.

[somber music continues]

172
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,714
What about when you said
you were free because of me?

173
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,135
Was that also a mistake?

174
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,101
My reality is clearer to me now.

175
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,729
Stop lying.

176
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,442
That's why Matmat calls you a liar.

177
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,693
That's the truth.

178
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,903
Enough.

Patrick, please.

Enough.
