00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,337
Oh, this?

186
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,047
Let me tell you how, boss.

187
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,091
You see, the other day,

188
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,846
I went to the drugstore.
And I won the raffle they had there.

189
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,223
- Really?
- Yes. Can you believe it?

190
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,100
I was just planning to buy medicine

191
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,102
because you've been causing me headaches.

192
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,522
And I came home with a brand-new laptop!

193
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,773
I just don't get it.

194
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,402
Why are you always
the lucky one between us?

195
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,571
- [playful music playing]
- Oh…

196
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,240
Well, I can explain that, boss.

197
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,243
In my past life…

198
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,830
I was an angel.

199
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,707
Angel.

200
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,793
Anyway…

201
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,171
look here, boss.

202
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,675
Gemma Lyn Marie Bautista.

203
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,302
No boyfriend.

204
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,847
But not actively pursuing.

205
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,682
[playful music continues]

206
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,684
Okay. That's good.

207
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,395
- Okay. And?
- [music ends]

208
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,025
[car alarm honks]

209
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,694
[Patrick] Pogi?

210
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,531
Pogi.

211
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,578
Hey.

212
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,916
- [claps]
- Pogi!

213
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,626
Oh…

214
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,793
Patrick.

215
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,130
I didn't notice you.
I'm just about to leave.

216
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,383
Bye.

217
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,013
By the way, Patrick, I'm glad I saw you.

218
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,308
Can you inform the class
that Mia has been canceled?

219
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:30,935
What?

220
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,436
Wait, what I meant was,

221
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,607
tell Mia that all her classes
have been canceled, okay?

222
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,901
- All of them?
- Yeah.

223
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,945
It's been classroom-ed in the post.

224
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,113
Uh… Huh?

225
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,909
I mean, it's been posted in the classroom.

226
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,329
I have to go.
I don't want to get scolded by Miss Eden.

227
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,206
Wait. What's going on with you?

228
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,917
Lack of sleep, exhaustion, everything!

229
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,547
Pogi, you know you're
working the night shift,

230
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,465
so you should be sleeping during the day.

231
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,635
Whatever! If only Mister Samuel
didn't make us work all night.

232
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,346
What happened?

233
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,517
We just saw him
outside the room, unconscious.

234
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,728
[pensive music playing]

235
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,938
He was…

236
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,941
Hold up.

237
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,360
- You might get hurt out there.
- Hey!

238
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,862
You shouldn't drive.

239
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,240
But Patrick, how will I get home?

240
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,450
Hey, come on.

241
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,203
- Give me back my helmet. You moron!
- [pensive music fades]

242
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:36,000
Three years ago, she and Patrick met
in Santa Monica. They were working there.

243
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,918
- Okay.
- She has a mother.

244
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,045
But her father,

245
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,464
kicked the bucket.

246
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,843
- That's sad.
- Mm…

247
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,344
- That's sad.
- Yes.

248
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,721
Okay. And then?

249
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,515
- She's an only child.
- Okay.

250
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:57,021
And her mother is currently working
in the cafeteria at OK Hospital.

251
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,025
Thanks for watching. Thanks for listening.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

252
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:05,154
Wait, what about favorite color?
Favorite food? Motto in life?

253
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,071
[claps]

254
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,991
Ah…

255
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,203
So, you want her slam book answers, boss?

256
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,414
Your research isn't enough! Come on!

257
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,084
Well, I didn't know
you were that old-school.

258
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,836
But, boss…

259
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:25,549
I noticed you cracking
a smile while listening.

260
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,968
It's like, your mood totally improves

261
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,179
when she's the topic of conversation.

262
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,015
- [playful music playing]
- [gushes]

263
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,517
I bet you like Miss Gemma, don't you?

264
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,897
Well, if that's the case,
what are you waiting for?

265
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,191
Ask her out! Go for it!

266
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,779
Well, between me
and Patrick, who's more…

267
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,905
More handsome?

268
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:53,452
- The more handsome and better guy overall?
- [playful music continues]

269
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,496
Yeah.

270
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,289
Obviously, Patrick.

271
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,585
- Patrick.
- No, not you!

272
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,754
What about from Gemma's perspective?

273
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,839
- Ah…
- Well?

274
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,007
Still Patrick.

275
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,636
Of course, it's still Patrick.
Are you kidding me?

276
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,722
Real talk, boss.
It's Patrick we're talking about.

277
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,351
Real talk? Well, let's do a
real talk about your bonus.

278
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,853
Bonus? Wait, boss, the food!

279
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,063
Eat them all yourself!

280
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,357
- But this hasn't been paid yet.
- Then pay for it!

281
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,900
[playful music ends]

282
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,778
- [Tommy] Nurse?
- [machine beeps steadily]

283
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,948
Can you find out what happened to him?

284
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,659
They're already checking the CCTV footage.

285
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,577
Do you think,

286
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,081
the tumor in his brain has come back?

287
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,624
You see.

288
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,044
He's been rambling nonsense again.

289
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,381
- [pensive music playing]
- [machine continues beeping steadily]

290
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,924
Has he said something?

291
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,847
Yes, but I don't understand any of it.

292
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,101
It's like he's in a dream or something.

293
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,938
I'll inform Doctor Anok.

294
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,025
[Tommy] Thank you, nurse. Thank you.

295
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,652
[pensive music continues, fades]

[machine beeping steadily]

297
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,203
Did you hear her last night, too?

298
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,041
I wasn't here last night.

299
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,961
I heard her.

300
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,964
She was humming.

301
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,342
Humming?

302
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,219
[machine continues beeping steadily]

303
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,554
Are you sure?

304
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:43,228
[Samuel humming]

[haunting music playing]

306
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,239
She's already dead.

307
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,201
Why…

308
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,912
Why was she here?

309
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,333
[haunting music continues]

310
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,502
Who are you talking about?

311
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,883
She's already dead,
but she still lingers here.

312
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,178
Who?

313
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,806
Is it your wife?

314
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,768
Is she the one you're talking about?

315
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:28,273
[haunting music continues]

316
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,657
[Samuel resumes humming]

317
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,952
[Patrick] It's just like
what Mister Dipong said.

318
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,958
Is Mia's mother haunting him, too?

319
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,920
- [humming fades]
[haunting music turns unsettling]

320
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,005
She was declared dead.

321
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,550
Even though her body wasn't found.

322
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,677
[unsettling music continues]

323
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,554
[Dipong] If I were the two of you…

324
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,806
I would leave this place.

325
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,100
Because she's coming back.

326
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,229
[Samuel] She's already dead,
but she's still here.

327
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,069
[Patrick] Dead?

328
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,571
Or are you still alive, Ingrid?

329
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:21,201
[unsettling music continues]

330
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,286
Yeah.

331
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,583
[Patrick] Just when
you've started to move on.

332
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,877
[unsettling music fades]

333
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,878
[exhales sharply]

- [pensive music playing]
- [chuckles softly]

335

[sighs deeply]

336
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,429
What the heck, Patrick?

337
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,975
You're really thinking about her?

338
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:52,482
[pensive music continues]

339
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,154
[pensive music fades]

340
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,447
[exhales heavily]

[Tommy humming]

351
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:01,551
I heard Samuel humming that tune.

352
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,846
He said he always hears it.

353
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,431
Do you know what song it is?

354
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:14,356
[foreboding music continues]

355
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,366
Patrick, hold on. Please wait for her.

356
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:33,000
[foreboding music continues]

357
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,630
Zelda, I have some questions for you.

358
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,758
- [Zelda] Hmm?
- Hopefully, you can help us.

359
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:46,263
It depends on whether I know the answers.

360
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:55,397
Did you see Samuel last
night at around 12 midnight?

361
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,401
[music turns suspenseful]

362
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,610
Hmm…

363
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,532
I went out to get some
fresh air around that time, but…

364
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,703
I didn't see him.

365
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,751
So when you went out
to get some fresh air,

366
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,086
were you humming?

367
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:26,011
[suspenseful music intensifies]

368
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,897
[suspenseful music crescendos]

369
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,902
- Patpat and I are going to eat.
- I'm coming with you.

370
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,737
This is where you eat? Why?

371
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,198
This is where we used to eat with Mama.

372
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,701
They're already noticing her.

373
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,079
- Who?
- The ghost.

374
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,455
She's hiding something.

375
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,541
Report back to me
even the tiniest detail you notice.

376
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,252
Do you want me to settle that?

377
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,463
- Is he your boyfriend?
- He's not my boyfriend.

378
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,216
- You look happy.
- Are you jealous?
