1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,460
[Cynthia] Didn't he used to abuse her?

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,295
He's the reason Bella's traumatized.

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,840
Whatever you say,
I'm not coming back to you!

4
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,633
Don't you understand that, huh?!

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,346
They say that only
insecure men hurt women.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,056
I told you to stay out of this.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,099
- [grunts]
- [slaps]

8
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,767
- Mia!
- I told you!

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,020
[blow lands]

10
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:28,945
[Kai] Even when you know
that you shouldn't follow your heart,

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,533
what can you do, when your head and heart

12
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,118
keep shouting her name?

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,578
Patrick!

14
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,205
[Matmat] Patpat!

15
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,041
Stop punching him.

16
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,626
It's wrong to hurt people.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,211
Don't hurt him.

18
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,882
It can't be, was she in love?

19
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:57,432
[theme music playing]

20
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:51,611

[solemn music continues]

[solemn music continues]

23
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,781
Are you hurt?

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,166
[solemn music continues]

25
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,881
[thud]

26
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,845
[solemn music fades]

27
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:03,975
Patrick, haven't
you read the rules in the handbook?

28
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:08,688
Staff must never cause
harm to any patient or visitor.

29
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,065
Jerome wants to press charges against you.

30
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,776
Patpat.

31
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,529
[stammers] You should say sorry.

32
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,074
You did something bad.

33
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,166
I will accept whatever punishment
you deem appropriate.

34
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,710
[Matmat whimpers]

35
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,963
Are you not going to say sorry?

36
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:34,964
[Eden] Wait.

37
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,634
Aren't you going to apologize to Jerome?

38
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,683
Doc, if you're worried about Mia,

39
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,644
we'll speak to Jerome.

40
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,022
So he can also be held
accountable for hurting her.

41
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,442
Patrick, you've put
the hospital in a very tough position.

42
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,737
For sure, the hospital
will be implicated in this.

43
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,030
Doc Anok?

44
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,866
[sighs] Tsk.

45
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,120
This is the second time you've had
an encounter at the hospital, Patrick.

46
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,251
First, when you talked back
to Congressman Martinez, now this.

47
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,130
I have no choice but
to suspend you for 10 days.

48
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,216
Without pay.

49
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:23,471
[somber music playing]

50
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:34,148

[music fades]

52
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,117
You were really suspended?

53
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,159
Mm-hmm.

54
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,202
Are you okay?

55
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,246
I'm fine. At least I wasn't fired.

56
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,914
What about you and Matmat?

57
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,876
Maybe Doc will change
his mind if you apologize to Jerome.

58
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,336
- Just say--
- Gemma.

59
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,464
It's what I wanted.

60
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,217
You did it on purpose?

61
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:08,308
[soft music playing]

62
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,279
You did it for Mia.

63
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:29,704
[soft music continues]

64
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,833
[Bella] Patrick. Patrick!

65
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,710
Patrick.

66
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,881
[sobbing] Patrick, I'm sorry.

67
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,302
Am I the reason you lost your job?

68
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,970
Was it because of Jerome?

69
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,931
Patrick, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

70
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,934
No, Bella. I was only suspended.

71
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,853
[sniffles, sobs]

72
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,313
Still, Patrick.

73
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,523
If Jerome hadn't come here,

74
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,858
- then maybe…
- [Kai] Patrick…

75
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,277
- [breathes heavily] Maybe--
- Thank you.

76
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,529
If you hadn't come,

77
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,364
Jerome might have hurt Bella too.

78
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,450
You were amazing, man!

79
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,870
You were like an action star! [chuckles]

80
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,208
[soft thud]

81
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,801
What happened to him? Why is he smiling?

82
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,885
Huh?

83
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,887
[sobs] He's not.

84
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:32,225
Patrick is sad. He got suspended.

85
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:33,976
Without pay.

86
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,896
[sighs sharply] Poor guy.

87
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,774
Doesn't look like it.

88
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,318
I've never seen anyone
so happy after being suspended.

89
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,530
[glum music playing]

90
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,532
[Matmat] You should apologize.

91
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,408
[Eden] Aren't
you going to apologize to Jerome?

92
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,286
[Gemma] Maybe Doc will change his mind
if you apologize to Jerome.

93
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,621
[Patrick] But Gemma…

94
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,706
That's what I wanted.

95
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:03,005
[music turns upbeat romantic]

96
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:31,492
[romantic music continues]

97
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,458
[exhales softly]

98
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,463
Why are you smiling?

99
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,964
Didn't you get punished?

100
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,758
I'm suspended.

101
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,595
[laughs softly]

102
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,305
And that's a good thing?

103
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,974
Suspended without pay.

104
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,727
And the guy I punched is pressing charges.

105
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,562
[chuckles]

106
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:03,483
[romantic music continues]

107
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,859
[chuckles]

108
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,319
Everything's a mess.

109
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,451
You said…

110
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,912
you'd leave everything behind

111
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,624
if I just asked
you to run away from all this.

112
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:24,045
[romantic music continues]

113
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,171
You mean…

114
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:26,881
Let's go?

115
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:32,970
[romantic music continues]

116
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,767
Let's run away?

117
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:45,775
[romantic music continues]

118
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,360
[car engine revving]

119
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,280
I know! Taiwan.

120
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,242
It's close and
we don't need a travel visa.

121
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,579
[music fades slowly]

122
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,164
Is that a look of regret?

123
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,834
You don't want us to leave together?

124
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,379
[hesitates] No.

125
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,216
I was just thinking
I left something behind.

126
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,385
[Matmat] Patpat…

127
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,303
Patpat…

128
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,306
If you left something at the hospital,

129
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,975
don't worry about it.

130
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,852
So? Taiwan?

131
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,941
Mia, I don't have a passport.

132
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,986
You don't have a passport?

133
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:35,116
You're asking me to run away
but we can't even leave the Philippines?

134
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,411
Mia, Matmat and
I never made it a priority.

135
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,540
Fine.

136
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,542
We'll go to Montanesa.

137
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,210
Montanesa?

138
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,337
That's five hours away.

139
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,091
I'll make it in four if I drive fast.

140
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:57,847
Um, why don't we go to Aplaya instead?

141
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,391
Aplaya? That's still in Maravida.

142
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,394
But we've never been there.
Let's just get some fresh air.

143
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,730
I can't stay…

144
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,399
overnight anyway.

145
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,902
What?!

146
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,948
- [car engine revving]
- [foreboding music playing]

147
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,366
Mia, slow down.

148
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,494
Answer me honestly.

149
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:25,458
I've been planning all of this and now
you're saying you can't stay overnight?!

150
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,668
Mia, I'm thinking of Matmat.

151
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,629
What?!

152
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,091
- [car engine revving, roaring]
- [foreboding music continues]

153
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,926
Mia, what are you doing?

154
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,304
I'll drive this car off the cliff.

155
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,180
What?!

156
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,431
We'll die together!

157
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,642
Mia, that's not funny! Mia!

158
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,893
[car engine revving]

159
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,728

165
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,118
What's wrong with you?!

166
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,496
That's not a good joke!

167
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,832
Do I look like I'm joking?!

168
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,127
You don't make sense!

169
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,422
You asked me to run away,
but you can't even stay long?

170
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,217
What kind of vacation is that?!

171
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,344
- Please understand--
- No!

172
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,804
I will not listen to you!

173
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,222
I am very angry!

174
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,058
Get out.

175
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,938
I said, get out!

176
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,148
[quirky music playing]

177
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,234
Get out!

Hey.

186
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,067
Dear, do you want
me to add you to this dish?

187
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,778
At least I won't be alone.

188
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,405
Huh?

189
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,908
Ma…

190
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,744
Should I really move on?

191
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,164
Sweetie.

192
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:33,502
I wouldn't be rooting for Vincent
if there was still hope for Patrick.

193
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,129
The thing is,

194
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,506
there's nothing. It's hopeless.

195
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,677
Was Papa your first love, Ma?

196
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,720
What?

197
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,013
Why are you asking me that?

198
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,267
Is Anok right around the corner?

199
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,268
What?

200
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,729
Oh, I was just asking.

201
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,731
Why do you want to know?

202
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:57,735
What's your Papa and
I got to do with your love life?

203
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,029
Well for starters,

204
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,490
if Papa wasn't your first love…

205
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,159
How did you move on from your ex?

206
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,369
How did you find
your happy ending with Papa?

207
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,123
I have moved on.
I gave birth to you, right?

208
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,458
So how did you do it?

209
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,834
[pensive music playing]

210
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,129
Well, when your Papa was here.

211
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:22,843
He reminded me
that I had a lot of love to give.

212
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:28,307
So why be selfish when
you have a lot of love in your heart?

213
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,310
[pensive music fades]

214
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,437
[Jason] Bro!

215
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,815
I got the vibe that you ran out,
so here you go.

216
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,651
- I brought more.
- Nice. Leg part?

217
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,903
Yeah, of course.
You already had some breast.

218
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,071
Perfect. Thank you.

219
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,572
Alright, enjoy.

220
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,579
Bro, smile.

221
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,914
- Smile!
- What are you doing?

222
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,916
- [shutter clicks]
- It's just a picture. Smile!

223
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,084
- There.
- [shutter clicks]

224
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,586
I just want to immortalize this moment

225
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,922
while you still have your appetite…

226
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,632
- [shutter clicks]
- …and you're still healthy.

227
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,176
Because one of these days,
I'll need to get you checked.

228
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,637
Why?

229
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,307
I wasn't injured,
Mia and I didn't get into an accident.

230
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:14,144
I wish you got hit so it'll
knock some sense into you.

231
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,396
There. There it is.

232
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,231
So you want me to get into an accident?

233
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,942
- Blah. Blah. Blah. You seem happy.
- [tray clacks]

234
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,443
Be honest with me.

235
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,156
In your whole life,
you've never been suspended.

236
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,158
And now you're happy about it?!

237
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,245
And then you invited Mia
to go on a vacation with you?

238
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,538
You're unbelievable.

239
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,290
I don't know, bro.

240
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,834
That's what I felt at the time.

241
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,252
I know what it is, bro.

242
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,546
Unfortunately,
I know what your problem is.

243
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,630
What?

244
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,383
Miatitis.

245
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,593
What?

246
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,886
Miatitis!

247
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,638
A disease you got from Mia.

248
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,807
Give me your hand. See this?

249
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,642
- Hurts, doesn't it?
- Ow!

250
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,521
Ever since Mia cut your palm,
the stupidity started.

251
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,065
It's a virus,
and it's spreading to your brain.

252
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,859
[in soft voice] Mia, Mia, ahh!

253
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,319
You're crazy.

254
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,737
Let's go apply for a passport.

255
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,864
[quirky music playing]

256
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,325
Where did that come from? No transitions?

257
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,410
Let's go apply for a passport.

258
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,121
Okay, sure. I'm game for that.

259
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,541
[quirky music continues]

260
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,586
Just to be sure,
we're not going to work abroad, right?

261
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,006
For vacation.

262
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,800
[quirky music continues]

263
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,013
- Bro--
- Just let me do this.

264
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,348
Ugh!

265
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,562
[upbeat techno music
playing in background]

266
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,813
[glass thuds]

267
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,323
[upbeat techno music continues]

268
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,866
Are you going to play, ma'am?

269
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,785
- Yes.
- Alright, ma'am.

270
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,794
[piercing noise]

271
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,588
- [offbeat music playing]
- [background music fades]

272
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,465
So pretty.

273
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,514
[offbeat music continues]

274
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,307
Mmm, hi.

275
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,688
- Ugh!
- [dart thuds]

276
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,483
- [screaming]
- [quirky effects playing]

277
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,403
[quirky effect plays]

278
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,031
[screaming]

279
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,367
[offbeat music continues]

280
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,952
- Ugh!
- [poof effect]

281
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,454
You deserve that.

282
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:41,959
[offbeat music continues]

283
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,465
- [offbeat music fades]
- [footsteps receding]

284
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,718
Really? Vincent's courting Gemma?

285
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,220
Dude, right in front of my face.
He's got a lot of nerve.

286
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,765
Do you really like Gemma?

287
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,686
Yeah, bro! [giggles]

288
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,189
You think I'm fooling
around when I call her 'pretty love'?

289
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,109
There. That's why
Auntie Li doesn't take you seriously.

290
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,944
But why? Why?

291
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,865
It's a term of endearment.
I'm trying to be sweet to Gemma.

292
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,992
Bro, just be yourself.

293
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,536
And don't be cocky. She hates that.

294
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,955
Bro, that's not me. I'm not cocky.

295
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,874
- You know what type I am?
- What?

296
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,836
- I'm the charming type. Right?
- [both chuckle]

297
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,504
I'm a low-key kind of guy.

298
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,674
Vincent is the cocky one.
He gets all the attention.

299
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,136
She'll notice you, too. Just be patient.

300
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,390
Do you have plans tomorrow?
Are you going to open your restaurant?

301
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,894
- I know you too well. Fine.
- I haven't said anything.

302
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:46,398
Blah-blah. I've heard
that many times before. [chuckles]

303
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,650
You have a favor and need to go elsewhere.

304
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,903
If you need to go, just go.

305
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,072
Go. Leave. Goodbye.

306
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,239
Thank you, bro.

307
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,830
- Mister Dipong.
- Forgive me. Did I scare you?

308
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,582
Yeah.

309
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,917
You're here early.

310
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,962
Yeah. I'm scheduled to check the pipes.

311
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,048
Have you had any
problems with the water supply?

312
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,175
None so far. Have you eaten?

313
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,804
Don't worry about me, Patrick.
I'm good. Thank you.

314
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,724
By the way,
I found these letters by the gate.

315
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,727
There's an electricity bill in there.

316
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,147
[chuckles] I'm surprised
people still send snail mail.

317
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,567
Oh, yes. This town is still old-fashioned.

318
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,404
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

319
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,117
If you need something,

320
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,536
I'll be outside. Just call me.

321
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,246
Okay.

322
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:51,380

324
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,105
Mister Dipong!

325
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,525
- Have a drink.
- Oh. Thank you.

326
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,152
[liquid sloshing]

327
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,403
Thanks.

328
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,739
Mister Dipong,

329
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,616
what song were you humming earlier?

330
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,536
You were humming
a tune before you cut the grass.

331
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,665
Oh. I can't recall the title of the song.

332
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,960
But I heard it from Ma'am Ingrid.

333
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,588
[ominous music sting]

334
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,964
Mia's mom?

335
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,591
Yeah.

336
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,843
It was her favorite.

337
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,220
She used to always sing it.

338
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:46,018
[ominous music continues]

339
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,978
I've got to go.

340
00:19:54,484 --> 00:20:01,366

[sinister music playing]

343
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,798
What is she doing there?

344
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,471
[water splashes]

345
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:31,438

00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,710
- Ingrid?
- [grunts] Ah!

352
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,713
[groans] Argh!Argh!

are scarier than the dead.

00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,561
Where are you, Ingrid?

356
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,980
Where could you be?

[ominous music crescendos]

358
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,401
We like the same things.

359
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,696
Matmat is Mia Hernandez's best friend.

360
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,865
Mia, let's talk.
Why are you throwing things at me?

361
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,408
Are you coming with me somewhere far away?

362
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,243
Mia. Hey!

363
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,369
Don't talk to me.

364
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,539
I was enraged when
I saw that you got hurt.

365
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,167
He can't get enough of me.

366
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,253
I think I'm losing my mind.
Maybe I'm crazy.

367
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,630
Is that a bad thing?
