Matmat and Patpat's surname is…

Gonzales.

184

She's Mia Hernandez.

We're not related by blood.

186

Matmat, you can choose your family.

187
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,704
And that's why I choose
you and Patrick to be my family.

Yes.

I have an idea.

we can be a family?

No.

359
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,104
I didn't do anything.

360
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,568
Something happened at the hospital.

361
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:45,113
[sullen music continues]

[groans]

363
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,658
You're killing me, Patrick!

364
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,996
You can't look like that
in the family photo.

365
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,749
I won't take no for an answer. I won't!

366
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,793
[sullen music fades]

367
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,211
- Uh…
- [glass thuds]

368
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,880
So writers really do talk to themselves?

369
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,007
What's wrong with Patrick?

370
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,926
Um…

371
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,721
First of all, you should lock the gate.

372
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,641
It's late,
and I got in without any trouble.

373
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,975
I unlocked it for you.

374
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,852
And second, did you need this many?

375
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,063
All of these? Look how many!

376
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,899
You could've just texted me.
My phone's right here.

377
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,443
We have each other's numbers,
or you could've emailed me.

378
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,861
Don't you want to earn money?

379
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,614
Well, I do believe
that the best customer service

380
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,407
is hand-delivering orders personally,

381
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,868
so I don't mind
doing this from time to time.

382
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,703
So, how can I serve you today, ma'am?

383
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,749
What's wrong with Patrick?

384
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,209
[quirky music playing]

385
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,794
Uh, many things.

386
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,171
He's resilient to a fault.

387
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,258
His face card is unreal.
I mean, you've seen him.

388
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,009
Sometimes,
I can't believe he's that handsome.

389
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,427
Ugh! That's not what I mean!

390
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,889
I mean, what's wrong with Patrick today?

391
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,141
Oh, today?

392
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,935
I haven't talked
to him today, so I don't know.

393
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,812
But you're his best friend.

394
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,313
You should know what's upsetting him.

395
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,066
Yes, yes, yes.
I know I'm his best friend, okay?

396
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,778
That's why I know that if
something's bothering him

397
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,322
or if he's worried or hurt,

398
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,158
he won't talk to anyone about it.

399
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,827
Frustrating, right?

400
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,829
He has a bad habit
of hiding his feelings.

401
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,541
[somber music playing]

402
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,042
He's so great at it,

403
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:26,006
that no one or nothing can force him

404
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,633
to share whatever
goes on in his mind and heart.

405
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,720
So the only thing I can do as his friend

406
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,890
is be there for him

407
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,017
in case he needs…

408
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,811
someone.

409
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,814
You have to wait until he opens up.

410
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:48,653
You see,
when he and Matmat became orphans,

411
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,950
he had no one
to talk to about his struggles.

412
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,495
So he just kept them to himself.

413
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,667
[Jason] <i>From a young age, he learned to…</i>

414

[music turns stirring]

[stirring music ends]

419
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,875
Attorney, I know so much time has passed,

420
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,964
but I want to seek
justice for my mother's death.

421
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,301
I understand how you feel

422
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,680
because you learned some new information.

423
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:01,184
But Patrick, we need strong
evidence to reopen the case.

424
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,560
[foreboding music playing]

425
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,229
My brother, Matmat.

426
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,315
Can he testify as
witness even if he has autism?

427
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,734
Of course.

428
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:14,656
If the testimony of
a person with disability is coherent,

429
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,492
it is admissible in court.

430
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,121
Okay.

431
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,707
[foreboding music continues]

432
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:28,211
Okay, I'll ask my
brother to testify in Mama's case.

433
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:33,842
But can he say
that it was really Ingrid Hernandez

434
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,887
he saw at the scene
of the crime at that time?

435
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,516
That he saw Hernandez's face?

436
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,146
He said he saw a butterfly broach.

437
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:49,190
I saw a picture of her wearing it.

438
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,651
If that was really Ingrid's,

439
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:56,114
is your brother sure
that it was her was wearing it

440
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,826
at the time and place
that the crime happened?

441
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,331
Attorney, she killed Mama.
She even wrote it in her book.

442
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,958
But it's a book of fiction.

443
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:10,795
And it doesn't help

444
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:14,215
that the person
you want to file a case against

445
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,760
is already dead in the eyes of the law.

446
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,973
I strongly believe that she is alive.

447
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,892
That's another thing.

448
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:28,271
Ingrid Hernandez is a known personality.

449
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,522
If she's still alive,

450
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,399
where is she?

451
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,650
But…

452
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,198
what if she changed her face?
Had plastic surgery?

453
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,616
That's possible, right?

454
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,912
Then we need
to prove that Ingrid Hernandez

455
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,415
and that person are one and the same.

456
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,002
Can you do that, Patrick?
