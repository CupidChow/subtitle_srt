You decided to be idiots today!

27

Your only job was to put
the photo I picked in a frame,

I apologize for the inconvenience.

have the frame you wanted.

Why?

Because?

170
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,705
Because my favorite writer is in here.

Not only that, of course,

00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,960
Mia is very inspired
to write here in Maravida.

Second, the cost of
living here is cheaper.

Third, office spaces are also cheap.

[dramatic music continues]

365
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,006
Hey, wait a minute, Patrick.

366
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,675
It's okay, Dipong.

367
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,428
What do you want, Patrick?

368
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,515
I found these.

369
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,600
Letters from Mister Samuel.

370
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,062
[dramatic music continues, fades]

371
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,356
- I've long wondered if you're--
- Ingrid?

372
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,694
You thought I was Mia's mother?

373
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,196
[sullen music playing]

374
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,156
I wish I were.

375
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,285
Then I'd be Samuel's wife.

376
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,913
How long have you known Samuel?

377
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,166
I've known him since college.

378
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,878
He was my first and only love.

379
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,089
- [young Samuel] Olivia!
- [Olivia] <i>I came from</i>

380
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,674
- <i>a poor family.</i>
- I'm here!

381
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,175
- The smell's making me hungry!
- [Olivia] <i>But he accepted me</i>

382
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,553
- <i>though I had nothing.</i>
- Hmm! Delicious!

383
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,929
[young Olivia] <i>What do you have there?</i>

384
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,264
[young Samuel]
<i>A little something for you.</i>

385
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,766
And another special gift too.

386
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,768
<i>I know you're going to like it.</i>

387
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,690
[young Samuel] <i>How many more</i>
<i>poems are we going to read?</i>

388
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,443
[young Olivia] <i>I love</i>
<i>reading when I'm with you.</i>

389
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,069
[young Samuel] <i>"Each moment…</i>

390
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,572
<i>the hours dim,</i>

391
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,158
<i>yet hope lingers…"</i>

392
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,410
[young Olivia] <i>"…that our hearts…</i>

393
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,537
<i>…will finally be as one."</i>

394
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,916
[Olivia] <i>But Ingrid and</i>
<i>Samuel's marriage was arranged</i>

395
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,794
<i>to save their estate.</i>

396
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,172
<i>Ingrid comes from a wealthy family,</i>

397
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,507
<i>so what chance did I have against her?</i>

398
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,426
It felt like…

399
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,261
[melancholic music playing]

400
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:30,223
they stole the only man I ever loved.

401
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,977
After how many decades,

402
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,229
I had searched for him.

403
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,982
- [melancholic music continues]
- [breathes deeply]

404
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,609
I found him.

405
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,570
He's at OK Hospital.

406
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:48,158
[sobbing softly]
I learned about his condition,

407
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,452
and I thought…

408
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,620
I…

409
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,289
I could care for him myself.

410
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,999
[sniffles]

411
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,293
To be the last person by his side

412
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,921
until his final breath.

413
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,380
[sniffles]

414
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:06,384
[melancholic music continues, fades]

415
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,012
But why didn't you tell
Mia about your connection?

416
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,514
[inhales sharply]

417
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,099
[exhales shakily]

418
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,061
Because Ingrid will come back.

419
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,689
- [breathes deeply]
- [tense music sting]

420
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,780
I saw her rise
from the lake, Patrick.

421
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,449
- [ominous music playing]
- And this scar?

422
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,742
She did this.

423
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,328
I know she's alive.

424
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,248
I don't know where she is,
but I know she's alive.

425
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,834
[ominous music continues]

426
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,671
[Olivia] I found out Dipong
was taking care of the mansion.

427
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,381
So I hired him

428
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,134
to keep an eye for Ingrid's return.

429
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:52,222
I had him watch over Mia too.

430
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,684
Who else would Ingrid be coming back for…

431
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,645
[exhales heavily] …but her daughter?

432
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,649
Ingrid is alive.

433
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,443
And I'm also waiting for her return.

434
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,906
I want to make
her pay for my mother's death.

435
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,617
[ominous music continues]

436
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,536
[Patrick] If you're not Ma'am Ingrid,

437
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,122
then I have to go.

438
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:25,463
[music becomes suspenseful]

439
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,049
Mia!

440
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,886
Mia?! Mia!

441
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,721
Patrick?

442
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,806
- [hurried footsteps]
- [Patrick] Mia?!

443
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,559
Mia, Olivia isn't your mother.

444
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,270
So that means,
there's only one person who could be.

445
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,689
Eden.

446
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,441
[Patrick] Look at this.

447
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,985
I found one of Eden's stories
at her house.

448
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,237
- [music becomes tense]
- You're also a writer.

449
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,781
I'm sure you recognize
your mother's writing.

450
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,368
[tense music continues]

451
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,995
[Vio] <i>What?</i>

452
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,413
She did it again.

453
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,706
<i>That's Mama's.</i>

454
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,124
<i>Ma'am Eden's a writer?</i>

455
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,918
[Vio] <i>Yeah.</i>

456
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,044
- [camera shutter clicks]
- <i>It's kind of her hobby.</i>

457
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,796
<i>It's her hobby to edit my works too.</i>

458
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,883
[tense music continues]

459
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,136

[tense music swells]

464
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,190
[Mia] I can hear my mother's voice.

465
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,860
This is her writing style.

466
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,576
- [music turns foreboding]
- [breathing heavily]

467
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,877
[breathing shakily, heavily]

468
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,213
Eden is my mother.

[gasps]

00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,385
[foreboding music continues]

471
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:58,431
Patrick, she's disliked
you since we were kids.

472
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,601
Now that she's back,
I'm sure she'll try to harm you!

473
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,396

She lived it for real.

The words on her manuscript.

479
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,539
You read it?

480
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,916
[Patrick] Yes, I found it here.

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,502
[foreboding music continues]

482
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,545
In here.

[ominous music sting]

484
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:34,676
I read something about transformation.

485
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,971
She must have taken
a new face to hide herself.

486
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:41,474
[music becomes eerie]

487
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,976

[eerie music sting]

I'm sure she did exactly that.

491
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:08,335
To take advantage of it,
to get what she wants.

492
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,378
I know her.

493
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,590
That's why she wanted
Mister Samuel under her care.

494
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,468
She wanted Papa under her control.

495
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,720
That's why she came back

496
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,514
to do the same to me.
