Grr!

182
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,341
[Madeth] Boss! Boss!

183
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,426
Oh, Madeth!
What did the security team say?

184
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,638
Boss, we've reviewed every CCTV footage,

185
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,099
but we still couldn't find Miss Mia.

186
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,517
Grr!

187
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,311
I just looked away for a second,
and you already caused trouble again!

188
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,357
I've just settled the issue that happened
at St. Benedict Hospital,

189
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,568
and the endorsements
have just started picking up again.

190
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,112
But now, there's another threat!

191
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,031
- [quirky music playing]
- Threat?

192
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,157
There's a death threat?

193
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,076
There's a death threat against Miss Mia?

194
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,661
Boss, someone wants to kill Miss Mia?

195
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,373
Madeth, we can't let
the new scandal leak! That's it!

196
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,916
What is it about?

197
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,168
Hmm…

198
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,546
Oh, come on. What is it?

199
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,047
Another secret?

200
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,508
Everything's a secret!
She's hiding so many things!

201
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,304
Secret personality, secret identity,
secret family, secret--

202
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,306
Miss Mia is hiding so many things, boss!

203
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,475
This is so hard! Let's just be
authentic and reveal everything!

204
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,146
If you reveal it all at once,
you won't have any problems!

205
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,065
Madeth, you don't understand.

206
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,777
No go and find Mia.

207
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:13,821
Go!

208
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,281
I'm on it!

[Dennis] Oh, what now?

216
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,870
Changed your mind?

[unsettling music playing]

218
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,916
And you think I'd
actually tell you my life story?

219
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,838
Well, I only need some information.

220
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,299
I actually know a lot about you.

221
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,510
You don't know me.

222
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,719
I don't know you?

223
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,721
Okay.

224
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,973
Mia Hernandez.

225
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,519
The most beloved

[unsettling music crescendos]

228
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,446
Are you surprised?
Who's going to buy your books

229
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,199
once they find out
the writer's mentally unstable?

230
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,369
Who'll still send you endorsements

231
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:49,375
once they learn you and
Vincent cover up your mess

232
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,293
with money and influence?

233
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,547
All because of your disorder.

234
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,882
That's it?

235
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,970
Well… [chuckles wryly]

236
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,221
Let's go all in then.

About your mom.

238
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,851
Is she dead?

239
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,436
Or still alive?

240
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,272

Yes.

248
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,840
And one more thing, Mia.

249
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,758
Just one night.

250
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,512
You can think of it as a one-night stand.

251
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,057
That's enough to keep me quiet.

Dead, disappear… Whatever.

271
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,609
I just don't want
to see his face ever again.

Do you hear yourself?

273
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,405
That guy almost died.
What did he even do to you?

274
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,948
He almost took advantage of me.

275
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,450
Misogynists and
opportunists are the kind of people

276
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,494
who shouldn't exist in this world!

277
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,455
People like him deserve to die!

There are other ways
to deal with people like that.

You don't have to get physical.

What if he dodged and you fell instead?
You'd be the one who almost died.

And so?

It's called a butterfly hug.

296

A therapeutic intervention.

297
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,310

you can do this.

305

It's for people who go
through intense emotions.

Stop!

I'm still too emotional.
Help me calm down.

You will stop me when

you with Dennis. Did that work?

- You still did it.
- [sighs]

330
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,886
It's a different scenario.
In fact, if you weren't there,

I would've already
lost it just seeing his face.

I didn't explode
right away, thanks to you.

334
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,938
So, I think this can work.

335

How did you know about that?

342
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,540

Because…

I'm different.

00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,893
That's right.
You're unlike any patient I've ever had.

Should I take that as a compliment?

361
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,522
That I'm unique?

362

[Gemma] <i>You really don't want</i>
<i>to go back to Maravida anymore?</i>

543
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,877
<i>Is it because…</i>

544
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,006
<i>that's where your mother died?</i>

550
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,926
[Matmat murmuring, sighs deeply]

551
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,429

- [screaming continues]
- [music swells]

557

Aah!

558
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,005
- [Patrick] Bro…
- [panting] They're coming!

559
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:49,634
They're coming! They're chasing Matmat!

560
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,929
- They're chasing Matmat!
- Please calm down.

561
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,764
- I don't want to be here!
- Bro…

562
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,933
- I'm not safe here!
- I'm here for you.

563
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,393
- Calm down.
- [screaming, sobbing]

564
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,396
No! They're coming to take Matmat!

565
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,691
- [sobbing continues]
- That won't happen. I'm here.

566
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:08,236
- They're taking Matmat!
- No, I won't let that happen.

567
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,780
No one's taking you.
We'll move away from here.

568
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:14,450
[uncontrollable crying]

569
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,078
Matmat wants to leave this place!

570
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,164
[wailing]

571
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,418
<i>Welcome back to Maravida!</i>

572
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,669
<i>Is it fine if we stay here again?</i>

573
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,754
<i>The butterflies are coming back!</i>

574
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,965
<i>I decided to come back here, Ma.</i>

575
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,635
<i>Maybe this is how Matmat</i>
<i>gets over his fear of butterflies.</i>

576
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,138
<i>You kept messing up one after another.</i>

577
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,264
<i>You want him dead.</i>

578
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,100
<i>- Mia's boyfriend is my witness.</i>
<i>- Boyfriend?</i>

579
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,770
<i>Miss Mia, did you know</i>
<i>Sir Nurse works at the same hospital</i>

580
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,522
<i>where your father's confined?</i>

581
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,024
<i>It's you, right?</i>

582
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,317
<i>We'll see each other again.</i>
