1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,002
<i>You shouldn't have used</i>
<i>Matmat because you're mad at me.</i>

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:05,338
<i>Do you honestly</i>
<i>have no feelings for me?</i>

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,798
<i>Stay with me!</i>

4
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,258
<i>Let's change our lives together--</i>

5
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,718
<i>- Mia, please!</i>
<i>- Aah!</i>

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,637
<i>Matmat…</i>

7
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,722
<i>lives here now.</i>

8
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,140
<i>I'm not going!</i>

9
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,850
<i>I said you're not working for her!</i>

10
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,852
<i>I decide!</i>

11
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,813
<i>I decide what I want! Not Patpat!</i>

12
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:22,939
<i>This is my life!</i>

13
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,691
<i>This is my life! You don't own me!</i>

14
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,942
<i>I'm not yours!</i>

15
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:29,279
<i>You'll just let him</i>
<i>hurt you forever?</i>

16
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,447
<i>Abandon him, too…</i>

17
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,742
<i>so you can live the life that you want.</i>

18
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,328
<i>Miss Mia won't pay me money.</i>

19
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:41,541
<i>A camping car for Matmat and Patpat.</i>

20
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,350
Patpat?

21
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,603
Patpat?

22
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,772
Patrick?

23
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,571
Miss Li.

24
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,699
Hey. I brought sticky rice
cake and hot chocolate.

25
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,993
My regular from the market gave it to me.

26
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,666
You've got another bruise on your face.

27
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,751
Did someone slap
you again at the hospital?

28
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,461
Uh…

29
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,879
No.

30
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,049
Matmat and I just fought.

31
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,093
- Matmat--
Oh, Miss Li…

32
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,137
He's not here right now.

33
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,221
He ran away.

34
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:19,931
Huh?

35
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,601
Where'd he go? He left so early.

36
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,063
Don't worry. I know where he is.

37
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,402
What looks good here? Uh…

38
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,780
Boss that one, cheesecake.
That one's really good.

39
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,906
Cheesecake?

40
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,742
I'll get a slice of blueberry cheesecake.

41
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,745
- Then--
Boss, look! Chocolate cake!

42
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,582
I don't care if it's early,
I'm eating that.

43
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,708
That's so good.

44
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:50,336
Add one triple chocolate mousse cake too.

45
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,755
Oh, and look! They've got carrot cake!

46
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,967
Boss, it's healthy. It has veggies.

47
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,802
- You should get some.
- You're right.

48
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,680
- Get carrot cake too.
- One order of carrot cake.

49
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,098
Actually, make that two slices.

50
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,224
- Alright.
- And…

51
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,643
- …one box of silvannas.
- Sure.

52
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,228
-
540 pesos, sir.

53
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,397
You're so generous, sir. I'm touched.

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,940
It's the first time
you've treated me this much!

55
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:11,983
Hey! Hey!

56
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:12,984
Treat?

57
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,528
I bought all that for Mia.

58
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,614
- Add two brewed coffees.
- Okay, sir.

59
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,449
For Mia and me.

60
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,828
Then why'd you bring
me if it's all for Miss Mia?

61
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,624
So you'd know we need
to be at Mia's place early,

62
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,960
to find out who that housemate is
and stop them! And you--

63
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,254
You're supposed to be
the one living there, huh?

64
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,592
But Boss V…

65
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,763
after all the time
I slaved away for Miss Mia,

66
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,725
just so you know, never, ever,
have I seen her eat sweets.

67
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,644
Never.

68
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,730
Alright!

69
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:54,192
Miss, give that to me!
I knew it would end up with me!

70
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,779
Oh, that's actually good news!

71
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:01,950
This isn't even Matmat's first job, right?

72
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,827
Miss Li, it's just
he decided without telling me.

73
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,706
I'm worried it might affect
the trauma therapy

74
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,708
he's been working on with Doc Anok.

75
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:17,799
Then just observe
him and talk to Doc Anok.

76
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,802
But what if--

77
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:26,683
If Doc Anok says he needs to stop working,
then tell him to stop.

78
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:33,106
You know, not
everyone with Matmat's condition

79
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,067
gets this kind of opportunity.

80
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,071
Don't take it away just
because you're worried.

81
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:47,745
He'll do better at work with your support.

82
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:52,166
We should be happy
the world's opening up to him.

83
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,544
Okay?

84
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,172
- Okay, Miss Li.
- Very good!

85
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,967
That's the spirit! Stay positive!

86
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,720
Didn't you say his job is to draw?

87
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,265
So where is this job,
and why can't he live here?

88
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,686
He got hired as an illustrator

89
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,314
for Mia Hernandez's new book.

90
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,066
Miss Li?

91
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,444
Are you okay?

92
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:27,201
So that means you're
going to stay with him at Mia's?

93
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,248
What's that?

94
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,416
Boss, what is it?

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,752
- Find a stick.
- Why me?!

96
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,587
- I'm carrying stuff!
- Okay, here.

97
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,339
Use this.

98
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,592
- Poke it.
- Why me, boss?

99
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,052
- Do it! Come on!
- Ugh!

100
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,428
You're closer.

101
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,472
Really, huh?

102
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,931
Boss, wait.

103
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,976
Boss, I said wait!

104
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,812
Boss! Alright, you do it.

105
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,190
You're bigger than me! Go, you do it.

106
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,026
What if it's a wild animal?
I can't die. You do it!

107
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,445
What, I'm the one who can die?

108
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,407
Madeth, you won't die.
You're too stubborn to die.

109
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,159
- Go, do it.
- So I'm stubborn now?

110
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,411
- Madeth, I'm your boss.
- You just called me stubborn.

111
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,080
- You still called me stubborn.
- Ouch!

112
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,416
So noisy.

113
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,751
So noisy.

114
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,877
- Ouch!
- I'm sorry, boss!

115
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,838
So early and already noisy.

116
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,673
Who are you? What are you doing here?

117
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,594
Oh, boss!
I recognize him. I know him.

118
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,845
So noisy this early.

119
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,516
That's Nurse Patrick's brother.

120
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,477
His name's Matmat. They call him Matmat!

121
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,856
Uh, why are you here?
You want a video greeting? A fan sign?

122
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,733
He's really fanboying hard.

123
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,194
That's Matmat, boss.

124
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,321
- That's really him!
- Hey, wait! We're coming in!

125
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,156
Hey, wait! Matmat--

126
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,202
- Matmat, open the door.
- Matmat?

127
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,411
Mia!

128
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,329
Matmat!

129
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,456
- Open the door!
- Noisy!

130
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,666
Matmat!

131
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,292
- Mia!
- Miss Mia…

132
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,752
- I'm here!
- So noisy this early.

133
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,003
They're so annoying, right?

134
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,463
- A-Annoying.
- Matmat!

135
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,340
- Matmat!
- Open the door!

136
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,134
Open up!

137
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,510
Aah!

138
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,637
Ouch!

139
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,389
Boss V!

140
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,766
Come on, boss! Get up!

141
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,144
It hurts to fall for the wrong person.

142
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,146
Mia! Mia, wait! Uh…

143
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,397
Why is he here?

144
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,940
Isn't it obvious?

145
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,483
He's my new housemate.

146
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,777
- No!
- Yes!

147
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,156
- No!
- Y-Yes.

148
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,200
- No!
- Yes!

149
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,161
Why are you saying yes?

150
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,413
I just wanted to feel included.

151
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,458
Matmat's living here now.

152
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,043
He's the illustrator of my new book.

153
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,045
Because we have to work closely together.

154
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,715
Mia, you've made tons of books.

155
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,842
You never made
your illustrators your housemates!

156
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,218
Well…

157
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,929
Well, there's always a time for a first.

158
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,056
- Matmat, let's go.
- Let's go.

159
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,935
Mia, you two won't get anything done.
You'll just mess around.

160
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,145
No.

161
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,438
That's not true.

162
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,191
Someone will be watching us.

163
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,569
Fine! Fine!

164
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,362
Madeth, you stay here too.

165
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,447
No.

166
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,282
Not her.

167
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,037
My safety pin will watch me.

168
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,589
Patpat! Patpat!

169
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,612
Pat… Patpat!

170
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,531
Patpat!

171
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,826
Matmat's sorry about last night.

172
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,663
Matmat's really sorry for what happened.

173
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,833
Matmat's really sorry.

174
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,877
It's okay, Matmat.

175
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,338
Sorry I just got here now.

176
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,972
See?

177
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,100
I'm all set.

178
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,566
Everything I need is here.

179
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,206
Gemma, dear…

180
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,001
I know you're understanding.

181
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,254
I know you'll get where I'm coming from,

182
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,338
but--

183
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:54,051
What's wrong with you, Liwanag?!
It can't be like that!

184
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:59,098
Why did I even push
Patrick to stay at Mia's?

185
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,227
What am I going to do now?

186
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,147
Mia, hold on.

187
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,857
- Out. Out.
- We have things to discuss.

188
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,900
- We are missing so many opportunities!
- Out, out, out.

189
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,319
- Such a waste!
- Get out.

190
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,779
- Mia, wait a minute.
- I don't need you here.

191
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,614
Wait.

192
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,199
There is something I need.

193
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,910
I knew it! I'm so glad you changed--

194
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,458
This is mine, right?

195
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,628
I'm taking the car back. Bye.

196
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,881
- If you take that, I won't have any car.
- Not my problem.

197
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,132
Mia!

198
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,676
Hey! Hold on, Mia!

199
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,888
We need to discuss about
the opportunities we're wasting!

200
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,976
Why--

201
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,482
She just kicked us out!
Why on earth are you smiling?!

202
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,778
At least boss V,
I don't have to live here anymore!

203
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,279
I'm safe.

204
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,324
You don't understand, Madeth.

205
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,285
As long as Mia's here,
she won't be able to work!

206
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,830
Why do you have to be so negative, boss?

207
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,167
Just think,
with Miss Mia's excellent writing

208
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,795
and Matmat's drawing skills,

209
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,172
you might just get your bestseller!

210
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,591
Why not just give Miss Mia what she wants?

211
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:16,842
Because…

212
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,303
I don't want the company
to go in the negative. Got it?

213
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,889
Negative?

214
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,266
Will we go into debt, boss V?

215
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,268
Madeth.

216
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,146
Mia's books are the only ones selling,

217
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:35,403
and we're bundling other titles
with hers just to help them move.

218
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,738
That's why we really need an endorsement

219
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,783
to fund the rest of the company, okay?

220
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,785
Ah…

221
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,704
So you'll still have
something to pay me with, right?

222
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,165
This can't go on, Madeth.

223
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,501
I may have no
choice but to lay someone off.

224
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,930
Hello, sis.

225
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,266
I was curious if
your office is currently hiring.

226
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,725
Hey!

227
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,853
Seriously? You're already job hunting,

228
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,729
and right in front of me?

229
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,149
Just in case you fire me.

230
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,026
Don't quit now.

231
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,028
This will all be worth it in the end.

232
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,780
And admit it,

233
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,451
Mia isn't like any other
writer here in the Philippines.

234
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,702
Am I right?

235
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:27,997
See?

236
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,208
Can't argue with that, boss.

237
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,545
Alright, let's get
Miss Mia back to the city.

238
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,131
Yes! I like that!

239
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,133
I love the fighting spirit!

240
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,552
But how will we do that?

241
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:45,055
I believe walking can help
us come up with ideas. Come on!

242
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,765
Let's eat.

243
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:58,277
Let's eat.
Matmat will… will get some plates.

244
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,154
Feel at home, Matmat.

245
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,162
So you came back for your brother.

246
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,538
Let's talk.

247
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,248
Sure.

248
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,377
What would you like to talk about
on your first day at my house?

249
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,467
We'll stay here during the week
and go home to our apartment on weekends.

250
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,802
Can I not come with you on weekends?

251
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,222
Matmat's top priority
is drawing at the hospital.

252
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,097
Hey.

253
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,933
He has a contract with me.

254
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,768
But that job came before this one.

255
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,063
His sessions with Dr. Anok come first,

256
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,149
so you can't demand
his time when he's at the hospital.

257
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,111
Fine.

258
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,614
I will work around his schedule.

259
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,243
If Matmat says
he wants to leave and go home,

260
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,870
- you'll allow it.
- I'll make sure he won't quit.

261
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,664
There will be days
when he'll throw tantrums.

262
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,583
- Try to be patient with him.
- Sure. Piece of cake.

263
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,293
- Mia, I'm serious.
- Do you think I'm not?

264
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,380
- And--
- Yes to all.

265
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,465
Mia.

266
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,841
What more do you want?

267
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,261
Should I get a lawyer as a witness?

268
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,471
Or swear in front of a judge?

269
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,558
Patrick.

270
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,894
I am going to fulfill my promise.

271
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,729
Why?

272
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,651
Because it's you.

273
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,575
Let's eat!

274
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,414
Let's… Let's eat.

275
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,958
Matmat, that's for Mia.

276
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:43,132
It's okay because…
because Matmat lives here now.

277
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,217
Yes, Matmat.

278
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,679
The three of us will stay here together.

279
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,393
We're going to have so much fun.

280
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,857
Jason, calm down.

281
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,317
<i>How am I supposed to calm down</i>

282
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,028
<i>when you did</i>
<i>the exact opposite of what I said?!</i>

283
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:09,700
I thought we agreed
you'd stay away from Mia.

284
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,036
And now you're
actually moving in with her?!

285
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,371
Jason, we're not giving up the apartment.

286
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,040
We'll still stay there on the weekends.

287
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,959
<i>You really think</i>
<i>you'll even make it to Saturday?!</i>

288
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,796
Let me remind you,
Patrick. She stabbed you once!

289
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,591
She stabbed you! Right?!

290
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,884
You know what's next--

291
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,177
God forbid--

292
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,387
that woman will end up killing you.

293
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,389
You're overreacting, Jason.

294
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,353
<i>- Patrick, I'll say it slowly this time.</i>

295
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:42,107
<i>That… woman… is going to kill you!</i>

296
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,318
<i>You will die…</i>

297
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,779
<i>if you don't leave that house right now!</i>

298
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,990
Stop joking like that.

299
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,791
<i>I wish I was joking, man.</i>

300
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,627
<i>Just come home now,</i>
<i>please Patrick. Come home.</i>

301
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,007
You talk like we'll
never see each other again.

302
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,093
Matmat still works with you, remember?

303
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,513
Bye, I have to go.

304
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,401
Darn it. Darn it. Darn it.

305
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,903
I hate you, Mia! I hate you!

306
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,031
Dear, I've picked up the silvanas!

307
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,617
I'll put it in
the fridge so it doesn't melt.

308
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,286
Mama, how can I still give
it if Patrick isn't here anymore?

309
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,746
Oh, gosh.

310
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,001
Well,

311
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,713
he said they'll come
back once the book's done.

312
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:49,008
Matmat can do the job
without both of them living there.

313
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,594
But you still see
Patrick at the hospital, right?

314
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,805
That's not the point, Ma!

315
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,348
I see him all the time at work,

316
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,685
but it's Mia he'll spend time with
at home! That annoying woman!

317
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,729
Gemmalyn Marie!

318
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,565
Go ahead!

319
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,401
Put all your anger on me!

320
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,988
I'm the one who pushed
Patrick to support Matmat anyway.

321
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,158
Get mad at someone
who supports another person's dreams!

322
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,870
Mm!

323
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,377
I need 2 kilos of
ground meat delivered, please.

324
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,299
I'm making <i>embutido </i>all of a sudden.
Can you throw in some raisins?

325
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,092
Thank you.

326
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,848
Mama, I'm sorry.

327
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,101
Please forgive me.

328
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,521
Do your best chopping those potatoes.

329
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,984
This is the library.

330
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,695
This is where we're going to work, Matmat.

331
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,365
And I'm going to get a desk just for you.

332
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,035
There's a lot of books!

333
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,915
Some of these are obsolete, but…

334
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,541
some are classics.

335
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,461
Patpat, I… I like it here.

336
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,047
- Be careful, Matmat.
- It's okay.

337
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,715
Matmat…

338
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,759
feel at home.

339
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,273
I don't take you as
someone who likes books.

340
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,818
What's your thing?

341
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,572
My thing is the hospital.

342
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,909
That's work.

343
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,327
That doesn't count.

344
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,246
What are your hobbies?

345
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,542
Sleeping… I guess.

346
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,378
So that's what you like to do? Sleep?

347
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:54,550
P-Patpat… likes hanging out with Jason.

348
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,635
Not all the time, Matmat.

349
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,638
Hanging out with friends?

350
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,723
No, I can't accept that.

351
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,269
What "thing" are you talking about?

352
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,688
For example,

353
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,273
Matmat.

354
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,276
He loves drawing. He's into art.

355
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,405
Matmat likes to draw.

356
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,116
And me…

357
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,539
I like pretty things.

358
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,419
I can't think of anything else except

359
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,629
my work and my brother.

360
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,631
But you see…

361
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,966
Matmat…

362
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,510
is a person, not a thing.

363
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,681
I just meant that's
all I've been focused on.

364
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,099
Are you serious?

365
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,811
Nothing else?
Not even driving or traveling?

366
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,647
I'm not into traveling.

367
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,734
Then why is Matmat

368
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,654
asking me to buy a camper van
in exchange for his illustrations?

369
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,824
We… We keep moving.

370
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,451
So we…

371
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,746
We can leave whenever it follows Matmat.

372
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,623
- Matmat.
- Following you?

373
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,917
Who's following you?
Do you have a stalker?

374
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,918
No.

375
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,961
Where will we be staying?

376
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,468
Follow me, boys.

377
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,053
Matmat.

378
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,434
This will be your room.

379
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,103
This used to be my room,

380
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,106
but it was turned
into a guestroom when I left.

381
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,400
That might be dusty.
We'll have to clean it first.

382
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,819
I like it here. There are two beds.

383
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,571
But we have to clean it first, okay?

384
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,120
Matmat.

385
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,082
Shh, shh, shh…

386
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,543
What is he doing?

387
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,921
Is he playing?

388
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,507
He's just happy.

389
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,094
He considers closets as a safe space.

390
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,345
I see.

391
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,933
Like I told you…

392
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,185
I can understand his situation.

393
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,855
Matmat?

394
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,693
See? Didn't I tell you that it's dusty?

395
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,487
It's very dusty.

396
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,948
I can fit in there, Patpat.

397
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,036
Is it okay for us to use this?

398
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,456
If Matmat wants to use it, go for it.

399
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,546
Matmat, take off your shoes first.

400
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,134
And you need to take a bath.
Our clothes are dirty.

401
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,760
Come on.

402
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,556
What about you?

403
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,560
Are you okay with the room? The bed?

404
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:57,149
If Matmat approves, I approve also.

405
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,902
Matmat likes it here.

406
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,382
M… Matmat needs to pee.

407
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:26,553
Going to the restroom…

408
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:34,603
Matmat needs to pee.

409
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,577
Is… Is there someone there?

410
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,370
Shh!

411
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:22,025
M-Matmat needs to pee. Shh… Shh…

412
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:03,984
Mat… Matmat needs… needs to pee…

413
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,488
Matmat really… needs to pee…

414
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,900
What are you doing?

415
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,238
<i>One condition…</i>

416
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:55,368
<i>Never open the door in</i>
<i>the deepest part of the palace.</i>

417
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,829
<i>Is Matmat going to die if he goes there?</i>

418
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,792
<i>Mama used to work here.</i>

419
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:03,919
<i>Yes. You remember that?</i>

420
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,755
<i>If I were you two,</i>
<i>I would leave this place</i>

421
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,673
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Before it returns.</i>

422
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,176
- <i>She's beautiful.</i>
- <i>Who's beautiful?</i>

423
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,595
<i>Mia's mother.</i>
