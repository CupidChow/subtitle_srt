1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,752
<i>Patrick, let's have a baby!</i>

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,963
<i>You're too loud. It's embarrassing.</i>

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,923
<i>- Patpat?</i>
<i>- I'll take it.</i>

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,050
<i>What are you going to do?</i>
<i>Are you going to talk?</i>

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,552
<i>Hello, pretty boy.</i>

6
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:13,012
<i>Wine, cheese, and more.</i>

7
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:16,141
<i>I'm so, so happy</i>

8
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:19,352
<i>that you and Matmat</i>
<i>are living here with me.</i>

9
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:23,898
<i>Do you think you can</i>
<i>face your fear of butterflies?</i>

10
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,442
<i>She isn't just here for Mia.</i>

11
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,360
<i>Everything was from Ingrid.</i>

12
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,404
<i>She's alive, Patrick.</i>

13
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:32,032
<i>And if there's one thing I know for sure,</i>

14
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,868
<i>she's right here, inside the hospital.</i>

15
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:44,753
[theme music playing]

16
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,553
- [sizzling]
- [pensive music playing]

17
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,347
[Zelda] <i>I received</i>
<i>some letters out of nowhere,</i>

18
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,766
<i>with instructions</i>
<i>to give them to someone.</i>

19
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,976
<i>Everything was from Ingrid.</i>

20
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,521
<i>And she's alive, Patrick.</i>

21
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,774
<i>And she's right here, inside the hospital.</i>

22
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,194
Patpat, the fried rice.

23
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:55,448
The fried rice. You're going to burn it.

24
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,284
It's just toasted a bit.

25
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,661
It's good to go.

26
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,376
Why are your eyes red?

27
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,170
Were you not able to sleep?

28
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,756
I had enough sleep, Matmat.

29
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,967
Maybe something just got into my eye.

30
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,101
You have a session with Doc Anok, right?

31
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,102
Hmm?

32
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,147
Mm-hmm.

33
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,986
Matmat is going to see Doc Anok because…

34
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,489
butterflies cure.

35
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,283
But…

36
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:44,164
Matmat is still scared of butterflies.

37
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,331
They're scary.

38
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:51,337
What if Matmat gets
chased by the butterflies?

39
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,845
[Patrick sighs heavily]

40
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,054
Matmat?

41
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,766
Why don't we stop running?

42
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,812
If you're still afraid,

43
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,816
I'll fight the butterflies for you.

44
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,780
You will fight them, Patpat?

45
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,616
Yeah.

46
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,411
I'm a good boxer, remember?

47
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,496
Y-Yes!

48
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,249
Patpat is a boxer.

49
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:34,464
When Patpat and Matmat fought,
his punches hurt a lot.

50
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,424
Patpat is a boxer.

51
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,343
I'll fight all of them.

52
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:42,013
Those chasing you,
your enemies… all of them.

53
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,431
But…

54
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,225
[tender music playing]

55
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:50,605
Matmat should be
the one defending Patpat.

56
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,773
Because…

57
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,360
I'm older.

58
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,819
Yes, Matmat, but--

59
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,863
Matmat can also fight

60
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,949
because he can…

61
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,203
he can protect his brother.

62
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,375
[tender music continues]

63
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,463
[music fades]

64
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,841
Finally, I'm getting rid of you.

65
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,345
[Tommy] You talk like
you can't stand having me here.

66
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,432
Admit it, Doc,
you're going to miss your chess buddy.

67
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,892
[both chuckle]

68
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,062
And those secret
chitchats in the storage room.

69
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,522
- Hmm?
- [Tommy chuckling]

70
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,690
[Eden chuckling]

71
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,941
- I'll be off.
- Alright.

72
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,567
- Goodbye.
- [Eden] Bye, Mister Tommy.

73
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,445
[contented sighs]

74
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:44,701
[gentle music playing]

75
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:50,456
I don't know if I should be happy or sad.

76
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:54,127
We've had two patients leave.

77
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,297
If you're talking about Zelda,

78
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,173
there's nothing more we could do.

79
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,928
Her family transferred her
straight away to another hospital.

80
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:08,141
[gentle music continues]

81
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,517
[Anok] But as for Tommy,

82
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,728
let's just be happy for him.

83
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,063
Now that he's getting better,

84
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:18,609
let's pray he continues
to heal and finds a peaceful life.

85
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,822
[gentle music continues]

86
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,199
[music turns unsettling]

87
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,702
[Zelda] <i>And she's alive, Patrick!</i>

88
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,829
"I'LL BE BACK"

89
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,540
<i>She's here, inside the hospital.</i>

90
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,962
[unsettling music continues]

91
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:40,798
[Eden] Patrick?

92
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,426
Ma'am?

93
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,971
Did you need something?

94
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,932
Uh, I was about to ask,

95
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,893
but it looks like you're busy.

96
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,895
Are those love letters?

97
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,147
Ah, no.

98
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,274
These are Matmat's sketches.

99
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,525
[paper rustling]

100
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,777
[Eden] Mm.

101
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:07,867
I heard from the other nurses
something about patients leaving notes.

102
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,703
You do know that's not allowed, right?

103
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,039
Yes, ma'am, I do.

104
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,125
- But nobody's left me one.
- [Eden] Mm-hmm.

105
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,418
That's good.

106
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,464
You'll need to speak
to them if it happens.

107
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,051
- Yes, ma'am.
- Anyway,

108
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,929
- I found a pair of tweezers…
- [unsettling music continues]

109
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,306
…in one of the rooms.

110
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,559
- Okay, I'll double check each room.
- Okay.

111
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:37,396
Start with Tommy's
since he's already been discharged.

112
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,234
[unsettling music continues]

113
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,988
- [kettle clinks]
- [lid closes]

114
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,159
[traffic noises]

115
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,538
[vehicle honks]

116
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,332
M-Mister Tommy.

117
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,336
Y-You're a patient at OK Hospital.

118
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,963
Yes, that's me.

119
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,381
You've been discharged?

120
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,966
[breathes deeply]

121
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,509
I'm going home.

122
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,927
How about you?

123
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:12,390
I-I'm going to Jason's restaurant.

124
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:16,811
Then, I'll see Doc Anok for our session.

125
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:22,024
He wants Matmat to draw butterflies.

126
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,111
But Matmat doesn't want to.
He's scared of butterflies.

127
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,572
Oh? Do butterflies…

128
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:32,618
Do butterflies trigger
bad memories for you?

129
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,164
- [traffic noises]
- [somber music playing]

130
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,249
[Tommy] Oh.

131
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,960
[sighs, breathes deeply]

132
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,336
I guess they do.

133
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,754
[clicks tongue]

134
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,424
But, Matmat?

135
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:52,013
Don't let fear control you.

136
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,808
[sighs] Don't be like me.

137
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,103
I was trapped in the past.

138
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,147
[breathes deeply]

139
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:06,027
T-Trapped in the, in the past?

140
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,156
I couldn't escape.

141
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,411
I couldn't find the door out.

142
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,706

- [gunshot]

146
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,756
- [breathing heavily]
- [driver] There's an accident.

147
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,717
- A tire exploded.

162
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,212
Miss, could you help me?

163
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,048
- Call Patpat on speed dial 1.
- [Tommy sobbing]

164
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,508
M-Mister Tommy.

165
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,260
- [Tommy cries]
- No one's picking up, sir.

166
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,053
Try Gemma, please.

167
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,721
- [vehicle honking]
- Mister Tommy!

168
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,557
- Hello?
- [Tommy sobbing]

169
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,142
Gemma! Gemma, we need help.

170
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,354
It's-It's Mister Tommy.
A-Are you at OK Hospital?

171
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,315
Mister Tommy… We need help, Gemma.

172
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,193
Gemma! Gemma-- Mister Tommy.

00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,230
Doc…

182
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,527
I knew you'd be missing me.

183
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,904
[Tommy chuckles]

184
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,864
- Come on, Doc.
- [Anok] Go on.

185
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,783
Get some rest.

186
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,911
Once you're better,
I'll have someone to beat at chess again.

187
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,205
[chuckles, inhales sharply] Doc.

188
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,333
Take me back to my room, please.

189
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,586
I don't want to be stuck in here.

190
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,633
- Hmm?
- Alright, fine.

191
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,512
[chuckling gently]

192
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,014
- [somber music playing]
- It's hard to believe.

193
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:27,353
We thought Mister Tommy
was cheerful and funny,

194
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,107
but deep down
he still remembers the killings

195
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,734
and violence from his past.

196
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,945
Chances are,

197
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,157
Mister Tommy
brought with him all the hurt,

198
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,493
the nightmares,
and violence he experienced.

199
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,454
[somber music continues]

200
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,874
- I thought he had gotten better.
- [somber music fades]

201
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:53,337
[tense music playing]

202
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,880
[Tommy] <i>But, Matmat…</i>

203
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,716
<i>don't let fear control you.</i>

204
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,095
<i>Don't be like me.</i>

205
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:10,521
[tense music continues]

206
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,070
[Anok] <i>Face your fears.</i>

207
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:22,199
<i>Help Patrick by</i>
<i>facing your fear of butterflies.</i>

208
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:29,373
[breath quivering, whimpering]

209
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,917
B-Butterfly…

210
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:36,172
M-Matmat will draw a butterfly.

211
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,719
[music becomes foreboding]

212
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,512
[Patrick] <i>I will fight them all.</i>

213
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,308
<i>All of your enemies and</i>
<i>everyone who is chasing you.</i>

214
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:53,314
[Matmat] <i>Matmat</i>
<i>should be the one to protect you.</i>

215
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,441
<i>Matmat is the big brother.</i>

216
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,567
<i>Butterfly…</i>

217
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,196
[foreboding music crescendos]

218
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,906
[breathes heavily, whimpers]

[tense music playing]

220
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,950
Matmat…

221
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,243
Matmat can't do it.

222
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,079
Matmat can't do it.

223
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,919
[tense music intensifies]

224
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,131
[tense music crescendos]

225
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,842
Doc! Doc?

226
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,802
Matmat? You okay?

227
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,262
Does anything hurt?

228
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,433
Patrick, I have good news.

229
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,061
Your brother saved the day.

230
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,482
Good thing he was with
Tommy when he had an episode.

231
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,193
He acted like a responsible adult.

232
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,402
He's a hero!

233
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,489
Really, Matmat?

234
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,244
Mm-hmm.

235
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,122
M-Matmat helped.

236
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,793
M-Matmat is a hero.

237
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,464
Helping people is big deal.

238
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,218
Is that why you called me here, Doc?

239
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,595
Well, here's the thing,

240
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,347
he has something to say.

241
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,016
[sentimental music playing]

242
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,393
What is it, Matmat?

243
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,645
Do you have a new--

244
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:20,860
[sentimental music continues]

245
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:26,282
M-Matmat tried to draw…

246
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:31,912
a butterfly but,
Matmat couldn't do it, Patpat.

247
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,752
Is it because of what we talked about?

248
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,090
Because I said I would fight them all?

249
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:47,845
[sentimental music continues]

250
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,807
Matmat, we can do this. Okay?

251
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,644
- Little by little--
- Mister Tommy said…

252
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,191
M-Mister Tommy said…

253
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,527
Matmat…

254
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,532
Matmat shouldn't be like him.

255
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,495
How so?

256
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:18,876
[poignant music playing]

257
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,960
[stammers]

258
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:25,633
Don't be like Mister Tommy

259
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,843
who was stuck in the past.

260
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:33,140
Matmat shouldn't be stuck in the past.

261
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:39,021
[poignant music continues]

262
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,566
M-Mister Tommy said…

263
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:49,740
M-Matmat might never find…

264
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,116
[sniffles]

265
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,037
…the way out.

266
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,415
Matmat might be trapped forever.

267
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,834
[sniffles]

268
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,421
R-Remember Mia's book?

269
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:10,886
"The Kid Batibat Visited"

270
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,058
I, I let Mister Tommy borrow it.

271
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:24,733
Because I remember what it said.

272
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:29,154
[poignant music continues]

273
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,781
What did it say?

274
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,493
Our…

275
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:41,667
painful memories…

276
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,547
shape who we are.

277
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:53,095
[Matmat] <i>You won't be</i>
<i>able to tell the difference between</i>

278
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,389
<i>pain and relief,</i>

279
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:59,977
<i>happiness and sadness without them.</i>

280
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,354
How can I forget?

281
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,648
[sighs heavily]

282
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:10,112
I saw so many innocent people die.

283
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,408
[Kai] But, Mister Tommy,

284
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,493
- you were just doing your job.
- [sniffles]

285
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,663
You had to fight bad people.

286
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,292
But they had kids on their side.

287
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,044
[poignant music continues]

288
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,004
I killed them, too.

289
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,840
I should've protected the innocent!

290
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,425
They shouldn't have been involved!

291
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,510
They shouldn't have died!

292
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,016
[sobbing]

293
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,979
[Matmat] <i>That's why these memories…</i>

294
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,024
<i>should not be erased.</i>

295
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,861
<i>We must acknowledge them and face them.</i>

296
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:58,577
Because if we ignore them,

297
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:04,208
who we really are…

298
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,921
will remain lost in sadness and darkness.

299
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,006
[poignant music continues]

300
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,091
Matmat.

301
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,429
Mister Tommy said…

302
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:23,519
It's okay to remember
what happened before.

303
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,563
[poignant music continues]

304
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,690
As long as you learn from it.

305
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,193
So…

306
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,862
[giggles]

307
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,947
Patpat…

308
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,870
Matmat will fight back now.

309
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,955
He will.

310
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,960
But Matmat can't, he can't…

311
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,633
Matmat can't draw a butterfly yet.

312
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:59,513
[poignant music continues]

313
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,224
Hmm, but…

314
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,394
Matmat is ready to be brave.

315
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,688
[sniffles]

316
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,234
Just like Patpat. [chuckles]

317
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,115
Um, Patpat?

318
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,704
We won't move anymore.

319
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,959
Every time the rainy season comes,

320
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,421
we won't move anymore.

321
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,968
Whenever it's Mama's death anniversary,

322
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,095
Matmat won't…

323
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,642
Matmat won't run
away from the butterflies.

324
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,145
Way to go, Matmat!

325
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,939
What a brave boy! [chuckles]

326
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,233
So…

327
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,987
are you ready to tell us what you saw?

328
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,034
[poignant music continues]

329
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,452
What I saw?

330
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,914
What you saw that night.

331
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,417
When…

332
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,337
Mama was killed.

333
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,217
[poignant music fades]

334
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,680

[huffs]

336
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,353
I wonder what Matmat was thinking
when he was drawing you.

337
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,231
There's a camping car, so you're leaving.

338
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,442
Where?

339
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,237
Why?

340
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,823
To travel?

341
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,118
But you said,

342
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,081
you only leave when you're
running away from something.

343
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,208
[sighs]

344
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,045
To escape?

345
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,258
Escape what?

346
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,052
[clicking]

347
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,139
What makes a person want to run away?

348
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:11,270
[pensive music playing]

349
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,073

[unsettling music playing]

351
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,042
Come on, Matmat.

352
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,045
[whimpering]

353
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,423
[sniffles]

354
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:45,178
We picked up Mama that time,
remember Patpat?

355
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,015
W-We picked her up.

356
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,809
[sniffles, breathes heavily]

357
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,227
[young Patrick] <i>Ma!</i>

358
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,812
You can go ahead.

359
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,731
I'll follow in a bit.

360
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,025
Alright. Hurry up, okay?

361
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,359
Follow us right away.

362
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,111
[young Matmat] Right away, Patpat.

363
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,739
Patpat will follow us right away.

364
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,992
[Tessie] Dear, are you hungry?

365

A woman, Matmat? [sobbing softly]

450
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,555
A woman killed Mama?

[Anok] Do you remember the woman's face?

452
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,852
[Matmat] N-No, Doc.

453

[sobbing, sniffling]

455
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,858
[whimpers]

456
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,902
[Anok] What about the butterfly?

Do you remember what it looked like?

458
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,200
M-Matmat
remembers seeing two butterflies.

459
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,286
One big butterfly.

460
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,955
And one small butterfly. [sobbing shakily]

461
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,499
They were on top of each other!

462

On top of each other!

463
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:32,132
They were pinned on the woman's dress!

464
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:37,721
It was like a mommy
butterfly with her baby butterfly!

465
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,431
On top of each other!

466
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:45,437
T-They were pinned on the woman's dress!

467
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,439
[Anok]
A butterfly didn't kill your mother.

468
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,566
[unsettling music continues]

469
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,402
But a woman with butterflies on her dress.

470
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,363
Is it like a brooch with a pin?

471
00:26:55,447 --> 00:27:01,619
- [Matmat sobbing]
- [unsettling music continues]

472
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,332

[dramatic music continues]

475
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:29,230
[Matmat sobbing, sniffling]

476
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:38,323
[dramatic music continues]

477
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,492
<i>What's the problem?</i>

478
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,160
<i>He's avoiding me again.</i>

479
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,829
<i>As long as Samuel lives,</i>
<i>his family can still be together.</i>

480
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,247
<i>Mia's mother will come back?</i>

481
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,209
<i>I'm now choosing who I want as my family.</i>

482
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:52,420
<i>Is the punishment</i>
<i>the world gave me finally over?</i>

483
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,631
<i>He won't ever tell</i>
<i>anyone what he's feeling.</i>

484
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,509
<i>I've already told you everything I know.</i>

485
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,762
<i>Mia's mother can't be</i>
<i>the reason my life got ruined.</i>

486
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,931
<i>Only this house knows the whole truth.</i>
