00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,636
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,014
<i>Mia?</i>

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,849
<i>- Mia!</i>
<i>- No!</i>

6
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,977
<i>You have to go! She's going to kill you!</i>

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,520
<i>Mia, it's just a bad dream.</i>

8
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,439
<i>Get out of here!</i>

9
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,233
<i>I'm here for you. I'm not leaving, okay?</i>

<i>Mia was involved with a patient.</i>

11
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:32,032
[Eden] <i>So, what do you mean, Doc?</i>
<i>Should we remove Mia?</i>

12
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:36,119
<i>I think we should</i>
<i>suspend Mia's sessions for now.</i>

13
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,746
<i>Mister Dipong.</i>

14
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,166
<i>Who were you referring to</i>
<i>when you said someone would come back?</i>

15
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,669
<i>Ma'am Ingrid.</i>
<i>I can still feel her presence.</i>

[theme music playing]

17
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,184
[Jason] Thank you, thank you!

18
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,478
Did you enjoy the food? Alright, cool.

19
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,146
Tell your friends to come here too, okay?

20
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,648
- Thank you!
- Don't worry.

21
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,525
[Jason sighs deeply]

22
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,236
Hey, Patrick, Matmat!

23
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,446
[Jason chuckles]

24
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,992
Thank you, Lord,
for keeping my friends alive!

25
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,702
[Jason whimpers]

26
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,955
- You're being dramatic, Jason.
- Matmat.

27
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,748
- Let's get back to work.
- Matmat.

28
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,584
I missed you. And you too.

29
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,586
[laughs]

30
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,921
Well, bro?

31
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,548
Are you staying back at the apartment?

32
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,553
You're still staying
there Monday to Friday?

33
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,182
Bro, seriously?!

34
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,268
What's with you, bro--

35
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,354
You think you can bribe me?
It smells good, though.

36
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,940
- Sausages?
- With tomatoes.

37
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,984
[inhales] Ahh.

38
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,529
Bro, listen.

39
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,116
I'm going to be frank with you.
In case you've forgotten…

40
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:43,121
You and Matmat are the only family I have.

41
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,622
Okay?

42
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,167
I've been an orphan for a long time now.

43
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,670
You two and this restaurant
are the only things important to me.

44
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,755
Well, we feel the same way about you too.

45
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,510
And thank you because
even though I wasn't a graduate yet,

46
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,637
you let me work at your restaurant.

47
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,265
[laughing]

48
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,726
It's "restaurants." My restaurants.

49
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,019
Who do you think I am?

50
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,646
But bro, that's the point.

51
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,982
We go back a long way.

52
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,026
We've been through thick and thin.

53
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,364
That's why you follow me
and Matmat wherever we go.

54
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,450
Hey, I don't "follow" you.

55
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,745
I accompany you. There's a difference.

56
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,872
But you get it, right?

57
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,999
Our lives are connected.

58
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,418
And then you just
packed up and left abruptly.

59
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,045
"Abruptly?"

60
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,922
I have large vocabulary, huh?

61
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,758
It's as large as the knife
wound you left on my back!

62
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,760
It's like you ended our friendship!

63

[birds chirping]

69
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,369
[sighs] Thank you, Lord!
Madeth's talent finally became useful.

70
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,037
Wait a minute, boss.

71
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,124
After all the endorsements
and photo shoots I handled for Miss Mia,

72
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,709
you still didn't find me talented?

73
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,753
I just didn't see your talent before.

74
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:17,131
But now I know you really are. Good job.

75
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,634
Uh, boss, wait. Um…

76
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,469
That didn't sound like a compliment.

77
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,097
How is picking locks a talent?

78
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,933
For emergencies,
like if you get locked up.

79
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,102
Boss, I'm going to get locked up?

80
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,980
Boss, come on.
I've done everything you wanted.

81
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,815
Hey, are you saying I'm indebted to you?

82
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,608
No, boss.

83
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:40,196
You talk too much. What I meant was
in case you get locked in a car or room--

84
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,659
Oh, by the way, you need
to replace that lock. You broke it.

85
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,744
I knew it.

86
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,205
At least the mansion's not locked.

87
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,708
You're right.

88
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,546
Maybe Miss Mia
doesn't like locking the doors.

89
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,466
[glass shattering]

90
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,968
- Mia! That came from upstairs.
- [suspenseful music playing]

91
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,012
- Boss! What's happening?
- Stay here!

92
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,764
I'll tell you if
you need to go look for help.

93
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,516
- Stay there!
- Boss?

94
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,603

[phone ringing]

96
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,774
So don't leave, okay?
Move back to our place.

97
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,609
Bro, I'll call you later.

98
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,487
- Watch Matmat. I have to go.
- Bro, wait! Bro!

99
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,031
Bro!

100
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,366
Bro!

101
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,953
Oh, yes! Ma'am, sir! Are you hungry?

102
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,830
Of course you are!
Why else would you be here?

103
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,165
Mia?

104
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,126
Mia? Mia!

105
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,838
[somber music playing]

106
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,174
Mia. Are you okay?

107
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,592
Are you hurt?

108
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,928
I want to cut her, Vincent.

109
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,847
[somber music continues]

110
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,640
Cut what? Cut who?

111
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,936
I want to cut my mother out of my life.

112
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:59,150
[somber music continues]

113
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,777
Are you having nightmares again?

114
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,238
Did your sleep paralysis come back?

115
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,366
Mia, when did it come back?

116
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,828
Ever since I came back here.

117
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,207
[somber music continues]

118
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,291
Okay.

119
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,252
Let's get you out of here. Go get dressed.

120
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,214
- I'll take you some--
- No!

121
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,007
[music turns unsettling]

122
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,926
Mia, go get dressed.

123
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,512
Don't worry about your stuff.
I'll have them shipped to you.

124
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,306
What's important is I get
you out of here as soon as possible.

125
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,266
Just leave me be or we'll have a fight.

126
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,436
- I… I don't care, Mia. I don't care.
- [music turns somber]

127
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,606
I need to get you out of here
before you ruin your life

128
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,941
because of your hallucinations.

129
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,276
Go get dressed.

130
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,321
- Fine. You wear that. Let's go.
- No!

131

- [grunts]
- [groans in pain]

[Vincent] <i>Madeth!</i>

133
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,286
Boss?

134
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,788
Boss, are you asking for help?

135
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,958
- [Vincent] <i>Madeth!</i>
- Boss, do you need my help?

136
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,587
[pained grunts]

137
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,798
- Mia!
- [hurried footsteps approaching]

138
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,716
Boss? Boss V!

139
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,969
Oh, Boss V! What happened?!

140
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,554
Madeth. [grunts]

141
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,056
Get Mia. We're taking her with us.

142
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,643
- Get her in the car, come on.
- Madeth, I'll give you a bonus.

143
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,769
If you don't help him.

144
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,772
[somber music continues]

145
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:20,982
What?

146
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,733
Is money all that it takes?

147
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,236
Come on, Madeth! Get her in the car!

148
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,696
[Vincent breathing heavily]

149
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,613
Miss Mia.

150
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,948
- Come on.
- No!

151
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,784
- Miss Mia, come with us.
- Whether you like it or not…

152
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,661
- [Madeth] Please, Miss Mia.
- [Vincent] This is for your own sake!

153
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,122
- [Madeth] Come with us, Miss Mia.
- [Vincent] Don't be so stubborn!

Hey! Miss Mia!

155
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,168
- Let me go! No! No!
- [Madeth] Miss Mia!

156
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,752
- Miss Mia!
- [Vincent] Mia, come with us!

- Mia, come on!
- [Mia] No!

- [Mia] No!

[ominous music playing]

160

- [huffs, exhales loudly]
- [music ends]

165
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,282
You were just like Prince Charming.

166
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,203
You came all the way here
just for your company's sake?

167
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,497
Patrick, you don't understand.

168
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,291
You don't know what
Mia experienced in this house.

169
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,169
But you can't force
her to leave if she doesn't want to.

170
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,589
Patrick, can you please listen?!

171
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,549
Mia can't stay in this house.

172
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,551
[Madeth] Hey. Hey. Boss.

173
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,178
Mia! Mia! Hold on!

174
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,513
- Boss, wait!
- Let me go!

[Vincent] Mia! Mia! Wait!

00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,432
- [Madeth] Boss, wait!
- Mia!

177
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,767
- Come back…
- Boss, wait!

178
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,560
…when you can face Mia
like decent people.

179
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,187
- [door slides]
- Wait, you don't--

180
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,230
- [door shuts]
- Mia!

181
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,731
- [banging on door]
- [lock clicks]

182
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,783
We're changing the gate lock.

183
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,368
Did you go out earlier?

184
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,495
We locked the door before we left.

185
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,456
I guess.

186
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,543
I don't really remember.

187
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,213
Are you still not feeling okay?

188
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:13,928
Here.

189
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,805
It's for your headache.

190
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,016
You looked like
you were getting a fever last night.

191
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,105
You went out to buy that for me?

192
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,860
I tagged along with Matmat when he left.

193
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,030
Take it, before your sickness gets worse.

194
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,115
[exhales sharply]

195
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,994
I don't need that.

196
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,163
Medicine doesn't work on me.

197
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,086
- Maybe you don't need medicine--
- What part do you not understand?

198
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,921
Does fresh air make you feel better?

199
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:57,013
["Kathang Isip"

200
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,812
[chuckles softly]

201
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,566
It seems you're feeling better.

202
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,901
[music fades]

203
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,653
No.

[car engine rumbling quietly]

205
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,950
You're smiling now.

206
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:24,582
If I say yes, you'll take me home.

207
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,670
So no, I'm still not feeling better.

208
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,464
[inhales, exhales sharply]

[car engine continues rumbling quietly]

210
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,066
You know what?

211
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,447
I'd run away with you.

212
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:04,163
Just say when and I'll drop everything.

213
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:10,002
[romantic music playing]

214
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,838
What do you think?

215
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,299
Let's escape this world.

216
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:23,391
[romantic music continues]

217
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:35,986
Silence.

218
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,781
Is that a yes?

219
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:45,955
[romantic music continues]

220
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,207
What do you want to eat?

221
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,458
[sighs deeply]

222
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,419
Change topic?

223
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,003
Seriously, what do you want to eat?

224
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,088
You…

225
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,093
What do you want to eat?

226
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,056
I'm asking you.

227
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,688
[exhales] Anything.

228
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,692
I'll eat whatever you give me.

229
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:21,782
[romantic music continues]

230
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:37,131
[romantic music continues]

231
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,435
So dirty.

232

[romantic music fades]

233
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,024
[fake cries]

234
00:12:55,691 --> 00:13:00,779
You shouldn't be sad…
sad while eating, Jason.

235
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,075
Who wouldn't be sad, Matmat?

236
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,120
Your brother said he'd call.

237
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,002
What.. what's the problem with that?

238
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,630
He didn't say when.

239
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,260
Look, Matmat, look.

240
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,972
Wherever you're moving, I'm there too.

241
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,266
It's like we're
practically joined at the hip!

242
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,270
[stammers] You can't be joined at the hip.

243
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:37,942
That's not possible, Jason.

244
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,695
And now he won't
even say when he's calling?

245
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:43,989
Not a word.

246
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:51,580
I-If Patpat says he'll call, he will.

247
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,416
H-He doesn't lie.

248
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,668
Matmat, he's like that with you

249
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,295
- because he always calls you.
- [chair scrapes]

250
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,463
But what about me?

251
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,382
What am I?

252
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,759
What am I to Patrick?

253
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,347
A friend.

254
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,185
I'm his brother, you're his friend.

255
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,270
Oh, yes!

256
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,480
I'm his friend.

257
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,691
Just his friend.

258
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,236
And you made the biggest mistake

259
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,072
of falling in love with your best friend.

260
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,241
- Yes… No!
- [quirky music playing]

261
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,119
Hey! We're just friends, okay?

262
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,664
Oh sorry, I thought
you were like Marvin and Jolina.

263
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,790
Classic love team.

264
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,878
Are you done ranting?
Can I talk to Matmat now?

265
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,422
[quirky music continues, ends]

266
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,883
Do you know me?

267
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,844
Matmat, aren't you the one
who took her the order?

268
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,138
Uh, Matmat,

269
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,766
I'm Maria Bernadeth "Madeth" Balagtas.

270
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,226
Just call me Madeth.

271
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,022
Ah! Your name doesn't even suit you.

272
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,399
Shut up.

273
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:04,778
Matmat, I'm Boss Vincent's assistant.

274
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,740
We met at Miss Mia's mansion.

275
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,368
Ugh! "Mia, Mia…"
everything's always about Mia!

276
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,204
He's got way too many issues.

277
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:20,628
I-I'm Matthew Gonzales, Matmat for short.

278
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,171
I'm 35 years old.

279
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,424
Oh…

280
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,009
[hesitates]

281
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,137
- Matmat--
- Are you going to pay now?

282
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,640
No-- I mean, yes!

283
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,309
Of course, but later.

284
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,729
Matmat, can we talk first?

285
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,107
Hmm…

286
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,199
[indistinct background chatter]

287
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,202
[spoon clatters]

288
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,328
It doesn't taste good?

289
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,789
It's not the same.

290
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,668
Waiter!

291
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,086
[waiter] Yes, ma'am?

292
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:07,800
Can I please order salted egg with tomato?

293
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,928
Don't slice them. Just serve both whole.

294
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,889
Mia, that's literally the same.

295
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,225
- Salted egg and tomato.
- It's different.

296
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,060
I know it is.

297
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:23,107
Even if you say "I'm empty inside".

298
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,236
Sorry for saying that.

299
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,571
Okay.

300
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,867
That's it?

301
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,999
Here's your order, ma'am.

302
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,626
- [thud]
- Thank you.

303
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,129
Now do it.

304
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,006
[plates clinks]

305
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,924
What?

306
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,926
[offbeat music playing]

307
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,804
Mix the salted egg and the tomato.

308
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:06,734
- [squelching]
- [offbeat music continues]

309

T-Tea.

310
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,407
- So, as I was saying
- [offbeat music fades]

311
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,495
aside from being
a glorified slave of Boss Vincent,

312
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,123
you can say that I'm
also like an instant coffee.

313
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,708
Three in one.

314
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,960
For the amount of workload that I handle.

315
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,629
[engine hums distantly]

316
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,799
Just like Matmat.
He has a ton of things to do.

317
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,177
Correct! Correct!

318
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,013
And speaking of handles,

319
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,558
one of the things I'm
handling is Miss Mia's new book.

320
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,352
And because you're her illustrator,

321
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:47,232
I need to know your creative process.

322
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,777
Mm…

323
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,445
[lively music playing]

324
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,155
Creative process?

325
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,990
Hmm…

326
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:59,161
Just walk me through how
you conceptualize and draw.

327
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,206
[lively music continues]

328
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:07,669
M-Matmat gets a pencil and paper,

329
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,632
then he just draws whatever he thinks of.

330
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,635
Oh, right. That's how it is. Yes!

331
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:19,181
But how about the other things like,

332
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,101
uh, where do you get inspiration from?

333
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,813
Do you have any drafts or sketches?

334
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,690
Matmat, do you have
sketches or examples? Hey!

335
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,734
[lively music continues]

336
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,860
Bye, Jason!

337
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,195
- Bye, Matmat!
- Matmat--

338
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,697
Enjoy Jason's Grilled Chicken!

339
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,407
- Matmat!
- [Jason] Yes, sir!

340
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,867
M-Matmat?

341
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,912
Where's he going?

342
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,206
Isn't it obvious?

343
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,332
He's going home.

344
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:49,503
[lively music continues]

345
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,963
- He just left me?
- [lively music fades]

346
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,259
[Mia exhales deeply]

347
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,802
I'm so full.

348
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,806
How about you?

349
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,058
You're done eating? You hardly ate.

350
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,186
It's okay.
I'm still full. Just water for me.

351
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,397
You don't want to eat.

352
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,149
You don't want to have fun.

353
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,400
You don't want to have sex.

354
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,986
- [glass clinks]
- [Patrick coughs]

355
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,487
- Come on.
- Mia!

356
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,489
You really don't want to have sex?

357
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,409
Meaning. Do you not have any experience?

358
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,035
[playful music playing]

359
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,787
What kind of question is that?

360
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:25,873
Let's go.

361
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,585
[playful music continues]

362
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,086
Mister, I'll leave the money here.

363
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,089
[playful music intensifies, fades]

364
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,841
What was that?

365
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,885
[Mia sighs] What I mean is,

366
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,928
you seem like
you don't want anything at all.

367
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,930
At least with your brother,

368
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,724
painting is his thing.

369
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,019
With you, it's like nothing excites you.

370
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,647
That's not true. I also have wants.

371
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,482
I just don't give them much attention.

372
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,401
Of course.

373
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,819
Because of your brother.

374
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,488
But why not loosen up a bit?

375
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,824
I don't have the time for it, Mia.

376
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,369
If you really like something,

377
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,746
you'll make time for it.

378
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,415
Do you want me to help you?

379
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,626
Help me with what?

380
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,920
To loosen up.

381
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,421
To find your thing.

382
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,799
Or whatever your thing is,
let's do it together.

383
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,264
Let's help the stiff Patrick have fun.

384
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,688
What you need to help is yourself.

385
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,940
Come on.

386
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,282
[cicadas chirping]

387
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,285
I'm so happy that we went on a date again.

388
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,664
Why do you keep saying
that we should go on a date?

389
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,167
Because you're always
saying that it's not a date.

390
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,836
I said we'd just get some fresh air.

391
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,715
We did get some fresh air at the bridge,

392
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,342
that was a date.

393
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,177
It wasn't a date.

394
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,763
[Patrick sighs]

395
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,309
We need to go home. Matmat’s all alone.

396
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,395
- What's the hurry?
- I'll just check on him.

397
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,646
- Give me that.
- Mia!

398
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,314
- [phone ringing]
- Oh!

399
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:16,858
Hello?

400
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,026
Who is it?

401
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,486
- Hi, Gemma!
- Mia--

[playful music playing]

403
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,410
Where's Patrick?

404
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,912
He's here. He's with me. Why?

405
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,038
Mia.

406
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,749
Isn't it obvious?

407
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,626
I need to talk to him.

408
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,920
Wait on. I'll put you on speaker phone.

409
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,964
[playful music continues]

410
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,591
Okay, Gemma girl. Ask away.

411
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,302
Say hi.

412
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,888
Uh, Patrick…

413
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,517
I just want to know why
you didn't go to work today.

414
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,978
[playful music continues]

415
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,229
You were absent?

416
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,565
You said it was your day off.

417
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,277
I'm sorry, Gemma. Mia's been annoying.

418
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,487
I didn't go to work because--

419
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,573
- I do, I do!
- We have a winner!

420
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,660
- [applauding]
- [playful music continues]

421
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,329
Oh, yes.

422
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,040
There's obviously a winner today.

423
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:18,003
[playful music continues, ends]

424
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,547
I needed to do something.

425
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,050
Is there a problem at the hospital?

426
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,843
- [tense music playing]
<i>- </i>[Gemma] <i>Nothing.</i>

427
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,595
I was just wondering…

428
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,059
That's it.
I need to go Patrick, the jeepney's here.

429
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,351
<i>What about your car?</i>

430
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,897
My car, huh?

431
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,443
[tense music continues, fades]

432
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,446
So…

433
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,784
You were absent from work today,

434
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,952
so we can get fresh air together?

435
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,663
You shouldn't have done that to Gemma.

436
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,166
You were absent from work today,

437
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,044
to take care of me.

438
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,255
And then you'll tell
me that this isn't a date?

439
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:08,887
["Hiwaga" by Dana Balagtas playing]

440
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,435
You told me that I should leave.

441
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,022
To run away.

442
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,488
But how am I supposed to go
if you were holding me this tight?

["Hiwaga" continues]

444
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,756
That's why you didn't leave me.

445
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,094
That's why I'm here with you now.
