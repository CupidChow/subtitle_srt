I want to talk to Miss Mia

42
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,161
You should probably ask Vincent.

[Dipong] That's the thing.

44
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,373
Sir Vincent is not responding to me.

45
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,670
Since Miss Mia is the owner of the house,
I thought I'd ask her.

46
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,673
She can't talk to you right now.

47
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,550
You'll have to ask her some other time.

48

In the past, Vincent's
never failed to pay me my salary.

49

Please be patient.
Maybe he just forgot about it.

00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,380
Matmat's going to Jason's Inasal.

182
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,757
Don't worry. You won't get lost, Matmat.

183
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,512
Matmat will type
it on his phone to be sure.

184
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,765
Matmat, I'll go with you.

185
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,936
You're coming? Why?

186
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,105
I'll take you there.

187
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,024
You don't have to do that.

188
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,861
You might be late for work.

189
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,782
I'm not going to work today, Matmat.

190
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,284
[plates clattering]

191
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,869
Mm, okay.

192
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,914
Patpat's coming to Jason's Inasal too.

193
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,418
Is Miss Mia's not eating?

194
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,005
She said she'll eat later.

195
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,427
Why? Is she okay?

196
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:51,473
She's not getting up? Is she sick?

197
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,395
Oh, uh…

198
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,897
She just wants to rest a bit more.

199
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:03,444
If she's sick, you can help her.

200
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:08,198
You're a nurse aide,
so you can help sick people.

201
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:18,834
[gentle music playing]

202
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,212
Okay, here's what we'll do, Matmat.

203
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,798
Let's set aside some breakfast for her,

204
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,052
and later we'll get
her some medicine, okay?

205
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,974
That way, we have medicine
ready just in case Miss Mia's sick.

206
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,226
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

207
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,354
- [gentle music fades]
- [birds chirping]

208
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,945
[tapping]

209
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,908
[keyboard clacking]

210
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:57,998
[pensive music playing]

211
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,341
[pensive music fades]

212
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:11,303
[Anok] We are still treating
her psychosis and depression,

213
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,348
so the delusions might continue.

214
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:20,396
Because of what happened,
Elvie might also have lucid moments.

215
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,524
In the middle of all the confusion,

216
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,861
there might be brief flashes of clarity.

217
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:32,282
But those moments might
only last seconds or minutes.

218
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,827
We don't know how long,

219
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,538
then she slips back into her delusions.

220
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,874
That's right.
So we have to watch her even more closely.

221
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,251
- Yes, Doc.
- Yes, Doc.

222
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:48,549
Doc, shouldn't we also ask
Mia what she said the patient?

223
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,010
It might help with Elvie's evaluation.

224
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,054
Yes, I wanted
to talk to her about that too.

225
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,514
[Patty] Maybe,

226
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,350
Mia told Elvie that her daughter is dead.

227
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,602
That's the only
thing that could shock her.

228
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,771
Why would she tell Elvie that?

229
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,815
Does she even know Elvie's history?

230
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,819
- Maybe Patrick told her.
- No way!

231
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,992
I mean, Patrick is professional.

232
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:19,163
He knows our patients' profile
must be treated with confidentiality.

233
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,248
[Emman] But, Doc Anok,

234
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,168
this is the second time
Mia was involved with a patient.

235
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,546
Third, if we count what
happened with her father.

236
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,006
So, what do you mean, Doc Emman?

237
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,759
Should we remove Mia?

238
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:38,348
For now, I think
we should suspend Mia's sessions

239
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,602
until Elvie's case is resolved.

240
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,228
That's all for now.

241
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,772
Let's get back to work!

242
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,441
Uh, Jun? I mean, Pogi.

243
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,152
Tell Patrick I want to talk to him.

244
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:54,198
Doc Anok, Patrick told
me he'll be on leave today.

245
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,741
Oh, okay.

246
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,077
Let's go.

247
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:00,996
[Eden] Gemma!

248
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,165
[chairs scraping]

249
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,959
[traffic noises]

250
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,523
You've been so busy lately,
you've barely have time to read.

251
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,735
Because… Because…

252
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,987
Matmat has lots of work to do.

253
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,322
That's true.

254
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,241
You're even busier than me.

255
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,702
Why don't you quit
your job at Jason's restaurant?

256
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,247
Isn't it tiring?

257
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,458
[traffic noises continue]

258
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,253
Matmat is not tired.

259
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,589
Matmat is okay working.

260
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,219
Patpat…

261
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,263
Patpat seems tired.

262
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,391
Me?

263
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,813
Because when Patpat is sleeping,

264
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,232
he snores as loud as Jason.

265
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,900
Like Jason?

266
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,570
But you can't sleep
when you hear Jason snoring.

267
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,116
Your snores sound different, but…

268
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,451
you're just as loud.

269
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,954
[chuckles] Sorry about that.

270
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,920
[melancholic music playing]

271
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,463
Is Patpat okay?

272
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,134
Sometimes…

273
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,178
You…

274
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,015
You seem like you are crying.

275
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,852
Like Happy who cries at night.

276
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,771
[melancholic music continues]

277
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,149
Maybe I'm just dreaming.

278
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,612
What are you dreaming about?

279
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,991
I don't remember.

280
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,870
- [melancholic music continues]
- [motorbike engine rumbles]

281
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:09,166
Happy cries at night because he is sad.

282
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:14,296
His body is okay but his heart is not.

283
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,551
Maybe Patpat is like that too.

284
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,847
You think I'm not okay?

285
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,975
Because…

286
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,104
[melancholic music continues]

287
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,814
your…

288
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,901
your heart is not okay.

289
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,741
When our body hurts,

290
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,244
we say, "Ow!"

291
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,330
And when our heart hurts,

292
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,540
we cry a lot.

293
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,920
You cry at night. That means…

294
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,090
…your heart hurts.

295
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:04,596
[melancholic music continues]

296
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,852
[Mia crying]

297
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,022
<i>- Mia, wake up! Mia!</i>
<i>- No! </i>[sobs]

298
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,816
<i>Get out of here!</i>

299
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,987
<i>Go! She'll kill you!</i>

[melancholic music continues]

302
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,251
That was deep, Matmat.

303
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,962
Did Happy really say that?

304
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,424
Happy cries when he is sad.

305
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,675
He wants…

306
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,845
He just wants a friend.

307
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,267
He just wants to run and play.

308
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:55,439
[melancholic music turns tender]

[jeep gears grind, engine idles]

[Patrick] Careful.

[tender music continues, fades]
