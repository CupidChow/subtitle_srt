<i>Let me do my job!</i>

00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,504
<i>I'm the nurse manager now,</i>

3
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:07,340
<i>and I'm removing Samuel</i>
<i>from under your monitoring.</i>

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,925
<i>- But--</i>
<i>- But what, Olivia?</i>

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,010
<i>Mia's part of my family now, Ma.</i>

6
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,680
<i>She and Matmat are</i>
<i>the most important to me right now.</i>

7
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,766
<i>Once I prove</i>
<i>that Ma'am Ingrid is still alive,</i>

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,060
<i>I want her to pay</i>
<i>for what she did to you.</i>

9
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,270
<i>But if I go down that path,</i>

10
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,355
<i>- Happy Day!</i>
<i>- it might affect Mia.</i>

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,399
<i>Am I one of those people you'll protect?</i>

12
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,526
<i>Mia, you're part of our family now.</i>

13
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,070

18
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,137
[Tommy] Matmat,
I see you're painting again.

[Matmat stammering]

20
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,598
Mister Tommy!

21
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,974
H-Happy Day!

22
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:40,975
[Tommy chuckles]

23
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,560
I'm sure this will make you happy.

24
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,561
- Here.
- [gasps]

25
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:47,482
Thank you for all your help,

26
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:51,194
and for lending me that book.

27
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,447
D-Did Mister Tommy love the book?

28
00:01:54,531 --> 00:02:00,203
Did he enjoy the story of
"The Kid Batibat Visited"?

29
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,287
[Tommy] Absolutely!

30
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,206
- I know it by heart now.
- [giggles]

31
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,166
By the way, Matmat…

32
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,294
are you able to paint butterflies now?

33
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,213
[pensive music playing]

34
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,632
[stammering] Not yet.

35
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,135
Not yet, Mister Tommy.

36
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,971
Matmat still can't paint butterflies.

37
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,765
But Matmat will try.

38
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,392
He will keep trying.

39
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,519
I'm curious.

00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,937
[pensive music continues]

41
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,482
Who do you think will
be the first between us?

42
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,985
First in what, Mister Tommy?

43
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,404
Is there a race?

44
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,865
[chuckles softly] I'm
not talking about a race.

45
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,993
Who will be-- Who will be first?

46
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:44,164
You painting butterflies…

47
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,832
[breathes deeply]

48
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,626
…or me getting past my trauma?

[pensive music continues]

50
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:58,303
It… It depends on
who will find the door first.

51
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,763
Mister Tommy or Matmat?

52
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,932
[chuckles] You remember!

53
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,225
You're right!

54
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:09,355
May we find the door at the same time,

55
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,275
so we can leave together.

56
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,693
[pensive music continues]

57
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,821
W-We will leave side by side.

- Ma'am Eden.
- Patrick.

63
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,798
I was hoping to talk to you.

64
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,384
What about?

65
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,222
I want you to give Mia a heads-up,

66
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,934
since you're always together.

67
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,143
Mia is aware that--

68
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,645
Let me finish.

[tense music playing]

70
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,482
All I'm saying is,

71
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,652
if she needs to organize any documents

72
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,196
or say anything to her father,

73
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,281
now is the time.

74
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,284
[tense music continues]

75
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,119
Alright, I'll tell her that.

76
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,331
Make sure she understands, Patrick.

77
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,293
So that on her next visit,

78
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,421
she can focus on her father.

79
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,552

Samuel.

92
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,350

- [machine beeping]
- [unsettling music continues]

94

Get me out of here.

Please get me out of this place.

96
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,453
I've had enough of this place.

[unsettling music continues]

98
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,087

Matmat. You're here.

108
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,554
How long have you been here?

109
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:34,519
Mmm. Matmat just
finished his work at OK Hospital.

110
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,145
[exhales heavily]

111
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,188
Perfect.

112
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,315
I have something to discuss with you.

Is this the latest
draft of your illustrations?

116

T-Those are Mister Box,

117

Mask Boy,

118
00:06:56,457 --> 00:07:00,378
and Princess Without Feelings.

119
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,046
They don't have faces.

120
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,340
They're human characters.
They need faces.

121
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,427
Mask Boy and Mister Box…

122
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,556
T-They have their faces hidden.

123
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,976
They don't need f-facial details.

124
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,978
[Mia sighs]

125
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,396
In all of my books,

126
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,314
the characters have faces.

127
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,775
They may not have proper nouns as names,

128
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,861
but it's important
that they do have faces.

129
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,863
[stammering] It's hard. It's hard.

130
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,950
M-Matmat just cannot draw faces.

131
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,327
It's too hard. Too hard.

132
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,912
Listen, Matmat.

133
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,874
You have a poster of expressions, right?

134
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,625
You can learn from it.

135
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,918
[Matmat stammering]

136
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,796
Matmat looks at it.

137
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,134
[sighs heavily]
How about you start practicing?

138
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,554
You want Matmat to practice?

139
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,638
Yes.

140
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,224
They say practice makes progress.

141
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,644
Start by drawing expressions.

142
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,606
As you go,
imagine what the characters look like.

143
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,275
Once you can do that,
you'll be able to draw their faces.

144
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,693
Mmm.

145
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,903
Matmat.

146
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,697
I know you can do it.

147
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,742
You're talented, observant…

148
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,744
But we have a deadline to work to.

149
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,954
You must finish everything by next week.

[Matmat stammering]

151
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,585
Next week? M-Mister Box
and friends need to have faces?

152
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,504
Yes. You need to turn in the final draft.

Faces.

- He suddenly…

187
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,665
Come on.

188
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,084
[Olivia] Samuel!

189
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,879
Samuel, can you hear me?

190
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,464
You're in the hospital.

191
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,633
I can take care of him, Olivia.

How are you?

198
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,701
I haven't seen you.

199
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,786
I'm good.

200
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,039
About the thing
you were asking me the other day.

201
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,625
With Ma'am Ingrid and your mom.

00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,336
Is it okay now?

[uneasy music playing]

205
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,341
Why do you ask?

206
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,011
It's nothing.

207
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,639
It's just that you looked worried.

208
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,935
Don't worry. It's all good.

Will those three find
what they're looking for?

213
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,889
Hey!

214
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,599
No reading.

215
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,685
Neither of you won't
even share it with me.

216
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,811
No.

217
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,521
You have to wait until it's done.

218
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,148
That’s too much of a suspense.

Go.

222
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,910
You don't want to go?
Do you have anything to say?

223
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,162
What is it?

224
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,997

229

And so?

Mia…

231

Oh, Vincent.

For you.

257
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,569
Apologies. My friend just
returned from the farm in Benguet.

258
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,070
That's why it took me a while.

259
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,824
You shouldn't have bothered.

260
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,785
You always tell me not to bother.

I'm sorry I didn't
message you while I was in Manila.

This is all Madeth's fault.

Madeth?

I should not have

I should, listen to you alone.

Looks like you've contemplated
a lot while you were in Manila.

271

All I did there was work.

272

And my business dinner with Erica--

273
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,368
We didn't even follow up on.

274
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,912
And to be honest,

275
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,123
I'm able to think more
sensibly here in Maravida.

- Hmm.
- [tender music continues]

I shouldn't be rushing into things.

Ma'am Eden.

287
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,831
Why did you lie?

288
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,290
What?

289
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,751
You said,
you didn't do anything to Samuel.

290
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,588
But I saw on the CCTV
footage that you were talking to him.

- [morose music playing]
- Ma'am--

Do you want me
to report this to Dr. Anok?

293
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,761
You've committed
countless offenses, Patrick.

294
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,139
This is grounds for your termination.

295
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,725
Ma'am, I didn't want
that to happen to Sir Samuel.

296
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,143
What did you say to him anyway?

297
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,811
For him to react that way?

[morose music continues]

299
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,607
I asked him how he was doing.

300
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,277
I mentioned Mia's name.

301
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,072
Is it bad to mention his daughter's name?

302
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,493
You shouldn't be doing things
that you're aren't ordered to do.

303
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:23,250
You didn't even know that you were
ruining a patient's treatment.

Is that your sad face?

[Jason] Yes, Matmat. This is a sad face.

No, Matmat asked me
to help him with drawing expressions.

He's practicing how to draw expressions.

338

Drawing expressions? Matmat, that means

- Wow!

How happy do you want, Matmat?

00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,807
You don't want that, Matmat?
Hold on, Madeth.

363
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,351
Didn't like hers? It was good!

364
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,020
Like the one who won the lottery,
draw that one!

365
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,150
- [quirky music resumes]
- Oh, oh no! Madeth, what was that?

366
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,610
Why are you feeling this way.

367
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,613
Why would you say that?
Noticed by your crush?

368
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,866
What did my crush notice?
What is it, Madeth?

369
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,534
[quirky music ends]

370
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,704
So, I'm the one you want to drink with?

371
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,748
[crickets chirping]

372
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,842
Is this about your papa?

373
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,555
Gemma.

374
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,642
What if we were switched at birth?

375
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:16,400
What if Miss Li was my mama,
and you had my papa?

376
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,114
- Mia…
- What would happen?

377
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,158
Come on.

378
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,619
It's just a "what if."

379
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,455
[pensive music playing]

380
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:35,043
If it was like that,
and you were mama's daughter…

381
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,381
She'd pinch your inner
thigh for talking like that.

382
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,924
[chuckles]

383
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,093
[inhales] That's true.

384
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,055
As for you…

385
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:54,688
My parents would be so
happy having a nice daughter like you.

386
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,524
[music becomes uneasy]

387
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,693
Someone who would be afraid of them.

388
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,112
Afraid?

389
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,823
You're afraid of your papa?

390
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,951
I'm afraid of my mama.

391
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,746
[uneasy music continues]

392
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,958
That's why I tried to be
a good daughter growing up.

393
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,963
Because I was afraid of her.

394
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,674
[haunting music playing]

395
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,384
Mama?

396
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,429
Mama, I'm hungry.

397
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,473
Aren't we going to eat dinner?

398
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,308
You're disturbing me!

399
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,979
Didn't I tell you to not
disturb me while I'm writing?

400
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:42,944
[haunting music continues]

401
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,949
[flies buzzing]

402
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:07,010
[haunting music softens, ends]

403
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,680
I just didn't want her to hate me.

404
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,103
I used to think she was
the only one that liked me.

405
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,857
[melancholic music playing]

406
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,442
[Mia] <i>Until I met him.</i>

407
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,573
<i>I wanted to go with him…</i>

408
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,452
so that I didn't
need to live life in fear.

409
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,205
<i>But those plans…</i>

410
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,750
<i>were thwarted by her.</i>

411
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:43,672
[melancholic music continues]

412
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:48,051
You're so luck to have
a supportive mother like Miss Li.

413
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,055
[exhales heavily]

414
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,267
[glass clinks]

415
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,687
As for my papa, [scoffs]

416
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,606
I'm not afraid of him.

417
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,860
I just…

418
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:09,072
never felt his presence. Never.

419
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,783
He was just there.

420
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,496
He didn't do anything for you?

421
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,331
Like what?

422
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,961
Try to protect me
from the cruel ways of my mother?

423
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,006
He didn't do anything.

424
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:29,593
[melancholic music continues]

425
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,927
Wait…

426
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,722
There was one thing.

427
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,809
He read me a fairytale.

428
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,188
That's it?

429
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,734
Yeah, just once.

430
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,445
Nothing more.

431
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:54,659
[melancholic music continues]

432
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,586
[melancholic music fades]

433
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:13,094
[suspenseful music playing]

434
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,388
- [door opens]
- [machine beeping]

435
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:22,103
[beeping continues]

436
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:34,157
[beeping continues]

437
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:39,537
[suspenseful music continues]

438
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,545
Do you want a drink of water?

439
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,633
I want to…

440
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,388
I want to tell the truth.

441
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:02,060
- [beeping continues]
- [suspenseful music continues]

442
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,478
What's the truth?

443
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,398
I did…

444
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,358
[beeping intensifies]

445
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,402
…something bad.

446
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,700
Don't think too hard, Samuel.

447
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,495
I killed her.

448
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,873
I killed my wife.

449
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,458
[ominous music sting]

450
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,838
- [beeping continues]
- [dramatic music playing]

451
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,177
[dramatic music crescendos]

452
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,266
<i>You two are mine and mine alone.</i>

453
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,892
<i>I killed her.</i>

454
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,229
<i>There are only two people</i>
<i>in this hospital that could be Ingrid.</i>

455
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,232
<i>They're the two people</i>
<i>who are connected to Mia's papa.</i>

456
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,819
<i>Mia saw how I killed my wife!</i>

457
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,362
<i>Is that why you strangled Mia?</i>

458
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,949
<i>No matter what I discover,</i>
<i>I'll get you out, Mia.</i>

459
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,910
<i>Do you know where Mia is?</i>
<i>Mister Samuel is missing.</i>
