00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,810
What are you going to do?

180
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,229
- Uh…
- Are you going to talk?

181
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,772
[Mia chuckles softly]

182
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,193
Can Matmat join you?

183
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,406
- [Mia chuckling]
- [quirky music playing]

184
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:37,326
Matmat, I bought
new art materials for you.

185
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,163
- New coloring materials…
- Wow! Wow!

186
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,417
- [Matmat giggling]
- [Patrick sighs deeply]

187
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,003
Uh, Madeth.

188
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,546
Are you talking with someone?

189
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,631
Uh…

190
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,133
I'm not.

191
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,095
I'm just watching videos
because I need to finish this

192
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,681
'A day in the life of a writer' project.

193
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,726
I see. It's your new
endorsement with Vincent, right?

194
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,061
Correct! Yes! Exactly.

195
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,855
Boss V called.

196
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,898
He said Miss Erica is
already asking for the video.

197
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,650
I told him I'm still working on it.

198
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,653
So you've spoken to him?

199
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:19,952
Yeah. He was with
Miss Erica when he called.

200
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,746
[quirky music playing]

201
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,915
[whispers] He called Madeth
but didn't bother to message me.

202
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,168
What did you just say, sis?

203
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:31,714
Huh? Nothing.
I said that endorsement seems important.

204
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,759
Vincent even spent
the day with your client.

205
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,010
So tell me…

206
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,970
Are you saying that she's missing me?

207
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,432
She didn't directly say it, Boss V.

208
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,685
But I just have a gut feeling.

209
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,564
Madeth, I'm not sure
your gut feeling should be trusted.

210
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,027
Then why did
you hire me for this job, Boss V?

211
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,446
Trust me, Boss V.

212
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,656
Just a little push,

213
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,950
Gemma will eventually
verbalize that she misses you.

214
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,453
<i>Sure, sure. I'll call her right now.</i>

215
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,039
Hey! No, Boss V!

216
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,667
Don't! Don't call her yet!

217
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,337
Why? What if Gemma is
upset because I haven't text her?

218
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,131
Oh, Boss V.

219
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:18,386
Haven't you heard
of delayed gratification?

220
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,972
Just wait for my signal.
I'll tell you when it's time.

221
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,517
So what? You're the boss now?

222
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,519
I'm the one getting orders from you now?

223
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,561
[Erica] Vincent.

224
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,773
Miss Erica?

225
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,817
Boss V, is that Miss Erica?

226
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,068
- [Erica] Hi!
- Hi!

227
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,070
- Hi! Hello!
- Erica!

228
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,073
Boss V?

229
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,284
Oh, sorry. I got a little excited.

230
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,870
Really? We've been
talking on the phone for a while.

231
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,249
No, but it's different
seeing you in person.

232
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,251
Oh, yeah. Um…

233
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,378
- Let's have a seat.
- Yeah.

234
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,546
Uh, Miss!

235
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,755
Good to see you. How are you?

236
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,425
I'm good. I'm good and
I'm happy to see you as well.

237
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,218
Uh, yes. We'll order, please.

238
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,429
Okay. Uh…

239
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,348
Patpat,

240
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,934
Dr. Anok said

241
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:14,692
in different countries
the butterfly is a cure.

242
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,487
Cure…

243
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,116
What does that mean?

244
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,286
Does the illness go away?

245
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,037
Is it like…

246
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,834
If you could drink the butterfly

247
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,127
then you'll be healed.

248
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,129
[gentle music playing]

249
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,089
It's not a drug, Matmat.

250
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,508
What doc meant was,

251
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,719
the butterflies…

252
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,930
are a symbol of healing.

253
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,600
Remember, they were caterpillars first

254
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,019
before they became butterflies.

255
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:55,858
[page turning effect]

256
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,072
[gentle music continues]

257
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,825
They're like dinosaurs.

258
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,579
They start out as
babies then they grow old.

259
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,540
Could be.

260
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,335
[page turning effect]

261
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,421
Like an Archaeopteryx.

262
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,842
First bird dinosaur.

263
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:27,681
But they're born
with wings already, Patpat.

264
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,853
What I'm trying to say is,

265
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:37,691
the butterflies' wings
and how they fly freely

266
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,612
symbolize that a person has healed.

267
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,781
The illness is gone?

268
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,619
Free from the pain.

269
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,413
Doc said,

270
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:57,294
Patpat is also getting affected because…

271
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,632
Because Matmat is scared of butterflies.

272
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,804
Are you scared of butterflies too, Patpat?

273
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,724
Not really, Matmat.

274
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,394
But…

275
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,230
I also have to move places,

276
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,650
even though I'm not the one
being chased by the butterflies.

277
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:25,239
That's why we should face our fears.

278
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:31,370
We should face
our fears so we don't have to move.

279
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,044
Do you think…

280
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,297
you can do that?

281
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,344
Do you think you can
face your fear of butterflies?

282
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:53,142
[gentle music continues]

283
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,480
We have new bread.

284
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,901
To replace what Mia burnt.

285
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,867
[panicked breaths]

286
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,121
[uneasy music playing]

287
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,332
Zelda?

288
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,876
[gasps, breathes heavily]

289
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,712
Do you know where you are?

290
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,134
[shakily] Isolation room.

291
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,387
[uneasy music continues]

292
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,640
Do you know how you got here?

293
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,141
Mm-hmm.

294
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,226
I walked here.

295
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,940
Did you go to Mia's house?

296
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,026
[Zelda whimpers]

297
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,486
[quietly] Y-Yes.

298
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,199
I wished her a happy birthday.

299
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,036
[Olivia] Did she help you to go there?

300
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,041
No, no. I was alone when I went out.

301
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,544
And then… [sobbing]

302
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,799
He thought I was her.

303
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,010
He thought I was her!

304
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,764
Who?

305
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,975
Who did they think you were?

306
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,352
Ingrid.

307
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,107
He thought I was Ingrid Hernandez.

308
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,276
- [tense music sting]
- I'm not her.

309
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,904
- [tense music sting]
- [sobs] I'm not, I'm not Ingrid.

310
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,032
Ingrid?

311
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,326
Mia's mom?

312
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,955
[sniffles, whispers] I'm not her.

313
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,416
- Do you know who he was?
- No.

314
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,292
I don't know him.

315
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,838
[panicked breathes] His face…

316
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,298
He was so mad!

317
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,634
So, so mad!

318
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,845
He thought I was Ingrid!

319
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,764
He thought I was Ingrid but that's not me!

320
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,474
That's not me!

321
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,519
He wants to kill me! I don't want to die!

322
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,898
[crying] I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!

323
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,151
Do you think she's telling the truth?

324
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,446
Do you believe that's
what happened to her?

325
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,532
That she was mistaken as Mia's mother?

326
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,369
Okay, calm down.
You're safe, you're safe.

327
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,289
[whimpers, sobs]

328
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,875
If it's true that someone kidnapped her,

329
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,335
because they thought she was Ingrid,

330
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,006
Could Samuel
and Mia be in danger too?

331
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,342
[ominous music playing]

332
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,053
Are you saying, Doc,

333
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,346
that there's someone out there

334
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,891
who is a threat to their lives?

335
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,225
Not just that.

336
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,270
What if they're looking for Ingrid

337
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,105
because she's still alive?

338
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,609
What if Ingrid is still really alive?

339
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,988
Then it's going
to change everybody's lives.

340
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,451
Maybe it'll be better if she comes back.

341
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,204
Because then…

342
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,873
there will be no more mystery.

343
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,751
No more hiding.

Hello, pretty boy.

Wine.

357
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,729
Cheese.

358
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,898
And more.

00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,738
Matmat told me something earlier.

360
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,991
He and Dr. Anok talked.

361
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,492
[music ends]

362
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,831
What are you doing?

363
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,666
Wine and cheese.

364
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,168
Let's talk.

365
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,627
[playful music playing]

366
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,630
Wine, cheese and more.

367
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,341
Me. I'm the "and more."

368
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,302
Really?

369
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,971
- [huffs]
- [wine pouring]

370
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,139
[sighs loudly]

371
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,391
You really know how to kill the mood.

372
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,394
Are we really going to talk about Matmat?

373
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,396
Well, what are we going to talk about?

374
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,480
Us.

375
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:54,860
There's so much
we can talk about and do.

376
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:59,364
So please,
let's not talk about Matmat right now.

377
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,203
Every time you mention Matmat,

378
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,246
[playful music continues]

379
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,832
you have to drink a glass of wine.

380
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,876
Fine.

381
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,294
But you drink a glass

382
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,089
every time you curse
or say something mean.

383
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,132
[scoffs]

384
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,842
That's all?

385
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,886
Fine. Deal.

386
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:26,850

389
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,652
I'm not Gemma,
I shouldn't be this drunk, this fast.

390
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,570
Don't drag other people into this.

391
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,950
Your drunk because you drank too much.

392
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:47,287
I'm sure you love
that we're talking about her.

393
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,914
[chuckles softly]

394
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,459
Leave Gemma out of it.
Come here, you're talking too much.

395
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,211
[grunts softly]

396
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,463

[romantic music playing]

398
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,883
You really just want attention, huh?

399
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,468
Mm-hmm.

400
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,848
I'm so happy, even just like this.

401
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,896
I'm so, so happy…

402
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,067
that you and Matmat
are living here with me.

403
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,445
So happy…

404
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:26,034
I'm so very, very happy.

405
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:31,832
[romantic music playing]

406
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:32,958
Me too.

407
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,673
Good night.

408
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:49,349
[romantic music swells]

Call my brother!

434
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,712
I'm leaving!
I don't want to stay here anymore!

435
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,465
Transfer me to another hospital!

[Patrick] Miss Zelda!

441
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,208
Miss Zelda, there's something
I need to ask you, before you leave.

442
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,461
Patrick, I'm about to leave.

443
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,380
You went to Mia's mansion, right?

444
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,965
Were you the one who left the butterfly?

445
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,425
We need to leave.

446
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,011
The letter? Was it from you?

447
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,013
- Yes, I put it there.
- [man] Auntie.

448
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,764
It's okay.

[tense music playing]

450
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,602
You put it there.

451
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,979
Why did you do that?

452
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,732
I put it there

453
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,067
because someone told me to.

454
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,736
Who?

455
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,822
[tense music continues]

456
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,074
I received some letters out of nowhere,

457
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,160
with instructions
to give them to someone.

458
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,207
Was it Ingrid Hernandez?

[tense music sting]

460
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,551
I'm a fan. [breathes shakily]

461
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:18,016
I'm a big, big fan of Ingrid Hernandez.

462
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,478
I know everything about her

463
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,189
because of the stories she wrote.

464
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,942
So, yes.

465
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,737
Everything was from Ingrid.

And she's alive, Patrick.

471
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,678
And if there's one thing I know for sure,

472
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,766
she's here, inside the hospital.

[ominous music intensifies]

474
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,153

<i>Your brother will fight too.</i>

486
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,611
<i>Are you ready to tell me what you saw?</i>

487
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,946
