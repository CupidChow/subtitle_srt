Is Mia Hernandez coming?

00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:05,338
Will she finally sign for her father?

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,340
See her if you have to.

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,051
Some children can bear
to leave their parents behind,

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:14,222
but no parent can bear to do the same.

6
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,850
Dear, you're coming with me, okay?

7
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,644
But I don't want to die, Papa!

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,021
You won't be able to live without me.

9
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,691
If you want to die,
leave your child out of this.

10
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,025

You want Patrick Gonzales terminated?

17
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,458
It's just a simple task, isn't it?

18
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,001
Someone must be accountable.

19
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,671
Otherwise, this
hospital's reputation will suffer.

Huh?

23

You were fired?

24
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,778
Are you serious?

25
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,155
That's a shame.
Your brother also got fired.

26
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,782
It's okay.

27
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,909

Ugh! Damn the rain!

31
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,754
I'm already looking for a new place.

32
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,299
This is bad for my business.

33
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:19,139
Bro, you do need
to follow us wherever we go.

Hey! How could you say that, bro?

I'm not the kind of
friend you leave behind.

Hey, is Matmat seeing butterflies again?

37
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,699
Not yet.

38
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,119

Finding justice for your mom is impossible

41

when Matmat is
the sole witness to her murder.

42
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,383
He said a butterfly killed her.

43
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,595
But butterflies don't
appear during the rainy season.

44
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,930
His claim doesn't make sense.
Something's wrong.

45
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,475
[doctor] Because of autism,

46
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,895
Matmat is more sensitive to stress.

47
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:12,108
He is more prone to post-traumatic
stress disorder compared to other people.

48
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,986
They struggle to express their emotions.

49
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,072
In result, they can't
properly process their trauma.

50
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,200
He'll have to undergo intensive therapy.

51
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,995
This will cost a lot.

52
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,875
And you can't be moving homes so often.

53
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:30,960
Oh.

What's up with that?

00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:39,010
Dude, if I knew,
we would've solved Mama's death by now.

Without the nightmares.

58
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,559
I'm okay with that.

Wait! What's wrong?

00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:14,119
[tapping]

363
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,622
[gurgling]

364
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,166
[splash]

365
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:24,379
[tender music continues]

366
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:34,556
[breathing heavily, gasping]

367
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,100
[coughs]

368
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:45,400
[breathes heavily, coughs]

369
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:48,320
[music fading]

370
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:04,544
[ethereal music playing]

371
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:24,856
[ethereal music continues]

372
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:49,756
[ethereal music continues]

373
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,021
[music fades]

374
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,982
Why'd you let those two meet?!

375
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,568
There was a girl and you remember
all of your beautiful memories.

376
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,446
Did I ever say those times were happy?

377
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,324
Please accept my heartfelt apology.

378
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,910
Did you get Miss Mia to sign the book?

379
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:19,995
I'll see you soon.

380
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,122
Thanks, but this is
the last time we'll see each other.

381
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,040
[Madeth] Miss Mia,
do you want something?

382
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,208
Yes.

383
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,003
Him. He's going to be mine.

384
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,796
I'll wait for you, Matmat.
