00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,086
Patrick, let's have a one-night stand.

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,173
When will you leave me alone?

3
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,800
When you stop being a hypocrite.

4
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:12,011
We all put on an act for our own reasons.

5
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,347
Look at this breathtaking view of the sea.

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:18,560
What if we bring the
view inside the hospital?

7
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,062
Doc, are you sure about this?

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,230
It's part of his therapy.

9
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,691
Wow! A big painting means a lot of money.

00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,109
[Patty] A patient escaped.

11
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,111
Junjun is giving me a headache.

12
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,321
I have something special for you.

13
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,197
It's small.

14
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,574
Don't insult my manhood!

15
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,451
I have an idea. Get in the car.

16
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,244
What? Mia took Junjun?

This is the life!

26

Gemma, pull over.

Gemma. Gemma, I said pull over!

35
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,632
Faster! Faster!

Patrick, what are you doing?!

42
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,983
Mia. Mia, stop!

43
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:12,901
Hey.

44
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,360
Watch out!

45
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,946
- [engine revs]
- I think that's Patrick.

00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,534

Get out of the car.

59
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,212
Me?

60
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,548
Impressive. You're not a coward anymore.

61
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,387
Get out.

62
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,807
No way. I'm still having fun.

63
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,688
Why don't you get in the car instead?

64
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,731
Come with us so you can have fun too.

65
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,983
Mia, stop it!

66
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,329
Why are you always mad at me?

67
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,165
Because you keep
doing things that make me mad!

68
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,459
I love it.

69
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,587
That means I have an effect on you.

70
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,049

He's tailing us.

80
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,459
Faster, Mia! Faster!

81
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,922

Hi, Patrick!

90
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,356
Mia, stop the car!

91
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,025
I don't want to.

92
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,529
Mia!

93
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,156

What is it this time, Eden?

106
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,244
Be careful what you say to me
in front of my staff.

107
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,996
All I'm looking for is accountability.

108
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,581
It's part of the job.

109
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,084
Is that so?

[ominous music sting]

113
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,681
That way, you'll get
promoted to nurse manager.

[ominous music sting]

115
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:17,979
Your performance will
disqualify you as nurse manager.

Uh…

122
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,081
It's nothing.

00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,710

She's not here, Zelda.

Hmm.

127
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:48,843
Okay.

So, this is how you want to fight, Olivia?

00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,823
Fine. Have it your way.

134
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,701
But remember,

00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,954
a fish is caught by its mouth.

136
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:24,128
Be careful or your words might reveal

[Ben] Thank you so much for your support.

Hey.

161
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,072
Patient Zelda told me that she saw

162
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,741
Ma'am Eden and
Ma'am Olivia in the storage room.

163
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,745
Pogi, you never learn your lesson, do you?

164
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,580
We're still dealing with
our problem about Junjun--

165
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,375
That's why I was doing rounds.

166
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,379
It seems the competition between those two

167
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,798
for the position of nurse
manager is getting intense.

168
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,926
I hope it's Ma'am Olivia
who gets promoted.

169
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:21,263
She'd make a good manager,
and she handles people very well.

170
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,309
But Ma'am Eden has
been here longer, right?

171
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,145
It's the skill that counts, not the time.

172
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,981
Ma'am Eden handles our unit very well.
Right, Pogi?

173
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,818
Her strictness
ensures that there's discipline.

174
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,862
I think I'm on Ma'am Olivia's side.

175
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,740
Oh, come on.

176
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:44,036
Ma'am Eden made you recite
Junjun's case notes,

177
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,454
that's why you don't like her.

178
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,456
Whose fault was it anyway?

179
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,168
Whatever. I want an easygoing boss.

180
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,878
I don't want to be
stressed out by my boss.

181
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,714
I'd rather put all
my energy into the patients.

182
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,052
But you know, come, listen.

183
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,929
Sometimes I notice

184
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:05,099
those two are fighting
over something we don't know.

185
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,436
Pogi, here you go again being a gossip.

186
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,232
Has anyone called about Junjun?

187
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,321
- [people clapping, cheering]
- [Ben] Thank you!

188
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,948
- [Ben] Thank you.
- [woman] Congressman,

189
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,535
thank you for your help when
my child was confined to the hospital.

190
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:28,164
You're so understanding
and your entire family is so thoughtful.

191
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,791
- You're welcome.
- [woman] Thank you.

192
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:37,047
[people chanting] Cong.
Martinez! Cong. Martinez!

193
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,719

194
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,846
[people chanting] Cong.
Martinez! Cong. Martinez!

195
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,389
[microphone feedback rings]

196
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,809
Hello to my dad's supporters!

197
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,019
Hello!

198
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,356
It's Junjun.

199
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,359
- What's he doing here?
- [Junjun] I'm the youngest son

200
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,820
of Congressman Martinez.

201
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:04,700
You don't know me because I'm his son
who is admitted in a psychiatric hospital.

202
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,453
All of them are here, look! Hey! Hi!

203
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,455
Mommy, Archie!

204
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,708
My cousins are here too,
and also some of our relatives.

205
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,834
Look at them.

206
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,587
They're all smart and amazing.

207
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,422
I'm the only exception.

208
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:22,092
[somber music playing]

209
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:26,764
Is it my fault that I was born a moron?

210
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,643
Dad used to smack me all the time before

211
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,853
because I'd always fail in school.

212
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,482
It's not my fault I'm
not as smart as Archie.

213
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,652
[somber music continues]

214
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,819
[exhales deeply]

215
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,113
So, yeah…

216
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,700
My father is ashamed of me.

217
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,622
I've become totally invisible.

218
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:57,336
[somber music continues]

219
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,840
But do you think that's right?

220
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,426
[Junjun sniffles]

221
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,013
That even though I was born stupid…

222
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,479
I still want to feel the same
love that he gives to Archie.

223
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,114
Aren't all kids like that?

224
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,493
We just want
to have our parents' attention.

225
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,746
[somber music continues]

226
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,248
[Tessie] It's pouring.

227
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,876
- [young Matmat] It's pouring.
- Yes, you're right, dear.

228
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,377
Are you getting rained on?

229
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,087
- Yes, Ma.
- Just hold on to me.

230
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,380
Okay, Mama.

231
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,383
- It's pouring.
- [Tessie] It is, Matmat.

232
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,635
So stay close to me.
We don't want you to get sick.

233
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,763
- [young Matmat] Matmat is wet.
- [Tessie] Oh, no.

234
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,765
Mama is drenched too.

235
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:58,856
[somber music continues]

236
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,738
So, you know what I did?

237
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,950
I did a lot of crazy things…

238
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,703
to get my dad's attention.

239
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,580
Look. Just like this.

240
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,042
- [Archie] Medic! Medic!
- [Ben] Stop him!

241
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,170
[people clamoring]

242
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,880
[woman] Ambulance! Ben!

243
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,257
Get him out of here!

244
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,469
[woman] Where's the ambulance?
Call an ambulance!

245
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,845
Hurry!

246
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:35,851
[pensive music playing]

247
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:56,956
[pensive music continues]

248
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:17,851
[pensive music continues]

249
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,693
What if I just go with you?

250
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:32,032
[tender music playing]

251
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,575
Just have fun together.

252
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,294
[tender music continues]

253
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,504
[reporter] Breaking news!

254
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,466
Cong. Benjamin Martinez Sr.'s
supporters were shocked

255
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,470
after his youngest son,
Junjun Martinez, made a scene

256
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,640
at his campaign rally in
Centro Maravida this morning.

257
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,559
- Doc.
- Junjun wasn't in…

258
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,519
What are we going to do with Mia?

259
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,438
Mia?

260
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,314
Yes.

261
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,899
[reporter] …after he stripped…

262
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,569
This wouldn't have turned this big thing

263
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,655
if Mia had escorted Junjun back inside.

264
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,076
[sighs] Shouldn't
we find out the details first?

265
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,706
Admit it, it was a bad decision
to hire Mia to teach here.

266
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,001
I don't think her teaching
has something to do with it.

267
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,502
But her mere presence

268
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,796
and how she interacts
with the patients does.

269
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,466
Doc, it's affecting the entire hospital.

270
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:34,178
That just means
you don't understand why Mia did it.

271
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,929
For all you know,

272
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,140
it's part of Junjun's therapy,

273
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,476
which will help Junjun and his family.

274
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,519
His family was minding their own business.

275
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,647
But there was a disruption
because of what Junjun did.

276
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,483
And we're responsible of him.

277
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,526
All families have problems.

278
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,864
If the Martinez's face it,
it might help strengthen their family.

279
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,200
No, I disagree.

280
00:17:56,283 --> 00:18:00,329
Mia put the patient
and his family in danger.

281
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:02,956
Well, doc?

282
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,877
[tense music playing, fades]

283
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,714
Sam, please open the door.

284
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,843
Mama!

[smacks]

00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,688
[birds chirping]

287
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,652
So?

288
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,320
Are you happy now?

289
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,825
Are you happy now that you embarrassed us
in front of the whole of Maravida?

290
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,410
Are you satisfied
that because of your anger,

291
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,497
you ruined everything
your papa worked hard for?

292
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,125
Mama, no, it's not like that.

293
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,504
Why did I have to give
birth to a moron like you?

294
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,631
[Junjun's mother sobbing]

295
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,761
Now everything's ruined.

296
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,305
- You're so selfish!
- Ma'am, that's enough.

297
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,516
- Ma'am, enough. Please.
- You're so selfish.

298
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,059
You're so selfish!

299
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,785
It's been a while
since my Mama spoke to me.

300
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,329
[somber music playing]

301
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,540
This is the best day of my life!

302
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,751
You know, Patrick,

303
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,547
even though Mama yelled at me

304
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,674
and slapped me,

305
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,635
I know she's not mad.

306
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,430
[sniffles] You know why?

307
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,433
Because that slap…

308
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,060
[somber music continues]

309
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,104
…she did it out of love.

310
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,734
Out of love?

311
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,486
[somber music continues]

312
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,529
Yes.

313
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,824
Because out of all the slaps,

314
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,493
hers didn't hurt.

315
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,247
[somber music fades]

316
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,583
[young Patrick] Ma! Ma!

317
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,002
I won this in the boxing match!

318
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,713
You came from a boxing match?

319
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,800
You left your brother to win that?!

320
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,595
Look. Look at him!

321
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,805
Some bums beat him up!

322
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,433
- You stubborn kid!
- Ma, it hurts!

323
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,435
- [crying] It hurts!
- I didn't have you learn boxing

324
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:31,772
just for you to join some contests!

325
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,983
You should've used
it to protect your brother!

326
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,027
- Ow! It hurts, Ma!
- [grunting]

327
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,612
- [young Patrick sobbing]
- [smacking]

[morose music playing]

332
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,176
Ma?

333
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,181
Ma?

334
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,268
Patrick.

335
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,435
Patrick, come.

336
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,729
Patrick, dear. Come here.

337
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,481
Come.

338
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,151
Oh, Patrick.

339
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,947
My sweet son.

340
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,076
Never leave your brother, okay?

341
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,206
Always take care of him.

342
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,042
Always protect him, okay?

343
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,338
Take care of him forever.

344
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,882
[chuckles]

345
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,592
[exhales deeply]

346
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,389
You were born…

347
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,560
to take care of your brother.

348
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:59,026
[morose music continues]

349
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:14,207
[pensive music playing]

350
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,631
I'm having so much fun in our date.

351
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,799
This isn't a date.

352
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,802
We are going to have
fun whether you like it or not.

353
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,555
Because I go crazy
whenever I get disappointed.

354
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,806
I think…

355
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,018
Mia's presence
isn't good for the patients.

356
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,186
[Vincent] Aren't you scared?

357
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,855
I want to stay here and have fun.

358
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,191
I forgot that you were different.

359
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,276
I shouldn't have
expected anything else from you.

360
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,570
What do you expect from me?

361
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,197
- Nothing!
- Patrick!

362
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,114
Patrick!
