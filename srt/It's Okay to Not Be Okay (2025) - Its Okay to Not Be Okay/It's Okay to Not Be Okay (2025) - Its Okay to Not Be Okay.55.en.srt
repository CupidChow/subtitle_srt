00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,090
[Mia chuckles softly]

183
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,884
Stand beside me, Matmat.

184
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:48,100
["Hiwaga" continues]

185
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:55,774
- [footsteps thud]
- [leaves rustling]

186
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,077
Mia's part of my family now, Ma.

187
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,750
She and Matmat are the
most important to me right now.

188
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:20,591

192
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:34,647

[photographer] Ready, sir?

197
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,083
Both of you,
please stand closer to Miss Mia.

198
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,503
Big smiles for your family picture!

199
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,672
Happy day!

200
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,507
[photographer] Yes, say "happy day!"

201
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,842
[all] Happy day!

- [camera shutter clicks]
- [music fades]

205
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,144
Yes, I saw the books you left, Madeth.

206
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,064
I'll give them to Matmat
so he can use them as a reference.

207
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,066
Okay, thanks.

208
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,824
Does that book hold
a special place in your heart?

209
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,244
I wouldn't be surprised if it does.

210
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,663
Why do you say that?

211
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,665
Because you and Happy are alike.

212
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:39,461
You don't easily
open up about your feelings.

213
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,926
I asked Jason what's going on with you.

214
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,138
Why you're upset.

215
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,600
Since when did you two get close?

216
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,727
[Mia] Hmm…

217
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,855
Maybe since
I ordered so much chicken <i>inasal.</i>

218
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,732
Mm.

219
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,194
Okay then. What did he tell you?

220
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,156
He told me that, as your best friend,

221
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,452
he just waits for you to open up

222
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,704
about how you feel.

223
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,458
He said that's the best way to help

224
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,627
and support you.

225
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,254
[chuckles softly]

226
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,131
And I think he's right.

227
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,382
[Mia chuckles softly]

228
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,968
- That best friend of yours--
- I'm tired.

229
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:32,765
[tender music playing]

230
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,975
I'm tired of taking care

231
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,562
and protecting the people around me

232
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,609
just because it's expected.

233
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,987
[tender music continues]

234
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,198
I don't want that kind
of responsibility anymore.

235
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,370
So from now on…

236
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,958
I'll protect them
because it's what I want.

237
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,462
Because I love them.

238
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,175
Am I one of those people you'll protect?

239
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:12,930
[tender music continues]

240
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,523
We already have a family picture,
don't we?

241
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,403
Mia, you're part of our family now.

242
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,656
[shakily] You…

243
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,075
Matmat,

244
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,160
and me?

245
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:41,834
[tender music continues]

246
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,377
- And Satsat.
- [Mia chuckles softly]

247
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,380
[sniffles] And Satsat, of course.

248
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,758
I'm definitely buying him a suit.

249
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,760
So he can join next time.

250
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:57,391
[tender music continues]

251
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,476
Taking that family photo

252
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,398
was the best decision
I've ever made in my life.

253
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:10,571
[tender music continues]

254
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,373

[tense music playing]

256
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,673
Hurry up, Pogi!

257
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,094
[Olivia] What?!

258
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,763
- Gemma, assist Doc Emman.
- What's going on?!

259
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,389
- Yes, ma'am.
- To the isolation room.

260
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,892
- My patient needs me!
- No!

261
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,810
Eden!

262
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,021
Let me do my job!

263
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,858
No! You do as I say, Olivia!

264
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:48,776
But…

265
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,446
I'm the nurse manager now, you know that.

266
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,199
And I'm removing Samuel
from under your monitoring.

267
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,159
- But--
- But what?!

268
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,287
But what, Olivia?

269
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,500
[tense music crescendos]

270
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:09,713
[unsettling music playing]

271
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,049
- [Zelda] <i>It's all from Ingrid.</i>
- [eerie music sting]

272
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,136
<i>She's alive, Patrick.</i>

273
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,764
<i>She's here, inside the hospital.</i>

274
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,268
[Patrick] <i>Most of the women</i>
<i>in the hospital are nurses.</i>

275
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,231
<i>But considering Ingrid's age,</i>

276
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,775
<i>she can't be one of the young nurses.</i>

277
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,153
[Olivia] Eden! Let me do my job!

278
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:38,492
[unsettling music continues]

279
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,953
[Olivia] You won, okay?
You're now the nurse manager.

280
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,372
I didn't question your promotion.

281
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,707
Are you really going
to take this away from me?

282
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,253
This position is
mine from the very start.

283
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,965
I worked harder than
you and anyone else here.

284
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,092
So you have no right to question me.

285
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,928
Whatever I have now, I deserve it.

286
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,139
Think whatever you want,

287
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,015
just return Samuel under my care.

288
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,392
I will do anything.

289
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,520
I'll even take extra shifts for free.

290
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,689
There isn't much time left for Samuel.

291
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,107
The way you're acting now

292
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,317
proves I made the right call

293
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,444
taking the patient out of your care.

294
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,573
Eden, just let me have this.

295
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,741
No.

296
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,911
Do your job,
just like the other nurses here.

297
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:27,166
[unsettling music continues]

298
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:39,928
[unsettling music intensifies]

299
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,521
[unsettling music crescendos]

300
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,025
There's more of that at home.
Vincent brought it.

301
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,319
- Thank you.
- Give yourself a break.

302
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,404
[relieved sigh]

303
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,532
Miss Li, how long
have you been working here?

304
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,577
I've been working
here for about ten years now.

305
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,578
[Patrick] Mm…

306
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,291
So, you've been here with
Ma'am Eden and Ma'am Olivia.

307
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,085
- Since they began working here?
- [Patrick] Mm-hmm.

308
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,295
Yeah.

309
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,464
Why do you ask?

310
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,301
I often notice them

311
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,472
fighting over who will
take care of Mister Samuel.

312
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,099
- I wonder why.
- [LI] Hmm…

313
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,061
Gemma and I once talked about that.

314
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,146
We're confused, too.

315
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,984
But isn't it true you can
dislike someone for no reason?

316
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,361
They might be like that.

317
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,238
Maybe they don't like each other.

318
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,866
Who among them started
working here at the hospital first?

319
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,246
When it comes to seniority,

320
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:51,166
Eden's been working
here for almost ten years.

321
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,086
Olivia's only been
here around three years.

322
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,170
She's new here.

323
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,713
[pensive music playing]

324
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,131
Are they locals?

325
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,260
[Li] Not as far as I know.

326
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:05,430
I think Olivia first
worked in different hospitals.

327
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,100
And Eden… Let me think.

328
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,185
I don't really know much about her.

329
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:15,023
[pensive music continues, fades]

330
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,527
So, you've been here this whole time.

331
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,945
- [Patrick sighs]
- [Li] Uh…

332
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,656
[Matmat] Hi, Miss Li.

333
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,908
[Li] Hello, Matmat. Hello, Mia.

334
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,285
Hello…

335
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,413
Miss Li.

336
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,915
- Here's your food!
- Thank you, Miss Li.

337
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,167
- Thank you, Miss Li.
- Thank you, Miss Li.

338
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:38,380
[utensils scraping, clinking]

339
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,557
[water sloshing]

340
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,975
So, Mia's here.

341
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,645
She's able to come in here,

342
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,481
but she can't find
time to visit her own father.

343
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,109
[sullen music playing]

344
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,945
I've always try to convince her, ma'am.

345
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,032
- [Matmat giggles]
- [Li chuckles]

346
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,451
Tell me who is Matmat's real sibling.

347
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,702
[Mia, Patrick chuckles]

348
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,037
Miss Li…

349
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,289
We are family.

350
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,791
Mm. But,

351
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:19,046
Matmat doesn't like an annoying sibling.

352
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,464
Don't be annoying.

353
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,924
She looks happy when she's with Patrick.

354
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,761
Are they close?

355
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,055
[sullen music continues]

356
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,057
[Gemma] I think so.

357
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,768
You think so?

358
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,228
You mean, they're together?

359
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,438
[Mia] I'm not annoying.

360
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,106
[Matmat, Patrick chuckling]

361
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,487
[music becomes uneasy]

362
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,289
[uneasy music fades]

363
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:55,999
[Mia] Hmm…

364
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,795
What if I put the family photo here?

365
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,839
Or probably over there?

366
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,676
It's still a family photo
no matter where you put it.

367
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,596
Actually, what if I have
this whole place renovated?

368
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,599
And a designer to do the rooms?

369
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,642
[gasps]

370
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,561
I can change it so
it matches both of our taste.

371
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,481
- Both? You mean, us?
- [Mia] Mm-hmm.

372
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,982
I'll share my room.

373
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,776
Mia, I don't like that idea.

374
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,070
Why? Because it's spacious?

375
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,780
[Patrick] Oh, Mia.
That's your parents' room.

376
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,491
Of course, I won't be comfortable.

377
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,786
[huffs] But this whole house
belonged to them.

378
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:36,289
Surely you remember them
wherever you look.

379
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,416
[Patrick] Hmm…

380
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,336
What if we move to a different house?

381
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,797
Will you come with Matmat and me?

382
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,967
Is it that time of the year again?

383
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,345
Is Matmat having nightmares again?

384
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:55,559
No. I'm just asking if
you want us to move to another house.

385
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,395
I don't mind where we live.

386
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:03,400
But you and Matmat don't have to leave.

387
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,862
Because I'll kill
those butterflies myself

388
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,613
before they can hurt Matmat.

389
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,532
[Patrick chuckles softly]

390
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,829
["Kathang Isip" instrumental playing]

391
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:17,956
Don't.

392
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:22,210
I might get scared if
you tear their wings off again.

393
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,545
[Mia chuckles]

394
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,464
If you run away from me again,

395
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,551
I really will follow you.

396
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,970
But fine.

397
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,474
I will never kill a butterfly, ever.

398
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,728
["Kathang Isip" instrumental continues]

399
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,104
[Mia] Promise.

400
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:47,235
Patrick, come on. Pinky promise.

401
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,323
[Mia chuckles softly]

402
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,409
- I think something's missing.
- [Patrick] Mm?

403
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,244
I think it needs a seal.

404
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,787
Seal?

405
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:03,084
["Kathang Isip" instrumental continues]

406
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,133
[Patrick] That's the new seal now, huh?

407
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,760
[Mia chuckling]

408
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,430
- [Mia, Patrick giggling softly]
- ["Kathang Isip" fades]

409
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,226
[Patrick giggles softly]

410
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,518
[Matmat] Mm.

411
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,023
Patpat is like,

412
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,025
a Saurolophus.

413
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:33,531
The Saurolophus dinosaur
always looks like it's smiling,

414
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,408
just like Patpat. [chuckles]

415
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:39,788
Why is Patpat smiling? Is it because…

416
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,417
he and Mia kissed.

417
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,046
- [Patrick] Mm.
- [giggles]

418
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,550
It's okay for Mia and Patpat to kiss,

419
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:58,223
as long as Mia and Patpat don't fight.

420
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,059
[gentle music playing]

421
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:05,772
Because a couple breaks
up when they fight each other.

422
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:11,653
We're not leaving Mia,

423
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:15,865
because she's family.

424
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:21,538
[gentle music continues]

425
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,123
Okay, Matmat.

426
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,208
Whatever happens,

427
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,211
we're not leaving Mia.

428
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,465
[Patrick] Mm?

429
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,093
No, we're not leaving her.

430
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,054
We'll stick together.

431

433
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,981
<i>I really want</i>

434
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,899
