Samuel choking Mia is more understandable

85
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,352
because of their relationship.

86
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,730
But doing that to another patient?

87
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,566
Clearly there is something wrong
happening under your care.

about being nurse-manager.

He didn't say earlier.

He just suddenly
approached me and choked me.

108
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:13,724
Maybe you said something,
even not related, that triggered Samuel

109
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,810
There was nothing like that, Nurse!

110

I was the one who got choked!

Mister Samuel mistook Zelda as his wife?

132

Maybe.

133
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,973
Zelda might know things about Samuel.

00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,626
I called Vincent while
I was busy in the kitchen.

182
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,962
See these plates of
barbecue and fried chicken?

183
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,798
I had him place an order so
we'd have plenty of food tonight.

184
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,092
[Li chuckles softly]

185
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,136
[Madeth giggles]

186
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,765
Miss Mia, that chocolate
cake really is the best.

187
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,434
It's the same color as--

188
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,560
Chocolate!

189
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,896
A chocolate cake with just
the right amount of sweetness.

190
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,731
[Madeth whimpers]

191
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,319
I'll take a slice to Matmat later.

192
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,821
It's his favorite.

193
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,905
[Li chuckles]

194
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,866
Thank you.

195
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,453
Don't mention it.

196
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:29,165
Birthdays are special to us mothers.

197
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,418
We were the first to celebrate

198
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,336
our child's arrival into the world.

199
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:39,049
[melancholic music playing]

200
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,468
[match striking]

201
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,761
Blow out your candle now, Miss Mia.

202
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,763
Then we can start eating.

203
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,307
There we go.

204
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:53,814
[melancholic music continues]

205
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,732
[huffs]

206
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,359
[cheering, clapping]

207
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,403
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

208
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,655
- [Vincent chuckling]
- [Madeth] Happy birthday, Miss Mia!

209
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,407
- [Li] Go on.
- [Madeth] Let's do this!

210
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,576
- [Li] Dig in.
- I've been waiting for this!

211
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,953
- [Li] Let's eat.
- [Jason] Excuse me.

212
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,664
- [Madeth] I'll use my hands, Ma'am Li.
- Sure thing.

213
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,583
Do you want anything else?

214
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,001
- Use your plate.
- [Thank you.

215
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:17,546
- [Jason] I'll take that barbecue.
- Go ahead.

216
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,593
[Vincent] Oops!

217
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,429
For my favorite writer.

218
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,893
It begins to lose
its value every time you say it.

219
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,858
[box lid clicks open]

220
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,822
- [clears throat]
- What can I say?

221
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,077
You have excellent taste.

222
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,038
[pensive music playing]

223
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,916
You know, Mia, after all
these years of working with you,

224
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,210
I can say I know you well.

225
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,963
And I know that even now,

226
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,423
you're still affected by what
happened with those siblings.

227
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,176
But wake up, Mia.

228
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,304
[sighs exasperatedly]
When will this obsession end?

229
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,932
Aren't you tired of all this?

230
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,518
[pensive music continues]

231
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,686
Why?

232
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,981
So I can go back to Manila?

233
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,317
So I can get you out of Maravida.

234
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,488
So your past,
and your parents, stops weighing on you.

235
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,117
Seriously.

236
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,411
[pensive music continues]

237
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,413
Mia, I'm worried about you.

238
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,836
That's the first time I enjoyed Montanesa.

239
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:53,851
[pensive music continues]

240
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,688
But he said…

241
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,900
it was all just a dream.

242
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,197
It's not that I agree with Patrick,

243
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,867
but he's right.

244
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,036
[pensive music continues]

245
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,706
You had a memorable
experience because it was temporary.

246
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,500
You said it yourself, Mia.

247
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,838
If the same thing keeps happening,
if you experience it every day,

248
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,465
it begins to lose its value.

249
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,844
[pensive music continues]

250
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,095
Look at you.

251
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,099
Speaking words of wisdom.

252
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,604
Don't tell me you're
thinking of becoming a writer.

253
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,565
We already talked about this.

254
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,567
You're my favorite writer--

255
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,778
- No, it's like you want my job.
- [pensive music fades]

256
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,075
Fine.

257
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,453
- I'll write the book.
- [exclaims]

258
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,622
Yes!

259
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,332
Now?

260
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,669
- Whoa, whoa. Where are you going?
- [playful music playing]

261
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,045
Wait, you're going
in the wrong direction--

262
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,463
It's my birthday.

263
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,382
Stay here.

264
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,843
- [playful music playing]
- [footsteps retreating]

265
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,720
Classic Mia.

266
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,722
[inhales deeply]

267
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:18,477
[playful music continues]

268
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,561
[wooden gate opens]

269
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,021
Matmat?

270
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,483
Matmat?

271
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,277
[Mia] My bestie?

272
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,446
[playful music continues]

273
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,739
N-No…

274
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,618
[stammering] Matmat
doesn't want to see Mia.

275
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,412
- Bestie?
- [Matmat] No…

276
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,205
I don't like Mia.

277
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,999
Matmat?

278
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,710
Come on, open the door.

279
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,088
[Mia] Let's talk about our book.

280
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,716
[Matmat] No!

281
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,136
- I-I don't want to!
- I know you're there, Matmat.

282
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,472
- Come on now.
- [knocking continues]

283
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,935
If you're not going to do it,
I'll force it open.

284
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,437
I've got an electric chainsaw.

285
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,232
I don't believe you!

286
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,028
Matmat, I'm serious.

287
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,531
I'm getting that chainsaw.
I'll be right back.

288
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,702
[footsteps thudding]

289
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:21,331
[playful music continues]

290
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,833
S-She's gone.

291
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,004
She left me alone.

292
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,135
[Mia] I'm serious!

293
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,344
[Matmat gasps]

294
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,929
- I'm here!
- No…

295
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:36,889
Don't!

296
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,641
- Please, no! D-Don't do it…
- [electric chainsaw whirring]

297
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,726
[Mia] Fine.

298
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,271
One, two…

299
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,356
- Three!
- No!

300
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,983
Mama Li will get mad.

301
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,777
[whirring audio over the phone]

302
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,113
[playful music continues]

303
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,907
I don't see any chainsaw.

304
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:56,909
[whirring stops]

305
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,624
I don't want to be
with that doll anymore.

306
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,417
Can it be you instead?

307
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,420
I'd rather be with you.

308
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,714
[playful music fades]

309
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,799
Liar.

310
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,635
No, I'm telling the truth!
The house feels empty.

311
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,387
It's just boring
without my bestie around.

312
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,098
You're my bestie, right?

313
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,475
- Matmat?
- Liar!

314
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,393
Matmat, I'm not lying.

315
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,272
You're a liar.

316
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,441
- You're a liar!
- Matmat, listen to--

317
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,527
No, I don't want to! You're a liar!

318
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,612
Matmat!

319
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,989
- Matmat--

- [whimpers]
- [somber music playing]

324
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,460
- They're always lying to me.
- [Mia] Matmat!

325
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,837
They say--

326
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,089
They say I'm their best friend,

327
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,966
but they keep secrets from me.

328
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,844
They kept the trip
with Patpat secret from me.

329
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,137
Matmat!

330
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,514
[Matmat] Liar!

331
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,225
Liars are mean people!

00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,070
I'm done with camping cars.

335
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,074
- Matmat--
- No more camping vans!

336
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,285
I don't like Mia anymore!

[Matmat] They call me bestie, but…

340
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,716
but they kept that trip
with Patpat a secret from me.

341
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:47,853
[somber music continues]

342
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,230
Matmat.

343
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,775
Do you know who the real mean ones are?

344
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,863
People who don't believe others.

345
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,284
[Mia] I guess you're
familiar with the story of…

346
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,245
"The Boy Who Cried Wolf"

[whimsical music playing]

348
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,958
[Mia] <i>There was a boy who kept crying</i>

349
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,419
<i>that a wolf was attacking all the sheep.</i>

350
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,382
<i>But when the neighbors rushed to help,</i>

351
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,801

- [glass thuds]

360
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,496
[Patrick exhales deeply]

361
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,748
Why don't you get some rest?

362
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,542
[somber music continues]

363
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,295
I'm okay, I promise.

364
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,422
[Gemma sighs]

365
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:58,966
[Patrick sighs]

366
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:05,806
[somber music continues]

367
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,899
[phone buzzes]

368
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,656
[phone chimes]

369
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,699
"FINE. FORGET ABOUT THE BIRTHDAY"

370
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,117
"BRING ME MEDICINE AND SOUP. I'M SICK."

371
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,244
"IT'S MY BIRTHDAY TODAY.
WHERE'S MY GREETING?"

372
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,038
[Mia] <i>He kept calling out to them.</i>

373
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,416
[somber music continues]

374
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,419
<i>Making up one lie after another.</i>

375
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,632
[Matmat] <i>I-I don't like that boy.</i>

376
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,134
<i>He's a liar.</i>

377
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,306
Did you know why he kept doing it?

378
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,391
[somber music continues]

379
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,767
Because,

380
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,811
it was fun?

381
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,230
He was bored?

382
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,859
[somber music continues]

383
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,027
No.

384
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,031
He kept repeating the same lies

385
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,574
because he was sad.

386
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,910
Because he didn't have any friends.

387
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:16,209
[somber music continues]

388
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,087
He was a lonely boy.

389
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,969
[somber music fades]

390
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:27,888
[Gemma] Pogi.

391
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,598
Pogi, seriously, wake up!

392
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,849
- Pogi!
- [exhales weakly]

393
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,977
Come on, Pogi!

394
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,312
Pogi, open your eyes!

395
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,230
Pogi!

396
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,273
Pogi?

397
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,233
[ominous music playing]

398
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,402
- Patrick!
- What happened?

399
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,946
I saw him like this,
and then I found this.

400
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,493
[ominous music continues]

401
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,625
[ominous music ends]

402
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,003
[Vincent] <i>Do not leave Mia alone.</i>
<i>It's her birthday tomorrow.</i>

403
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,088
<i>I don't like Mia anymore!</i>

404
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,255
<i>They're monsters!</i>

405
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,548
<i>Your daughter's not a monster.</i>

406
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,093
<i>He was sad because</i>
<i>he didn't have any friends.</i>

407
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:10,055
<i>You always make me feel like</i>
<i>I come second, Matmat is your priority.</i>

408
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,516
<i>I'm scared that if I give even a little,</i>

409
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,767
<i>I'll lose everything.</i>

410
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,685
<i>I don't want to lose everything.</i>

411
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,438
<i>Why does it seem so easy</i>
<i>for you to just forget everything?</i>

412
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,566
<i>Whenever you feel</i>
<i>yourself losing control, count to three.</i>

413
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,444
<i>One, two, three.</i>

414
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,115
<i>You'll pay for everything you did to me!</i>

415
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,326
<i>On the day of your birthday,</i>
<i>he has a surprise for you.</i>

416
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,410
<i>Your death.</i>

417
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,246
<i>The hell I care.</i>

418
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,455
<i>Are you with Mia?</i>

419
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,082
<i>No, she left a while ago.</i>

420
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:43,338
<i>If at least one person believed in him,</i>

421
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,006
<i>he wouldn't have died.</i>
