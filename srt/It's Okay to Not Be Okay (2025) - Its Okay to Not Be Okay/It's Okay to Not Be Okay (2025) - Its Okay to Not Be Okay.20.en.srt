1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,627
Gemma, you're kind

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,088
You deserve a love
that makes you complete and happy.

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,798
Is it because you like someone else?

4
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,175
I'm sorry, Gemma.

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,511
But we're still friends, right?

6
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,139
Are you stressed, Matmat?

7
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,433
- Would you like to have some fun instead?
- Wow!

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,811
Would you like to live here, Matmat?

9
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,146
[chuckles]

10
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,858
Matmat will live here with Miss Mia?

11
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,192
Here's a contract.

12
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,653
Aside from living here…

13
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,907
this is an agreement for you,

14
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:37,954
to be the illustrator of my next book.

15
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,372
[Doctor] Patrick, why are you still here?

16
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,875
I thought you left with Matmat.

17
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,043
- He left already?
- Yes, with Miss Mia.

18

Patrick.

21
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,237
- Is something wrong?
- Can I borrow your motorcycle?

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,114
Sure. Here's the key.

23
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,199
Wait. This feels like deja vu.
Give me that.

24
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,118
- Hey!
- I really need to go.

25
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,537
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to pick up Matmat.

26
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,915
- You better make sure it's him.
- Yeah.

27
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,958
Here.

28
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,669
- Thanks, bro.
- Alright.

29
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,170
- Drive safe.
- Yeah.

30
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,713
Wait. Where are you picking up Matmat?

31
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,048
Patrick.

32
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,883
Hey, fill the tank with gas.

Mat--Matmat doesn't drink,

38
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,700
but Matmat is drinking
at his and Miss Mia's house.

While we're waiting…

47
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,483
do you want to hear a story?

[sullen music continues, fades]

Is that…

50
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:26,497
Is that the story Miss Mia
that Matmat will draw--

51
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,457
No.

52
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,626

An old…

55
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,258
but familiar one.

56
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,515
Once upon a time…

57
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,396
deep in the heart of a dark forest…

[unsettling music playing]

59
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,696
[Mia] there lived a young girl…

60
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,076
in a cursed palace.

61
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,498
- Her mother never allowed her to leave.
- [engine approaching]

00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:13,419
[unsettling music continues]

63

[music turns dark whimsical]

64
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,509
The young girl's mother told her

65
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,972
she was far too special
to mingle with the outside world.

66
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:29,185
[dark whimsical music continues]

67
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:36,359
She had to stay inside the palace forever.

68
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,822
But the young girl…

69
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,659
felt like a prisoner.

70
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,621
So one night,
she prayed to the yellow moon.

71
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,457
"Please, I beg you.

72
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,462
Send me a prince
who will save me from this place."

73
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,215
Will he come today…

74
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,302
or tomorrow?

75
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,929
Every day,

76
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:09,350
the young girl
waited for her little prince.

[dark whimsical music continues]

78
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,905

[Mia] Leave. Don't ever come back here.

84
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,028
- But--
- I said leave!

85
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,572
And this is the last
time we will see each other.

- Matmat?
- [melancholic music fades]

Matmat, wake up. It's time to go home.

You took too long.

99
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,746
I've been waiting for you.

100
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,043
You shouldn't have used
Matmat just because you're mad at me.

101
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,545
I told you…

102
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,756
I was waiting for you.

103
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,509
Don't ever do that again, okay?

104
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,677
Do you honestly have no feelings for me?

[crickets chirping]

106
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,186
You didn't answer my question.

107

Do you honestly have no feelings for me?

108
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,154
I saved your life, remember?

109
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,949
You owe me.

110
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,284
So you should take care of me, too.

111
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,998
Thank you, Mia.

112
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,502
But this is as far as I can go.

113
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,839
The truth is, you shouldn't have--

114
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,007
I shouldn't have what?

115
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,386
That I shouldn't have saved you that day?

116
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,472
So you wouldn't have
to live the life you have now?

I offered him a job.

And he accepted.

158
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,622
Matmat, why would you accept a job
without talking to me first?

159
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,999
Don't you already have one?

car in exchange for the drawing.

366
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:57,782
A camping car for Matmat and Patpat.

367
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:02,329
[tender music continues]

368
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,250
We can live in it.

369
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,212
A… A car with a bed.

370
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,758
And… and a bathroom and a stove.

371
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,927
We can live in it when…

372
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:23,475
when the butterfly comes.

373
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,185
[tender music continues]

374
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,394
Matmat.

375
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,980
Wherever we go,

376
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,109
I won't need anything else.

377
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:36,696
[tender music continues]

378
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,989
Just you.

379
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,825
Because…

380
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,913
its only Matmat and Patpat

381
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,836
[sniffles]

382
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,716
- [sobbing]
- [tender music continues]

383
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,265
[sniffling]

384
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,033
[tender music fades]

385
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,118
[groans sleepily]

386
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,126
Matmat will live here.

387
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,670
You won't finish anything here.
Just pure distractions!

388
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,965
My safety pin will be taking care of me.

389
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,346
I know what's good and not for her.

390
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,015
You said you're
going to stay away from Mia.

391
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,727
The three of us will
stay here at my house.

392
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,734
Mama worked here before.

393
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,319
If I were you, I'd leave this place.

394
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,237
Why?

395
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,864
Because she's going to come back.

396
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,700
There's something missing.
Butterflies perch on flowers.

397
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,617
I don't like butterflies.

398
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,996
You'll follow everything that I say.

399
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,582
Leave me alone!

400
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,375
Did you come back for me?

401
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,627
Mama?
