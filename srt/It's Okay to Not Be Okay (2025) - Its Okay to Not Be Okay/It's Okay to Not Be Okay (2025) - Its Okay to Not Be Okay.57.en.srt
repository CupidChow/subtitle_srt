00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,164
- [monitor beeping]
- [door opens]

367
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,250
[door closes]

368
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:31,715
- [monitor beeping]
- [unsettling music playing]

369
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,970
Do you know where you are?

370
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,935
[exhales heavily]

371
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,273
You are at my house.

372
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:54,529
[unsettling music continues]

373
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,205
<i>Sir Samuel is missing.</i>

374
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,624
<i>Thank God.</i>
<i>I don't care about him.</i>

375
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,877
<i>It's like they know every loophole here.</i>

376
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,045
[Anok] <i>What did you do, Olivia?</i>

377
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,421
<i>How did it come to this?</i>

378
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,840
<i>I'll be the last person you ever see.</i>

379
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,718
<i>That is none of your business.</i>

380
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,053
<i>What if she comes back?</i>

381
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,304
<i>What if she is your mother?</i>

382
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,722
[Olivia]<i> I cannot leave you.</i>

383
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,932
<i>Because what's inside you,</i>
<i>and what's inside me</i>

384
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,226
<i>are bound together, forever.</i>
