Let's have some snacks.
Then you can also join us for dinner.

00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,589
I invited Gemma too,

00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,300
but she couldn't leave work

4
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,011
because Sir Samuel
suddenly had an outburst.

5
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,805
He strangled his daughter.

- Yes.
- No.

Why? What's wrong with that?

Fine. Minimalist.

Did you tell him not to come home?

Look at their faces.

Mia, everyone has emotions,
not just people with autism.

We should know how
to express our feelings.

Are you sure everyone has emotions?

00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,327
How about the demon kid?

59
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,996
You truly believe
the demon kid didn't have feelings?

60
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,333
Didn't he tell his mother
that her hug felt nice

61
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,043
because that's what he'd been starved of?

62

He needed care.

But it wasn't food.

Mia, let's go.

189
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,469
To sleep?

190
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,100
We'll go to the neighbors and
find someone who can take you home.

191
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,602
Who says I'm going home?

192
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,604

- So?

[comical music playing]

194
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,483
I can't take you home.
I have to look after Matmat.

195
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,860
- No, I'm not leaving.
- Mia, stop being stubborn.

196
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,070
- Let's go.
- No!

197
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,613
This is ungentlemanly of you.

198
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,949
You'll kick a girl out at this hour?

199
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,617
We'll find someone to take you home.

200
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,868
- No.
- [Jason] Bro!

201
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,913
- Let's have some drinks!
- [comical music continues]

If you kick me out,

203
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,917
- I'll look for Matmat.
- Shh! Be quiet!

205
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,087
[Jason] Bro, come on! Let's drink!

206
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,922
Fine, you can stay.

207
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,131
Just be quiet.

208
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,008
Shh.

209
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,468

00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,392
[Jason] There you are.

213
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,977
- Bro.
- Look what I brought.

214
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,396
- Let's drink.
- No, I'm good.

215
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,148
I'm busy with something.

216
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,358
Hmm…

217
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,068
You know what, bro?

218
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:25,030
You cannot fool me. I know you too well.

219
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,700
I know when you need company,

220
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,827
- so let's drink! Let's go.
- No need!

221
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,620

[fingers snap] …our water pipe broke,

223
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,126
so… our place is flooded.

224
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,378
I need to fix it.

225
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,256
- Then I'll help you.
- No, it's okay.

226
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,425
- I can help you.
- No, just look after Matmat.

227
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,926
I'll leave him to you, okay?

228
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,304
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I can manage.

229
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,931
- You sure you don't need help?
- No, it's okay.

230
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,267
Okay, once you're done cleaning,

231
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,102
knock on my room
and we'll have this together.

232
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,605
I won't touch this yet. Or this.

233
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,649
- Okay? Got it?
- Mm-hmm.

234
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,860
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, it's okay.

[comical music continues]

236
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,072
- I have--
- Just go and watch Matmat.

237
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,198
Alright, I'm leaving.

238
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,284

Who is it?

245
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,553
[Patrick] Mia.

246
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,390
Are you going to let me sleep here…

247
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,729
or I'll look for Matmat?

248
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,522
[Patrick sighs]

249
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,652
Mia, open the door.

[Patrick] Mia.

252
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,005
I've talked to Patrick earlier.

253
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,466
You'll be sleeping in my room for now.

254
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,983
Patpat doesn't want…

255
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,403
to sleep with Matmat?

256
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,286
I don't think so.

257
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,958
Maybe Patrick just wants
to rest because he's stressed from work.

258
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,459
Y-Yeah.

259
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,628
It's very stressful to get slapped.

260
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,255
Even I would get stressed.

[pensive music playing]

262
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:56,765
So, Patpat wasn't
lying about getting slapped?

263
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,143
Uh…

264
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,188
Yeah, it's true he got slapped, but…

265
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,065
he'll be okay.

266
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,233
Right, Jason?

267
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,278
Yeah, Matmat. He'll be okay.

[pensive music continues]

269
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:21,665
If Patpat wants Matmat to be here…

270
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,335
it's okay.

Please look after Matmat, okay?

274
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,184
I guess I'm going
to have a good night tonight.

275
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,604
Mia, I told you we're not
sleeping besides each other.

276
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:48,400
That's why there's a pillow. Technically,
we're not sleeping besides each other.

- Come on.

Can't you just pretend
you like me for tonight?

Am I right?

283
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,724
You're good at pretending to be okay?

284
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,312
At pretending that everything's okay?

285
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,608
And that you're not hurt?

["Kathang Isip" instrumental continues]

287
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,299
It's because of Matmat.

288
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,639
I don't want him to worry.

Jason!

294
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,329
What did Patpat say?

295
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,290
[groans] Huh?

296
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,499
What?

297
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,960
What did Patpat say?

298
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:35,465
Matmat, he said your water pipe broke,

299
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,761
so your place is flooded.

300
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,514
Okay? Got it?

301
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,184
Good? Good night.

302
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,438
Please stop waking me up to ask that.

303
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:56,778
The water pipe broke, so it's flooded.

304
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,450
It's flooded because the water pipe broke.

305
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,371
Have things always been
like this ever since you were kids?

306
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,585
I can't remember anymore.

time I put my feelings first.

313

It had nothing to do with Matmat.

You heard what happened to me earlier.

315
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,289
You felt bad.

316
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,543
You feel for me.

- Passed by?
- Yes.

Didn't you hear about it?

hears someone walking

[footsteps approaching]

364
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,355
[beeping continues]

365
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:09,990
- [music turns ominous]
- [footsteps approaching]

366
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,242
[machine beeping]

367
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:19,791
- [eerie tone playing]
- [machine beeping]

368
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:28,008
[grunting, gasping]

369
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,473
- Mm.
- [Samuel grunts]

370
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,268
So noisy.

371
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,563
What… Samuel!

372
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,981
Samuel!

373
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,524
- [Samuel grunting]
- Samuel, what's wrong?

374
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,818
Sam-Samuel?

375
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,361
- K-Kai! Kai!
- What?

376
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,155
Kai, wake up. Call a nurse!

377
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,990
- [Samuel grunting]
- Samuel?

378
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,575
- Kai?
- [Kai] What happened?

379
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,826
Samuel!

380
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,995
- Call a nurse!
- Nurse! Nurse!

381
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,955
- What's going on, Samuel? Samuel!
- [dramatic music playing]

382
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,416
- [Samuel grunting]
- S-Samuel!

383
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,293
Samuel, what's happening?

384
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,794
Nurse!

385
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,339
- Samuel! Samuel!
- [dramatic music crescendos]

386
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,007
Mia is at risk,

387
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,634
especially if you're close to her.

388
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,928
Maybe someone needs to always remind me.

389
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,471
I'm getting forgetful.

390
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,349
Why are you here?

391
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,934
I already gave you what you want.

392
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,769
[Gemma] Are you done with your illusions?

393
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,812
Are you done hoping? He's mine.

394
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,232
[slaps] That's called obsession!

395
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,360
You didn't tell me that Miss Mia was here.

396
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,445
The way you treat me is driving me crazy.

397
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:34,699
You can't tell me what to do or where
I should live because you don't own me.
