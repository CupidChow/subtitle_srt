00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,693
I can't carry you if you get wasted.

186
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,989
I didn't say I was going to drink alcohol.

187
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,408
I just wanted coffee.

188
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,993
Coffee?

189
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:47,748
Yeah, right.
You look like you want a drink.

190
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,625
The look in your face says,

191
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,796
"Can I get a bucket of beer
and appetizers please?" To table 1

192
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,968
Have you ever been in love?

193
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,679
[inhales deeply]

194
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,098
Yes, I've been in love.

195
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,979
But unrequited love?

196
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,106
Not yet.

197
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,650
I'm not that stupid.

198
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,698
I'll be frank with you.

199
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:25,202
Patrick is so kind,
he's basically a saint.

200
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:29,165
He only needs
the Pope's blessing at this point.

201
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,544
But girl…

202
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,755
You're on an losing streak.

203
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,217
Not just today, but every day.

204
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,014
- So you know?
- That you like Patrick?

205
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,182
Yeah!

206
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,267
It's so obvious, sis!

207
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,897
[Gemma sighs]

208
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,276
You know, people like you…

209
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:05,618
you are wasting
your love on the wrong person.

210
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,871
It's not a waste if you're helping them.

211
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,165
Why?

212
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:17,463
Do you think helping him
will change his feelings for you?

213
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:18,631
Yeah!

214
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:25,429
If I could give him
what he's been looking for,

215
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,973
maybe then I'd have a chance.

216
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,185
[Madeth] Oh, dear…

217

[melancholic music playing]

218
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:39,652
Sis. You and I, especially you…

219
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,031
We deserve the
kind of love only you can give.

220
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:51,413
That's why I'd rather
choose someone who loves me

221
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,040
than someone I love.

222
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,417
Isn't that unfair?

223
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:57,962
No.

224
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,800
You'll learn to love them.

225
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:09,640
At least there's the
reassurance that the love you give

226
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,935
will be reciprocated.

227
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,730
[melancholic music continues]

228
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:21,527
But if you ask me,

229
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:28,534
I think the guy for you is loving, kind,

230
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:35,374
strong, and oozing with charisma.

231
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:40,087
He can make you smile
even if he doesn't have a mustache.

232
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,841
I feel that's the man for you!

233
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,801
I feel it in my bones.

234
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,763
I can even sense that…

235
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,976
Good job, Madeth!
I can't believe you're on my side.

236

00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,347
Why did he do that

240
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,474
if he wasn't going to go through with it?

[exasperated sigh]

242
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,524
But it wasn't his fault.

243
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,902
It was the goat's.

Yes.

I need to talk to Matmat.

Well, call him.

Now.

Mia, it's not that easy.

267
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,481
I have to remind him
about his sessions with Doc Anok.

Are you done packing?

I'll get ready.

Because tomorrow,

273
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,459
we'll finally be able to…

- [playful music playing]

275

285

Hmm, if you felt bad for him,
you wouldn't have suspended him.

286
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,884
I can't.

287
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,427
I can't do that.

288
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,721
You have to follow
the rules in the handbook.

[stammers] You're right, Doc Anok.

290

If you do something wrong,
you should be punished.

[Anok] Mm-hmm.

292
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:30,484
But, you know,
I understand what Patrick did.

- Yeah. Back when I was younger,

- he courted me.
- [laughing]

Why, why did you break Doc Anok's heart?

307
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,029
- Why did you?
- Hmm…

308
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,239
First of all, I don't like you.

309
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,450
Hmm, that's not what
you told me back in the day.

310
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,536
You told me your parents were strict.

311
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,454
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

312
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,665
I just didn't like you before.

Oh, you didn't like me before?

314
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,336
So you like me now? Ohh!

- Uh…

316
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,507

I don't want to leave yet.

That's enough, Bella!

And yet, you let it happen?

Sir, Bella consented…

330
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,587
We'll continue your treatment in the U.S.

331
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,298
Pa. Don't do this, Pa.

332

My daughter is not safe here.

336

You can't just do that.

337
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,063
Why? Who are you, huh?!

338
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,357
He's the medical director here.

339
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,194
- You can only do that if--
- If what?!

340
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,112
Huh?!

your remaining balance at the hospital.

- The cashier is over there.

Bella,

347
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,963
I'll pray for your continued recovery.

348
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,385

352
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,731
Do you really think,

353
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,110
it's okay to discharge Bella?

354
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:19,945
No.

355
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,614
Emman hasn't gotten
a chance to assist her yet.

356
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,410
You shouldn't have approved her release.

The decision falls on the patient
and their family if they want to go.

No matter what advice we give,
if they want to go home,

360
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,087
there's nothing we can do about it.

361
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,131

- Let's just hope…

362

["Being With You" by
Angeline Quinto playing]

365
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,144
[Kai] Bella?!

366
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,729
- [muffled] Bella!
- Shh.

367
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,647
- [muffled screaming]
- Kai, Kai!

368
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,609
Kai, if you try to force it,
you might not see Bella again.

369
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,862
Even if you get discharged. Okay?

370
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,530
- [sobs]
- Okay?

371
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,115
Bella's leaving me.

372
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,909
Calm down, calm down.
You have to keep your relationship quiet.

373
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,661
You're going to be punished!

374
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,122
Don't worry. I've read the future.

375
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,167
You'll see her again.
Someone will help you, soon.

376
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,921
["Being With You" continues]

377
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,300
What can you see?
Will her Papa bring her back?

378
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,969
She has a different aura.

379
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,390
She'll reveal herself very soon!

380
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,185
[car engine starting]

381
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:39,316
["Being With You" continues]

382
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,912
[song fades]

383
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,747
- This is mine.
- That's mine!

384
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,208
Matmat, stop it! Let go!

385
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,251
I told you to stop it!

386
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,005
That's the last thing
you can take from Matmat.

387
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,633
He can't control
himself when he's around me.

388
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,551
Come on, let's go.

389
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,095
I'm going to make Patrick happy.

390
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,431
The kind of
happiness that he won't forget.

391
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:15,560
You can have Satsat.
But Patpat stays with Matmat.

392
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,938
I'll find out what you're hiding.

393
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,481
Do you remember me?

394
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,399
Die!

395
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,317
Protect Mia.

396
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,236
- Protect her from what?
- Where's Mia?

397
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,367
I realized that I couldn't do this
if Matmat was here.

398
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,410
I'm sure he'll try to stop me.

399
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,621
I love that this was spontaneous

400
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,832
because I get to see the fun side of you.

401
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,959
You're cute when you smile.

402
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,087
I'm happy to have the people in my life.

403
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,131
I have a new bestie.

404
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,466
I have you.

405
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,176
You'd rather be with Miss Mia!

406
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,053
You don't want to be with Matmat!

407
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,596
Argh! I hate you!

408
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,765
I hate you! You want me to go away!

409
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,851
You want me to die!
