It all depends on,

when they were born.

123
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,229

Hmm. I see.

There's ginger.

It's good for your immune system.

This <i>caldereta's </i>just the right spice,

Don't like <i>malunggay?</i>
You've got bitter ground.

You need vegetables.

If you don't want meat,
there's fish here.

00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,095
I'm sorry for troubling you.

155
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,432
You don't need to worry about me too.

156
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,435
Honestly, I'm thinking…

157
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,482
maybe I should've just thrown you out.

158
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,193
What?

[gentle music playing]

160
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,865
My daughter hasn't admitted her feelings,
and you already rejected her.

161
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,825
If I were some other mother,

162
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,578
you'd probably be getting
yelled at and cursed right now.

163
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,331
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,208
[gentle music continues]

165
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,377
But I'm not that kind of mother.

166
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,214
My conscience wouldn't let me do that.

167
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:12,385
And I can't stand seeing
people around me go hungry.

[gentle music continues]

169
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,974
Thank you.

170

And again, I'm really sorry.

171
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,644
I'll accept your apology

172
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,063
once you eat and regain your strength.

173
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,442
If it's okay with you,
I'll take Matmat home

174
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,903
so you can focus on yourself.

175
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:35,116
Then when you're
feeling okay, you two can talk.

176
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,329
Why are you being so kind to us?

177

[gentle music continues]

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,502
Whatever you went through before,

And from what I see,

181
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,845
you're such a good kid, Patrick.

182
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,223
Because of that kindness,

183
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,060
I'd be glad to have
you as a son in my next life.

184
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,856

I just have client calls today.

193

Oh, so you're just sitting around all day.

194
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,315
Yes!

195
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,193

196
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,738
Plus, I am guiding my publishing staff.

197
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,574
And we're also
preparing for her birthday.

198
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,243
Her birthday?

199
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,079
Yes, tomorrow.

200
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,499
I need it to be special,
for my favorite writer in the world.

Nothing.

Can you wait?

210
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:31,315
I had so many customers,
so I haven't packed it yet.

211
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,151

can help out while I sort it?

I already prepared them earlier.

you'd be bringing a young man!

Auntie, don't be too loud.

222
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,012
I'll report back to her

Why not call her "Mama Joy"?

- "Mama Joy"?
- [tender music playing]

244
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,482
Why "Mama Joy"?

No reason. I just thought of it.

seemed neutral, so I'm not sure.

She's definitely concerned!

286
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,825

you don't care, right?

[quirky music ends]

369
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,603

372
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,365
[Mia] Aah!

373
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,368
Why are you here?

374
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,786
I'm sorry, ma'am.

375
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,330
Someone's looking for you.

Patrick asked me to get their things.

380
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,391
So what are you?

381
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,352
His new assistant or something?

382
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,230
Say whatever you want.

383
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,023
I just need to get their stuff.

Why are you still here?

387
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,040
I didn't get to work this morning, ma'am.

388
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,168
I came tonight to check on some things.

389
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,378
Leave.

<i>Let's wait for her time to come.</i>

395
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,370
<i>That's it?</i>

396
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,081
<i>I'm sorry for what I did.</i>
<i>Please don't avoid me.</i>

397
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,752

<i>about wanting you dead.</i>

398
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,003
<i>You're pissing me off.</i>

399
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,379
<i>You're cute when you're mad.</i>

400
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,590
<i>Why does Patrick like you?</i>

401
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,383
<i>It's just us two.</i>

402
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,302
