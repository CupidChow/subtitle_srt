Universe!
I want a love life, but I'm picky.

182
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,856
- I have standards!
- Hmm!

183
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,316
- Ouch!
- Just go to the other side.

184
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,400
Whatever!

[quirky music continues]

00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,405
Hey, universe!

187
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,908
You love romcoms too much.

188
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,993
I'm not amused anymore!

[waves lapping distantly]

191
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,209
[Mia] Good thing I stepped on
those flowers you gave me.

192
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,754
You really wanted to ruin them?

193
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,467
If you hadn't pushed me away,
we could've been friends a long time ago.

194
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,302
If I hadn't rejected you,

195
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,013
I wouldn't have what I have today.

196
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,265
And what's that?

197
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,393
This.

198
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,562
This moment.

199
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,231
This view.

200
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,067
Our kiss.

201
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,987
What we're sharing now.

204
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,621
Hmm. If we'd gotten closer back then,

205
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,791
I wonder how things would be now?

206
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,086
Maybe we'd still be close.

207
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:45,676
Or maybe not. We might've realized
we don't even get along.

208
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,053
Or you and Matmat wouldn't get along.

209
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,056
Hey! I told you, Matmat's my bestie.

210
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,311
Maybe…

211
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,065
Mama would still be alive.

[somber music playing]

213
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,154
What do you mean?

214
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,993
If I hadn't followed
you that night you snuck out…

215
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,663
I would've gone home with her.

216
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:22,296
<i>Go ahead, Ma. I'll catch up.</i>

217
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,091
<i>Okay, but don't take too long.</i>

218
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,093
[Matmat] <i>Follow right after, Patpat.</i>

219
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,220
<i>Patpat, will follow us.</i>

220
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,934
<i>Mia…</i>

221
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,396
Maybe I could've protected her…

222
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,066
from the person who killed her.

00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,860
[somber music continues]

224
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,945
Do you--

225
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,238
Do you blame me?

226
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,286
That's why I didn't want to see you.

227
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,416
Even though Matmat love your books.

228
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,337
[Mia] <i>Do you know who I am?</i>

229
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,215
[Patrick] <i>Mia Hernandez.</i>

230
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,009
<i>Author of children's book.</i>

231
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,594
<i>And you are?</i>

232
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,181
[somber music continues]

233
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,767
[Mia] <i>I'll see you soon.</i>

234
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,519
[Patrick] <i>Thank you.</i>

235
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,854
<i>But this is the last time we'll meet.</i>

236
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,025
- [Matmat] <i>I am not leaving!</i>
<i>- I told you, you're not working for her!</i>

237
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,360
[Matmat whimpers]

238
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,407
- [Matmat whimpers]
<i>- We'll find another job!</i>

239
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,870
I didn't want any connection with you.

240
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,002
Because you reminded me of that night.

241
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,839
It's not my fault.

242
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,633
Mia! Mia, I know.

243
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,052
I shouldn't have thought that way.

244
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,139
I was wrong. I failed.

245
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,182
But it wasn't your fault either.

246
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,769
You had no idea your mother
would run into her killer that night.

247
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,313
You had no idea what was about to happen.

248
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,191
And even if you were with them,

249
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,861
you were just a kid, Patrick.

250
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,030
Do you really think
you could've saved her?

251
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,740
I don't know.

252
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,658
If I couldn't save them,

253
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,702
I could at least pointed
out who the killer was.

254
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,204
<i>Who was the person that killed Mama?!</i>

255
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,956
<i>Try to remember!</i>

256
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,250
<i>We're wasting</i>

257
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,963
<i>- Matmat!</i>
- [Matmat screaming]

258
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,382
Matmat wouldn't have been traumatized.

259
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,426
I would've gotten justice for Mama.

260
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,428
[frustrated sigh]

261
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,305
Patrick.

262
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,099
You were just a little boy.

263
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,937
[somber music continues]

264
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,398
It's unfair that you
are carrying this burden.

265
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,358
Ugh, I hate this killer!

266
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,568
You're getting angry for me again.

267
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,153
Because this person ruined your life!

268
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,696
But now, I'm with you.

269
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,698
And I think that will change things.

270
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,076
Not because I'm enjoying
my time or because I feel relaxed,

271
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:02,581
but because you told me
to not burden myself with regret.

[music turns tender]

273
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,381
And I will remain
to be that person in your life.

If you're my safety pin…

275
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,015
I will be they key to break
away all the chains holding you back.

- Tell me the truth.
- [tender music fades]

280
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,919
What is Kai planning to do?

281
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:54,550
Something bad might
happen to them while he's outside.

282
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,926
[Cynthia] Doc!

283
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,596
I can sense that nothing
bad is happening to him right now.

284
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,933
I don't see any dark omens.

285
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,020
Cynthia.

286
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,482
I can understand
why you're feeling like that.

287
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:14,194
And Doc just wants some reassurance.

288
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,655
So, just tell us what you know.

289
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,782
All I know is…

290
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,660
Kai really misses Bella.

291
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,288
Nurse…

292
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:30,919
Kai just looked, sad inside his room.

293
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,507
I think he's developed
some kind of depression.

294
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,426
Mister Tommy.

295
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:42,014
If he does have depression,
we'll be the ones to help him.

296
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,017
Letting him escape is not the solution.

297
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,522
You haven't answered my question.

298
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,774
What is Kai planning to do?

299
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,987
Uh, hmm.

300
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,491
H-He'll go meet up with Bella, and

301
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,620
they're going to elope.

302
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:07,956
[Cynthia] Doc!

303
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:13,128
I can really sense
that nothing bad is happening to him.

304
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,548
Do you know where Kai and Bella are?

305
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,426
No.

306
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,595
But,

307
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,639
Cynthia's right.

308
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,642
I don't think anything bad has
happened to Kai or Bella because…

309
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,812
we made sure to tell him
that if they got into a problem,

310
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:37,903
they should call one of
the nurses at the reception.

311
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,906
Check with the other staff
if Kai has called.

312
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,577
Alright, you may go.

313
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,040
- Tommy.
- Hmm?

314
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,708
No extra snacks for you.

Let me call Kai and
Bella so they can get ready.

00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,967
Then, let's head back to Maravida.

326

Alright.

Kai?

- Kai?
- [staff] Sir?

Are you with those two lovebirds?

- Yes.
- Can you give them their towel?

331
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,401
They left it inside their room.

332
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,111
They might've just gone out.

333

Oh sir, their clothes are already gone.

334
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,325
I saw them leave early this morning.

00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,785
