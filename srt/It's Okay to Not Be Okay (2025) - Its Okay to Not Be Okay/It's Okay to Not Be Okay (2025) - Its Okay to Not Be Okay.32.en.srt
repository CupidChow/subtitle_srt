- Give it!
- This is mine!

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:06,548
- He's mine!
- Matmat, I said let go!

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,134
You're mean, Miss Mia!

[Mia, Matmat grunting]

00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:14,639
Matmat! Mia!

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,058
Give me that.

7
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,312
She already took Satsat.
What happens if…

8
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,648
What if she also
takes the other things I have?

9
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,734
Mia's not going to take everything.

10
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,611
Are you sure of that, Patpat?

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,906
Me. She can take everything but me.

12
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:37,120
She… She can have Satsat.

Time! Time! Where are you?

19
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,273
I'm on my way. Wait.

20
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,359
I'm almost there. I'm here!

[exasperated laugh] Mama Li,
what did I ever do to you?!

25
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,495
Why did you put this jerk in my room?!

26
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,997
[loud snoring continues]

27
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,082
Be right back.

[quirky music playing]

29
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,798
You're such a pain!

30
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,424
You ruined my game!

Oh, Vincent!

39
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,158
Smile!

- [snoring]
- [laughing]

41
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:47,917
That's what you get for being so annoying.

42
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,043
Serves you right!

[Ingrid] Mia, dear.

49
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,973
You are very special,

50
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,642
because you,

51
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,936
are my creation.

52
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,480
I made you.

53
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,274
My other self.

54
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,401
[Mia] No.

55
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,987
You don't have control over me.

You want to be assigned to monitor Samuel?

Wait.

61
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,635
Doc?

62
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,720
A rotation?

63
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,931
Oh, not a rotation.

64
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,768
Olivia just requested
to be in charge of Samuel.

65
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,146
Well, can we talk about this first?

[tense music playing]

67
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,566
Sure thing.

68
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,861
Just let me know your decision.

69
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,613
I'll leave you two to talk.

[tense music continues]

71
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,868
Olivia.

72
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,998
Is this your way of
sneaking in to become manager?

73
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,292
You're trying to impress Doc Anok?

74
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,795
I don't have time for this.

75
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,214
I have a lot of patients to take care of.

76
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,966
That's precisely my point!

77
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,052
You have enough patients,
and you're stealing mine?

78
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,307
- Oliv--
- [nurse] Good morning, Ma'am Eden.

79
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,269

[Li] Oh!

82
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,237
You're looking sharp!

83
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,781
Really, Mama Li?
You think the clean-cut look suits me?

84
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,410
Yes! What finally
made you ditch the stache?

85
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,580
Nothing much.

86
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,958
I just woke up feeling like shaving.

87
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,086
- [Li] Hmm!
- Looks like it backfired.

88
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,048
It took years off your face!
You look way younger!

89
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,424
- [Vincent] Really?
- [Li] Yes!

90
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,884
[Vincent] As young as Gemma?

91
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,761
- [Li chuckles]
- [plate thuds loudly]

92
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:48,931
Jason, don't be so loud.
Get that bad energy off the table.

93
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,266
- Yeah.
- Anyway…

94
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,060
Maybe not as young as Gemma.

95
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,644
My daughter's got a baby face.

96
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,813
Of course. Just like you!

97
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,814
She got it from you.

98
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,608
- Aww! [giggles]
- You also have a baby face.

99
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,694
[Vincent] Seriously, Mama Li. Thank you.

100
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:06,699
Because you really do
make me feel, handsome.

101
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,867
[laughs mockingly]

102
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,368
- You wish.
- [utensils clatter]

103
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:13,623
Hey, didn't I just
tell you not to be so loud?

104
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,375
Right, Jason. Didn't you hear Mama Li?

105
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,169
[sarcastic laugh] Sorry, Mama Li.

106
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,172
I'm just making sure we're all awake.
Seems like someone's still dreaming.

107
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:24,175
Oh, it's the two
ladies you should wake up.

108
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,384
I'll do it, Mama Li!

109
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,095
So when Gemma opens her eyes--

110
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,680
She'll definitely throw a fit.

111
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,766
- Good morning!
- [Li] Good morning!

112
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,143
- Here's the duo who'll ruin my love life.
- [quirky music playing]

113
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,687
Mama Li, are you sure

114
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,565
you want Gemma be
roommates with Madeth?

115
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,692
What, like you're better?

116
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,904
Yeah, boss.
It's been decided. I'm her roommate now.

117
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,989
Gemma and I already talked.

118
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,284
I told her to just
think like she gained a sister.

119
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,078
[Jason] That's perfect, Mama Li.

120
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,539
- Vincent can be my love's uncle!
- [quirky music continues]

121
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,041
- Hey! I can't be her uncle.
- [Jason laughing]

122
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,751
I'm too young to be one.

123
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,877
Fine.

124
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,548
And since I'm already
an honorary family member,

125
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,174
I'll wake Gemma up.

126
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,676
- Bye!
- Madeth!

127
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,178
Hey, chill out, Uncle. Watch your heart.

128
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,555
Take it easy.

129

Let's eat.

132
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,911
Matmat.

133
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,246
Sit down.

134
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:49,051
- [cutler clanking]
- [birds chirping]

135
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,472
How was your sleep?

136
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,603
Probably the best I've ever had.

137
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,234
Matmat…

138
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,319
[spoon clanks]

139
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,701
There's something
you want to tell Mia, right?

140
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,496
Hmm…

141
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,207
M-Miss Mia…

142
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,629
I'm sorry about last night.

143
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,965
Because…

144
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:35,223
I hit you with
a pillow and pulled your hair.

145
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,314
Mia…

146
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,368
I'm sorry, too.

147
00:08:56,577 --> 00:09:03,626
[light-hearted music playing]

148
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,467
Because I also hurt you.

149
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,639
There.

150
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,809
Now, we can start our day happy.

151
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,102
Happy day, Matmat?

152
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,105
Matmat didn't get hurt.

153
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:27,817
But Satsat got hurt
because his head got ripped off.

154
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,111
Matmat.

155
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,739
It's okay, Miss Mia.

156
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,493
You can keep Satsat.

157
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:42,707
[light-hearted music continues]

158
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,962
But that's the last thing
you can take from Matmat.

159
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:51,924
Okay?

160
00:09:53,634 --> 00:10:00,266
[light-hearted music continues]

161
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,690
Okay?

[exhales sharply]

163
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,445
Okay.

164
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,657
Okay.

165
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,036
[light-hearted music continues]

166
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,037
Let's eat.

167
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,291
Rice.

168
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,837
[light-hearted music fades]

- [spoon clinking]
- I made sunny-side-up

171
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,970
and scrambled eggs. It's up to you.
You can eat whichever you like.

172
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,974
My pretty love, first
have some coffee to warm yourself up.

173
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,185
I can manage. Thank you.

174
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,190
[Madeth] Wait, wait!

175
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,608
- There's more!
- [Li] Wait!

176
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,568
- Oh! What's that?
- Vincent, here you go!

177
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,862
This is my recipe.

178
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,155
- Tapa.
- Tapa.

179
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,324
A lot of people like my tapa.

180
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,409
Hey, hey. I like your tapa, too.

181
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,786
Just help yourself.

182
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,121
[comical music playing]

183
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,498
It's so good, Ma!

184
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,749
[Li] I told you.

185
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,793
You know, if I can have
this for breakfast in Manila,

186
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,128
I'm sure I'll be more motivated to work.

187
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,298
Oh, wow! You're so hardworking!

188
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,925
I like hardworking people.

189
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,136
My daughter is hardworking, too.

190
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,596
As you know, Mama Li,

191
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,350
I was able to build
my own business not long ago.

192
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,018
- I even--
- Twice!

193
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,436
I work twice as hard.

194
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,980
Because, of course,
there are employees who rely on me.

195
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,858
Plus, I have to take
care of Mia's career, too.

196
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,361
Wow, you have a lot on your plate.

197
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,447
Good thing you still have
time to take care of your body.

198
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,826
I mean, look at these broad shoulders.

199
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,120
- So amazing!
- Thank you, Ma.

200
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,371
Are you into swimming?

201
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,580
Not really.

202
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,791
- Oh, Mama Li.
[comical music continues]

203
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,211
Just so you know, I'm quite the runner.

204
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,796
I can run pretty fast,

205
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,798
especially when we're playing tag.

206
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,633
- I can outrun everyone.
- [comical music continues]

207
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:58,717
Don't you play any sports?

208
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,886
Um…

209
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,972
- I just…
- Oh!

210
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,349
work out in the gym three times a week.

211
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,892
But recently,
I haven't been able to do so.

212
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,688
No wonder you were able to carry Gemma.

213
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,606
What?

214
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,108
My pretty love, you let him carry you?

215
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,570
- Cut it out.
- [Jason] I can carry you, too.

216
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,990
Ma, I thought we only
had to get along with Vincent.

217
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,700
Yes, I'm trying to get along with him.

218
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,912
Why does it seem like you're supporting
his efforts to make a move on me?

219
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,708
Thank goodness
you noticed that he likes you!

220
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,378
He has to put in extra
effort to make a move on you

221
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,881
because all you see is Patrick!

222
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,725
Mama Li!

223
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,894
- [LI] Hi, Matmat!
- Ma!

224
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,354
Let's go. Come on now.

225
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,689
Gemma!

226
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,274
Matmat.

227
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,109
- Hi, Patrick. Hi, Mia.
- [Patrick] Hi.

228
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,235
[Mia] Hello.

229
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,570
[Li] Hey,

230
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,490
your hair is short now. It suits you.

231
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,908
[chuckles softly]

232
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:04,867
Thanks.

233
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,076
[Matmat] I don't like it.

234
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:11,123
It doesn't suit her.
Patpat shouldn't have cut her hair.

235
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,919
[quirky music playing]

236
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,130
I bet what you don't like,
is that he's the one who cut my hair.

237
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,345
Matmat, like I told you,
I just helped Mia.

238
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,015
[quirky music continues]

239
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:31,101
Uh, Mia, you should
visit our house sometime.

240
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,895
I'll cook for you.

241
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,191
She's already been there, Mama Li.

242
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,611
She and Gemma
even pulled each other's hair.

243
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,490
- [Patrick] Matmat.
- [Li] Matmat, that doesn't count.

244
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,492
[quirky music continues]

245
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,535
Ma.

246
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,329
Gemma, come on. Past is past.

247
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,332
That was a long time ago.
You should've made up by now.

248
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,000
- Ma, let's go.
- Huh?

249
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,293
Patrick, we'll get going.

250
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,711
Uh, bye.

251
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,339
What's the hurry?

252
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,175
[quirky music fades]

[gentle music playing]

255
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,892
Come on, let's go inside, too.

256
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,649
We better get going
or we'll be late, Patpat.

257
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,859
What about me?

258
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,738
[huffs]

259

[waves lapping distantly]

262
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,255
Hey!

263
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,423
Welcome back!

264
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,678
I thought you wouldn't
want to teach here again.

265
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,849
I heard the patients love my stories.

266
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,101
And you are a storyteller.

267
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,065
I thought you only agreed because
you found out Patrick had requested it.

268
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,359
You know,

269
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,361
that kid is very clever.

270
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,949
He said he'd only follow my orders
if I bring back your class.

271
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,412
He requested for it?

272
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,831
Uh, mm-hmm.

273
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,043
Aside from welcoming you,

274
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,544
I wanted to ask you a question.

275
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,631
Do you know Zelda?

276
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,592
Zelda?

277
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,678
I only know one Zelda.

278
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,889
Your patient here.

279
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,682
She's answered in my class.

280
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,143
Is that all?

281
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,188
I have no interest in
finding out more about her.

282
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,607
Fair enough.

283
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,109
So… welcome back!

284
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:51,742
[tender music playing]

285
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,624
He requested for me to come back.

286
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,212
[door opens]

287
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:09,259
[tender music continues, fades]

288
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,428
Hey!

289
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,513
That's sweet.

290
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,350
Do you know who left this?

291
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,727
Did you just find that lying around?

292
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,521
I didn't get one?

293
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,149
[Pogi] Mm-hmm!

294
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,359
Ahh…

295
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,529
Wow, you've got a secret admirer.

296
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,781
Feels like high school.

297
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,200
There's two possibilities.

298
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,621
Either they're into you
or they've got beef with you.

299
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,125
[soft music playing]

300
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,835
I'm betting on Miss Mia.

301
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,754
Wrong. It's neither of those.

302
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:50,300
Still, it means someone likes you,
and now you've got a problem.

303
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,470
Got any other problems besides her?

304
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,849
Problem…

305
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,934
[soft music fades]

306

[somber music playing]

308
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,332
[Eden] Are you struggling, Samuel?

309
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,838
Sometimes it's better to give up.

310
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,384
But if you want to fight, go ahead.

311
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,136
I'm right here.

312
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,183
Only I can take care of you.

313
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:46,774
I won't let someone
like Olivia steal you from me.

314
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,818
[door opens]

315
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,572

[somber music continues]

317
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,869
[Eden] Olivia.

318
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,246
We need to talk.

319
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,499
Don't avoid me.

320
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,379
I won't let you steal my patient.

321
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,549
- I'm not stealing anyone.
- You went behind my back.

322
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,009
Isn't that stealing?

323
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:20,224
I helped. That's what I did,
for the patient's sake.

324
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,393
If you were really
concerned about the patient,

325
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:27,189
you would know
continuity of care is important,

326
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,275
especially for someone like Samuel.

327
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,029
Samuel's used to my care,
and now you're changing it?

328
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,365
I can care for him better.

329
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,533
[Eden scoffs]

330
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,203
Are you saying I've been neglecting him?

331
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,372
Isn't that what's happening?

332
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,127
His surgery went well, he's
recovering fine so what are you implying?

333
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,130
What about what happened with Mia?

334
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,216
That's an isolated case.

335
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:59,346
He met his daughter and
whatever the reason, when she's with him,

336
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,223
- it's not--
- That's basically my point.

337
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,685
If you were watching closely,
that wouldn't have happened.

338
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,186
It wouldn't have happened,

339
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,231
if you hadn't
insisted on bringing Mia here.

340
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:13,485
Don't forget it was
your idea for Mia to care for her father.

341
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,447
You knew my position on that
from the very beginning.

342
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,493
Mia needs her father.
They need each other.

343
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,705
You talk like you know them so well.

344
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,708
You don't know anything.

345
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,585
And you do?

346
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,588
[music turns tense]

347
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,674
Do you know enough to talk like that?

348
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,301
Do you even know them?

349
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:42,806
[tense music continues]

350
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,936
We're their care providers. That's clear.

351
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,856
Our priority is the patient's health,

352
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,525
not their family relationships.

353
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,736
And that's where we differ…

354
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,324
because that's how I care for my patients.

355
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,201
Then do it with your patient.

356
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,786
Not mine.

357
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,458

00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:26,994
[unsettling music continues]

361
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:40,716
- [sloshing]
- [music turns haunting]

362
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:01,987
- [water splashing]
- [haunting music continues]

363
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,123

- [nails click]

364
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,459
- Aah!
- [screams in pain]

365
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,835

[unsettling music playing]

[foreboding music playing, fades]

370
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,487
- Don't you think something's--
- Stay out of it.

371
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,322
Do you have to meddle in everything?

372
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,408
First Samuel, then Matmat,
what's next, the whole hospital?

373
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,953
No matter how many
times I tell myself to stay away,

374
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,288
she still has an effect on you.

What? Are you in love with Mia?

376
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,752
When you fall in love, don't you
strive to become a better person?

377
00:22:58,835 --> 00:22:59,795
Bella!

378
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,214
[Mia] Only insecure men hurt women.

379
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,800
- Stay out of this.
- Ma'am Mia! Help!
