6
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,763

<i>Mia, we shouldn't be torn apart</i>

[Patrick] <i>They're a threat to your life.</i>

12
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,109

[theme music playing]

18
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,344
I'll take you to Miss Li's
so you won't be alone.

19
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,263
I'm going to see
where Mister Dipong is,

20
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,932
so we can find Ma'am Olivia.

21
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,642
Why?

22
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,186
Because you think
that woman could be my mother?

23
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,312
Is that what you're saying?

24
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:47,941
We're only know Olivia
has a connection to Mister Dipong.

25
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,860
But whether
Mister Dipong was involved or not…

26
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,738
That we're not sure of.

27
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,783
[sighs] Whatever.

28
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,284
I'm not scared.

I'll go there and put an end to this.

51
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,060
[Anok] All right.

52
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,021
I'll call the police.

It was Ma'am Olivia

You're too late.

Why is Patpat standing there?

Uh…

104
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,315
Matmat, do you remember when,

105
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,318
you helped Sir Tommy with his trauma?

106
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:46,948
A-And then Dr. Anok said,

107
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,993
"You're a hero, Matmat."

108
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,122
[Patrick] Yes, Matmat. You were a hero.

109
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,418
Can you be brave
again in the coming days?

110
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,133
Brave again?

111
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:11,097
Why does Matmat need to be brave again?

112
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,641
You need to be brave

113
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,936
if Ma'am Olivia or Ma'am Eden
try to come near you.

114

[somber music playing]

115
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,234
Why, Patpat?

116
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,112
They're nice.

117
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:32,326
They gave Matmat, Mama Dinosaur.

118
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,497
Matmat, they're no longer
nurses at OK Hospital.

119
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,126
They don't work there anymore.

120
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:45,715
They did some
things that hurt other patients.

121
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,551
[somber music continues]

122
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,096
They should have followed the rules

123
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,391
and taken care of the patients.

124
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,893
That's right, Matmat.

125
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,729
Matmat, listen to me.

126
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,065
I don't want them to come near you, okay?

127
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,568
They might do something bad to you too.

128
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,195
[somber music continues]

129
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,989
Okay, Matmat won't go

130
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:14,118
with Ma'am Olivia and Ma'am Eden.

131
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:20,333
Matmat will only go
with people we know and trust.

132
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,922
[tender music playing]

133
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,507
Thank you, Matmat.

134
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,759
If you do that…

135
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,346
you'll be brave for Patpat too.

136
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,642
[tender music continues, fades]

137
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,978
We're telling you this
because you're important to us.

138
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,565
So you'll know what
we're facing right now.

139
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,319
So you can help us
protect Matmat from my mother.

140
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:53,157
If she's still alive, or if it's true
that she's either Eden or Olivia.

141
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,493
W-wait a minute,

142
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,787
I know you don't want
anything to do with your mom.

143
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,373
But isn't this just overthinking?

144
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,294
Boss V, it really isn't overthinking.

145
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,921
Imagine,

146
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,967
you thought your mom was dead,
and then suddenly, whoosh,

147
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,553
two people show up
acting like they might be her.

148
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,180
What if they're just working together?

149
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,268
What if neither of them is Ma'am Ingrid,

150
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,020
and they're just
working together to mess with Mia?

151
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,606
But why would they do that

152
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,109
if they've had nothing to do with Mia?

153
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,194
Fame, Miss Li.

154
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,612
People want fame nowadays.

155
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,907
Isn't that what they all want,
fame and money?

156
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,286
To extort money out
of Mia and leave her alone.

157
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,037
That is a possibility.

158
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,497
Since Mia is a celebrity.

159
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,542
They could kidnap her and extort money.

160
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,754
[Gemma] But isn't it hard to pretend
to be enemies for that long?

161
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,591
When I arrived at OK Hospital,
Ma'am Olivia and Eden

162
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,843
were already going at each other.

163
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,388
I just don't want any of
you to get caught up in this.

164
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,933
If it's just me, I don't care.

165
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,144
I can handle them.

166
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,231
[tense music playing]

167
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,275
But you all need to be careful, okay?

168
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,446
You're like children to me.

169
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,159
If anyone dares hurt even one of you…

170
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,203
there will be hell to pay.

171
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:26,375
[tense music swells]

172
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,255
[music becomes gentle]

173
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,673
Wow.

174
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,634
Matmat.

175
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,261
You finally drew a butterfly.

176
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,014
It's beautiful.

177
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:43,559
[gentle music continues]

178
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,103
Yes, Doc.

179
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,231
Matmat drew it.

180
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,818
It's beautiful, Matmat.

181
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,324
Matmat, you're doing a good job, huh.

182
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,160
- Even with our therapy sessions.
- [music becomes eerie]

183
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,124
Did Matmat do a good job, Doc?

184
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,336
Yes, I'm super proud of you.

185
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,673
It's rare for someone
like you to overcome this.

186
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:21,680
Doc, Mia and I finished our book too.

187
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,559
Please come to the book launch.

188
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,689
[eerie music continues]

189
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,234
Of course, I wouldn't miss it.

190
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,615
This painting isn't finished yet.

191
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,910
I still have to draw some plants,

192
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,580
and some birds.

193
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,960
[eerie music crescendos]

194
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,215
I'm sorry, Mia.

195
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,176
But I think you should have
your own personal security from now on.

196
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,512
Huh? Boss V, are you sure?

197
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:05,182
Security? Miss Mia is
already so allergic to the two of us,

198
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:09,353
and now you're going to hire big,
muscular guys she doesn't even know.

199
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,232
I'll take care of it, Patrick.

200
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,025
Do we have the budget?

201
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,652
I'll take it from your salary.

202
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,487
I'll handle it, okay?

203
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,532
For Mia's safety, I'll do everything.

204
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,118
Okay.

205
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,494
She said okay?

206
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,871
First time she's agreed to something.

207
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,622
[tender music playing]

208
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,625
You're okay with that?
Someone watching you the whole day?

209
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,503
Are you jealous?

210
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,048
I agree with Vincent.

211
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,551
You really should
have someone guarding you.

212
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,554
Like I said,

213
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,847
it's okay.

214
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,184
I just don't want
to feel like I'm in a cage.

215
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,437
I don't want any of this to stop me,

216
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,898
to stop all of us from living our lives.

217
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,941
[tender music continues]

218
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,027
I feel like there's some twist coming--

219
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,528
[Mia] And because of that,

220
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,656
I want to invite all of you to celebrate.

221
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,325
Because finally,

222
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,578
my beautiful book with Matmat is finished.

223
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,121
[light-hearted music playing]

224
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,249
- [Madeth squealing]
- [Vincent] Yes, yes, yes!

225
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,084
- Yes!
- [Madeth] Yay!

226
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,086
[Madeth squealing]

227
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,257
[light-hearted music continues]

228
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,969
Let's celebrate.

229
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,180
[music fades]

230
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,850
[Patrick] Please go in,
someone will welcome you inside.

231
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,061
Has security at the back been checked?

232
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,812
- Yes, all good.
- Placed one already?

233
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,940
- What about the one in front?
- Yes, it's all done.

234
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,566
[Madeth] Okay, just follow him.

235
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,318
- Good morning.
- Hello, I'm Jason.

236
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,569
This way.

237
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,488
- Do you see that--
- [Vincent] Okay, okay!

238
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,323
Everything should be perfect!

239
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,992
Even if it's just us,
it still has to be elegant.

240
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,327
We know Mia.

241
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,413
It should match
the aesthetics of our writer, okay?

242
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,415
Patrick! [sighs]

243
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,251
Good thing
you dressed like that, very good!

244
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,377
Very good!

245
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,419
Huh, why?

246
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,423
Because from years of
attending and socializing,

247
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,510
I learned there should only be
one handsome guy at each event and…

248
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,762
[chuckles]

249
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,264
…today that's me.

250
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,267
[Jason] Hey.

251
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,018
Hey, hey!

252
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,104
There's Gemma, there they are!

253
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,648
- [Vincent] That's them?
- Yes, that's them.

254
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,525
[Vincent] Very good.

255
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,862
As the only handsome
guy at this event, move aside.

256
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,822
I'll welcome the guests. Move, move.

257
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,699
- [Madeth] Wow.
- Move, move, Patrick, move.

258
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,450
- Stand here.
- [Madeth] Wow, Boss V.

259
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,121
Hi!

260
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,205
Welcome!

261
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,167

264
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,425
- [Madeth] Hello!
- [Jason] Hi, Miss Li!

265
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,844
- [Li] Hi!
- [Vincent] You're so beautiful.

266
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,471
- [Madeth] Gemma looks gorgeous.
- [Patrick] Miss Li, please come in.

267
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,098
Doc, let's go.

268
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,351
Of course, of course.

269
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:58,230
All eyes on the pretty one again, right?

270
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,609
Miss Li, I know you're already beautiful,

271
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,861
but wow,
you look even more stunning today.

272
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,487
[giggles] Oh, Vincent.

273
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,990
- Handsome as always.
- Thank you!

274
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,575
So, shall we?

275
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,994
["Bakit Naman Hindi" instrumental playing]

276
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,080
[Anok] Handsome? What about me?

277
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,250
[Li] Let the younger
ones take the spotlight.

278
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,627
Shall we?

279
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,421
Come on, move.

280
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,675
You'll get blown by the ill wind
and lose your game.

- [Gemma gasps]
- [Vincent] Hey!

Are you okay?
Do you need ice, are you hurt?

284
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,739
- What do you need?
- I'm fine.

285
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,283

Please get our guests a drink.

We have snacks over here.
Welcome to Mia's home.

293
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,512
Wow! Mia has such a big house.

- [Anok] Great, I'm hungry.

296
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,184
Watch your blood sugar.

297
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,187
- [Madeth] Go ahead.
- Alright, later.

298
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,524
- Madeth, drinks.
- Later, thanks.

I want you all to enjoy today.

It's time to celebrate our new book,

- Madeth!
- Huh?

314
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,197
Why are you live-streaming?
It's supposed to be an intimate lunch.

315
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:18,746
Oh Boss V, see Miss Mia told me to.

316
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,207
You want everyone to see this?

317
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,584
Yes.

318
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,629
Specifically Eden and Olivia.

319
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,593
I want them to see
what they're doing doesn't affect my life.

320
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,803
Mia, life must go on--

321
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,430
I want them to come out.

322
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,225
So I can find out
which one of them is my mother.

323

Madeth, continue.

324
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,731
Yes Miss Mia, one moment.

- [phone chimes]
- Yes.

- Let's eat.
- Go ahead.

332
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,000
Go on.

333
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,255
- Be careful.
- [Jason] Alright.

334
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,423
Yes.

335
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,801
Go on, boss. Hi!

336
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,760
[Jason] It's nice here.

[Madeth] Go ahead.

Go ahead, have a seat.

Here are our VIPs!

356
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,946
Alright. Yes.

357
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,283
Whoo…

358
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,325
Yay!

359
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,535
Thank you, thank you.

360
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,494
There.

361
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:26,248
[bright classical music playing]

362
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,294
Would you like to dance?

363
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,841
I'd love to,
but I have no one to dance with.

364
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:39,928
Dance with me.

365
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,722
- Eat that up first.
- What?

366
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,307
- Come on!
- Okay, okay.

367
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,185
- Right here.
- We can still dance!

368
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,896
Of course. I exercise regularly.

369
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,481
Well in fairness,
only if your knees can keep up.

370
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:55,277
[bright classical music continues]

371
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,779
So, why are you exercising regularly?

372
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,656
Getting in shape for something?

373
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,617
For our future.

374
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,994
What do you mean "our" future?

375
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,456
Because I want
to spend my retirement with you.

376
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,875
I'll get straight to the point, Li,

377
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,002
I'll be retiring next year.

378
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,297
So you must retire as
the hospital cook as well.

379
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,134
And why do you seem
so sure I'll agree to that?

380
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,221
I know you will
because I know you feel the same.

381
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,598
- [gushes, giggles] No!
- Am I wrong?

382
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,309
Whatever! You're so silly!

383
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,437
What are you talking about?
It seems serious.

384
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,023
I'm serious about your mother, Gemma.

385
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,734
[gobbling sound] This
turkey doesn't believe you.

386
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,819
- [chuckles] My goodness.
- Listen, Doc Anok.

387
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,281
How about you dance
with your future daughter-in-law,

388
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,201
while I dance with
my future mother-in-law?

389
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,454
Wait a minute! When did we discuss that?

390
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,580
In my dreams.

391
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,083
- [exclaims] Come on, Mama Li.
- Oh…

392
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,626
Come on, let's dance.

393
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,127
[Anok] What dance do we do?

394
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,712
- [Gemma] Um…
- Hip-hop?

395
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,548
[bright classical music continues]

396
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,051
It's so nice to see everyone happy.

397
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,263
Mm-hmm…

398
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,347
They're so happy.

399
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,393
Want to dance, Matmat?

400
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:14,273
W-Who will dance with Matmat?

401
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,734
Me.

402
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,821
Matmat and Patpat will dance?

403
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:21,905
Mm-hmm.

404
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,825
With Mia?

405
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,411
Me?

406
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,165
We're family, right?

407
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,585
Matmat is going to dance!

408
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,630

Dance!

411

[Madeth] Yay!

412
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,182
- [clapping, chanting]
- Dance, Matmat!

413
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,435
- Go, Matmat!
- Move it!

[poignant music continues]

415
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,031
[Jason] How can we top that?

416
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,536
That’s an unbreakable kind of love.

417
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,496
[Gemma] Go, Matmat.

418

Mia, we're just going
to get something to drink.

424
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,584
Excuse me.

425
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,586
Are you happy, Matmat?

426
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,671
M-Matmat is happy.

427
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,800
There are so many happy people.

[both chuckle]

429
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,346
We're all happy because
your book with Mia is done.

- [both chuckle]
- Happy day!

431

Happy day!

432
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,351
Here.

433
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,978
Matmat wants to rest.

434
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,271
Okay, sit down.

- Hmm?

Where's Mia?

442
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,669
I don't know.
She's around here somewhere.

443

[tense music continues]

455

Why did you let Mia leave?

456
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,967
- We couldn't stop her.
- Where is she going?

457
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,385
She didn't say where.

458

She just drove off.
