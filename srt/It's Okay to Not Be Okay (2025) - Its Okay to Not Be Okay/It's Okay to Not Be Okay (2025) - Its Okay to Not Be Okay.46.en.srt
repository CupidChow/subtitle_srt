Did you let me in because…

225
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,776
I called you my daughter?

226
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,444
No.

227
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,155
You're here because you're a fan.

228
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,574
My fans know my birthday.

229
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:03,248
So you don't believe I'm your mother?

[chuckles]

231
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,461
I don't know what's in
the air here in Maravida,

here call me their daughter.

[uneasy music continues]

234
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,553
So you didn't surprise me.

235
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,556
I just don't understand why anyone

236
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,725
would want me to be their daughter.

237
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,065
Because you are
different from them all, Mia.

[uneasy music continues]

239
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,781

Take it with you.

I don't eat food
given to me from strangers.

247
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,391
I will leave once we're done.

248
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,728
Go get some plates and cutlery.

249
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,691
I said… leave.

250
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,318
I am not leaving.

251
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,655

Patrick, it's me.

262
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,401
Are you with Mia?

263
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,195
No, she went home already.

264
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,446
Why do you ask?

265
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,864
I'll tell you later.

Where are you?

Hmm. [chuckles softly]

274
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,912
Mm-hmm.

[uneasy music playing]

278
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,548
You should throw it out.

279

You're nosy.

280
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,722
I just noticed.

281
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,558
What are you really doing here?

282
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,311

your father almost killed me?

[uneasy music continues]

302

And so?

304
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,687
"Monster."

That's what he called me.

He said I'm a monster.

308
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,032
He said his daughter is a monster.

309
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:34,913
And all monsters must die.

310
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,458
So, what?

311
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,710

Really?

[Zelda] Mm.

321
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,113
Why?

322
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,449
Isn't it sad?

323
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:17,789
On your birthday,
that's what he thought of doing…

Ah… [mock gasps]

329
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,598
It's nothing to you?

[laughs]

331
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,439
- Should I care?
- Shouldn't you?

332
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,820
I'm worried about you.

I guess we're the same.

340
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:16,723
I also hate it when
people touch my things.

341
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,352
