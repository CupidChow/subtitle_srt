<i>Then come home, darling.</i>

4
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,923
<i>You and your brother should die!</i>

5

<i>- No, Mia!</i>

6
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,468
<i>You're not a monster.</i>

00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,141
<i>Look what happened!</i>

10
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:20,103

[ominous music playing]

19

Ma'am Eden is evil.

20
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,689
She's hurting Matmat's family.

You're a great nurse,
but you're not a good person.

36
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,407
[Ingrid snickers] "Good person."

37
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,201
Am I not a good person?

38
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,912
What kind of person wants
to have her own daughter killed?!

39
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,915
I'm not the only one
who wanted to do that.

40
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,750
[ominous music sting]

41

[Ingrid] <i>My only intention</i>

45
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,934
<i>was to get back at him for hurting Mia.</i>

46
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,729
You ruined the lives of many people,

47
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,940
including Samuel, Olivia, and Zelda!

48
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,109
Zelda?! [laughing]

49
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,988
She's such an obedient…

50
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,531
fool.

51
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:22,327

<i>just so she could</i>
<i>continue to be the best.</i>

55
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,050
That's how I show my love for her.

- [snickering]
- [siren wailing]

57
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:45,350
I hope being in prison
teaches you what love means.

58
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,268
Love? [snickering]

59
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,937
[Anok] Take her away.

[sniffles, whimpers]

67
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,717
I'm so sorry.

- How are you feeling?
- Mia.

73
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,816
Does anything hurt?

74
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,359
I'm okay.

75
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,528
[Patrick mumbles] Where's Matmat?

76
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,280
Matmat's fine.

77
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,073
He's with Vincent.

[tender music continues]

79
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,494
You got hurt again,

80
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,247
because of me.

81
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,791

- [sniffles]
- [Patrick] What's important is,

88
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,559
we found her.

89
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,103
[Mia breathes shakily]

90

Are you coming back to me?

98
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,929
I'm just here to tell you

99
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,558
you'll pay for everything you did…

100
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,644
to Papa

101
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,898
and to Patrick's mother.

102
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,566
Those people again?

103
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,612
I'm your family, Mia.

104

[sullen music playing]

105
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:09,744
You're like a little demon
child who never stops eating,

106
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,707
unable to feel love for anyone else.

107
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,043
- [loud thud]
- [sullen music continues]

108
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,462
Enough of that love bullshit.

109
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,093
You won't be
the best because of that love.

110
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,931
I used to hate butterflies

111
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,267
because they reminded me of you.

112
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,107
[sullen music continues]

113
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,535
[Mia] <i>But I guess</i>
<i>I shouldn't hate them after all</i>

114

[music becomes soft]

116
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,333

[mouths] Wow.

118
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,546
[Mia] <i>Butterflies…</i>

119

00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,723
That's why…

122
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,186
I've sent you your own butterfly.

[melancholic music playing]

142
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,640
This is where we'll
visit Mama from now on.

143
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,477
Hmm.

144
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,524
C-Can I talk to Mama?

[whimpers]

167
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,433
You'd be proud of M-Matmat.

168
