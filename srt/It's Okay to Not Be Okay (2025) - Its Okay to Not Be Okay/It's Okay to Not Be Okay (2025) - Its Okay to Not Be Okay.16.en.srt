1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,460
<i>I don't want to go home!</i>

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,463
<i>Didn't I tell you to wait for me there?!</i>

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,800
<i>Patpat is mad.</i>

4
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:11,386
<i>Leave me and my brother alone.</i>

5
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:12,262
<i>What's that?</i>

6
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,596
<i>Who did that to you?</i>

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>You should've fought back!</i>

8
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,517
<i>Go ahead, tell me. What are you feeling?</i>

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,894
<i>Are you sad?</i>
<i>Do you feel sorry for me?</i>

10
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,771
<i>You don't even understand your emotions.</i>

11
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,274
<i>You're just loud like an empty can.</i>

12
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,609
<i>You should've been dead!</i>

13
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,736
<i>Sir Samuel, stop.</i>

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,489
<i>You should've been dead!</i>

15
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,371
<i>Before you tell me</i>
<i>anything to me about myself…</i>

16
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,749
<i>understand yourself first.</i>

17
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,576
<i>I heard you already went home.</i>

18
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,162
<i>Mama said you should get some rest.</i>

19
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:23,226


20
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,666
<i>I don't want to go home!</i>

21
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,750


22
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,836
<i>Didn't I tell you to wait for me there?!</i>

23
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,008


24
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,217
Tsk.

25
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,678
You messed up big time, Patrick.

26
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,764
You shouldn't have shouted.

27
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:11,983


28
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:41,721


29
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,499
<i>Matmat…</i>

30
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,627
<i>Matmat is the one</i>
<i>you should be thinking about.</i>

31
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,261
"ANG BATANG TIYANAK"

32
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,030
<i>In a remote town,</i>

33
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,659
<i>a kid like no other was born.</i>

34
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,078
<i>He didn't have any feelings.</i>

35
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:51,833
<i>All he wanted was to eat nonstop.</i>

36
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,503
<i>He was a demon kid.</i>

37
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,925
<i>To hide him from everyone else,</i>

38
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:05,096
<i>his mother locked</i>
<i>him up in their basement.</i>

39
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,726
<i>And every night,</i>
<i>his mother would sneak out</i>

40
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,853
<i>to steal some animals.</i>

41
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,896
<i>Night after night,</i>

42
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,940
<i>his mother would bring</i>
<i>home different kinds of animals</i>

43
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,608
<i>so he wouldn't get hungry.</i>

44
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,694
<i>Sometimes, chicken.</i>

45
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,237
<i>Sometimes, pig.</i>

46
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,614
<i>For many years,</i>

47
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,075
<i>the mother and son lived like this.</i>

48
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,787
<i>Until the demon kid grew up.</i>

49
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,750
<i>One day, an epidemic broke out.</i>

50
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,044
<i>Many people died,</i>

51
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,670
<i>even animals.</i>

52
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,759
<i>Everyone who survived</i>
<i>moved somewhere else.</i>

53
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,178
<i>Except the mother and son.</i>

54
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,222
<i>The mother couldn't leave her son behind.</i>

55
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,934
<i>So her son wouldn't get hungry,</i>

56
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,855
<i>the mother cut off</i>
<i>one of her legs to feed him.</i>

57
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,191
<i>Next, she cut off one of her arms.</i>

58
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,779
<i>Until she had no more legs or arms to cut.</i>

59
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,116
<i>The mother offered</i>
<i>whatever's left of her body</i>

60
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,244
<i>so until the very end,</i>

61
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,330
<i>her demon kid could eat.</i>

62
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,073
<i>The son</i>
<i>hugged his mother tightly.</i>

63
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,160
<i>And for the very first time,</i>

64
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,329
<i>the demon kid spoke.</i>

65
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,335
<i>"Mama, your hug feels so nice."</i>

66
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,163
<i>You are like no other.</i>

67
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,332
<i>You are special.</i>

68
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,251
<i>My daughter.</i>

69
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,504
<i>Because I'm the one who made you.</i>

70
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,635
<i>You should've been dead!</i>

71
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,803
<i>Help!</i>

72
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,555
<i>Sir Samuel, stop.</i>

73
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,807
<i>Sir Samuel…</i>

74
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,518
<i>- </i><i>Sir Samuel!</i>
<i>- You should've been dead!</i>

75
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,730
<i>- </i><i>You should've been dead!</i>

76
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,539
Matmat?

77
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,210
Matmat!

78
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,841
Matmat--

79
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,719
Oh, I'm sorry.

80
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,471
Were you expecting Matmat?

81
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,934
Please come in.

82
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,444
I just wanted to let you know that
Matmat and I have arrived at the house.

83
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,448
He'll be staying there for dinner.
So, I'll just drop him off later.

84
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,742
Thank you.

85
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,327
I'm sorry for the trouble.

86
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,870
Oh, no worries.

87
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,374
Come on, let's have some snacks.
Then you can also join us for dinner.

88
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,377
I invited Gemma too,

89
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,420
but she couldn't leave her work

90
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,882
because Sir Samuel
suddenly had an outburst.

91
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,592
He strangled his daughter.

92
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,678
What?

93
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,680
H-His daughter?

94
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,722
Mia?

95
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:21,018
I didn't see it but as you know,
gossip always reaches the kitchen.

96
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,827
Miss Li!

97
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,829
- Jason!
- Miss Li!

98
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,664
I brought something…

99
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,959
- that'll give us high spirits.
- Wow!

100
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,210
Patrick, you should join us.

101
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,045
- How generous of you!
- Of course!

102
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,131
Oh. Let me borrow your motorcycle.

103
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,716
- Huh?
- Come on.

104
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,342
- I'll be right back.
- Why?

105
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,969
- Just let me borrow it.
- Hey!

106
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,304
- Patrick!
- What's going on?

107
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,430
Wh--what?

108
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,098
Where's he going?

109
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,203
By the way, I've heard about
what happened to patient Samuel.

110
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,873
Oh, Doctor Emman already checked on him.

111
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,712
But, ma'am, is it okay
for Sir Samuel to be with Mia?

112
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,051
It is indeed alarming behavior,
having such a violent reaction

113
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,513
That's something we haven't seen before.

114
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,015
Turns out he's
capable of hurting other people.

115
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,185
But why did he react like that?

116
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,979
He just happened to see her again
and ended up strangling her.

117
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,147
Delusions.

118
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:35,111
He wrongly believed Mia's was dead
when she's obviously not.

119
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,113
That's exactly what's bugging me, ma'am.

120
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,493
Only Doctor Anok can answer that.

121
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,247
But if it were up to me,

122
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,834
I wouldn't let Mia and
Samuel see each other for now.

123
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:06,434
Miss, did you happen to see a tall woman
with long hair, wearing a white dress?

124
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,476
No, sir.

125
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,853
Did you see that woman?

126
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:09,895
Did you?

127
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,441
- We have no idea, sir.
- You sure? Her hair's in a braid.

128
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,484
I really didn't notice her.

129
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,236
Alright. Thank you.

130
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,085
"CLEAN! SMELLS GREAT!
WORLD-CLASS CUISINE!"

131
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,171
Sir, this way, please.

132
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,465
Just park your motorcycle inside.

133
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,259
This way, sir. There you go.

134
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,761
Okay! Thank you!

135
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,576
My pretty boy.

136
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,914
Were you captivated by my wet body?

137
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,208
Is that why you brought me here?

138
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,002
Huh?

139
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,380
This is the nearest place
I could take you.

140
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,799
Really?

141
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,426
Mia, we can't just
take cover from the rain.

142
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,887
You're soaking wet.
You have to get changed.

143
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,516
And you want to see that?

144
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,728
I'm just concerned.

145
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,647
Do you want to get sick?

146
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,276
Well, as long as you'll take care of me.

147
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,906
You can't take care of yourself, can you?

148
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,741
I rarely get sick.

149
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,204
Even if I get sick,
Vincent will be there for me.

150
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,498
You didn't answer my question.

151
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,792
Can you take care of yourself?

152
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,254
Patrick.

153
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,646
Good evening, sir, ma'am.

154
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,149
Want to book a room?

155
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,319
We have an evening special.

156
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:15,909
This is going to be a very special night.

157
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,996
Come on in.

158
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,672
What will it be, sir?

159
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,049
The evening special?

160
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,133
- Yes.
- No.

161
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,554
Ah, how about our themed rooms?

162
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,306
Is it your first night together?

163
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,309
Our Honeymoon Suite is available.

164
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,810
No.

165
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,312
We're not the sweet kind of couple.

166
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,065
Something wild perhaps?

167
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,527
How about our 50 Shades of Red room?

168
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,404
It sounds too cliché.

169
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,201
We want something… wild.

170
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,952
Unique.

171
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,872
How about our Intergalactic Suite?

172
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,999
For an out of this world experience.

173
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,043
No, sir. A simple room will do.

174
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,504
I guess he is a traditional guy.

175
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,216
The <i>Bayanihan</i> Suite is perfect for you.

176
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,345
It's perfect for those
who never back down, never give up!

177
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,846
- We'll take it.
- Just her.

178
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,348
Just me?

179
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,141
Mm-hmm.

180
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,686
You get the whole room all to yourself.

181
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,564
Once the rain stops, I'm going home.

182
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,610
Why did you bring me here?

183
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,279
Mia, I already told you.

184
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,490
Look at you, you're shaking.
You need to rest.

185
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,452
Besides, it's pouring outside.
I can't take you home.

186
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,746
That's it?

187
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,418
What do you mean?

188
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,045
I don't know.

189
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,548
That's why I'm asking you.

190
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,343
Is that the only reason, Patrick?

191
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,186
You're just looking out for me?

192
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,692
Out of concern?

193
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,239
Or because…

194
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,908
You like me?

195
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,163
Dude,

196
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,415
just say you love her.

197
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,002
A simple room please.

198
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,755
For the both of us.

199
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,563
Sorry, I left my wallet at home.

200
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,483
Are we still availing
the evening special, sir?

201
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,277
Yes, we are.

202
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,613
He's just playing hard to get.

203
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,198
Let me help him.

204
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,741
Patrick.

205
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,534
- Whip it out.
- Mia, stop.

206
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,036
- Just whip it out.
- Mia.

207
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,121
Sir, ma'am, not here.

208
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,207
Get a room first.

209
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,754
I really have left my wallet.

210
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,924
Can you pay?

211
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,469
Does it look like I have cash on me?

212
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,139
We accept payments via bank transfer.

213
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,725
All you need is to scan the QR code.

214
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,228
I don't have my phone.

215
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,397
Patrick?

216
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,904
Uh…

217
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,325
My account is empty.

218
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,162
Unbelievable.

219
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,291
You want to get
lucky but don't have money?

220
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,836
Sorry, ma'am.

221
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,339
No money, no honey.

222
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,093
Sorry.

223
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,220
I really forgot to bring my wallet.

224
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,265
It's okay.

225
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,934
I didn't bring mine either.

226
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,020
Come on.

227
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,730
I'll take you home.

228
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,824
As in your home.

229
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,867
I'll take you to your house.

230
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:31,248
You've seen the road to my house, right?

231
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,295
Fine.

232
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,090
Just take me as far
as your motorcycle can go.

233
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,278
Be quiet.

234
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,227
Hurry.

235
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,988
I'm sure these aren't Matmat's.

236
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,580
Come on.

237
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,292
Go in.

238
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,179
<i>Patpat is avoiding Matmat.</i>

239
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,931
<i>Stay away from my brother.</i>

240
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,099
<i>Why? Jealous?</i>

241
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,558
<i>Everyone has emotions.</i>

242
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,353
<i>We need to learn how to convey them.</i>

243
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,355
<i>You're good</i>
<i>at pretending to be okay.</i>

244
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,899
<i>Like everything's fine.</i>

245
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,401
<i>We'll find someone to take you home.</i>

246
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,736
<i>Who said I'm going home?</i>

247
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,238
<i>Matmat--</i>

248
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,491
<i>Liar! Patpat is a liar!</i>
