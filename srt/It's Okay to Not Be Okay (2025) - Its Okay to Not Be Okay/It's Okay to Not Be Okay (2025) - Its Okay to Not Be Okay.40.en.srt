<i>I'll take care of you for life.</i>

<i>Nurse Patty!</i>

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,261
<i>It's about Patrick and Miss Mia.</i>

6
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,680
<i>I overheard Kai…</i>
<i>Miss Mia's his girlfriend!</i>

7
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,057
<i>Patrick and Mia</i>

10

<i>That's not true.</i>

11
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,188
<i>You told Mama</i>

12
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,108
<i>you wanted me dead!</i>

13
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,819

[Patrick sniffles]

[somber music continues]

23
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,716
I can't drive you to your house.

24
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,305
I need to be with Matmat.

25
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,307
Patrick.

26
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,726
Doc Anok has advised
you shouldn't see him just yet.

27
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,272
Patrick.

28
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,731
Patrick!

00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:33,820
[somber music continues]

30
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,655
You did nothing wrong.

31
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,952
I have to see Matmat.

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,584

[somber music continues]

35
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,568
[Gemma] He won't wake up for
a while after the shot we gave him.

36
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,529
You should go home and rest.

37
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,241
I can't leave Matmat.

38
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,161
[somber music continues]

39
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,330
Patrick, you need to rest.

40
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,125
You need to compose yourself
before you see Matmat again.

41
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,464
Go home. I'll call you once he's awake.

42
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,053
[Zelda] He's got a gentle face,
but he's really nasty inside.

43
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,597
Zelda, the nurses might hear you.

44
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,974
Zelda's actually right. I saw it.

45
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,645
The look in Patrick's
eyes completely changed.

46
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,646
Right?

47
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,773
- I thought no one noticed it.
- I saw it, too.

48
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:55,360
[Zelda] How does
he have the nerve to act like that

49
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,488
when he lies to his own brother?

50
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,699
The truth really has
a way of ruining things.

51
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,868
Patrick has no respect!

52
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,620
- You really can't trust anyone.
- [tense music plays]

53
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,289
Those pretty boys hide evil so well!

54
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,042
- [screaming]
- [tense music continues]

55
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,627
[Kai] Don't you dare badmouth Patrick!

56
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,713
- [Tommy] Stop, Kai.
- You don't even know him!

57
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,257
[Cynthia] We know him!

58
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,633
No, you don't!

59
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,802
- You don't know Patrick!
- [Tommy] Come on now.

60
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,054
[Kai] Don't judge him
when you don't know him!

61
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,931
- You're nothing but gossips!
- [Cynthia] See what he did?!

62
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,933
- [Tommy] That's enough.
- [Zelda coughing]

63
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,059
Nurse, look!

64
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,145
- [Kai] Gossips!
- [music fades]

65
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,730
- Smell it!
- No!

66
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,234
Geez! This is what
we get for stepping in?

67
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:40,029
Rather than being pissed off,
just figure out why Kai reacted that way.

68
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,364
Okay.

69
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,284
Apparently, the patients were
saying bad things about Patrick,

70
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,827
that's why Kai got mad.

71
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,289
[Gemma] Ma'am Olivia.

72
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,626
I already talked to Miss Zelda.
I told her you'd be speaking with her.

73
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,461
Okay, let's have a meeting.

74
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,796
May I ask why?

75
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,173
Did something change
in patient Zelda's routine?

76
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,925
[Olivia] We're
treating her for depression,

77
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,052
but I've noticed some
changes in her behavior.

78
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:07,515
So I'd like to talk to her first
before consulting Dr. Emman.

79
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,768
Can I say something.

80
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,146
She's been our patient for a long time.

81
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,399
But she's still a mystery to me.

82
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,944
From what I know,

83
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,488
she no longer has family in the country.

84
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,992
It's her sibling in Italy
who supports her treatment.

85
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,538
May I ask what caused her depression?

86
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,418
Seems like it started after
her and her husband's separation,

87
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,379
but she hasn't shared anything with me.

88
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,674
Anyway, have
you talked to Patrick? How is he?

89
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,635
[pensive music playing]

90
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,928
Not yet, ma'am.

91
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,808
He probably needs more time.

92
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,103
[pensive music continues]

93
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,607
Anyway, let's start our meeting.
I'll just get my logbook.

94
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,570
Haven't you really
checked on Patrick yet?

95
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,989
[sighs deeply]

96
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,491
Patty,

97
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,577
he and Matmat are
dealing with a lot right now.

98
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,663
I have to give them space.

99
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,124
Is that so?

100
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:23,508
[pensive music continues]

101
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:38,940
[pensive music continues]

102
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,614
[sighs deeply]

103
00:06:54,205 --> 00:07:01,212
[pensive music continues]

["Being With You" instrumental playing]

105
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,403
What happened?

106
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:30,992
["Being With You" instrumental continues]

107
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,744
We were happy earlier.

108
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,706
[sighs deeply]

109
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,840
Matmat burst into tears recalling
how he almost drowned in the river.

110
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:51,637
["Being With You" instrumental continues]

111
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,515
But why does it feel like it's my fault?

112
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,316
Talk to your siblings.

113
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,321
So they can patch things up.

114
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,618
And so they can finally come home.

115
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:22,960
["Being With You" by
Angeline Quinto playing]

116

00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:42,897
Ah…

120
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,565
Okay. Noted, sis.

121
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,193
Besides,
Miss Li heard what you just said.

122
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,237
- Right, Miss Li?
- Yes. Go on.

123
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,780
I have something to tell her.

124
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,406
Uh, my pretty love…

125
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,535
I'm coming over tomorrow,
okay? My brothers need me.

126
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,620
Hmph. Delusional.

127
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,997
Alright, Jason.

128
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,708
You might help cheer up Matmat.

129
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,503
<i>Alright. I've got to get back to work.</i>

130
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,713
- Okay. Thanks, sis! Bye!
- Gemma, is Mia--

131
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,548
[phone beeps]

132
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,467
Hey. Why didn't you ask where Mia is?!

133
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:17,014
Well, Boss V,
if Miss Mia's at the hospital,

134
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,809
Gemma would've
mentioned her earlier in the call.

135
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,602
But she didn't.

136
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,438
And we kept calling Miss Mia,
but she wasn't picking up.

137
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,023
That means Miss Mia has gone missing.

138
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,358
- But she is--
- Madeth!

139
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,526
Mia really is missing.

140
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,111
That's why we're
searching for her, right?!

141
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,613
Are we just going
to wait for her to come back?!

142
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,576
Hmph! Mia's in serious trouble
again because of that annoying Patrick!

143
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,702
Psst!

144
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,579
You're being too mean to Patrick.

145
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,081
Why? I'm telling the truth!

146
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,543
If Patrick hadn't invited Mia,
Matmat wouldn't have gotten mad at her!

147
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,920
Psst. You know what? Listen to me!

148
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,714
No matter how many
times Patrick invited Mia,

149
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,049
if she had just said no,
we wouldn't have this problem!

150
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,260
There's nothing we can do.
Mia's madly in love with him!

151
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,221
Don't say things like that about Mia!

152
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,056
Patrick's taking advantage of Mia!

153
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,434
Patrick isn't like that!
Mia's the one to blame!

154
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,102
Our life was
peaceful before she got here!

155
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,147
- Our life was peaceful before Patrick--
- Miss Li, Vincent and Jason are fighting!

156
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,274
- [thud]
- [arguing stops]

157
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,234
Is there a problem?

158
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,238
[Jason] Bro. Bro, I like your cut.

159
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,824
- It's nice. You look so fine.
- [Vincent] Thanks to you.

160
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,159
[Jason] I also like your blue top.

161
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,744
- Thanks.
- I like it.

162
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,454
We're not fighting. Uh…

163
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,748
I was just checking
out Jason's nice polo shirt.

164
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,668
[Jason, Vincent chuckle awkwardly]

165
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,549
Nurse. [giggles]

166
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,343
Get straight to the point.

167
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,054
What do you need?

168
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:43,726
I just need to know what you're feeling.

169
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,020
[uneasy music playing]

170
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,897
Well, the truth is…

171
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,317
Something's been bothering me.

172
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,904
[uneasy music continues]

173
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:59,617
Is it true
that someone tried to kill him?

174
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,121
Who almost got killed?

175
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,332
Matmat.

176
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,088
Is it true his brother
wanted him dead before?

177
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,007
Ah…

178
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,595
Whatever happened to Matmat in the past…

179
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,888
Mm-hmm.

180
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,350
…it seems like it was just
a simple fight with his brother.

181
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,602
A misunderstanding.

182
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,564
Misunderstanding?

183
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:36,237
- [laughing]
- [uneasy music continues]

184
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,531
Do you think that's funny?

185
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,367
Did you know…

186
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,744
In Otero's book,

187
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,206
he killed his wife because
he thought she was having an affair.

188
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,208
And in <i>The Great Gatsby,</i>

189
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,836
George killed Gatsby,

190
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,463
even though Gatsby
didn't do anything wrong.

191
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,048
Mm!

192
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,593
[chuckling]

193
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:03,097
Do you think that way
because of the books you're reading?

194
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,102
But it can happen in
real life. Right, Nurse?

195
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,522
[ominous music sting]

196
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:16,318
So, Nurse, you shouldn't
take a misunderstanding lightly.

197
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,654
[uneasy music continues]

198
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:25,744
A simple misunderstanding
could cost someone their life.

199
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:31,459
[uneasy music crescendos]

200
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:38,757

[locker closes, locks]

00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:13,834
[melancholic music continues]

206
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,797
It's getting late.

207
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,550
Aren't you going home?

208
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,306
[Patrick sighs heavily]

209
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,185
I'll just wait for Matmat
to get out of the isolation room.

210
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:36,482
[melancholic music continues]

211
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,612
Aren't you going to go see him?

212
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,787
He needs some space.

213
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,126
Alright.

214
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,962
I'll go back to work.

215
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:04,218
[melancholic music continues]

216
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,433
[music fades]

217
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,937
[sighs] He said he'll go
home once Matmat comes out.

218
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,400
What if Matmat doesn't come out?

219
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,652
Patrick really won't go home?

220
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:28,409
- [somber music playing]
- [sighs deeply, clicks tongue]

221
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,827
Pogi.

222
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,912
Matmat has autism.

223
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,374
People like him,

224
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:44,008
shut themselves off from the world,
when they're struggling, overwhelmed,

225
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,510
or dealing with
emotions they can't explain.

226
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,931
We shouldn't pressure
them to be okay because

227
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,601
they should be the ones
to say when they're ready.

228
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,061
[Gemma] <i>That's why Patrick</i>

229
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,273
<i>has gotten used to waiting for Matmat.</i>

230
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,983
[somber music continues]

231
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,945
<i>He will wait no matter how long it takes.</i>

232
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,366
<i>Because that's how</i>
<i>he shows his love for his brother.</i>

233
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,702
[somber music fades]

234
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,747
[Li] Doc Anok?

235
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,582
Li?

236
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,667
- Doc Anok.
- Li? Li!

237
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,795
- Here.
- Ooh!

238
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,297
Time for your snack.

239
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,174
Just stay there. I got this.

240
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,509
Sit down. Just sit there.

241
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,929
- Here.
- Ah…

242
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,013
[Li] There you go.

243
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,141
Wow. You're so sweet.

244
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,311
You came here just to bring me a snack.

245
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,146
Don't be silly.

246
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,191
I came back here
because I couldn't help but ask

247
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,109
about what happened between those two.

248
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,695
So, how are they?

249
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,284
Life is testing them right now.

250
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,620
My goodness.

251
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,122
First they lost their mom,

252
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:01,168
now they're facing all these challenges.

253
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,921
Mm-hmm. First, the PTSD diagnosis.

254
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,257
Then, Matmat's
trauma from the river incident.

255
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,596
But Doc Anok, this is different.

256
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,433
I'm sure Matmat is
struggling to process this.

257
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:21,021
Imagine, he thinks
his own brother wanted him dead.

258
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,190
He's been carrying that for so long.

259
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,859
I'm sure this is
hard for Patrick as well.

260
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,446
He won't stop until
his brother forgives him.

261
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,576
And we don't know if
Matmat will ever forgive him.

262
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:41,417
But there is something
Patrick must do that is much harder.

263
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,919
What?

264
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,215
[sighs] He needs
to forgive himself first.

265
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,677
Because no matter how
many times he apologizes to Matmat,

266
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,638
if he hasn't forgiven himself,

267
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,933
the weight of their past
will burden him forever.

268
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:05,024
[pensive music playing, fades]

269
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:11,572
[ringing]

270
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,407
- [footsteps approach]
- Here.

271
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,410
You ignored what I said.

272
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,912
[ringing continues]

273
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,081
Sorry, Doc. I couldn't leave Matmat.

274
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,334
How are you?

275
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,256
How do you feel
about everything going on?

276
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,634
I don't know, Doc.

277
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,471
I never thought it would come to this.

278
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,931
What do you mean?

279
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,934
That your brother would get mad

280
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,353
at something you did when you were kids?

281
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,816
He never mentioned it before.

282
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,986
You've been taking
care of Matmat for so long.

283
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:55,491
You should know that people with autism
often have excellent memory.

284
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,786
It seems that you're
the one who wants to forget.

285
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,956
[melancholic music playing]

286
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,083
[sighs]

287
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,461
You and your brother
have gone through so much.

288
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,757
Your past resurfacing is just
another challenge for you both.

289
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,968
But you can overcome this.

290
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,096
As long as you're there for each other.

291
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,809
But didn't you hear what he said?

292
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,352
He doesn't want me around anymore.

293
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,355
I highly doubt that.

294
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,023
But if that's the case,

295
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,191
will you just abandon him?

296
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,611
[melancholic music continues]

297
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,738
Since you also rely on Matmat,

298
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,534
give him a chance to help you.

299
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,744
Face this together.

300
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,748
[melancholic music continues]

301
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,961
Will seeing the butterflies
affect his therapy progress?

302
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,464
The emotions he showed
aren't connected to the butterflies.

303
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,216
We need to observe him more.

304
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,012
Alright.

305
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,098
You can go back to work.

306
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:08,230
I took care of Bella's
dad's complaint against you.

307
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,107
What did you do?

308
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,860
I talked to him, of course.

309
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,197
Since you're always at the hospital,
you may as well work.

310
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:21,535
- Once Matmat is okay, you can go home.
- [phone ringing]

311
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,872
- Thank you, Doc.
- [ringing continues]

312
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,874
Your phone keeps ringing.

313
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,584
Should I pick it up for you?

314
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,713
[ringing continues]

315
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,799
Hello?

316
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,552

Matmat?

[door closes]

322
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,077
[Gemma] Matmat?

323
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,997
You can hear me, right?

324
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:13,462
[gentle music playing]

325
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,797
Is it not too hot under there?

[rustling]

327
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,806
Let's eat, Matmat.

328
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,350
Aren't you hungry?

329
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,311
[rustling]

330
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,315
Are you not hungry or

331
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,817
are you just trying to avoid Patrick?

332
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:40,572
[gentle music continues]

333
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,158
Patrick's not outside.

334
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,660
Come, let's eat.

00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:51,959
[gentle music continues]

336
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,336
I'll be at the nurse station, okay?

337
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,755
If you need company,
you know where to find me.

Gemma took forever to leave!

344
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,370
[whimpers] She kept talking.

345
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,790
Matmat was so hot underneath.

346
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,125
Hmph!

347
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,544

[Matmat] <i>Patpat is not here.</i>

<i>Patpat's not here.</i>

353
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,869
[Jason] Good morning, bro.

354
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,412
[gentle music fades]

355
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,623
I brought you chicken barbeque.
To remind you of what it tastes like.

356
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,210
I haven't been gone that long.

357
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:23,508
One day, six hours and seven minutes,
feels like forever to me.

358
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,219
[Jason clears throat]

359
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,096
[P.A. system chimes]

360
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,017
[indistinct P.A. announcement]

361
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,352
[Jason clears throat]

362
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,026
[clears throat] Where's Matmat?

363
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,696
Still in isolation?

364
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,203
[somber music playing]

365
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,579
He still won't come out?

366
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,832
We haven't talked yet.

367
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,628
[somber music continues]

368
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,714
If he doesn't want
to come out, it just means…

369
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,051
he's not ready to talk to me.

370
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,135
Patrick.

371
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,181
None of this would've happened

372
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,767
if you hadn't gotten close with Mia.

373
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,229
[somber music continues]

374
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,271
Bro.

375
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,483
Take a look at your palm.

376
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:28,031
It might just remind you
why you shouldn't be with Mia.

377
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,036
[Patrick] <i>I know that.</i>

378
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,250
[somber music continues]

379
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,502
<i>It was just a dream.</i>

380
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,840
<i>And in that dream,</i>

381
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,801
<i>I was happy.</i>

382
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,558
<i>I was free from everything.</i>

383
00:23:54,641 --> 00:24:01,648
[somber music continues]

384
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:14,911
[somber music continues]

385
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,204
[sniffles]

386
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,208
But now I'm awake.

387
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,299
I'm awake.

388
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:38,310
[somber music continues]

389
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,190
I'm back to reality now.

390
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,115
[music fades]

391
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,076
<i>Patpat and Matmat</i>
<i>should be together forever.</i>

392
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,494
<i>I will make Patrick happy.</i>

393
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,706
<i>Because you told me</i>
<i>to not burden myself with regret.</i>

394
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,208
<i>You want to be with Miss Mia!</i>

395
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,417
<i>That's not true.</i>

396
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,337
<i>You want Matmat dead!</i>

397
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,922
<i>Do you think he</i>
<i>still wants to be with you?</i>

398
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,840
<i>I didn't realize I was hurting Matmat.</i>

399
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,759
<i>It was a mistake I ever</i>
<i>entertained having you in my life</i>

400
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,053
<i>When I'm with you,</i>
<i>it's like he doesn't exist.</i>

401
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,847
[Mia] <i>What about when you said</i>
<i>you were free because of me?</i>

402
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,474
[Patrick] <i>This is where it ends for us.</i>

403
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:22,479
<i>If we want happiness around us,</i>
<i>it has start from within.</i>

404
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:25,732
<i>I really, really miss you, Patrick.</i>

405
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,068
<i>There's something odd about her.</i>

406
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,362
<i>I-It's a dinosaur!</i>

407
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:34,449
<i>It's her birthday tomorrow.</i>
<i>You can't leave Mia.</i>

408
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:37,994
<i>And we need to keep</i>
<i>her from thinking about her mom.</i>

409
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,746
<i>Did she tell you anything?</i>

410
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,499
<i>I remember her saying</i>
<i>today's an important day for her.</i>

411
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,834
<i>I wouldn't be surprised</i>
<i>if she turns out to be Ingrid.</i>

412
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,503
<i>That she's returned for</i>
<i>her husband and daughter.</i>

413
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,505
<i>She must die!</i>

414
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,382
<i>They're monsters!</i>

415
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,884
<i>Your daughter's not a monster!</i>
<i>Mia isn't like that at all!</i>

416
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,846
<i>You have to kill</i>
<i>her before she kills you!</i>
