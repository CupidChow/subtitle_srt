Ugh! [grunts]

35
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,759
When you took this job,
you said you'd do everything.

That includes this.

00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,763
I knew it, sir!

38
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,516
Getting hired as your assistant is a trap.

39
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,686
Do you want to quit?

40
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,604
No, boss!

Oh! By the entrance.

00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,698
So when people walk in,

46
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,701
they'll think of buying Mia's book.

47
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,579
Then why did I even bring it here?

48
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,249
Did I say bring it here?
What did I tell you earlier?

Isn't that a psychiatric hospital?

59

I know, Gemma.
It's just that we've been so busy--

[Gemma] <i>Sir.</i>

76
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,368
<i>The tumor in his brain</i>
<i>needs to be removed immediately.</i>

77
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,790
<i>If not, it could kill him.</i>

78
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,876
Why are you forcing life into
someone who's already dead?

[somber music playing]

80
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,181

Oh, Gemma.

If you really want him to live,

87

why don't you come
get my consent yourself?

88

Boss, so what's the truth?

96

Is he alive or not?

97
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,977
Why are you still here?

98
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,687
Go to the entrance!

[Patrick] New patient, Doc?

Yes, patient Alex Roces.

107

He was being treated for anxiety disorder,

108
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,465
but two days ago,
he overdosed on alprazolam.

109
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,926
He tried to commit suicide.

110
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,345
And almost killed his own child.

111
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:51,100
Good thing the kid
threw up the pills and ran away.

112

Mona, my dear!

- Mona!
- [kid gasps]

184

What happened? How did Alex escape?

190
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,774
I don't know! How did he get out?!

191
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,567

[music ends]

195
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,512
All she has to do is
sign a piece of paper.

196
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,097
Nurse Gemma?

197
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,059
Is Mia Hernandez coming?

198
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,522
Will she finally sign off
on her father's operation?

199
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,275
She still refuses
to give consent, Ma'am Eden.

200
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,070
Then you aren't trying hard enough.

201
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,533
Have you done
everything to get her consent?

202
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,203
I'll try again.

203
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,206
Go to her if you have to.

204
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,876
No child should
abandon their parents to die.

205
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,212
Am I right, Eden?

206
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,634
If she's really against it,
let's not force her.

207
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,053
That's just how it is.

208
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,056
Some children can bear
to leave their parents behind,

209
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,436
but no parent can bear to do the same.

[Marshal]
We apologize for the inconvenience.

But we need to evacuate the auditorium.

Please remain calm…

226
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,284
- What's going on? Wait.
- …and follow the marshals.

227
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,578
- I'll check on Mia.
- [Marshal] Miss Mia, let's go.

00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,371
[Vincent] Why are
you evacuating the venue?

Hey!

Hey!

239
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,270
I won't allow this.

240
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,564
Tell people to stay so
I can finish my reading.

Ma'am, no one wanted--

244
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,283
This will be your fault
if the kids stay up all night

245
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,994
wondering how the witch's story ends.

246
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,162
We understand.

00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,956

Listen to me, okay?

252
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,801
You will come with me
and we'll carry on with the plan.

253

But I don't want to die, Papa!

Leave us alone!

261
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,653
[Mia] Did I hear that right?

262
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,655
You'd kill your daughter,

263
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,907
because you don't
want to leave her behind?

264
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,995
Wow. Amazing.

- [Mona sobs]
- [Mia] Why can't you answer me?

270

The answer better be yes

271
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,806
since you have the nerve
to drag your daughter into this.

272
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,310
When the truth is you're
the one afraid to be left alone.

274

leave your kid out of it.

I'd claim it was self-defense.

360
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,761
You know…

361
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,057
there are a lot of
bad people in this world.

362
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,979
And that's why there
are crazy heroes out there.

363
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,859
To kill those bad guys.

364
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:57,613
[mysterious music continues]

365
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,697
So, tell me.

366
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,035
Which one do you think I am?

367
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,916
Am I a bad guy or a crazy hero?

368
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,545
[mysterious music continues]

369
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,671
Neither.

370
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:20,719
Because people like
you just do whatever you please.

371
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:28,477
[mysterious music continues]

372
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,566
[music fades]

373
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,193
[Vincent] Thank you!

374
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,029
- Thank you for your time!
- Miss Mia, care for a photo?

375
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,073
Security, please control the crowd.

376
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,741
[whispering] We can easily say

377
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,534
we had nothing
to do with the interruption,

378
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,245
but not that incident with the patient!

379
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,039
If this hits social media,
the headline will say

380
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,959
"Mia Hernandez stabbed a patient!"

381
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,044
"A famous book author and influencer

382
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,921
turns out to be a murderer!" [huffs]

383
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,048
Do what you always do.

384
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,008
Bribe whoever needs to be bribed.

385
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:04,304
We can donate a hefty sum to the hospital
and they'll keep the incident under wraps.

386
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,848
But the nurse?! The nurse!

387
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,352
I need to do something.

388
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,230
What? What do you mean?!

389
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,190
We have to go! Mia. [sobs]

390
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,817
[frustrated grunt]

391
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,610
[whines]

392
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,239
Why am I being punished like this?!

393
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,699
[whimsical music playing]

394
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,702
Maybe you were
a jerk in your past life, sir.

395
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,162
I don't need your opinion!

396
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,582
Go find that nurse in
your past life! I don't care!

397
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,751
Damn it!

398
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,086
You deal with Mia!

399
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,421
Follow her!

400
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,548
I give up!

401
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,885
Nurse? In my past life?

402
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,973
[hospital director] You want
Patrick Gonzales terminated?

403
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,267
It's just a simple task, isn't it?

404
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,893
- But--
- Fine.

405
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:56,398
Then I will just make a big deal about
what happened at the book reading today.

406
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,899
I'll have my manager post

407
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,028
about this hospital's
negligence to its patients.

408
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,071
You obviously don't
take good care of them--

409
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,823
Ms. Hernandez…

410
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,868
This hospital doesn't need a scandal.

411
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,870
Then do what I told you to do.

412
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,122
Easy, right?

413
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,502
You're firing me?

414
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,714
[sighs] You should've
exercised more restraint.

415
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,967
We treat patients here.

416
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,635
We don't beat them.

417
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,305
I wouldn't be surprised
if this is the same reason

418
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,849
you got fired from those other hospitals.

419
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,267
Sir, it's not.

420
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,185
[sighs sharply]

421
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,730
Five hospitals in five years?

422
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,858
Someone must be accountable.

423
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:44,154
Otherwise, this
hospital's reputation will suffer.

424
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:47,991
[somber music plays, fades]

425
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,039
Boss Vincent, it's Miss Mia!

426
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,583
- Miss Mia!
- Mia! You're 40 minutes late!

427
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,376
[Mia] Late or I won't show up at all?

428
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,878
I'm glad you showed up.

429
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,880
But anyway, this is an endorsement shoot.

430
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,799
All you have to do
is post about it online.

431
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:08,095
For now, we have
to promote brands on social media,

432
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,764
Then, we'll get TV commercials.

433
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,224
That's the next step, alright?

434
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,391

Hello. Are you here, Gemma?

437
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,275
[Gemma] <i>Hello, Sir Vincent?</i>

438
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,194
I'm almost at your location.

439
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,572
Where can I meet with Ms. Hernandez

440
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,741
so she can sign the consent form?

441
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,493
Just get to the studio, quick.

442
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,328
Mia seems to be in a good mood.

443
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,956
<i>I'll be there shortly, sir.</i>

444
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,042
Yes, hurry!

445
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,752
Okay, bye.

446
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,879
- [phone beeps]
- I better go.

447
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,423
I don't want them
finding out I planned this.

448

Gemma?

453
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,877
Gemma!

454
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,673
Gemma, Gemma, Gemma.

455
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,552
What's it been? Twenty years?

456
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,142
Miss Mia, do you know each other?

457
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,103
Why don't you get our guest a drink?

458
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,480
Sure.

459
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:50,363
Here's the consent form for Mr.
Hernandez's surgery.

460
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,449
Why would I sign that?

461
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:56,286
You told me to come to you
so you can sign it--

462
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,079
Well, I changed my mind, so…

463
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,207
No.

[quizzical music playing]

465
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:06,338
Ms. Hernandez,
your dad needs this for him to live.

466
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,006
I've said it before.

467
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,009
My dad has long been dead.

468
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,350
Oh. Why do you look shocked?

469
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,896
Right.

470
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,065
I forgot that you're kind, Gemma.

471
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:29,819
So now you're here doing
your job as a responsible nurse.

472
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,744
I just need one
signature from you, Ms. Hernandez.

473
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,913
Hey, just call me Mia.

474
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,206
Ms. Hernandez.

475
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,835
Your dad's life depends on this.

476
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,756
I no longer have parents.

477
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,761
They're both dead to me.

478
00:25:54,844 --> 00:26:00,558
[tense music playing]

479
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,310
Come to think of it.

480
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:07,691
One has a dead soul
who you all want to bring back to life.

481
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,694
As for the other one,

482
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,613
no matter how hard I try to kill her,

483
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,909
her breath still reaches my soul.
