1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,002
Leave Patrick alone, Gemma.

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,462
He's really mine.

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,590
Do you really have
to own whatever you want?!

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,968
That's called obsession!

5
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,429
You act kind in front of other people.

6
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,763
But the truth is…

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,390
You have a nasty mouth!

8
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:16,182
[slaps]

9
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,183
Ow! Stop it, Mia!

10
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,728
It hurts! Let me go!

11
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,604
Mia! Enough!

12
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:26,234
You didn't tell me Miss Mia's here.

13
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,737
- That's lying, right?
- I'm sorry, Matmat.

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,281
- Go home.
- Why are you staying here?

15
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,074
You're better to leave this place.
I'll help--

16
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:33,992
Can you stop?!

17
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:37,328
You have no right to tell
me what to do or where to live,

18
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,830
because you don't own me!

19
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:41,833
You're making me confused!
You keep sending mixed signals!

20
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,626
You're being forgetful
because of that woman?

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,919
I shouldn't let that happen.

22
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,673
We're here in Maravida
for Matmat's therapy sessions.

23
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,634
I should focus on Matmat.

24
00:00:53,261 --> 00:01:00,435
[theme music playing]

00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,069

26
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,656
[loud knocking continues]

27
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,951
- [knocking continues]
- [Mia] Wait!

28
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,703
- [heavy footsteps]
- [Mia sighs sharply]

29
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,580
[Mia] Whoever has woken me up,

30
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,834
I will make sure they regret
this for the rest of their life!

31
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,335
- [heavy footsteps]
- [knock on door]

32
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,003
[huffs]

33
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,964
- [Mia grunts]
- Hello, sunshine!

34
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,174
The whole world says "hello" to you!

35
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,178
[Vincent] Wait, wait, wait!

36
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,346
Ow! Ow! Ow!

37
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,015
Open the door! Mia, it hurts! Ow! Ow!

38
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,392
[Vincent grunts]

39
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,313
- [sobs softly]
- [Mia] You don't need to cry.

40
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,690
I'm still alive.

41
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,066
Come on, Mia.

42
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,903
Do you really think
that's the reason I'm crying?

43
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,030
[Vincent scoffs lightly]

44
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,533
[sobs, sniffles softly]

45
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,829
What about you?

46
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,706
Why are you crying?

47
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,501
I got scammed.

48
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,253
Huh?!

49
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,588
When?! Where?!

50
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,508
The moment I accepted this job.

51
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,844
[quirky music playing]

52
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,679
- [scoffs]
- No, Mia! Please!

53
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,599
Come back to Manila with me!
Get to work! Please!

54
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,017
- No.
- [exhales sharply]

55
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,311
Mia, you're missing out
on so many opportunities

56
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,396
because you won't return to Manila!

57
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,774
It's affecting you, me, the whole company!

58
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,027
Come on, Mia!
Don't wait until you hit zero balance

59
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,112
- before you decide to return--
- Is that my fault?

60
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,196
Mia…

61
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,032
I'm begging you.

62
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,491
[quirky music ends]

63
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,543
No.

[huffs]

65
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,881
- You're under contract, okay?
- I don't care.

66
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,176
If I say I'm not ready,
then I'm not ready.

67
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,054
[footsteps receding]

68
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,306
[Madeth] Uh, Boss? Boss.

69
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,099
What's this?

70
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:49,395
Boss, I'm begging you.
Just accept my resignation already.

71
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,730
Let me go.

72
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,441
I don't want to wait
until I hit zero balance.

73
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,692
We're not hitting zero.

74
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,861
You just said we would.

75
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,030
Please.

76
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,157
Mia!

77
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,619
You'll go back to work
and you will write, okay?

78
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,628
I will.

79
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,256
[quirky music resumes]

80
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,384
What do you need? An assistant?
Do you want Madeth to stay?

81
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,468
She can sleep on the floor!

82
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,929
- There's plenty of space!
- No, Boss! I'm resigning!

83
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,264
She can't stay here.

84
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,224
I didn't accept her resignation letter!

85
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,850
- Boss!
- I tore it up!

86
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,478
- And she can't stay here.
- [quirky music fades]

87
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,274
Because I have a new housemate.

[suspenseful music playing]

90
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:40,321
Uh, Boss? I really want to quit.
Please just let me go.

91
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,407
Miss Mia's already
seeing things around here.

92
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,284
There's no way I'm staying here.

93
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,203
Uh…

94
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,372
Mia, who…

95
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,791
Who are you calling your housemate?

96
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,962
[suspenseful music continues]

97
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,551
[suspenseful music crescendos]

98
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,346
[Gemma] Have you finished your activities?

99
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,849
[Cynthia] Just the coloring book left.

100
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:10,893
Nurse Gemma.

101
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,355
[Cynthia] Nurse Patrick,
are you in charge of me?

102
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,606
If it's you, then that's okay.

103
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,151
Later. I'll talk to Nurse Gemma first.

104
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,486
Nurse Jen, can you please
take Cynthia for now?

105
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,322
- Sure, no problem.
- [Cynthia] Okay.

106
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,079
I haven't checked in on you.

107
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,540
How's your head?

108
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,294
Got my hair pulled,

109
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,670
but it's fine.

110
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,255
My hair's tough.

111
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,175
I'm really sorry.

112
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,677
Patrick, it's okay.

113
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,765
Thanks for worrying.

114
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,267
Had I known this would happen,

115
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,936
I wouldn't have let her come over.

116
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,236
What about you? Are you okay?

117
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,822
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

118
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,870
Why was she at your place anyway?

119
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,540
She got caught in the rain.

120
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,501
She had no ride,

121
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,211
and I couldn't take her home either.

122
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,838
Doesn't she have a car?

123
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,007
She left it.

124
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,928
And it was too dangerous
to drive on the slippery roads.

125
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,724
I should've just lent you my car.

126
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,810
Gemma, you were on shift.

127
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,145
I didn't want to bother you.

128
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,691
And it wasn't an emergency anyway.

129
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,407
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,869
I really shouldn't have brought her over.

131
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,663
[mouth clicks]

132
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,456
I'm really okay, Patrick.

133
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,210
Patrick, dear?

134
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,170
Yes, ma'am?

135
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,464
Can you help me out?

136
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,716
Sure. Are you in pain?

137
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,801
Not really.

138
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,345
Over there. Let's talk there.

139
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,765
I'll be right back.

140
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,768
- Let's go.
- Follow me!

141
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,019
Over here.

142
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,355
Here. Stand right here.

143
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,273
Stay still.

144
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,691
Just stand right there.

145
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,526
I'm checking your angles.

146
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:24,986
My angles?

147
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:29,323
Yeah, this is how I check my models
before a fashion show.

148
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,910
I focus more on the face than the outfit.

149
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,579
Now turn. Turn around.

150
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,540
Go on. Turn! Turn around.

151
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,254
Yes! Perfect!

152
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,840
You're a perfect match for my daughter.

153
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,134
Your daughter?

154
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,678
Yes, I have a daughter.

155
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,014
She's beautiful!

156
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,101
- Miss Elvie…
- Why?

157
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,562
Oh, I should've asked first.

158
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,398
Is Nurse Gemma your girlfriend?

159
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,400
[chuckles softly] No, ma'am.

160
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,695
Oh good! My daughter's single.

161
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,031
She's pretty.
You two would look great together!

162
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,493
Do you need anything else?

163
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:17,955
No. I'll just stay here and get some sun.

164
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,250
My daughter told me
it's good for my health.

165
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,669
I'm just following her advice.

166
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,297
- I'll go back to work.
- Alright.

167
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,507
Oh, Patrick!

168
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,511
I'll introduce you to my daughter
when she visits again, okay?

169
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,722
Okay.

170
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,915
The hardest part of any
journey is taking that first step.

171
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,254
First step of the journey?

172
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:11,175
Matmat's painting.
He won't go on a journey, Doc.

173
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,468
[chuckles]

174
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,762
It's not just about that, Matmat.

175
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,431
It can also be about work.

176
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,851
Because the hardest
part of getting work done…

177
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,937
is…

178
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,023
getting started.

179
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,443
- You're doing it wrong!
- What do you mean?

180
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,612
- You're bad, Doc!
- Matmat, what's wrong?

181
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,030
- You're bad!
- Hey, Matmat!

182
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,657
- You just ruined it!
- Calm down!

183
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,450
- Aw, look at them.
- [playful music playing]

184
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,411
Look at them. They…

185
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,122
They look so happy!

186
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,083
Why, Bella?
Do you want to do some painting?

187
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,794
- Just calm down, okay?
- Go away!

188
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,505
- I want to…
- [playful music continues]

189
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,341
…I also want to have fun.
[sighs sullenly]

190
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,343
[taps on counter, clicks tongue]

191
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,762
I think it's time for
you to take your meds.

192
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,682
- Let's look for Nurse Patty. Come on.
- [playful music fades]

193
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,352
- [Bella] Mm? Nurse Patty?
- [Kai] Nurse?

194
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,315
[sighs]

195
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,319
Ugh.

196
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,826
- Mm!
- [back scratching]

197
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,536
[door opens]

198
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,041
[footsteps approaching]

199
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,834
[scratching continues]

200
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,711
What are we going to talk about?

201
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,380
Oh, Ms. Hernandez!

202
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,049
Come sit down.

203
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,842
How are you?

204
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,304
You made me come here
just so you could ask me that?

205
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,306
You could have just called.

206
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,599
[Anok] Uh…

207
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:46,187
I thought I should say sorry in person.

208
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,897
Sorry for what?

209
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,776
Uh, for what happened
between you and your father.

210
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,153
What happened isn't your fault.

211
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,280
Were you the one who strangled me?

212
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:02,411
Uh, no. But as his doctor,
I'm partly at fault because I suggested--

213
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,456
You made that decision as his doctor.

214
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,917
It's not your fault,

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,336
so saying sorry won't change anything.

216
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,671
- [quirky music playing]
- Uh…

217
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,131
Okay, Ms. Hernandez.

218
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:19,220
You're free to strangle me,
right here in my office.

219
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,429
Nice view, right?

220
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,139
Look at the sea.

221
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:26,102
You can drown me out there,
if you can make me sink.

222
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,354
- Look at this amazing view.
- [door slams shut]

223
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:32,358
[quirky music continues]

224
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,653
[music ends]

225
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,825
Is there something wrong, Nurse Gemma?

226
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,701
Hmm, nothing.

227
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,370
I wanted to ask.

228
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,247
Last time you said,

229
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,917
you heard someone walking
in the hallway around midnight.

230
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,585
Yeah.

231
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,838
I'm sure that wasn't any of us.

232
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,006
- Mm.
- It gave me goosebumps.

233
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,468
Did you also hear it?

234
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,595
If it wasn't a person,

235
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,473
that means it was just all in your head.

236
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,059
Don't butt in if you don't know anything.

237
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,727
[chuckles]

238
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,104
[breathes sharply]

239
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:16,360
Are you seriously asking
Cynthia about that, Nurse Gemma?

240
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,070
[Zelda scoffs]

241
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,824
Did you forget that she's sick?

242
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,409
Are you saying I'm lying?!

243
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,327
- Cynthia, stop.
- I know what I heard!

244
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,996
[Zelda scoffs]

245
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,707
Cynthia? Don't worry.

246
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,084
I understand what you're saying.

247
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,967
Are you implying that I'm a crazy liar?

248
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,389
[tense music playing]

249
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,725
Ma'am, we'll take you back to your room.

250
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,060
- [Zelda] Mm.
- Let's go, ma'am.

251
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,564
[tense music continues]

252
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,648
[Gemma sighs]

253
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,942
Are you okay?

254
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,652
Come on. Let's go inside.

255
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,905
[Gemma] Come with me.

256
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:05,618
- [plate clinking]
- [sniffling]

257
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,332
[plate clinking]

258
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:15,544
- [birds chirping]
- [waves lapping]

259
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,426
You're eating sour mango alone?

260
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,437
Where did you get hit this time?

261
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,234
On the cheek.

262
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,318
[chuckles softly]

263
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,654
You still have that habit, huh?

264
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,700
I just turn to food
to deal with the pain…

265
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,912
instead of taking it out on the patients.

266
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,876
Yeah, I remember you took
the calamansi from my dipping sauce

267
00:13:56,627 --> 00:14:00,381
because one of
the patients pulled your hair

268
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,383
when her husband didn't show up, right?

269
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,093
[chuckles softly]

270
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,220
Because of that,

271
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,139
you'd always bring me some calamansi.

272
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,892
I actually brought you a whole bag.

273
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:18,023
What, you think the patients here
are going to hurt me that much?

274
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,859
Not them.

275
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,948
But what I'm about to say might.

276
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,953
[waves lapping]

277
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,622
Gemma.

278
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,916
You're kind.

279
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,545
You deserve a love
that makes you complete and happy.

280
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:46,844
[sentimental music playing]

281
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,392

[sentimental music continues]

00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,648
[exhales sharply]

284
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,817
Is it because you like someone else?

285
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:06,572
[sentimental music continues]

286
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,869
Or is it because you and
Matmat are leaving again after a year?

287
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,914
I'm sorry, Gemma.

288
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,169
I'll understand if you get mad at me.

289
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:24,590
[sentimental music continues]

290
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,799

00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,393
[Gemma sniffles]

[sentimental music fades]

294
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,023
[birds chirping]

295
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,651
But we're still friends, right?

296
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,527
[chuckles softly]

297
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,155
If you're fine with that.

298
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:53,744
[tender music playing]

299
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,038
[chuckles softly] Gemma.

300
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,374
- [plate clinks]
- I'm done eating my mango.

301
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,210
You owe me five kilos, okay?

302
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,711
[chuckles]

303
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,338
[tender music fades]

304
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,881
[Patrick] I'll bring mangoes next time.

305
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,925
[foreboding music sting]

[offbeat music playing]

308
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,404
[Matmat] Doc Anok's bad.
He ruined the wall with the wrong paint.

309
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,574
Doc Anok's bad.

310
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,785
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

311
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:39,873
[offbeat music continues]

312
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,459
[offbeat music ends]

313
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,337
Are you stressed, Matmat?

314
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:53,929
Doc Anok's bad.
He ruined the wall with the wrong paint.

315
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:58,308
Would you like to have some fun instead?

316
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,687
Have… Have fun?

317
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,315
[offbeat music resumes]

318
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,361
You'll be able to paint better
if you have fun.

319
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,367
How will we have fun?

320
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,618
[chuckles quietly]

321
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,496
I have so many ideas.

322
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,625
[offbeat music continues]

323
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,837
[Matmat] Wow! Wow!

324
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,798
Nice car!

325
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,221
Is it yours, Miss Mia?

326
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,432
Was it expensive?

327
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,602
Expensive?

328
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,438
I guess you could say so.

329
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,150
How much does it cost?

330
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,487
You see…

331
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:58,535
Matmat wants to buy
his little brother, Patpat a car.

332
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,205
A car for me and Patpat.

333
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:07,336
Would you like to check out
some cars with me next time?

334
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,755
[chuckles]

335
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,965
Okay, it's a date.

336
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,468
Come on. Let's get in the car.

337
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,887
[unsettling music playing]

338
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,472
We're leaving?

339
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,224
We're going to have fun, aren't we?

340
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,311
Are we going somewhere far?

341
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,396
[Mia breathes deeply]

342
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,691
Matmat…

[ominous music playing]

344
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,322
[Mia] Trust me, Matmat.

345
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,700
You're going to have
fun where we're going.

00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,634
Okay.

350
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,177
Get in.

355
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,574
Hi, Doc.

356
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,909
Oh Patrick, why are you still here?

357
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,120
I thought you left with Matmat.

358
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,332
- He left already?
- Yes, with Miss Mia.

359
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,709
They didn't tell you?

360
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:33,797
[unsettling music plays]

361
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,174
Thanks, Doc.

00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,350
Wow!

364
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:50,230
[unsettling music continues]

365
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:04,369
[unsettling music continues]

366
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,749
Matmat has seen this gate

367
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:13,086
and this house before.

368
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,883
Do you like my house, Matmat?

369
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:23,263
[Matmat] Miss Mia's house is huge.

370
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,058
I know.

371
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,268
It's so huge,

372
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,812
but I'm the only one who lives in it.

373
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,316
[unsettling music continues]

374
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,277
No one lives here with you?

375
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,654
No one.

376
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,662
Why do you live alone?
Where are the others?

377
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,163
[Mia clicks tongue]

378
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,874
I don't live with my family anymore.

379
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,293
That's why I'm alone.

380
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,883
Would you like to live here, Matmat?

381
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,929
[giggles]

382
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,891
Matmat will live here with Miss Mia?

383
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,643
Why not?

384
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,688
The house is huge with so many rooms in it

385
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,606
and a massive dining table.

386
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,278
But Matmat and Patpat are living in--

387
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,487
And the best part?

388
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,074
I have a beautiful library.

389
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:28,078
[unsettling music continues]

390
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,748
Miss Mia has a lot of books?
Matmat likes books.

391
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,876
- Would you like to see it?
- Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

392
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,920
Let's go inside.

393
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:45,637
[suspenseful music stings]

394
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,514
[music fades]

395
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,853
[Matmat gasping in awe]

396
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,740
So, Matmat…

397
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,909
would you like to move in here?

398
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,246
[giggling]

399
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:16,418
Would that be okay, Miss Mia?
Can I really live here?

400
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,587
I offered, didn't I?

401
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,091
Well, if that's the case…

402
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,762
Here's a contract.

403
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,767
If you're going to live here,
you have to sign this.

404
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:40,442
We didn't sign a contract
when we moved in with Mama Li.

405
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,569
Why do I have to sign now, Miss Mia?

406
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,156
This is not just any other contract.

407
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,158
[mischievous music playing]

408
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,118
Aside from living here,

409
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,498
this is an agreement for you,

410
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:59,461
to be the illustrator of my next book.

411
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,799
[mischievous music continues]

412
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:08,095
[giggling]

413
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,013
You mean… [giggles]

414
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,892
Matmat will be your illustrator?

415
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,811
Yes, Matmat.

416
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:21,441
I'd love to hire you to draw for me.

417
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,904
- [giggling]
- [feet thudding]

418
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:29,116
If Matmat signs this,

419
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,410
he will create drawings
for Miss Mia's new book?

420
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,414
Only if you sign this.

421
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,166
[giggles]

422
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,547
[music turns unsettling]

423
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,392
"WORK CONTRACT:
THIS CONTRACT WAS SIGNED…"

424
00:23:55,475 --> 00:24:00,897
[unsettling music continues]

425
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,655
I think this calls for a celebration.

426
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,282
[unsettling music crescendos]

427
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,993
In this cursed palace…

428
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:17,247
send me a prince who
will rescue me from this place.

429
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,416
Do you honestly have no feelings for me?

430
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,168
This is all I can give you.

431
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,586
Because, honestly…

432
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,005
I wish I didn't save
you that day in the river.

433
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,674
Then you wouldn't be
living this messed up life.

434
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,426
This is Matmat's home now.

435
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,261
- Let's go.
- I'm not leaving!

436
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,054
I said you're not going to work for her!

437
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,557
Matmat will decide
for himself, not Patpat!
