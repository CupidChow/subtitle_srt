Patrick, where are you?
Matmat and I are at the shop.

- Wait. Your brother.
- I don't want.

189
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,762
Matmat, what's wrong?
What do you want?

190
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,681
- <i>Batchoy.</i>
- Please, give us <i>batchoy.</i>

191

195
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,071
- Eat up, Matmat.
- [Matmat] It's hot.

00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,823
Patrick, where are you?

197
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,533
I'm on my way home.

198
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,120
I finally have Mia's autograph.

199
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,331

205
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,427
Matmat is going home.

206
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,304
- Eat your <i>batchoy</i> first.
- Matmat is going home.

207
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,266
- Matmat, don't go!
- Going home! Going home!

208
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,642
- I'm going home!
- Matmat!

209

Where are you going?!

210
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,396
[Patrick] <i>Where's Matmat going?</i>

211
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,190
He's going to the market
to do some laundry.

212
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,818
<i>Obviously, he's going</i>
<i>home for that golden autograph!</i>

213

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,310
Damn it!

222
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,020
What's your problem?

223
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,438
I was asking nicely!

224
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,064
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
- Miss!

225
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,566
Can you hand this over, please?

226

You're going to dress up?

238
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:48,911
Matmat must look good. Miss Mia said,
"I'll be waiting for you, Matmat."

[Matmat chuckles excitedly]

240

[Jason] Hey, bro.

244
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,972
Miss me already?

245
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,765
Are you busy tomorrow?

<i>Um…</i>

Business as usual.

248
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,562
Why?

249
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,772
- Let me do that.
- Okay, sir.

250
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,859
Can you go with
Matmat to Mia's book signing?

251
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,236
<i>Why me? Why don't you go?</i>

252
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,781
I've got things to do for my new side gig.

00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,783
<i>Come on!</i>

254
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,452
You know, bro, just admit it.
Be honest with yourself.

255
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,580
You're avoiding the girl
who hurt you, aren't you?

00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,420

00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,927
Be honest, bro. Do you two have history?

262
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,846
[gasps] Was she your ex?

263
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,892
Please, bro. Just go with Matmat.

264
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,769
Hmm? Okay, fine!

265
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,521
I can't say no to you.

266
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,149
Just text me the time and place.

267
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,527
But before you hang up,
tell me who you like more.

268
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,070
Me or Matmat?

269
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,907
[Matmat] "I'll be
waiting for you, Matmat."

00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,253
Hello?

274
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,882
Jerk. How could you hang up on me?

275
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,093
- [Gemma] Jason!
- Yeah?

[enthralling music playing]

277
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,033
Eat up, okay? It's on the house.

278
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,577
Try the <i>pares. </i>It's my specialty.

279
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,622
- Give me two orders.
- No, let me pay.

280
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:00,459
Oh, come on, don't be a stranger.
It's on me.

281
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,461
You know I got you.

282
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,631
Want some <i>mami</i> too? I'll get you some!

283
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,008
Hey! No need! This is more than enough.

284
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:12,513
It's fine!
Just think of it as my farewell treat.

285
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,933
- Farewell?
- Tissue, please.

286
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,685
You're moving?

287
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,312
Yeah, because Patrick's moving again.

288
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,440
And wherever Patrick goes,
my business follows.

289
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,775
That's automatic.

290
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,611
Patrick's moving again?

291
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,822
[Jason] Hm?

292
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,907
There you go again.

293
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,909
You haven't changed.

294
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,662
Your eyes still light up
every time we talk about Patrick.

295
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,205
He's all you care about.

296
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,999
Oh, come on.

297
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,625
Am I wrong though?

298
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,211
You were like
that when you were both working

299
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,838
at Sta. Monica Hospital.

300
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,589
Back when we were living there.

301
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,426
Dig in. It's good.

302
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,599
Is Matmat still suffering from PTSD?

303
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,728
Yeah.

304
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,480
Where you guys moving to?

Well…

306
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,859
Patrick's still looking.

307
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,655
So he hasn't found a new hospital yet?

308
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:13,657
Do you know any?

[trolley rattling]

310
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,142
Stack them up properly.

311
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,270
Make sure they don't topple
over while the truck is moving.

and Aiah from the production company.

329

331

[Aiah] Good morning, Miss Mia.

332
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:54,836
About the movie adaptation of
<i>Happy, the Cheerful Dog,</i>

333
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,756
since this will be for
international streaming,

334
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,132
Hmm…

335
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,218
We're wondering if it would be possible

336
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:04,554
for Happy's story to run
longer than an hour and a half.

337
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,390
- Of course!
- No.

338
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,433
No?

339
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,314
What's Happy going
to do for an hour and a half?

340
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,651
Bark nonstop?

341
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,071
Maybe we could…

342
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:25,409
extend the adventures of Happy?

343
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,452
No.

344
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,831
No, Aiah! No, we can't!

345
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,875
If production insists
on changing the story,

346
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,128
I'll call my contact at ABS-CBN Films.

347
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,505
You wouldn't want-- Oh! It's Chris!

348
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,133
Chris! Hello, Chris!

349
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,676
How have you been?

350
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,762
Good, good! Uh, I'm with Mia.

Yes. We're actually
talking about that proposal…

- from ABS-CBN Films and--
- N-No, Sir Vincent! No!

353
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,275
Alright, we'll keep the movie
to an hour and a half.

That's my girl!

About the book signing at Lorenzo's,

358
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,745
I find that bookstore too tight and dark.

359
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,789
Find me a better venue
that has more light and space.

360
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,042
No! No! I understand, but the thing is--

361
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,668
Do it. It's your job.

362
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,921
And I expect everyone to do their job.

363
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,135
Especially when it's
direct orders from me. Right, Madeth?

364
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:31,433
[quirky music playing]

365
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,360
- [photos popping]
- You seriously aren't on social media?!

366
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,864
Who isn't on social media these days?

367
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,581
[line ringing]

368
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,083
Hi, Uncle.

369
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,128
Can I ask for your help?

370
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,213
Uh…

371
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,842
I need help running
a background check on someone.

372
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,969
Yes, Uncle.

373
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:13,058
I know it's not allowed
and a BI shouldn't be doing this but…

374
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,935
Uncle, you see…

375
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,230
my life is on the line.

376
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,859
- You see, my boss--

377
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,112
Hello?

378
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,781
Hello, Uncle?

379
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,699
Hello?

- [whimpers]
- [quirky music playing]

381
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,831
Please help me!

382
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,333
I still want to live!

383
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,503
[sobs]

384
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,923
Why is it so hard
to get your info, Patrick?!

385
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,008
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

386
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,510
Sorry, Gemma.

387
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:52,097
We haven't seen each other in so long
and this is all I can offer you.

388
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,974
Yeah, it's been a while.

389
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,686
Last time was at Sta. Monica,
three years and two months ago.

390
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,525
You didn't even last a year there,
while I stayed for two.

391
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,821
It was hell when you left.

392
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,366
I don't even know
how I lasted another year.

393
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,828
It's because you're a great nurse.

394
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:21,126
You're only saying that because you
were always with me during rounds.

395
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,335
Exactly.

396
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,589
I know how you work, and I also know…

397
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:29,634
you bring romance pocketbooks
to read during your breaks.

398
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,637
Fine.

399
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,514
That's so embarrassing.

400
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,811
But that's not the only thing you read,
You also read that one…

401
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,480
[sighs deeply, snaps fingers]

402
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,857
It's called "Patient Care."

403
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,654
You still remember that?

404
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,489
Tsk. Of course.

405
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,451
That's why I said you're a great nurse.

406
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,834
So, why are you here, anyway?

407
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,629
To see you.

408
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,422
[chuckles softly]

409
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:10,217
You traveled so far just to see me?

410
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,428
Really?

411
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,431
For work?

412
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,684
Yeah.

413
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,063
I just had to handle
something for one of our patients.

414
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:28,485
But let's not talk about my job,
let's talk about yours.

415
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,779
Why me?

416
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:35,575
Jason said you're leaving
but don't have a place to move to yet.

417
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,835
Would you…

418
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,213
consider staying at our place?

419
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:52,676
[unsettling music playing]

420
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,885
"Our place"?

421
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,304
Yes, our place.

422
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,639
In Maravida.

423
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,311
I messaged you about it before.

424
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,314
After I left Sta. Monica,

425
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,066
I transferred to OK Hospital, remember?

426
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,653
The salary is a bit smaller but…

427
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,862
it's fine.

428
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,447
I pay less for transportation.

429
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,326
Besides…

430
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,080
don't you miss…

431
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,166
our place?

- Matmat!
- The butterfly will return!

443
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,985
- The butterfly.
- Matmat, tell them!

444
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,654
What did your mother's killer look like?!

445
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,197
- Try to remember it!
- Butterfly.

446
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,992
We're wasting time asking your brother.

00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,745
Sir, I think their mom got mugged.

[officer 2] The victim
fought back so they killed her.

[officer 1] Let's just end it at that.

was killed by a butterfly.
