introduce me to your daughter.

I only have Gemma,

00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,721
can you even remember his name?

186
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,556
[quirky music playing]

187
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,225
[Gemma] Who are you again?

188
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,937
[Vincent] Please don't move too much!

189
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,022
- [Gemma giggling]
- Oh, we're here now.

190
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,191
Left or right?

191
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,902
- Right!
- Ri--

192
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,278
- [Vincent grunts]
- Right!

193
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,408
[Gemma] Right! Right! Right! Right--

194
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,784
[Vincent] We're going right!

195
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,411
[Gemma] Right?!

196
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,580
Are you stupid? That's left! [chuckling]

197
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,998
Didn't you go to grade school, bro?

198
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,917
The alcohol told me
this was the right way!

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,923
[quirky music continues]

200
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,262
- [sighs]
- [quirky music ends]

201
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,055
[Patrick] Matmat.

202
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,605
[grunts] Matmat?

203
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:17,236
How's my favorite brother?

204
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,447
- You stink, Patpat.
- [Patrick chuckles]

205
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,573
You stink.

206
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,033
You and Jason drank again.

207
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,035
Just a little.

208
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,831
- Since you're my favorite…
- [Matmat whimpers]

209
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:33,377
I'll treat you to your favorite…

210
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,840
W-what's Matmat's favorite?

211
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,093
Batchoy! [chuckling]

212
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,179
Mmh.

213
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:49,351
[stammers] No, that's not
Matmat's favorite, that's Patpat's.

214
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,562
Hmm, it's you!

215
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,272
- It's you.
- Huh?

216
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:57,067
That's why you always
ask me to go there, right?

217
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,987
Patpat's favorite is batchoy,

218
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:05,284
Matmat's is pancit molo.

219
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,204
- Hmm?
- "Matmat!

220
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,957
This is the best batchoy ever!

221
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,627
It smells really good!

222
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,047
The soup is super tasty!"

223
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:24,470
[pensive music playing]

224
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,680
[Tessie] It's here!

225
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,724
Eat up.

226
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,394
[young Matmat giggles]

227
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,231
Finish your bowl, okay?

228
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,524
[young Patrick] Matmat!

229
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,734
This is the best batchoy ever!

230
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,194
[pensive music continues]

231
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,445
[Tessie chuckles softly]

232
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,531
- Here's your bowl.
- It smells really good!

233
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,493
Your food is ready, dear.

234
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,287
What about you, Mama?

235
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,083
I'm still quite full.
You boys can go ahead.

236
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,460
- Eat it while it's still hot.
- [young Matmat] Mama.

237
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,504
- Yes, here's your food.
- Mama…

238
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,173
- Ah…
- It's hot.

239
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,925
Careful. Is it too hot?

240
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,134
Is it burning your mouth?

241
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,804
- Ah! It burns, Mama.
- Oh no, I'm sorry, dear.

242
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,847
That's good. Drink water.

243
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,599
- You want this?
- It still burns!

244
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,851
- Alright, let me cool it down.
- Thank you, Mama.

245
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,019
[pensive music continues]

246
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,437
[crying quietly, sniffling]

247
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,524
[Matmat] Mama always said

248
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:24,029
you loved going to Maravida's Original.

249
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,408
That's why we kept eating there.

250
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:32,913
- [pensive music continues]
- [sobbing]

251
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,081
Patpat?

252
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,709
A-Are you crying?

253
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,211
[pensive music continues]

254
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,671
Are you hungry?

255
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,299
Did Jason forget to save you dinner?

256
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,636
He could've at least
treated you to roasted chicken.

257
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,347
[sniffling]

258
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,892
- [Matmat] It's raining really hard.
- That's right, Matmat.

259
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,144
Let's hope you don't catch a cold.

260
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,355
- Matmat's all wet now.
- Oh, my son is drenched.

261
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,357
Mama will bring you boys home soon.

262
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,943
- [pensive music continues]
- [rain pattering]

263
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,236
Patpat!

264
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,405
Hurry up and join us, dear!

265
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,699
Come here!

266
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,078
- You should've stayed close.
- Patpat! Patpat!

267
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,830
Look at you. All wet and everything.

268
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,083
Stay close so
you won't get soaked even more.

269

- [crying continues]
- [pensive music continues]

My sweet child.

[pensive music continues]

273
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,469
I'm so lucky to have
a son like you Patpat.

274
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,021
I'm sorry.

275
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,899
[pensive music continues]

276
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,611
I'm sorry I lean on you so much.

277

[sighs]

278
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,995
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

279

[pensive music continues]

280
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,422
I love you so much.

[Matmat] Patpat…

285
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,997
Stop crying over batchoy.

286
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,127
Matmat is here.

287
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,963
Your brother is here for you.

[pensive music continues]

289
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,633
I'm always here for you.

[crying, sniffling]

291
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:36,305
Shh, shh.

[music fades]

294
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,111
Beautifully ugly.

295
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,364
I love it.

296
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:58,827
[chuckles softly]

297
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,544
You were useless anyway.

[indistinct background chatter]

304
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,657
Samuel's case…

305
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,201
A patient suffering from
both dementia and cancer.

306
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,079
Nothing unusual,

307
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,415
but I find it quite intriguing.

308
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,418
Eden.

309
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,920
All I'm saying is,

310
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,714
I know his medical records inside and out,

311
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,468
including his records from Divine Light.

312
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:01,682
Perhaps you know
something I haven't noticed yet.

313
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,895
[Olivia] What exactly are
you trying to find out, Eden?

314
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,149
[indistinct background chatter continues]

- [alcohol sloshing]
- [unsettling music playing]

317
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,614
Why OK Hospital?

318
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:22,411
Maravida General offers great benefits.

319
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,955
Not to mention, it has a psychiatric unit.

320
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,878
The experience I've
gained working under Dr. Anok…

321
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,212
[unsettling music continues]

322
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,797
I want more of that.

323
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,385
He's exactly why
I want to become the manager because

324
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,596
I want to be a leader like him.

325
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,640
Of course, the pay raise matters too.

326
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,393
After all,
I'm putting my child through school.

327
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:52,107
[unsettling music continues]

328
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,234
Husband?

329
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,819
Boyfriend?

330
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,699
Someone I care about…

331
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,744
[alcohol sloshing]

332
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,581
…That's what I have.

333
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:12,336
[unsettling music continues]

334
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,503
You?

335
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,089
Do you have a husband?

336
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,382
Where is he?

337
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,595
I left him.

338
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,808
I left him to die.

339
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:32,397

340

- [both laughing]
- [unsettling music continues]

341
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,206
After tonight,

342
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:53,877
we can go back
to our professional competition.

343
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,505
At least now, we can say…

344
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,509
we know each other better.

345
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,636
Right?

346
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,054
- Right.
- Mmm.

Mia?

What are you doing here?

358
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,553
I have a class.

Weren't you informed…

361
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,226
your class was canceled?

362
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,729
Well,

363
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,607
actually it's been suspended
until Dr. Anok assesses everything.

367
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,118
Don't force yourself into something
that was never meant for you.

368
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,788
And who are you
to say what's meant for me?

369
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,457
Mia.

370
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,125
[tense music continues]

371
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,502
[footsteps receding]

372
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:27,471
[tense music continues]

373
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,892
[tense music crescendos]

374
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,435
Where is Dr. Anok?!

375
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,811
I got suspended,

376
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,064
and no one even bothered to tell me.

377
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,275
You're not my daughter.
It's all confusing to me.

378
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,735
I like that.

379
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,820
I've been tied down
to this place for so long

380
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,073
that freedom feels impossible now.

381
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,325
Her blood runs through your veins.

382
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,951
There's no running away from it.

383
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,912
I am my mother's daughter.

384
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,414
But she doesn't control my life.
