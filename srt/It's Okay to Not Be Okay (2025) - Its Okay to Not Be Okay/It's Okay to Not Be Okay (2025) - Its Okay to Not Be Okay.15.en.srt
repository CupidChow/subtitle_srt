00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,919
I said "I love you" to him.

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,796
But he acted like he didn't hear anything.

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,173
I'm sure that Mia told you she likes you,

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,384
or that she even loves you.

5
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,136
But don't believe her.

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,680
She just says those
things without thinking, okay?

7
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:18,143
Someone once told me
no one would ever love me.

8
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,811
I love you, Patrick.

9
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,273
I love you!

10
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,858
You shouldn't have
brought him into this world at all!

11
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,025
What did you say?!

12
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,863
You shouldn't have had a child
if you were only going use him.

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,412
You shouldn't be in here.

14
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,622
The paint might spill on you

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,875
and you'll disturb my work…

I think I should get my eyes checked.

19

I still don't see a painting.

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,614

[unsettling music fades]

39
00:02:56,342 --> 00:03:00,889
He can't get away with this
just because he's a congressman!

40
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,520
Doc, did you hear me?

41
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,273
Yes, Eden. Loud and clear.

42
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,194
Thank you for your concern about Patrick.

43
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,031
He's my employee of course I need to.

44
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:22,035
I want to file a complaint
against the Congressman.

45
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,078
But he'll probably just bury it

46
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,622
or turn it against us

47
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,333
because of our lapses in his son's case.

48
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,336

Have you started painting?

55
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,028
Not yet.

00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,446

60
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,545
You don't have class today?

61
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,923
Why are you here?

62
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,843
Because I'm here for someone.

For someone?

64
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,973
Stop beating around the bush.

- Stop using Matmat--
- Am I bothering you, Gemma?

Fine.

Is that really how you are?
You should've fought back!

00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,157
I don't want that.

189
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,618
You don't? Alright, I'll put it away.

190
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,995
[whimpering]

191
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,416
Patrick is waiting for you outside.

192
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,293
[whimpering]

193
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,549
You have to go.
We're going to clean this place.

194
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,010
You'll get wet and dirty
if you stay down there. Come on.

195
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,179
Your bag will also get dirty.

196
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,557
- [Matmat whimpering]
- Your bag will get dirty.

197
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,599
Give it to me!

198
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,143
[yelps]

199
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,227
[groans]

200
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,069
Um…

201
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:21,657
Matmat, do you want
to talk about what happened?

202
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:30,416
[tender music playing]

203
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:39,967
[music turns somber]

204
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,135
[huffs]

205
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,901
[wheelchair rattling]

206
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:02,823
[somber music continues]

207
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:16,587
[somber music continues]

208
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,592
Hello.

209
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,802
[music fades]

210
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:30,726
Do you remember me, my dear father?

211
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,730
Mia, just a reminder.

212
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,108
Your father is still
recovering from his surgery.

213
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,536
Maybe you'll remember my voice instead.

214
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,832
What did I use to call you?

215
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,960
Daddy?

216
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,254
[scoffs]

217
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,007
Do you remember me, Daddy?

218
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,427
[somber music playing]

219
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,931
Do you remember me now, Daddy?

220
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:15,396
[somber music continues]

221
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,480
You…

222
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:26,532
[somber music continues]

223
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,581
Sir Samuel, do you remember her now?

224
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:38,085
[morose music continues]

225
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,045
You…

226
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,425
Why are you still alive?

227
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,471
That's the reaction I know.

228
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:51,932
You should've been dead!

229
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,727
- [Gemma] Sir Samuel! Sir Samuel, stop.
- [music turns ominous]

230
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,937
Sir Samuel--Sir Samuel!

231
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,814
[grunting, breathing heavily]

232
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,191
Sir Samuel! Sir Samuel, stop it!

233
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,027
[body thuds]

234
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,863
- [groans]
- You shouldn't have…

235
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,866
[ominous music continues]

236
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,284
- [young Mia wailing]
- [Gemma] Sir Samuel!

237
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,161
Mia, please die!

238
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,245
[wailing]

239
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,456
- Sir Samuel, that's enough.
- [Samuel] I want you dead!

240
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,042
[Gemma] Help! Sir Samuel, that's enough!

241
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,419
- Sir Samuel!
- Sir Samuel!

242
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,712
- Sir Samuel!
- [grunts]

243
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,173
You should've been dead!

244
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,426
- [coughing]
- You should've been dead!

245
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:31,472
- [laughing]
- [sobbing]

246
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,224
- You should've been dead!
- [eerie music playing]

247
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:39,855
- [sobbing]
- [laughing hysterically]

248
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,358
[Samuel sobbing] You should've been dead.

249
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,779
[eerie music continues]

250
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,576
[Samuel sobbing] You should've been dead.

251
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,662
[coughing, laughing]

252
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,705
[screams] You should've been dead!

253
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,124
[laughing hysterically]

254
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,420
[eerie music continues]

255
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,006
- [Bella] No, they said--
- [Kai] Oh, there she is.

256
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,883
- Oh, there! Miss Mia!
- Miss!

257
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,259
Miss Mia!

258
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,763
I was just going to ask
about our next class discussion

259
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:16,433
so I can study
and read up on it right away…

260
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,562
- Miss Mia?
- She's in a rush. Where is she going?

261
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,315
Kai, I think she's mad at me.

262
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,404
[dark suspenseful music playing]

263
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,490
[woman] You deserve what happened to you.

264
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,285
You shouldn't have come here.

265
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,247
Don't ever come back.

266
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,791
[dark suspenseful music crescendos]

267
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,002
[Anok] Huh?

268
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,213
Samuel strangled Mia?

269
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,758
May it be intentional or not,

270
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,844
that's what he did to her.

271
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,138
What did Mia do afterwards?

272
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,724
Doc, she just laughed.

273
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:01,520
I'm not sure whether
she thought what happened to her was funny

274
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,856
or if she just tried to laugh it off.

275
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,609
Oh, well.

276
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,320
Doc…

277
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,741
Mia doesn't really
seem worried about her father.

278
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,952
She doesn't care if he is in pain

279
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,496
- or why he did that to her.
- Hmm…

280
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,874
[inhales deeply]

281
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:22,958
Uh…

282
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,378
We'll never really know

283
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,298
unless we talk to Mia.

284
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,550
Uh…

285
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:35,429
Can you tell Doc Emman
to update me on Samuel?

286
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:39,391
And ask one of the nurses to call Mia.

287
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,018
I want to talk to her.

288
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,187
- Okay, doc.
- Thank you, Eden.

289
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,073
[creaks]

290
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:08,003
[pensive music playing]

291
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,186
[pensive music continues]

292
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,188
[Anok] Does your daughter
share the same condition as you,

293
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,314
Ingrid?

294
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,070
[pensive music fades]

295
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,364
Patrick.

296
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,157
Miss Li.

297
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,743
Looks like we're going to have
a lengthy conversation.

298
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,745
I'll take Matmat home.

299
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,748
It's okay, Miss Li. I'll wait for him.

300
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,667
He'll come out once he's feeling better.

301
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,586
It's fine. I'll take Matmat home.

302
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,589
- Miss Li, I can't just--
- It's okay.

303
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,175
Get some sleep and eat.

304
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,513
Take care of yourself and
whatever else that you need.

305
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,891
Gossip spreads like wildfire.
It's already reached the kitchen.

306
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:04,768
Here.

307
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,396
Go on.

308
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,733
- Thank you, Miss Li.
- Here.

309
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,280
Don't bother cooking.
We'll have dinner at my house.

310
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,699
- Okay.
- Alright.

311
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,411
[birds chirping]

312
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,838

313
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,313
[engine rumbling]

314
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:04,620
[tender music playing]

315
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:39,029
[tender music continues]

316
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:06,390
[tender music continues]

317
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,245
[tender music fades]

318
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,498
Mia can be a handful,
especially when you're near her.

319
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,292
I don't want you around my brother.

320
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,835
Why? Are you jealous?

321
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,545
We'll go out.

322
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,963
We'll have fun, right?

323
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,674
Liar! Patpat's a liar!

324
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,677
Mia doesn't really
seem worried about her father.

325
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,637
So, he's capable of hurting other people?

326
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,140
Enough of this! You don't own me.

327
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,308
You're so confusing!

328
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,560
You're driving me crazy!

329
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,687
Everyone has emotions.

330
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,690
We should let people know how we feel.

331
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:02,821
[sentimental music playing]
