I'll drive this car off the cliff.

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,504
- What?
- We're going to die together.

3
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:05,714
Mia, stop the car.

4
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,549
Mia!

5
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,050
You're not making any sense.

6
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,720
You asked me to run away,
but you can't even stay long?

7
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,638
You deserved that.

8
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,265
How about a trip to Montanesa?

9
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,808
Just a day trip, you and me.

10
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,103
You never told me
you were a pressure cooker.

11
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,354
You know how to soften me up.

12
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,522
I could say the same.

13
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,815
You're changing me for the better.

14
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:28,111
Why I couldn't control my
anger when I saw you were hurt.

15
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,238
- Is that a bad thing?
- Isn't it?

16
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,407
For me, you were amazing.

17
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,243
He's letting down his guard.

18
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,037
I'll go to bed now. See you tomorrow.

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,329
- Good night.
- Good night.

Matmat, join me for some snacks?

What are those?

26
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,773
I bought some rice cakes.

27
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,858
I got bored, so I went for a walk.

28
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,402
Matmat wants those rice cakes.

29
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,491
But where, where's Mia?

30
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,328
She's probably in her room. What's up?

31
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:05,125
Matmat wants to… to wait for Mia.

32
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,503
He wants them to eat together.

33
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,798
Why do you want to eat with her?

34
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,633
Because…

35
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,762

You know, bestie?

"Bestie"?

40
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,111
It's the same as "best friend," right?

41
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,779
Right.

42
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,031
We're best friends.

That's good.

46

Matmat, don't forget
your session with Dr. Anok tomorrow.

47
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,009
O-Okay.

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,472
And when you're done,
is it okay if you stay with Jason?

49
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,768
At his house or the restaurant?

50
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,898
At his house. Stay the night with him.

She won't be around, Matmat.

00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,135
She's got stuff to do, too.

60
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:45,099
Are you going to see
a patient in Montanesa?

61
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,103
Not exactly.

62
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,942

Oh yes, doc.

90

I decided to bring him out here myself,

91
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,281
so he'd get used to me.

Yes, doc.

I was hoping to see
how you're doing, Samuel.

You're not attending
your daughter's classes.

Would you like to spend
some time alone with her?

[chuckles awkwardly] Just because.
I mean, she's your daughter.

[solemn music playing]

You can tell me anything, Patrick.

184
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,503
What's on your mind?

185
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,424
Why do some people
dress in an unusual way?

186
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,470
Even when it doesn't suit the occasion?

187
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,390
A little more extravagant,
colorful, unique.

188
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,976
Weird.

189
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:48,522
Well, for some people,
it's a form of expression.

190
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,025
For others,

191
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,071
it's a way to protect themselves.

[tense music playing]

193
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,033
They want the focus on their outfit,

194
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,827
so no one sees what's hidden beneath.

195
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,830
To conceal what
they're really feeling inside.

196
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,627
So, Patrick, you have to protect Mia.

197
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,670
What?

198
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,004
[chuckles softly]

199
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,673
You asked that question because of Mia.

200

She's the only one
we know with a unique fashion sense.

203
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,977
As time goes by, I'm starting to think

204
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,647
Mia might be similar to her mom.

205
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,357
[tense music fades]

206
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:36,404
That she might have
antisocial personality disorder like her.

207

Ingrid was diagnosed with that.

209
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,785
Mia's mother was your former patient?

Yes.

211
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,622
Do you think…

212
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,959
Mia could possibly
inherit her mother's illness?

213

[unsettling music continues]

214
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,505
I wasn't able to assess her,
so I can't diagnose.

215

I can't say anything yet, but

216
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,137
if that happens and
Mia develops the condition,

217
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,472
you'll need to protect her.

218
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,851
Protect her from what?

Yes.

a lucid state of mind, Patrick.

I was able to talk to him clearly.

Do you believe
Mia's mother is still alive?

That it's possible, she could return?

262

I'm open to the possibility.

back for her husband and child,

None… Patpat doesn't like any girl.
