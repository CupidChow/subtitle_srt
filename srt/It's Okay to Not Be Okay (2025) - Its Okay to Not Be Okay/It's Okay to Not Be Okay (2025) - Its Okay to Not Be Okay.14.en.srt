00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,216
is my mom.

their children for two reasons.

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,102
[Vincent] "But how?"

184
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,937
That's the question.

185
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,689
If she won't listen to me…

186
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,401
maybe I should just drag her back.

187
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,611
[Gemma] I have to work harder.

188
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,324
I'll focus on Patrick, and not her.

189
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,618
That's it.

190
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,329
I won't be afraid anymore.

191
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,789
I have to fight.

192
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,707
Yes, that's it.

193
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,626
I won't give up.

194
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,379
I won't stop.

195
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,048
But how will I do it?

196
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,677
People say that you
shouldn't act based on looks.

197
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:04,181
But I'm not as pretty as her,
I'm just ordinary.

198
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:08,853
[quirky music continues]

199
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,813
Stop it, Gemma Lyn Marie.

200
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,108
It's like you're admitting
that woman is better than you.

201
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,611
No way. That woman is not better than me.

202
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,490
Besides, being
the best isn't just about looks.

203
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,201
[quirky music continues]

204
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,663
I mean, people say that I'm kind.

205
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:32,126
So, I'm kind and I have ordinary looks.

206
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,712
Is that enough?

207
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:43,262
- [quirky music continues]
- [cutlery clinking]

208
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,358
[quirky music ends]

209
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,111
[birds chirping]

210
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,070
Eden!

211
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,991
Doc Emman.

212
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,534
Have you seen Eden?

213
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,369
No, I haven't, Nurse Olivia.

214
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,871
Oh, okay.

215
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,083
Pogi, where's Eden?

216
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,002
She's… She's in the lobby.

217
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,003
Call her.

218
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,589
She has to know this. It's an emergency.

219
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,716
An emergency? Okay.

220
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,717
[line ringing]

221
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,511
[Pogi] Hello, ma'am?

222
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,179
Ma'am Olivia is looking for you.

223
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,182
Eden, where are you?

224
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,518
Come here now. Hurry.

225
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:36,941
[unsettling music playing]

226
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,319
Good morning, Congressman.

227
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,863
Do you have an appointment today?

228
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,533
[unsettling music continues]

229
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,617
[Olivia breathes sharply]

230
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,621
This doesn't look good.

231
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,416
Uh… Cong. Martinez,
it's nice seeing you here.

232
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,920
If you'd let me, I can
explain what happened to your son.

233
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,838
- Please keep distance.
- Mrs. Martinez.

234
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,217
Mrs-- Wait. Wait. Hold on.

235
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,970
[unsettling music crescendos]

236
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,680
Doc Anok.

237
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:11,225
[phone buzzing]

238
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,644
There. [chuckles]

239
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:18,023
So Tommy, I think you know
what happens next. [chuckles]

240
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,734
[door slams open]

241
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,738
[foreboding music playing]

242
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,657
Playing during shift?

243
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,743
The hospital staff here
really are irresponsible.

244
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,123
Good morning, Congressman Martinez.

245
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,500
Uh… Ma'am, good morning.

246
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,668
Have a seat.

247
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,882
[Eden] Oh. Excuse me.

248
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,844
This is between
the director and Cong. Martinez,

249
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,221
so can you please leave?

250
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,851
[sighs] Mister Tommy, let's go.

251
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,185
Uh…

252
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,898
Congressman, I'm ready
to listen to whatever you have to say.

253
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:05,863
[foreboding music continues]

254
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:09,074
Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!

255
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,117
Shh.

256
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,953
Does Junjun need
assistance going to the restroom?

257
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,371
No.

258
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,540
You're the one who will need assistance.

259
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,710
I suggest you call
everyone you know for help…

260
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,086
[panting]

261
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,172
and pray to all the saints in heaven.

262
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,258
What are you talking about?

263
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,846
Am I going to lose my job?

264
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,391
It's possible.

265
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:38,646
[foreboding music continues]

266
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,774
You know that my
son is not in his right mind.

267
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,109
That he would
suddenly take off his clothes

268
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,154
and waste all my money
just to get attention.

269
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,073
That's why I had him admitted here.

270
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,616
And then this happens?!

271
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,993
What if I have this hospital closed down?

272
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:57,164
We follow a certain
process in cases like this.

273
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,416
I don't care what process you have.

274
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,419
Bring me the staff member
who let my son out.

275
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,590
[foreboding music continues, ends]

276
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,467
- [tapping]
- [Patty] Okay, okay.

277
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,551
Alright.

278
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,305
Nurse Gemma,
Ma'am Eden told me to call Mia here

279
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,724
so she can explain
things to Cong. Martinez.

280
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,892
I'll call her.

281
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:20,896
No need.

282
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,316
Patrick, Ma'am Eden is right.

283
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,320
Mia was the one who was with Junjun,
so she needs to be here.

284
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,571
I'll talk to him myself.

285
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,448
I was also with Junjun
so I can explain everything.

286
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,617
- But Patrick--
- Gemma.

287
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,868
I mean it.

288
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,413
Don't call Mia. I'll handle it.

289
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,582
[phone receiver clacks]

290
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,011
Just tell me and I'll face them myself.

291
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,888
I got this, Nurse Eden.

292
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,682
Okay.

293
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,896
Why are you alone?

294
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,607
Where is that meddlesome woman?

295
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,276
We want her here.

296
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,195
She doesn't need to be here.
It's not her fault.

297
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,947
What do you mean it's not her fault?

298
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,615
She was the one driving the car.

299
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,786
Your son wanted to go there.
No one forced him.

300
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:22,833
We had Junjun admitted here
because he's not in his right mind,

301
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,544
and you let him do what he wants?

302
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:29,757
Uh… If I may,
Congressman and Mrs. Martinez…

303
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,719
The incident might
have tarnished your image,

304
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,847
but it helped Junjun a lot.

305
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,600
It had a positive effect on him.

306
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:43,312
In fact, you can take
him home after a few days.

307
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,605
Take him home?

308
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,774
[chuckles]

309
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,400
Have you lost your mind, too?

310
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,569
Who would take care of him

311
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,112
if we take him out of this place?

312
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,282
Congressman, aren't you his family?

313
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,827
This hospital is useless.

314
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,497
Go ahead!

315
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,040
Discharge Junjun!

316
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,502
There are other mental
hospitals here in the Philippines!

317
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,797
Even if he gets discharged
from this mental hospital

318
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,341
I'll just transfer him to a new one.

319
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,884
- But, Congressman…
- [somber music playing]

320
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,221
once a patient has recovered,
we let their family take them home.

321
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,140
Why would I take him home?

322
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,225
He's useless!

323
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,227
Ever since he was young,
he's been good for nothing!

324
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,020
Good for nothing?

325
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,524
Are children only required
to be useful to their parents?

326
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,152
Have you ever been a parent?

327
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:36,198
[somber music continues]

328
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,075
Do you know how it feels

329
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,911
to give birth to and take care of someone

330
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,497
who does nothing but use you up?

331
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,751
How can you say that?

332
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,920
You're a parent, too.

333
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:54,007
Our parents brought us into this world

334
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,926
because they need us.

335
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,512
Why don't you ask your parents?

336
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,765
Ask them whether
they would've still given you life

337
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,642
had you been of no use to them.

338
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,644
Then you shouldn't have
brought him into this world at all!

339
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,604
What did you just say?

340
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,982
You shouldn't have had a child
if you were only going

341
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,650
to use him for your own benefit!

342
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,402
[slaps]

343
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,486
Patrick.

344
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,948
You're just an employee!

345
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,909
Know your place and act accordingly!

346
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:26,748

[Matmat] New… new painting.

New s.. supplies.

352
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,486
My painting should look good

353
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,865
so Doc Anok will give me good pay.

354
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:05,746
[Cong. Martinez] Our parents brought us
into this world because they need us.

355
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,623
[Patrick] Then you shouldn't
have brought him into this world at all!

356
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,832
[Cong. Martinez] What did you just say?

357
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,293
[Patrick] You shouldn't have had a child
if you're only going to use him

358
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,086
- [objects thud]
- for your own benefit!

00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,139
[somber music continues]

363
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:28,894
[Matmat] Patpat, you've been
staring at the mirror for a long time.

364
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,146
Uh…

365
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,190
I was just checking if it's dirty.

366
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,323
If it's dirty, you have to clean it

367
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:45,118
because you work at a hospital.

368
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,792
[somber music fades]

369
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:59,758
[sinister music playing]

370
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,301
[fan whirring]

371
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,184
- [sinister music ends]
- [engine humming]

372
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,644
[Li] Let's ride this jeepney.

373
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,440
[grunts]

374
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,567
Oh my.

375
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,653
- [coins clinking]
- Okay.

376
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:23,115
This is Matmat's payment for the ride.

377
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,075
No need, dear. It's on me.

378
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,035
I'll pay for you.

379
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,120
Hand this over.

380
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:29,788
Go ahead.

381
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,416
- T-Thank you.
- You're welcome.

382
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,251
Here's the payment

383
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,837
for two people going to Dagat-dagatan,

384
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,299
one person with disability and…

385
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,885
one Mama Li.

386
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,554
Alright.

387
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,432
[indistinct chatter]

388
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,768
Are you used to taking
public transportation alone?

389
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,395
Patrick doesn't accompany you anymore?

390
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,690
Matmat can do it alone

391
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:00,861
once he has memorized the route.

392
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:07,784
But Matmat and
Patpat have to practice first

393
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,537
when they're in a new place.

394
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,789
Oh…

395
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:17,294
Now, Miss Li will help you practice.

396
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,379
When we get to the hospital,

397
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,048
I'll have to go straight to the kitchen.

398
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,174
Can you manage?

399
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,762
Matmat can manage

400
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:31,141
because he has
memorized his way around OK Hospital.

401
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,185
Hmm.

402
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,937
Very good Matmat!

403
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:36,855
[chuckles softly]

404
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,316
Matmat is very good.

405
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,317
Mm-hmm.

406
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,948
[light-hearted music playing]

407
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,243
- [waves crashing]
- [birds squawking]

408
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:54,247
[light-hearted music continues]

409
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,332
[camera shutter clicks]

410
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,211
[camera shutter clicks]

411
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,756
[camera shutter clicks]

412
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:13,975
[light-hearted music continues]

413
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,523
[camera shutter clicks]

414
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,318
[camera shutter clicks]

415
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,695
[camera shutter clicks]

416
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,614
[camera shutter clicks]

417
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,783
[camera shutter clicks]

418
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:34,079
[geese cackling]

419
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,289
- [chuckles softly]
- [camera shutter clicks]

420
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,457
[gushes]

421
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,542
[chuckles softly]

422
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:43,004
[light-hearted music continues]

423
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,798
[chuckles softly] Bye-bye.

424
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:56,059
[light-hearted music continues]

425
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,654
[light-hearted music fades]

426
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,949
[Zelda] Matmat.

427
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,118
What are you doing?

428
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,621
I'm taking pictures.

429
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,707
Pictures…

430
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,296
that I can use as
a reference for my painting

431
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,755
to make it pretty.

432
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,591
Pretty?

433
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,926
Well then, you can also include me.

434
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,429
[Zelda chuckles] Take a picture of me.

435
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,639
Patpat, come on!

436
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,350
Do I look pretty?

437
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:46,193
- [butterfly fluttering]
- [chuckles]

438
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,402
Am I pretty?

439
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,075
- No!
- Huh?

440
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,869
No! I don't like you!

441
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,580
- What do you mean?
- I don't like you! [whimpers]

442
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,998
Are you saying I'm ugly?

443
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,169
Everyone has an excuse.

444
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,591
[sighs deeply]

445
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:16,139
[stirring music crescendos]

446
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:19,768
[Matmat] Hmm.

447
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,937
This is a pretty flower.

448
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,107
I should also paint one here

449
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:30,070
so it will be pretty
both outside and inside.

450
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:35,158
- Hmm. This one's pretty, too.
- [footsteps approaching]

451
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,160
[unsettling music playing]

452
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,162
[chuckles softly]

453
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,166
You shouldn't be in here.

454
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,379
The paint might spill on you.
And you might disturb my work--

455
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:56,429
[unsettling music intensifies]

456
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,392
[ominous music sting]

457
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,851
Hello, Matmat. Where are you?

458
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,561
Finally, we meet.

459
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,855
Leave me and my brother alone.

460
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,692
If you're mad at me,
leave your sibling out of it.

461
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,443
Why are you even mad?

462
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,445
Go ahead and tell me how you feel.

463
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,863
Don't make this about me.

464
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,699
No. This is about you!

465
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,826
Maybe my voice will help you remember.

466
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,371
Do you remember me, Daddy?

467
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:27,252
- You…
- [unsettling music playing]
