I envy you.

187
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,644
You envy me?

188
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,189
I'm jealous.

189

191
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,369
It doesn't even taste good.

192
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,455
But you finished it.

193
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,251
For someone who eats for free,
you complain too much.

194
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,420
Excuse me.

195
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,340
Hmm?

196
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,760
Madeth, have you done
what I asked you to do for Mia?

197
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,179
Yes, Boss V. It's ready. All done.

198
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,474
Okay, so everything is set.
All we have to do is wait for tomorrow.

199
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,686
Yeah, wait.

200
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,688
Wait again!

201
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,189
We're always waiting.

202
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,941
Waiting for Miss Mia.

203
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,111
Waiting for her to show up,
waiting for her to be okay,

204
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,280
waiting for her mood swings to pass.

205
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,656
Always just waiting.

206
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,824
Hey, Madeth.

207
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,534
What, Boss V.?

208
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,703
I'm just saying the truth.

209
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:17,166
Are we really just waiting
for Miss Mia to write again?

210
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,002
Waiting for her to create another story.

211
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:26,425
Madeth, Mia is rare. She's one of a kind.

212
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,094
So, we need to wait for her.

213
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,472
Wait on her own time.

214
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,392
Boss V, it's not
that I'm complaining, but…

215
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,353
[quizzical music playing]

216
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,229
…is that really it?

217
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:44,276
We'll just wait for her?
We can't even tell her to hurry a little?

218
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:51,408
Hmm. Right? Because Boss V,
how long will you keep--

219
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,534
Just leave it there.

220
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,955
How long will
you keep waiting for something

221
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,333
or for someone when there's no certainty

222
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,503
if they'll ever be ready for you?

223
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,214
[quizzical music continues]

224
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,883
Patience is not about waiting, Madeth.

225
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,803
It's about how you're waiting,

226
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,222
and who you waiting for.

227
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,018
Because, you'll feel it.

228
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,856
You'll feel if
someone is worth waiting for.

229
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,234
Right?

230
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,612
So meaningful.

231
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,531
That's so profound, Boss V.

232
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,866
So deep of you, Boss V.

233
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,618
I thought it was only one year.

234
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,745
One year?

235
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,331
That's all you can wait? Just one year?

236
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,041
[music turns light-hearted]

237
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,251
Why?

238
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,629
Wasn't Miss Mia given one
year to finish her latest book?

239
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,007
That's what we're talking about.

240
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,508
Or did you change the topic?

241
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,428
- Oh! [chuckles] Yes, yes, yes.
- [light-hearted music fades]

242
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,388
That one.

243
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:59,018
I thought we were
talking about our love lives.

244
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,811
Oh.

245
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:07,860
Well, if it's about love life,
I've already given up.

246
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,529
I'm done with my waiting era.

247
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,615
If I want something,
I go for it right away!

248
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,411
If it's not available, I won't wait.

249
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,664
How come?

250
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,668
- Well, Boss V, it's a sign.
- [gentle music playing]

251
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,046
Sign that it's not meant to be.

252
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,965
Remember that famous book quote?

253
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:34,595
"If you want something, the universe
conspires to help you get it."

254
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,055
See?

255
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,601
If you've already done everything you can,
and you still have to wait,

256
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,437
then it means it's
really not meant for you.

257
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,688
Simple.

258
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,899
[Gemma groans]

- Mia!
- [thud]

263
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,620
Just let me do it once.

264
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,664
Do what?

265
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,752
Slap you.

266
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,462
[quirky music playing]

267
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:13,717
I should slap you twice
so it'll have more impact.

268
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,469
So we can get even.

269
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,179
[Mia chuckles dryly]

270
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:22,976
So we're entering
Gemma's violent era now, huh?

271
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,978
- Hey.
- [Mia chuckles]

272
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,564
You deserve that slap.

273
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:32,152
Because you're
the biggest thorn in my side.

274
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,904
Do you know that?

275
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,239
You!

276
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,533
[quirky music continues]

277
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,409
You bullied me when we were kids.

278
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,536
No, I didn't.

279
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,455
Yes, you did.

280
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,790
Yes, Mia.

281
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,793
You locked me in the restroom.

282
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,796
I only did that
because you're so-called friends

283
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,173
were apparently
going to pull a prank on you.

284
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,884
[quirky music continues]

285
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,219
That's not true.

286
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,345
Fine.

287
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,765
[sighs] Don't believe me.

288
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,604
You were the reason
my friends avoided me.

289
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,984
They were scared
that you'd bully them too.

290
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,613
You're also the reason

291
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:22,494
that the boy I like
didn't end up with me.

292
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:32,421
You're the worst and
most evil of all villains.

293
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,131
It's you, Mia!

So, come on, Mia.

297
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,432
Just let me slap you once.

- [Mia chuckles]
- Mia…

299
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,019
Just once.

300
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,229
Ah!

301
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,398

You know what?

You're cute.

305
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,702
You're cute when you're angry.

306
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,163
I'm cute?

307
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,458
I know I'm cute.

309
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,295
Unfortunately,

310
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,131
the boy I like doesn't like cute girls.

[Gemma sighs]

312
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:23,013
