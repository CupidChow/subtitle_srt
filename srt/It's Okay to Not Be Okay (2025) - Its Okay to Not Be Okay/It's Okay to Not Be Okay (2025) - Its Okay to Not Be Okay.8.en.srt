1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,169
[Gemma] Welcome back to Maravida!

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,421
[Patrick] Are you okay being back here?

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,005
I-I'm okay.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,800
[Patrick] I decided
it's time to come back, Ma.

5
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:13,763
Maybe being here will help Matmat
face his fear of butterflies.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,223
It's hard, Mama.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,434
But we have to face it.

8
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,228
I have to face this.

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,648
"Why do you keep following me?

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,777
Do you want to be my friend?"

11
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:32,991
It's you, right?

12
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,288
We'll see each other again soon.

13
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:48,256
[theme music playing]

14
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:33,968
[gate opens]

15
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,222
[crickets chirping]

16
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,306
[gate closes]

17
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,444
[latch clicks]

18
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,279
[door sliding open]

19
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,282
Good evening.

20
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,201
Oh.

21
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,706
You're finally home.

22
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,416
I made sure he had his meals.

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,627
Look, he fell asleep waiting for you.

24
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,712
Have you eaten?

25
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,590
You must be exhausted.

26
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,261
Hang on.

27
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,513
Let me see that.

28
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,474
Is this supposed to be your dinner?

29
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,935
Oh, sweetheart.

30
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:27,355
You should be filling
yourself with healthy food.

31
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,190
You're always tired.

32
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,484
And your work schedule
isn't doing you any favors.

33
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,989
Alright, grab a glass of water,
wash your hands,

34
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,448
and eat your dinner.

35
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,367
Make sure you get
some rest afterward, alright?

36
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,705
Now, off you go. Your food's waiting.

37
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,040
[door opens]

38
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,167
[exhales softly]

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,882
[tender music playing]

40
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,303
[music fades]

41
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,513
[Cynthia] People of OK Hospital!

42
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,559
We're so blessed to have
a guy that's so handsome!

43
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,518
[Kai] Seriously?

44
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,854
Patrick's the only one you find handsome?
Not me?

45
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,814
Kai, that's not what she meant.

46
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,941
She was just saying there
are now more handsome guys

47
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,860
working here at the hospital.

48
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:18,531
That's nonsense. In my opinion,
Patrick's more handsome than you.

49
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,325
He's kind and dependable.

50
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,577
And he's going to be
my newest chess partner.

51
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,745
Oh, really?

52
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:27,498
Do you really think he'd want to play
with a relic like you?

53
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,374
[chuckles]

54
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,500
Hey, girl!

55
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,920
Show the senior citizen some respect.

56
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,964
- Nurse, that woman's acting up.
- Let it go.

57
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,133
You're right, Mister Tommy.
Patrick's a good guy.

58
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,760
I'm sure you two will get along just fine.

59
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,220
He plays chess really well.

60
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,429
[laughter]

61
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,513
Told you.

62
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,015
[Tommy] Is this my lunch?

63
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,975
Thank you.

64
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,811
That smile hasn't left your face

65
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,813
since Patrick started working here.

66
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,358
Try not to make it too obvious, Gemma.

67
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,568
Patty, I'm just happy

68
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,571
because it looks like he
won't have a hard time adjusting.

69
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:03,159
Well, if he is
responsible as you say he is,

70
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,994
then he won't have a problem at all.

71
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,788
[Ada] Are you sure?

72
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,915
He hasn't even settled in yet,

73
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,959
and he's already talking
one-on-one with the doctor.

74
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,335
What's that about?

75
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,797
[breathing nervously]

76
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,342
Hi, Matmat.

77
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,390
Matmat?

78
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,940
- Matmat will leave now.
- Stego--

79
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,733
Stego… Stego--

80
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,860
S-Stegosaurus.

81
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,862
That's--That's the…

82
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:45,118
The one with two pairs
of spikes at the end of its tail?

83
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,537
[whimsical music playing]

84
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,788
Mm-hmm, correct.

85
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,290
You're right. You're right.

86
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,793
Well, your stegosaurus has a big body

87
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,045
but not such a big brain.

88
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,382
Dino Boy!

89
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,758
Dino Boy.

90
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,010
- Oh, Dino Boy.
- Di--

91
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,762
His name is Dino Boy.

92
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,264
- Hi, Dino Boy!
- Doctor.

93
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,348
Hi, Dino Boy.

94
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,558
[in high-pitched voice] Hi!

95
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,934
- Hi, Dino Boy!
- Hi!

96
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:15,398
[whimsical music continues]

97
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,482
[exhales heavily]

98
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,984
[doctor] Patrick?

99
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,739
- [doorknob turns]
- [door opens]

100
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,198
- [Matmat giggles]
- [Patrick] Doc?

101
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,951
- Uh…
- Patpat. Patpat.

102
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,328
- Have a seat, Patrick.
- [music ends]

103
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:31,956
Doctor.

104
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,210
Hang on, you always draw in Mia's book?

105
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,337
[Matmat] Yeah. Yes.

106
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,757
Because I want to make it more…

107
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,966
more beautiful.

108
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,217
Wow.

109
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,470
I had no idea he could draw so well.

110
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,722
He's got exceptional art skills.

111
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,390
Doctor, do you want me to…

112
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,726
draw you?

113
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,852
What?

114
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,271
I can draw you.

115
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,899
I'm going to draw you. I need a table.

116
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,817
Well, go ahead.

117
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,737
Matmat's going to draw. I need a table.

118
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,700
[Matmat humming]

119
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:14,707
Doctor, did my brother
mention anything about butterflies?

120
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,459
Um… [clicks tongue]

121
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,460
He hasn't brought it up.

122
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,339
Maybe the time will come
when he opens up about those things.

123
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,256
[somber music playing]

124
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,716
I know that, Doctor.

125
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,052
Listen.

126
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,678
From what I see in you,

127
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:31,682
it's like you want
your brother to overcome his fear already.

128
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,311
But everything starts from within.

129
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:40,358
The time will come in
his life when he wants to face it.

130
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,902
And that's when we'll
be there to help him, Patrick.

131
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,362
Just have faith.

132
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:49,826
[somber music continues]

133
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,120
So, did you make me look handsome or what?

134
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:58,584
[light-hearted music playing]

135
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,090
Whoa.

136
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,553
[Matmat giggling softly]

137
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,804
This is amazing.

138
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,641
[Eden] Here's the
request form for supplies.

139
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,934
[Matmat] Hmm…

140
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,727
- [door closes]
- Can we…

141
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,646
Can we go now?

142
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,981
Yes, Matmat.

143
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,732
Thanks, Nurse Eden.

144
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,359
Don't mention it.

145
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,487
He was the one
who agreed to talk to your brother.

146
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,322
When we…

147
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,199
When we come back,

148
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,869
I'm drawing him again.

149
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,953
Of course.

150
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,705
You'll have lots of time to draw him.

151
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,916
[Matmat] Back for therapy.

152
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,877
Something like that.

153
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,962
- [lights flickering]
- [pensive music playing]

154
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,464
The light.

155
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,090
Something's wrong with it.

156
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,633
[Eden sighs, clicks tongue]

157
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,721
It's happening again.

158
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,308
Has it been going on for a while?
Maybe I need to call the maintenance guy.

159
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,101
Yes, it has.

160
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,521
Especially when the weather's bad.

161
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,359
They say, that's how
the spirits in the hospital

162
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,446
warn that something bad is coming.

163
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,199
[pensive music continues]

164
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:15,328
Or at least that's what
the nurses before me used to say.

165
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,872
- I'll see you around.
- Sure thing.

166
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:23,711
- [flickering continues]
- [pensive music crescendos]

167
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,838
[Vincent] Finally!

168
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,424
We closed that endorsement deal for Mia.

169
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,053
Please check off that
brand's new endorsement deal for Mia.

170
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,095
[snapping fingers]

171
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,641
Yes, sir. Also, her follower count went up

172
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,018
after those content creators posted

173
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,062
about her defending the man with autism.

174
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,356
That's what I like! Music to my ears!

175
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,858
Now, we have
to strike while the iron is hot.

176
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,026
Where's Mia?

177
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,321
Didn't you hear me?

178
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,697
Where is she, Madeth?

179
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,782
Let's go.

180
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,159
[sighs exasperatedly]

181
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,120
[upbeat music playing]

182
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,248
[engine revving]

183
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,839
[ringing]

184
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,426
Hello?

185
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,096
Where are thou, my lovely, lovely writer?

186
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,014
Come on.

187
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,225
Tell me where in
the Philippines you are right now.

188
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,519
I'll have someone pick you up.

189
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:25,022
You want a jet plane,
a ship, a car, a bus?

190
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,107
Just say the word.

191
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,817
[upbeat music continues]

192
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,112
Are you familiar with
that story by Hans Christian Andersen?

193
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,032
About the lady in red shoes?

194
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:42,748
[upbeat music continues]

195
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,045
- [birds cawing]
- [upbeat music ends]

196
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,924
- [nurse] Exhale. Inhale…
- [thunder rumbling]

197
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,009
Exhale.

198
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,011
Inhale.

199
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,804
Exhale.

200
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,807
- Inhale, exhale…
- [unsettling music playing]

201
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,643
- Okay, put your hands up.
- [light flickering]

202
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,396
Down. Up, then down.

203
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,481
Up. Down.

204
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,482
Up…

205
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:13,029
[rumbling continues]

206
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:17,908
[unsettling music continues]

207
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,661
[thunder roar, claps]

208
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,913
[rain pouring]

209
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:28,669
[engine roaring]

210
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:41,849
[unsettling music continues]

211
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,018
[distant rumbling]

212
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:53,235
[Mia] There was a girl
who adored a pair of red shoes.

213
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,905
A gift from her mother.

214
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,907
[unsettling music continues]

215
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,534
Her love for them grew into an obsession.

216
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,995
And so, a soldier cursed them.

217
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,457
As long as she wore those red shoes,

218
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,671
she would never stop dancing.

219
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:17,510
[unsettling music continues]

220
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,803
[Gemma shivers]

221
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,304
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

222
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,514
Wait, I'll get you a towel.

223
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,015
Oh no, it's okay. I have mine…

224
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,944
[lights flickering]

225
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,280
And no matter how hard she tried,

226
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,617
she could never take them off.

227
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,327
[unsettling music continues]

228
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,996
So she danced on and on.

229
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,876
It got to a point where an executioner…

230
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,963
had to cut off her feet,

231
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,006
just to bring her stillness.

232
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,511
[flickering continues]

233
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,639
Such a beautiful
story about obsession, right?

234
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:08,644
[unsettling music continues]

235
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,689
- [rain pouring]
- [thunder rumbling]

236
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,864
[music swells]

237
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:24,952
[wind whooshing]

238
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,162
[thunder roars]

239
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:31,333
[unsettling music continues]

240
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,922
[heels clacking]

241
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,889
[lightning crashing]

242
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,894
I found my red shoe.

243
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,989
At last, I've found
what I've been looking for.

244
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:07,912
[unsettling music continues]

245
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,630
[thunder roars]

246
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:23,594
[unsettling music continues]

247
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,943
[thunder cracks, rumbles]

248
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,823
- [thunder roars]
- [music fades]

249
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,700
What are you doing here?

250
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,078
- [thunder cracks]
- [distant rumbling]

251
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,580
Destiny brings us together.

252
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,958
[Patrick huffs]

253
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,752
You're leaving again
just like you did before.

254
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,837
[thunder roars]

255
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,677
Finally…

256
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,680
we meet again.

257
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,933
- [lightning cracks]
- [thunder roars]

258
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,019
You're the little boy I met back then.

259
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,980
[chuckles softly]

260
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,149
- Wow.
- [thunder rumbles]

261
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,526
What a glow-up.

262
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,945
[thunder rumbling]

263
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,115
How long have you known who I am?

264
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,993
- [thunder rumbling]
- [unsettling music resumes]

265
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,412
Ever since Matmat
started liking your books.

266
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,748
I've found out online
that you're from Maravida.

267
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,544
We've run into each other many times,
but you didn't tell me.

268
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,505
Why does it even matter?

269
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,049
It's already in the past, Mia.

270
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,384
[thunder roars]

271
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,927
Would it change anything?

272
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,721
[Mia chuckles softly]

273
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,806
That's just the cherry on top.

274
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,019
I wanted you before I knew it
and now, I want you more.

275
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,397
If you really remember the past,

276
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,108
you should also
remember I was avoiding you.

277
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,610
[thunder roars]

278
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:06,614
I'm still doing the same thing.

279
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,326
That's why I've kept telling you
I don't want to see you anymore.

280
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,287
- [thunder rumbles]
- [Patrick huffs]

281
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,208
- [rain pouring]
- [unsettling music continues]

282
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:23,255
- [Mia] My pretty boy and his red umbrella.
- [thunder rumbling]

283
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,842
Do you still not get what I said?

284
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,803
Well, I don't agree.

285
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,348
Mia, you've recognized me.

286
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,224
You know who I am. What else do you want?

287
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,809
I told you…

288
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,772
I want you.

289
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,232
I like you.

290
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,818
[thunder rumbles]

291
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,237
You and me.

292
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:52,284
[unsettling music continues]

293
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,662
I'm not playing around with you.

294
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,832
Let's have dinner

295
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,085
We have a lot of catching up to do.

296
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,378
Come.

297
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,171
No. I don't want to.

298
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,591
[thunder roars]

299
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,054
Who is Patrick talking to?

300
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,891
[unsettling music continues]

301
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,102
It's Mia Hernandez.

302
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,191
- [thunder rumbling]
- [unsettling music fades]

303
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,484
Mia!

304
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,194
Mia.

305
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,114
I'm glad you came.

306
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,908
Doc Anok wants to talk to you.

307
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,579
You heard Nurse Olivia. Go on.

308
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,709
[rain pouring]

309
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:50,884
[waves lapping]

310
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,016
Glad you came.

311
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,810
Dr. Anok and I
can discuss the condition of--

312
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,104
I'm not here for a patient.

313
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,278
But, Ms. Hernandez…

314
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,990
You need to understand
that the brain tumor

315
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,825
is making your dad's condition worse.

316
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,453
How is that my concern?

317
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,669
[Kai] Yes, Mister Tommy.
I saw her earlier.

318
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,296
- R-Really?
- Yes.

319
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,881
And…

320
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:33,719
I saw her earlier
going into Dr. Anok's office.

321
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,636
Really?

322
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,555
Miss Mia's so beautiful, right?

323
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:40,350
By the way,
did you hear if she's visiting Samuel?

324
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,686
No. I was too far away to hear anything.

325
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,150
Here's what you can do.

326
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,486
Why don't you think about it?

327
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:56,158
And why don't you consider conducting a
literature seminar for the patients here?

328
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:05,501
[quirky music playing]

329
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,506
[sighs deeply]

330
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:18,722

[quirky music crescendos]

332
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:24,895
[sighs heavily]

333
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,231
What did Olivia say?

334
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,565
Uh…

335
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,652
She's disappointed,
but it's not a big deal.

336
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,197
I really don't get her.

337
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:39,535
She even hoped Mia
would agree to teach here.

338
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,204
Of course, she'd refuse.

339
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,208
Why is she here anyway?

340
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:58,929
[bells jingling]

[beeping continues]

346
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,724
Your daughter dropped by.

347
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,560
Mia.

348
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,020
[beeping continues]

349
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:52,441
[eerie music continues]

350
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,276
Do you remember her?

351
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:04,494
- [beeping continues]
- [eerie music continues]

352
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,461
[Tessie] Look. Look at that, Matmat.

353
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,130
[Tessie, Matmat] Wow!

354
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,883
- [Matmat] Whoa.
- [Tessie] Now you know, Matmat.

355
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,552
You already know where Mama works.

356
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,095
- Big house!
- Mm-hmm.

357
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,555
- So big!
- Yes, so big!

358
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,475
It's so huge that I get tired cleaning it.

359
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,353
Patrick, take care going
home with your brother, okay?

360
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,896
Don't pass by Miss Viray's house.

361
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,315
The guys hanging out
there might mess with you.

362
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,608
- Clear?
- Mm-hmm.

363
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:38,028
Mat, just stay home, okay?

364
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,405
Mama will hurry at work
so she can get back right away.

365
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,366
[Matmat] Alright, Mama.

366
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,951
Don't worry about me, okay?

367
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,620
My bosses are kind.

368
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,872
They treat me well.

369
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:54,878
- [birds chirping]
- [pensive music playing]

370
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,506
[Tessie] I'll go now.
My boss is waiting for me.

371
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,008
- [Matmat humming]
- [gate creaking]

372
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,427
- [Matmat mumbles indistinctly]
- [gate creaks shut]

373
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,595
Sir!

374
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,305
Good morning!

375
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,307
[Matmat] Kind boss…

376
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,893
[somber music playing]

377
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,937
[Patrick] Get well soon, Mister Samuel.

378
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,692
[somber music continues]

379
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,194
You might be the one who can give me,

380
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,281
answers about our mother's death.

381
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,824
[machine beeping]

382
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:29,079
[somber music continues]

383
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,749
[music fades]

384
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:34,918
Hi.

385
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,003
Wow.

386
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,879
- No one else can see us.
- Shut up.

387
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,550
Aren't you going to do something?

388
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,135
If you have
too many patients to look after.

389
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,553
Let me take care of Samuel.

390
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,888
Come with me.

391
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,391
Why didn't you tell me she went there?!

392
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,435
Mia shouldn't be in Maravida.

393
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,521
She can't stay in the mansion.

394
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,898
[ominous music playing]

395
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,483
[gate creaks open]
