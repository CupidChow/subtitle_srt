1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,168
Mia, stop!

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,045
That's Patrick, right?

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,132
- Patrick, you'll die--
- Gemma, just stay there!

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,883
- Patrick!
- [tires screech]

5
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,345
Why are you always mad at me?

6
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,764
Because you keep
doing things that make me mad!

7
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,934
That means I have an effect on you.

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,186
Hello to my dad's supporters!

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,689
- What's he doing here?
- You don't know me

10
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:26,484
because I'm his son
who is admitted in a psychiatric hospital.

11
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,527
Mama!

12
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,782
Even though Mama
yelled at me and slapped me,

13
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,242
I know she's not mad.

14
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,954
Because that slap, she did it out of love.

15
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,748
What if I just go with you?

16
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:53,762
[theme music playing]

17
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:48,191
- [van engine rumbling]
- [birds chirping]

18
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:57,909
Patrick?

19
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,162
- Patrick.
- Hmm?

20
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,081
Let's go.

21
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,252
- Oh. Here.
- [keys jangling]

22
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,465
You're not coming with me?

23
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,135
No.

24
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,511
Why?

25
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,013
I can't leave her behind.

26
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:26,855
[quirky music playing]

27
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,369
- [car door closes]
- [car engine starts]

00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,496
[music ends]

29
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,169
[sighs contentedly]

30
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,338
Now, let's have fun.

31
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,928
We're going straight to the hospital.

32
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:00,722
What?

33
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,181
No.

34
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,601
You asked me earlier,

35
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,271
"What if I just go with you?

36
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,440
We can just have fun."

37
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,488
I didn't say that to you.

38
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,074
Who was it for, then? The wind?

39
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,118
I was the only one standing next to you.

40
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,288
[tense music playing]

41
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,167
[sighs contentedly]

42
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,835
It doesn't matter.

43
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,922
We are going to have
fun whether you like it or not.

44
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,218
Because I go crazy
whenever I get disappointed.

45
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:42,180
[tense music continues]

46
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,224
[Anok] This condition is incurable.

47
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,683
It can be treated,

48
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,186
but if requires life long management.

49
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,064
Those of us who interact with people

50
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:54,692
with antisocial personality disorder

51
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,986
we shouldn't engage them

52
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,614
or enable their behavior.

53
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,747
[tense music swells, ends]

54
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,255
[birds squawking, chirping]

55
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,135
Mia.

56
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,893
I was planning to kidnap you.

57
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,396
It's a good thing you came willingly.

58
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,607
[huffs] Is it your hobby to kidnap people?

59
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,192
[chuckles] No.

60
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,279
I only take people who want to have fun.

61
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,074
Who exactly have
you kidnapped to have fun?

62
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,369
Well, there's Junjun,

63
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,246
and now…

64
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,707
you.

65
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,793
[chuckles softly]

66
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,211
I don't count.

67
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,838
Oh, come on, Patrick.

68
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,841
It was written all over your face.

69
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,176
You're jealous of Junjun.

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,430
It was written all over my face?

71
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,056
Are you sure that's what I want?

72
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,641
I just know it.

73
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,268
Don't deny it.

74
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,021
You're jealous of Junjun.

75
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,023
Why would I be jealous of Junjun?

76
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,525
Because he let himself have fun.

77
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,945
He was having fun
like no one cares at all.

78
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,199
I'm right, aren't I?

79
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,705
That feeling of leaving everything behind

80
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,875
just to have fun like him.

81
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:39,380
[tender music playing]

82
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,007
That's nonsense.

83
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,550
[exhales sharply]

84
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,263
[Patrick inhales deeply]

85
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,140
You're still just a little boy…

86
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,021
who wants to be loved.

87
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:04,405
[tender music continues]

88
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:27,720
[tender music continues]

89
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,441
[tender music fades]

90
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,442
[car door closes]

91
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,280
[car door opens]

92
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,074
Mia!

93
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,620
You said you just wanted some water.

94
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,621
What is it now?

95
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,540
Come here.

96
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,084
Mia, I need to go back to the hospital.

97
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,004
Patrick, we're
supposed to have fun, remember?

98
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,465
I said I didn't count.

99
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,343
Instead of resisting,

100
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,970
just come with me.

101
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,598
You can go back
to the hospital afterwards.

102
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,226
You're just wasting time
with these detours.

103
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,227
No.

104
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,189
Doing something for
yourself is never a waste of time.

105
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,076
[Mia exhales softly]

106
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,202
Look.

107
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:38,249
I know you're responsible for Junjun.

108
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,461
But you weren't
there when I snuck him out.

109
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,589
You let him get on the stage

110
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,966
when you could have easily stopped him.

111
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,388
Do you think you won't be blamed for that?

112
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,104
Even if I get blamed, I should be there.

113
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,981
Exactly my point.

114
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,483
The problem still remains

115
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,818
whether you get
to the hospital early or not.

116
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,779
So, what's the rush?

117
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:15,244
- [unsettling music playing]
- [phone ringing]

118
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,038
Patrick.

119
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,833
Will the world fall apart
if we stop to get some fresh air?

120
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,711
[unsettling music continues]

121
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,172
Come on.

122
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,717
Let's go.

123
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,055
[unsettling music intensifies]

124
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,348
[Mia grunts]

125
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,980
[unsettling music crescendos]

126
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:48,444
I know you're all worried
after what happened to Junjun.

127
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,490
So, I just wanted to say to you all,

128
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,367
don't worry.

129
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,162
No one will be punished or lose their job.

130
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,499
Okay?

131
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,750
Patients first.

132
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,169
[claps] Back to work. Okay?

133
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,883
[Gemma] Mia shouldn't
be allowed back here.

134
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,387
[Anok] Is that how
you really feel toward your friend?

135
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,973
She's your friend?

136
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,517
You and Mia are close?

137
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,188
Ah Doc, she's not actually my friend.
She's just an acquaintance.

138
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,362
Uh, Doc, if you ask me,

139
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,574
I don't think it's good for the patients

140
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,576
to have Mia around.

141
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,041
I'll get back to work, Doc.

142
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,385
Doc.

143
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:59,849
What do we tell the board of directors
if they ask about this case?

144
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,310
What about the sponsors?

145
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:08,149
We'll tell them that we could get sued.

146
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,817
That's the truth anyway.

147
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,360
[morose music playing]

148
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,947
Doc, what's your decision regarding Mia?

149
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,742
We're not in any rush.

150
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,536
Let's keep observing Junjun.

151
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,248
Let's see first if this
event has any effect on him.

152
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,792
Then I'll make my decision.

153
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:31,922
[morose music continues, ends]

154
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,925
[Mia] This is such a fun date.

155
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,261
[Patrick] This isn't a date.

156
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,723
Don't you remember this place?

157
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,227
[umbrella clicks, pops open]

158
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:49,940
Hold this.

159
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,653
Mia…

160
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,321
Come on.

161
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,827
[sentimental music playing]

162
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,371
Isn't it nostalgic?

163
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:12,338
[sentimental music continues]

164
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,635
[sentimental music fades]

165
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,387
Can we go back to the hospital now?

166
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,141
- Aren't you enjoying our date?
- I told you this isn't a date.

167
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,894
We're two adults
having fun alone together.

168
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,229
What do you call that?

169
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:32,233
Instead of focusing on this as a date,
why don't you think of anything else?

170
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,359
Like what?

171
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,195
Your job, your books,

172
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,531
or your endorsements on social media.

173
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,990
So you did your research.

174
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,244
Or think of your dad's welfare.

175
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,497
[morose music playing]

176
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,457
Why don't you care about him anymore?

177
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,084
I don't see a need.

178
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,545
But you promised Dr. Anok that you would.

179
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,588
I don't remember promising anything.

180
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,842
Besides, he has dementia.

181
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,386
Why will I waste my time?

182
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,055
He's better off dead.

183
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,643
Don't look at me like that.

184
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,812
How about you?

185
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,524
Did you take care of your parents
while they were still alive?

186
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,444
[morose music continues]

187
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,279
I did my research too.

188
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,826
So you know that my mom
worked at your house before she died?

189
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,412
Yes, but…

190
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,415
I really can't remember anything.

191
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,503
All that I remember from that house…

192
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,423
is my mom.

193
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,721
Anyway, back to your parents.

194
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,349
Were you helpful
to them when they were still alive?

195
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,728
[morose music continues]

196
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,313
Oh.

197
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,939
You look surprised again.

198
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,858
Am I wrong?

199
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,820
Parents keep
their children for two reasons.

200
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,614
Either you make them happy,

201
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,783
or you're useful to them.

202
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,912
Once you're no
longer useful, they neglect you.

203
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,122
Just like what happened to Junjun.

204
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,877
Anyway…

205
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,421
tell me more about your parents.

206
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:22,718
[morose music continues]

207
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,346
What?

208
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,391
I forget you're different.

209
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,061
I shouldn't expect anything from you.

210
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,562
What?

211
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,023
Patrick!

212
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,192
We're still talking.

213
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,695
Are you mad again?

214
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,906
Patrick!

215
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,368
- What do you expect from me?
- Nothing.

216
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,119
Patrick!

217
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,497
Patrick!

218
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,751
- Patrick.
- [bag rustles]

219
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,337
Patrick, let's talk.

220
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,799
Patrick, wait.

221
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,053
What do you expect from me?

222
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,181
Come on.

223
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,225
Tell me.

224
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,852
[birds chirping]

225
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,107
I love you.

226
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,863
[birds chirping]

227
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,865
I love you, Patrick.

228
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,662
[tense music playing]

229
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,705
Patrick!

230
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,624
Patrick, I love you!

231
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,505
Didn't you hear me?

232
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,632
I said I love you.

233
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,594
Do you want to hear it in Tagalog?

234
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,846
[in Tagalog] I love you!

235
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,639
[in Tagalog] I love you, Patrick!

236
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,766
[in Tagalog] I love you so much!

237
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,396
Is that how you act when
someone confesses their love to you?

238
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,564
You walk out?!

239
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,150
Patrick!

240
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,985
I love you! [echoes]

241
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,196
[crow cawing]

242
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,783
Unbelievable!

243
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,036
We were okay!

244
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,915
I didn't even say anything bad!

245
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,458
And he walks out on me?!

246
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,543
Argh! [grunts]

247
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,921
[car door opens]

248
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,757

[tense music builds]

[music fades]

254

[traffic noises]

255
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:01,210
[man] It wouldn't be hard
for you to make these products.

256
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,711
Here in the Philippines,

257
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,214
we have a rich variety of handicrafts.

258
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,258
Each region has its own influences.

259
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,428
Shaped by our natural resources
and cultural traditions.

260
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,639
Just like this.

261
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,100
Just like products like these.

262
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,435
Shaped by our skills,

263
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,853
- creativity…
- [yawns]

264
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,855
…and natural resources.

265
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,982
Right?

266
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,650
That's all you did?

267
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,277
[traffic noises]

268
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,821
I'm sorry, Matmat.

269
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,157
I haven't found any work for you.

270
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,536
But they said,
when you're done with the workshop,

271
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,832
they can take
you to work on livelihood projects.

272
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,711
I'll…

273
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,382
Matmat will just work…
work for Dr. Anok.

274
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:53,846
Matmat will paint for Dr. Anok and then…

275
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,056
he'll pay me. Right?

276
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,683
Is that a good idea?

277
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:02,479
Yes, because you're doing what you like
and you're also getting paid for it.

278
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,566
That's what Matmat will do then.

279
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,570
Hmm… [tongue clicks] Alright.

280
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:14,575
But that means we need to buy materials
you'll use for your paintings.

281
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,827
[tender music playing]

282
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,749
We shouldn't buy them
because we're saving money.

283
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,836
That's why Matmat will work,
to earn money.

284
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,297
I'll buy them for you. Don't worry.

285
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,844
[tender music continues]

286
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,889
[Matmat giggling]

287
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,224
Well? Do you want
to come with me to buy them?

288
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,643
You can use them for your new job.

289
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,938
Alright then.

290
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:50,611
Matmat will come with you for his new job.

291
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:55,240

[eerie music continues]

297
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,064
It was nothing, Vincent. [groans]
It was nothing.

298
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,233
[groans]

299
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,151
[knocking]

300
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,029
Aah!

301
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,614
[tongue clicks, huffs]

302
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,200
[door slides open]

303
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,119
Mia, that wasn't funny.

304
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,454
You almost scared the soul out of me!

305
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,457
I knocked so many times,
but you didn't wake up.

306
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,001
You deserve that scare.

307
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,253
Wow!

308
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:53,841
"Vincent, hi! How are you?
Why are you here? How was your flight?"

309
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,176
That might be a better
way to greet me, don't you think?

310
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,386
Why are you here?

311
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,720
[huffs]

312
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,763
Why?

313
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,224
You're asking me why? [frustrated sigh]

314
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,392
Let me think.

315
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,603
It's probably because
your real life is in Manila.

316
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,939
Your career is in Manila.

317
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,066
Your house is in Manila.

318
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,444
- Your career is in Manila.
- You said "career" twice.

319
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,696
For emphasis.

320
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,700
To remind you that you're supposed to be
in Manila, where your career is

321
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,537
So you can continue writing books and
secure all the endorsements I got for you.

322
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,914
I've just been here for a few days.

323
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,208
I want to stay here and have fun.

324
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,002
Fun?!

325
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,253
You want to enjoy?!

326
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,838
Have fun in Manila!

327
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,590
- There's so much more--
- No!

328
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,508
[sighs exasperatedly]

329
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,719
Look at this place!
You sure you want to stay here?!

330
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,387
Doesn't this creep you out?!

331
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,097
Why would I be scared?

332
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,266
I own this house.

333
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,393
Of course, this is where his mother died--

334
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,816
I think you're really tired.

335
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,276
You want to rest now.

336
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,069
I'll come back tomorrow. Let's talk.

337
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,821
I'll drop by again, okay?

338
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,031
Bye, Mia!

339
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,073
Good night!

[somber music playing]

342
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:23,096
[Patrick] So you know my mom
worked at your house before she died?

343
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,557
Yes, but…

344
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,852
I really can't remember anything.

345
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,355
[somber music continues]

346
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,774
[Mia] All that I
remember from that house…

347
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,652
is my mom.

348
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,528
[eerie exhale]

349
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:43,992
[eerie music playing]

350
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,744
[Mia's mother] Mia, dear.

351
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,999
Always remember that you're special.

352
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,629
You are very special.

353
00:20:56,338 --> 00:21:00,008
Because you are my creation.

354
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:06,723
[eerie music continues]

355
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,643
I created you.

356
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,273
I molded you.

357
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,819
You are special because you are…

358
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,989
…my other self.

359
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,490

[distorted noise]

369
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:30,057

370
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,526
[eerie music fades]

371
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,530
[door creaks open]

372
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:49,826
- [suspenseful music playing]
- [machine beeping]

373
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,663

- [machine beeping steadily]

375
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:17,854
- [suspenseful music continues]
- [machine beeping steadily]

376
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:35,831
[suspenseful music intensifies]

377
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:42,921
[music turns sinister]

378

379
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,222
[Vincent] She can't write while
she's there in Maravida.

380
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,723
What does that have to do with me?

381
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:57,894
Why do you keep insisting on staying here?
It's surely not because of your dad.

382
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,354
That Patrick--

383
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,064
I told him that I love him.

384
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,566
But he pretended not to hear anything.

385
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,734
Why? What did you want him to say?

386
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,902
There's an emergency!

387
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,320
Patrick! Patrick!

388
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,614
- Am I going to lose my job?
- It's possible.

389
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,993
Mia should be here because she was
with Junjun when they left the hospital.

390
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,953
Where's that nosy woman?

391
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,496
We want her here.
