- Um, uh…

177
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,946
Hello? Boss V?

[Jason sighs heavily]

179
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,618
Huh? Boss V, right now?

180
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,912
As in right now?

181
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,291
That's so you'll finally leave me alone.

182
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,962
What is this?

183
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,257
I know you'll keep trying
to convince me to change my mind.

[patron chattering indistinctly]

186
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,237
I know how important this is to you, Mia.

187
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,533
And so many people are
waiting for the last installment.

188
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,162
I've been trying to get
this from you for a long time.

189
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,000
But you're more important to me.

190
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:34,300
That's why I'd rather
publish your book than this.

191
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,096
You don't want this?

192
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,517
I don't want that.

193
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,479
Okay.

Hey, wait! Where are you going?

197
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,612
Didn't you say you just
wanted to meet one last time?

198
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,738
Yeah?

199
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,365
- Well, we've met.
- [quirky music playing]

200
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,241
- I'll be going.
- Hey!

201
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,703
Mia, wait! We're not done talking. Hey!

202
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,538

00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,757
- Miss, the bill.
- Yes, sir?

207
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,050
- Give me our bill.
- Okay, sir.

208
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,927
Please, make it quick.

209
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,348
[gasps] Hey!

210
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,266
Excuse me, sir. Here's your bill.

211
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,268
- [Vincent] Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.

212
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,895
Uh, wait! Wait! Mister! Mister!

213
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,231
Wait! Hold on! Hey, mister! Mister!

[quirky music crescendos]

215
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,790
You and Vincent ganged up on me.

216
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,629
Don't you understand?

217
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:56,757
When I drove you out of the house,
what I meant was…

218
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,009
- I didn't want--
- I forgive you.

219
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,346
["Being With You" instrumental playing]

220
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,974
If you think it's a sin
being the child of the person

221
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,600
who killed my mother…

222
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,438
I've already forgiven you.

223
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,233
If my forgiveness is what it takes

224
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,860
to bring you back to us…

225
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,489
I'll forgive you over and over again.

228
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,377
Mia, we shouldn't be torn apart

229
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,088
for a sin we didn't even commit.

230
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,675
[voice breaks] I'm sorry…

My goodness, Boss V!

Did you really have to make
me come back to Manila for this?

Can you please stop complaining?

259

Just keep looking for
Mia's mother's manuscript.

260
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,866
Once we find it, we can publish it.

[quirky music continues]

262
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,703
Huh? Boss V,

263
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:34,290
Isn't that like deceiving Miss Mia?

264
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,542
Madeth, use your brain.

265
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,752
We're not. It's called insurance.

266
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,671
What if Mia doesn't
finish writing her book?

267
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,381
The manuscript will be our backup.

268
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:48,345
Boss V, this backup of yours
has gotten us walking on trash.

269
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,139
I can't even see it.

270
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,768
Let's take a break, Boss V.
This is exhausting.

271
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,145
We can't take a break!

272
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,272
What if the garbage
collectors come and find it?

273
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,691
It's us who should be profiting from it.

274
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,736
Oh, I get it.

275
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,906
Money! You only care about money!

I'm out of here! It's always about money!

- I thought you've changed!
- Hey!

278
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,494
- Hey, hey!
- You'll always be greedy!

279
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,580
- Hey, hey, where are you going?
- I'm leaving!

280
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:18,042
Swimming in trash
isn't in my job description!

281
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,460
- No thank you!
- Hey, Madeth!

282
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,546
If I find the manuscript,
you won't get a bonus from me!

You're so mean, Boss V.

287
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,689
You can go crazy
looking through the trash.

288
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,109
I'm not showing this
to you until you act nice to me.

289
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,195
I'll get back at you for this.

You think either Olivia
or Eden could be my mom?

293
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,090
They're the ones
who fit Zelda's description.

294
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,926
Plus, the way
they act towards Mister Samuel,

295
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,845
and that book
that was left at the mansion.

296
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,556
They're a threat to your life.

297
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,061
I'm used to my mom hurting me.

298
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,939
But if she plans on hurting Matmat,

299
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,274
I will not let that happen.

300
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,694
- But, Mia--
- Let's confront them.

[uneasy music continues]

302
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,905
We can take them both on.

303
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,076
I'm not afraid
because I have my safety pin.

304
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,787
I have you.

- Vincent?

00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,514
It was a success!

309
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,808
I assume it is because you're together.

310
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,227
- That stench! Stay there!
- [quirky music playing]

311
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,479
- Don't come near us.
- Why? Why?

312
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,689
You stink.

Where's Madeth?

Forget about Madeth!
What matters is Mia's here!

316
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,448
I'm so happy. Can I give you a hug?

317
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,533
- No, stay away, stay away!
- It's okay.

318
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,493
- Stay away.
- Here's good?

319
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,870
- Yes.
- Okay.

320
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,622
Vincent…Okay, fine.

321
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,541
I'll work on the book.

322
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,293
Matmat and I will finish it.

00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,253
- [Vincent sighs in relief]
- But, please…

324
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,713
Take a bath.

Yes, yes!

[quirky music continues]

327
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,927
Yes, I'll do whatever you want.

328
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,430
I'll take a shower now! Yes!

329
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:38,974
[Vincent sighs]

330
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,143
Take care. Drive safely, Patrick.

331
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,311
Be careful.

[Mia] Eden has a son?

334
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,781
And you're telling me he turned out fine?

335
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,493
[scoffs] Then she's
definitely not my mother.

336
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,911
How can you be sure?

337
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,831
Because my mother is
a never ending black hole of selfishness.

338
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,667
If she wasn't able to take care of me,

339
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,586
how would she take care of someone else?

340
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,880
Mia?

00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,799
Patpat?

[chuckles]

343
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,348
You're home late. How was the trip?

344
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,061
Did you two make up?
D-Did you kiss each other?

345
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,312
Matmat!

346
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,940
[Li] As long as
they've made up, that's fine.

347
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,651
Uh, you two should eat dinner.
I've already prepared some food.

348
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:35,531
[waves crashing]

349
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,205
You left before everyone finished eating.

350
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,959
I know, I'm sorry.

351
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,296
I know Vincent had multiple showers but,

352
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,551
I still couldn't stand his smell,
so I stepped out.

353
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,853
Are you ready to face them?

354
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,902
Both Ma'am Olivia and Ma'am Eden?

355
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,950
- What will we do if--
- Can we not talk about it now?

356
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,622
A lot has happened.

357
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,544
[sighs]

358
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,588
I just want to have a moment of peace…

359
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,675
before I deal with
the things I need to face.

360
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,553
Just for tonight.

361
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:45,017
- [waves crashing]
- [tender music playing]

362
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,365
[tender music continues]

363
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,167
[door squeaks]

364
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,838
Matmat already set up the bed.

365
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,007
Miss Mia can sleep here.

366
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,178
[tender music continues]

367
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,808
[music fades]

368
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,810
- Thanks, Matmat.
- Shh!

369
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,271
- M-Mia's sleeping.
- Oh.

370
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,190
Keep your voice down.

371
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,535
G-Good night, Patpat.

372
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,621
Good night, Matmat.

373
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:52,334
[tender music resumes]

374
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,266
Good night, Mia.

375
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,896
[tender music continues, fades]

376
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,027
She's not here, Patrick.

377
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,321
Eden hasn't come to work for a while now.

378
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,116
[unsettling music playing]

379
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,618
She's gone AWOL. We couldn't contact her.

380
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,247
She's been working here for so long,
but Eden has never done this before.

381
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,375
When did she stop coming to work?

382
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:38,588
Ever since we found
that butterfly on Matmat's painting.

383
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:43,051
[unsettling music continues]

384
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,556
The butterfly appeared
after Mister Samuel's death.

385
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,059
It's no coincidence.

386
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,103
She has something to do with this.

387
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:57,024
[unsettling music continues, fades]

388
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,859
[Vio sniffling]

389
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,279
- [exhales sharply]
- [foreboding music playing]

390
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,072
She just suddenly left.

391
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,367
She left without telling anyone?

392
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,621
[Vio] She took some
of her belongings with her.

393
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,249
She told me not to follow her because

394
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,586
I know that I'm not her real son.

395
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:23,008
[foreboding music continues]

396
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,969
Now that explains everything.

397
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,140
Do you know where she might go?
Did she say anything to you?

398
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,975
[Patrick] Somewhere we
might be able to find her?

399
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,227
[sniffling] No.

400
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,521
Mama left me.

401
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:41,318
- [Vio sighs, sniffles]
- [foreboding music continues]

402
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,153
Where the hell is she?

403
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,780
[foreboding music fades]

404
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,323
She's hiding.

405
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,950
She knows we're onto her,
so she went into hiding.

406
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,994
[loud thud]

407
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,330
[suspenseful music playing]

408
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,414
Stay there.

409
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,541
Patrick!

410
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,881
[suspenseful music continues]

411
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,345
Mia, stay right there.

412
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,683
[loud thud]

413
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,270
[Patrick whispers] Stay there.

414
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:25,237
[suspenseful music continues]

415
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:41,753
[suspenseful music intensifies]

416
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,218
[suspenseful music crescendos]

417
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:53,640
- [eerie music playing]
- [wings flapping]

418
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,767
Mia!

419
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,856
She's making her presence felt.

420
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,442
You need to get out of here, Mia.

421
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,319
I'm not afraid of her.

422
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,781
And all this time,
she's been working with Mister Dipong.

423
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,741
He's the only one
with access to the house,

424
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,368
so I'm sure he did this.

425
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,412
- [suspenseful music playing]
- We can't be sure, Mia.

426
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,039
Your mom might be
the one behind all of this.

427
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,085
But if Mister Dipong
had something to do with this,

428
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,296
we need to find him.

429
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,841
[suspenseful music crescendos]

430
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,097
[man] We're here.

431
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,893
[Patrick] Thank you for taking
me to Mister Dipong's house.

432
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:38,977
I'll take it from here.

433
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,562
[man] Alright, we'll get going.

434
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,646
[Patrick] Thank you.

435
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,985
- [knocking]
- [door creaks open]

436
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:50,447
[foreboding music playing]

437
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,698
Mister Dipong?

438
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:01,249
[foreboding music continues]

439
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:25,357
[foreboding music continues]

440
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,746
[Patrick] <i>Mister Dipong was</i>
<i>the one who took Mister Samuel?</i>

441
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,457
<i>He was working with Ma'am Olivia?</i>

442
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,461
[foreboding music continues]

443
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,678
<i>We'll face the butterfly together.</i>

444
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,346
<i>The woman was wearing that!</i>

445
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,932
<i>You've known for a long time.</i>
<i>Was she your mother's killer?</i>

446
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,184
<i>The butterfly appeared</i>
<i>after Mister Samuel's death.</i>

447
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,771
<i>You think either Olivia</i>
<i>or Eden could be my mom?</i>

448
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,856
<i>Eden left her son all alone.</i>

449
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,193
<i>All evidence points</i>
<i>to Miss Olivia being your mother.</i>

450
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,903
<i>How can we uncover their identity?</i>

451
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,863
[Matmat] <i>Mia and I finished our book.</i>

452
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,740
[Mia] <i>Welcome, everyone.</i>

453
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,701
[Patrick] <i>You want everyone to see this?</i>

454
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,910
<i>I want them to come out</i>

455
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,538
<i>so I can confront them,</i>
<i>and find out who my mom is.</i>

456
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,665
<i>I need to protect you and Matmat.</i>

457
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,377
<i>As long as we're all together,</i>
<i>we can face anything, right?</i>

458
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,255
<i>Useless children</i>
<i>should be thrown out to the sea.</i>

459
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,464
<i>That's a threat, Mia.</i>

460
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,758
<i>- Your life is in danger.</i>
<i>- I'm not afraid of her!</i>

461
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,219
<i>We're not ganging up on you!</i>
<i>We're trying to protect you!</i>

462
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,556
<i>I won't let you ruin the life I have now.</i>

463
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:43,226
<i>Matmat doesn't like</i>
<i>people doing bad things.</i>

464
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,562
<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>don't go with them.</i>

465
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,523
<i>Now that she's here, she'll hurt you too!</i>

466
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,400
<i>B-Butterfly!</i>

467
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,110
<i>You'll pay for everything you've done.</i>

468
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,905
<i>I'd rather die than end up like you.</i>

469
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,157
<i>Mia!</i>
