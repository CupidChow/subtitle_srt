[Vincent] Hello? Where are thou,
my lovely, lovely writer?

5
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,680
[Mia] Do you know the story
Hans Christian Anderson wrote?

6
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,307
…the lady in red shoes.

7
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,977
Such a beautiful story about obsession.

00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,815
Finally, we meet again.

00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,443
You were the little boy I met back then.

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,069
It's already in the past, Mia.

12
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,571
Would it change anything?

13
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:32,615
I want you.

14
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,951
You and me.

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,248
Let's have dinner.

16
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,376

Patrick.

20
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,812
Did you see Miss Mia?

21
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,730
No?

22
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,191
Look at this.

23
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,985
I got a picture with her.

24
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,071
She's so beautiful.

25
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,366
I'm going to send that to our group chat.

26
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,493
My friends will be so jealous.

27
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,870
Destiny brings us together.

28
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,375
She'll come back, right?

29
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,293
Her father is one of our patients.

30
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,297
Patrick.

00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,299
Hey!

34
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,140
You should get on with your rounds.

35
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,350
Wow.

36
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,020
You're even stricter than Miss Eden.

37
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,480
You're not my boss.

- Hi.

What are you doing here?

44
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,550
The nurse said you were here, so…

45
00:02:58,803 --> 00:02:59,721
Wow.

One touch. Please. Let me touch it.

50

- Mia.
- I'll be quick.

51
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,984
No need to be conservative.

52
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,236
We're alone in here.

Eden, aren't you going to do something?

65

If you have too
many patients to look after,

66
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,383
let me take care of Samuel.

Ma'am Eden,
you may administer his medicine.

Doctor Emman will be here shortly.

71

There's a standing

Answering a question
with another question?

90
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,125
Fine.

Vegetables. For my brother.

You know, Matmat can
have dinner at our place,

I was going to ask you earlier,

171
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,130
has the doctor assessed Matmat already?

172
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,884
Yeah, but he said he'll
need a lot more sessions.

173
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,761
Then?

174
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,930
Then I dropped Matmat off.

00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,675
Let me carry that.

190
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,844
- No, thank you.
- Come on.

191
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,305
Come on, beautiful.

192
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,681
Aren't you happy to see me?

193
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,976
Madeth, Mia shouldn't go to Maravida.

194
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,437
I'm so sorry, boss.

195
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,981
Why didn't you say she was going there?

196
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,359
I had no idea she'd go there, boss.

197
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,487
I just told her Nurse Patrick works there.

198
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,156
Book the earliest flight you can find.

199
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,866
Huh? Really, boss?

200
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,369
Miss Mia hates her father that much?

201
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,539
Madeth, you don't understand.

202
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,958
Fine, her father is in that hospital.

203
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,876
She might not visit him.

204
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,711
But for her to stay in the mansion?

205
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,674
[pensive music playing]

206
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,175
[Vincent] She shouldn't.

207
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:06,392
[grim music playing]

208
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:18,821
- [footsteps thud]
- [leaves rustle]

209
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:23,367
[keys clang, echo]

210
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,911
[padlock clangs, echoes]

211
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:34,920
- [padlock clangs, clicks]
- [keys jangling]

212
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,966
[chain clattering]

213
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,304
[Madeth] Why not, if the house is fine?

214
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,682
[gate creaking]

215
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:52,897
[pensive music continues]

216
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,612
- [leaves rustling]
- [wind blowing]

217
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,490
[Vincent] One of the most
beautiful ancestral mansions

218
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,409
in the southern part of
the Philippines is owned by them.

219
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,706
You can even
consider it as a national treasure.

220
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,334
But it became a haunted house.

221
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,257
[Madeth] There are a lot of people
who want to buy haunted houses.

222
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,009
Miss Mia can just sell it.

223
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,261
[Vincent] I wish it was that easy.

224
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,557
But the broker can't sell
it because of the house's history,

225
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,979
because of all the bad
things that happened before.

226
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,066
[Madeth] Huh?

227
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,403
What happened to Miss Mia's family?

228
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,243
[Vincent] There are some
stories you shouldn't uncover.

229
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,954
[pensive music continues]

230
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:54,124
[Vincent] There are some things
only the family can face.

231
00:13:55,668 --> 00:14:02,174
[dramatic music playing]

232
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:24,196
[dramatic music continues]

233
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,508
[dramatic music fades]

234
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,720
[door clacks, creaks]

235
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:03,110
[unsettling music playing]

[unsettling music continues]

239
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,552
[wind quietly blowing]

240
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:31,115
[unsettling music continues]

241
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:48,257
[unsettling music builds]

242
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,678
- [door creaks open]
- [music fades]

243
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:57,141
[cicadas chirping]

244
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:03,313
[eerie music playing]

245
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,081
[figurine thuds]

246
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,628
[Dr. Anok] You need to understand
that the brain tumor

247
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,255
is making your dad's condition worse.

248
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,924
How is that my concern?

249
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:39,058
[eerie music continues]

250
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,479
[phone chimes]

251
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:52,321
"JONAH GARCIA: THE WITCH'S
STORY ISN'T OVER! GIVE IT TO US."

252
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,286
[phone thuds]

253
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,456
[music turns somber]

254
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,832
- Ugh!
- [thuds]

255
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:10,756
[coughing]

256
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,759
[sighs deeply]

257
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,143
I'm hungry.

258
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,938
[somber music fades]

259
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,399
[Jason] That's crazy.
The sea looks amazing from here.

260
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,567
It's amazing in the morning.

261
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,194
- Really?
- Yeah!

262
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,278
It does in the morning.

263
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,864
Hey, Patrick. Dig in.

264
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,990
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

265
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,203
Food tastes better when it's hot.

266
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,746
Pass me your plate.

267
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,040
[waves lapping]

268
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,291
[plates clattering]

269
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,296
Do you not like the food I've prepared?

270
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,758
Oh, that's not what I mean. Uh…

271
00:18:56,426 --> 00:19:00,597
I'm just not used to
someone taking care of us.

272
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,684
- [utensils clattering]
- Oh.

273
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,105
Mama. Mama, thank you for

274
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,275
giving Matmat food,
making him full, and also…

275
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,027
your food tastes amazing.

276
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,738
Your welcome, Matmat.

277
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,574
[Jason] Doesn't it taste amazing, Patrick?

278
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,995
[pensive music playing]

279
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,496
[Tessie] Be careful. It's hot.

280
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,499
You look hungry.

281
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,334
This will be tasty.

282
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:38,844
[pensive music continues]

283
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,097
[Tessie] Here we go.
Dig in while it's hot.

284
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,390
But eat slowly, okay?

285
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,851
- [engine humming]
- Are you hungry?

286
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,522
Mm-hmm! Here it is!

287
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,149
Thank you.

288
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,817
Dig in, everyone.

289
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,611
Wait, wait, it's hot. It's hot.

290
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,947
- Ooh, aah, it's hot.
- Sorry, sorry, dear.

291
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,116
You two eat first. Come on, eat up.

292
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,413
- [slurping]
- Is that okay?

293
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,291
- Is it still too hot?
- Not anymore, Mama!

294
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,544
It's still hot. The food's still hot.

295
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,463
- Mama.
- It might be too hot.

296
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,715
- Oh, wait. Okay?
- [slurping]

297
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,472
[Jason] I'm sure you guys
will love my new business idea.

298
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,058
Mmm, I'll sell grilled chicken.

299
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,268
- Ooh.
- [Matmat] No thanks!

300
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,437
That'll just taste like beef stew.

301
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,481
- What's not to love, Matmat?
- [laughing]

302
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,067
It's a combination of
grilled chicken and beef stew!

303
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,612
- [utensils clattering]
- Here's some rice.

304
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,240
Do you want to get coffee after we eat?

305
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,159
- [chuckles] Coffee?
- Mm-hmm.

306
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,329
We might not fall asleep. Maybe tomorrow.

307
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,334
[chuckles] Yeah, you're right.

308
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,295
- [Jason] Thank you!
- [Mama Li] There's plenty of rice.

309
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,881
- [Mama Li] Dear, there's more rice here.
- [Jason] Thank you, ma'am.

310
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:05,097
[fan whirring]

311
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,851
[gentle music playing]

312
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,814
- [young Matmat crying]
- [thunder roars]

313
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:18,610
- [Patrick crying]
- [Matmat] butterflies!

314
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:39,589
[gentle music continues]

315
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:50,017
[Mia] In the middle of the forest,
there is a palace.

316
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,021
Within the palace lives a princess

317
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,317
who's fallen into
a deep sleep for many years.

318
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,361
[ominous music playing]

319
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,364
Once she pricks her finger,
death will befall her.

320
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:08,118
[water sloshing]

321
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,663
This curse was cast
upon her by an evil witch

322
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,583
on the day she was born.

323
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,753
[water sloshing]

324
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:23,091
The king destroyed and
outlawed every needle across the land.

325
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,594
- All to avoid the witch's curse.
- [footsteps thudding, splashing]

326
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,637
[footsteps accelerate]

327
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:33,727
[wind blowing]

328
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,230
[door creaks]

329
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:43,361
- [wind blowing]
- [ominous music continues]

330
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:51,995
[sinister music playing]

331
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:57,084
[wind blowing]

332
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,258
But the princess was pricked…

333
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,428
- [wind whistling]
- [gasps heavily]

334
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,056
by a thorn from
the rose the witch gave her

335
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,517
while disguised as a fairy.

336
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,478
[quivered breaths]]

337
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:23,568
[unsettling noises playing]

338
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,198
Rather than dying…

339
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,450
the princess fell into a deep sleep.

340
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,956
This story serves as a reminder
that no matter what happens…

341
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,128
you cannot escape your destiny.

342
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,756
- [panicked breaths]
- [sinister noises playing]

343
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,466
[ominous music sting]

344
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:51,054
And a kiss from the prince you love…

345
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,431
[muffled sobbing]

346
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,393
is not strong enough to change your fate.

347
00:23:56,476 --> 00:24:02,607
[whimpering]

348
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,069
[woman] Because I will kill him…

349
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,738
before he finds you!

350
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,657
[sniffling]

351
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:17,747
- [evil laughing]
- [sinister music continues]

352
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,963
- [music ends]
- [evil laughing continues]

353
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,214
[Patrick] Is he a new patient?

354
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,465
He's an old one.

355
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,261
I don't know where to go.
I just keep running and running.

356
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,930
They all stopped. Do I still have to run?

357
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:38,518
All the missing things always show up
right when you need them the most.

358
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,854
Who here believes in fairy tales?

359
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:45,692
[woman] And a kiss
from the prince you love…

360
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,486
is not strong enough to change your fate.

361
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,780
Because I'll be the one to kill him.
