<i>Gemma, I don't understand.</i>

199
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,592
<i>You meant for me to go see Mia, huh?</i>

200
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,720
<i>So we could reconcile?</i>

201
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,889

00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,916
Patrick, I'm really sorry. I'm so sorry.

230
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,252
Gemma, it's fine. Forget it.
