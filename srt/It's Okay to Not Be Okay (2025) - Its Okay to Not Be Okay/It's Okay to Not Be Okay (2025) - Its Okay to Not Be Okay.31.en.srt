00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,002
[Matmat stammers]
Ever since Patrick was a kid,

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,421
this has been his favorite.

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,339
We used to come here with

4
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,550
Mama every payday.

5
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:09,968
So, it's the nostalgia.

6
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,052
Now, I get it.

7
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,512
Patrick cut your hair?

8
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,180
I just helped Mia.

9
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,977
[Bella] Kai, we can't keep
sneaking around like this.

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,229
You knew our relationship
was forbidden from the start.

11
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:24,357
If they find out, they might send
one of us to a different hospital.

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,819
You were hiding in there, weren't you?

13
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:40,123
[theme music playing]

14
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,589
[birds chirping]

15
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,801
[chuckles slightly]

16
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,845
[chuckles awkwardly] You saw us.

17
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,435
I've helped Kai
change clothes so many times.

18
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,437
Obviously,

19
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,607
I already know
his scent and his mannerisms.

20
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,819
[hesitates]

21
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,071
Patrick, don't rat us out. Please!

22
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:58,451
You both know relationships
aren't allowed here in the hospital.

23
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,704
So you're saying
the hospital doesn't want us to love?

24
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,623
Bella, that's different.

25
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,583
The hospital,

26
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,002
just wants you both
to focus on your treatments.

27
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,380
Once you're well, you can leave,

28
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,883
and no one will stop
you from loving whoever you want.

29
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,803
Patrick, I don't want to leave.

30
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,012
Not yet!

31
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,557
I want to be with Kai. Wherever Kai is,

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,599
that's where I'll be.

33
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,976
So, I'm staying.

34
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,895
Me too, Patrick.
So please, don't tell on us.

35
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:32,360
[gentle music playing]

36
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,577
[cries, sobs]

37
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,329
He's mad. [cries, sobs]

38
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,959
- That's your fault.
- That made me nervous.

39
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:52,422
- [music fades]
- [lightly taps laptop]

40

[playful music playing]

42
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,449
So, this is how it's going to be?

43
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,618
[chuckles slightly]

44
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,082
[door slides open, slides shut]

45
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,002
Isn't it too early for
Patrick to head home?

46
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,339
Oh, Matmat.

47
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:40,678
[playful music continues]

48
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,015
[Mia] Matmat?

49
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,809
Matmat, aren't you
coming to work with me?

50
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,145
No, Miss Mia. I'll just work tomorrow.

51
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:55,109
[playful music continues]

52
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,033
[playful music ends]

53
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,994
Nurse, let me do that.

54
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,589
[Eden sighs heavily]

55
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,969
Samuel,

56
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,596
You need to eat.

57
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,933
Just a few bites, come on.

58
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,397
Why haven't you gone home yet?

59
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,156
Do you know where you are right now?

60
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,287
Hospital.

61
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,755
My daughter's not home yet.

62
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,842
So, I'm staying here at the hospital

63
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,511
until she gets back.

64
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,597
Your daughter?

65
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,144
What is she doing?

66
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,938
[somber music playing]

67
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:14,939
Right now?

68
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,359
Writing.

69
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,864
My daughter loves stories.

70
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,075
But you're a nurse.

71
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,330
[somber music continues]

72
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,498
Does her father…

73
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,959
…write too?

74
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,338
No.

75
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,176
Her father has a business.

76
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,845
But he's gone now.

77
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,725
He's not with us anymore.

78
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,020
He's been gone a long time.

79
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,564
Even so…

80
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,736
he's always in our hearts.

81
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,949

[knocking]

85
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,967
Matmat?

86
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,971
[rapid knocking]

87
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,765
C-Come in. Come in.

[doors thud]

89
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,187
Matmat, are you okay?

90
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,107
You were all jolly earlier.

91
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,192
Now you're not.

92
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,361
Hmm…

93
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,656
Matmat's just t-tired.

94
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,911
[tense music swells]

95
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,915
[chuckles]

96
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:01,003
Why, why do you have Satsat? That's ours.

97
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,847
He's mine.

98
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,808
- Patrick gave him to me.
- [Matmat whimpers]

99
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,227
No.

100
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:22,525
P-Patpat gave Satsat
to help with Matmat's n-nightmares.

101
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:27,613
H-He's not yours.
Satsat's our little brother.

102
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,910
[exhales deeply]

103
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,831
[whispers] Patrick
told me not to fight with him.

104
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,667
Don't fight.

105
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,299
Matmat.

106
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,385
You're not even using him.

107
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,013
I'm his sibling now.

108
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,347
[quirky music playing]

109
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,476
Matmat, Patpat, Satsat!

110
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,479
Your name's not even in there!

111
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:03,065
So what? Do our names
have to sound alike to be siblings?!

112
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,485
Matmat, stop it!

113
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,446
Give Satsat back… [whimpers]

114
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,323
…and Matmat will stop.

115
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,201
- No! This is mine!
- [whimpers]

116
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,535
- That's ours!
- This is mine!

117
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,786
- He's ours!
- No, mine!

118
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,205
Matmat, stop it!

119
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,623
- Give it to me!
- This is mine!

120
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,082
- Mine! Mine!
- I said this is mine!

121
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,459
- It's mine!
- He's mine! Let go!

122
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,169
- Mine!
- This is mine!

123
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,879
- [Matmat grunts]
- Let go!

124

- [Matmat grunts]
- This is mine!

125
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,633
- No! This is mine!
- He's mine!

126
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,800
[Matmat] Let go!

127
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,553
- This is mine! Satsat!
- Give it to me!

128
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,472
This is mine!

129
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,308
- Let it go!
- Matmat, I said let go!

You're mean, Miss Mia!

136
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,038
You're so mean, Miss Mia!

137
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,374
You broke Satsat!

[music ends]

153
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:55,970
Miss, Miss Mia took Satsat!
She… she won't give him back!

154
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,680
- Because he's mine!
- [Matmat whimpers]

155
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,099
I told him you gave Satsat to me,

156
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,768
but he said I can't be Satsat's sibling!

157
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,562
- Satsat is mine!
- He is mine!

158
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,147
- Satsat is mine!
- [Patrick] Enough!

160

[quirky music continues]

165
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,416
You two fight like siblings.

166
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,169
You shouldn't be fighting over Satsat.
He's a good boy, right?

167
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,212
[stammers] Miss Mia isn't!

168
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,716
She's ugly because she cut her hair.

169
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,303
She's not nice because she took Satsat!

170
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,639
It's my fault now?! Who started it, huh?!

171
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,350
You said I couldn't fight with him!

172
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,393
- Isn't this a fight already?
- I was just defending myself!

173
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,314
[quirky music continues]

174
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,440
Give me that.

175
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,067
No!

176
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,488
I made Satsat, so give him to me.

[quirky music continues]

178
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,953

[Matmat whimpering]

180

You are all unfair!

192
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,817
Me again?!

193
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,236

Yes.

212
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,006
It's about love.

213

Olivia?

218

She's the one who gave you the letter?

219
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,534
Where's Olivia?

220
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,330
- I want her--
- You want her to what?

221
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,707
I want her to be
the one to take care of me.

222
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,083
[Eden] Samuel.

223
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,589
Samuel, I'm your nurse.

224
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,259
Why do you want Nurse Olivia instead?

[stammering] She was hurting Satsat.

239
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,500
You shouldn't have given him away.
She's hurting him.

240
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,421
You know why I made Satsat, right?

241
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,134
For my nightmares.

242
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,512
Because of the butterflies.

243
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,391
That's why I gave it to Mia.

244
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,352
Because Mia gets nightmares.

246

You don't like her anymore?

249
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,035
Before,

250
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,997
I liked her because she's pretty

251
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,207
and she writes beautiful stories.

252
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,086
So you don't find her pretty anymore?

253
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,257
[tender music continues]

254
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,634
Because…

255
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,889
She's getting what's mine.
She's getting what's mine.

256
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,391
She got Satsat now, what happens if…

257
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,272
What if she also gets
the other things I have?

258
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,321
Matmat, Mia's not
going to take everything.

259
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,784
[stammers] Are you sure of that,
Patpat? [sniffles]

260
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,663
[Patrick] Yeah.

She can have Satsat.

272
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,834
But she can't take Patpat from me.

273
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,837

279
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,115
I don't know how
you can't be angry at him.

280
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,618
The way he acted earlier. If I were you,

281
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,912
I would've screamed at him.

282
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,581
I've gotten used to it.

283
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,584
You got used to not showing emotions?

284
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,839
He made you chase him,
he beat you and he doesn't listen to you.

285
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,425
How do you stay calm?

286
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,596
I'm the one who can control my emotions,

287
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,015
so I should be more patient.

288
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,310

And you are my safety pin
who makes sure I don't explode.

294
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,876
You really are my safety pin.

295

I just wanted to check on Samuel.

00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,061
Can't we be friends?

363
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,729
I said leave!

364
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,648
I don't want to be with
someone like you! Leave!

365
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:26,446
[morose music continues]

366
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,156
[Patrick sniffles]

367
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:36,248
- [sniffling]
- [morose music continues]

368
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,009
[doors open]

369
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:52,931
[crickets chirping distantly]

370
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:56,977
[Patrick sighs]

371
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,954
[pensive music playing]

372
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:22,752
- [young Matmat sobbing]
- [young Patrick weeps]

373
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:23,837
Matmat?

374
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,298
- [thunder rumbling]
- [foreboding music playing]

375
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,216
- Where's Mama?
- Mama!

376
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,262
Mama! Mama!

377
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,556
- Mama! Mama!
- Where is she? Matmat!

378
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,557
Mama!

379
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,392
[thunder rumbling]

380
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:40,937
- Butterflies! Butterflies!
- [rain patters]

381
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,190
[Matmat] Butterflies!

382
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:47,611
- Ma! Ma! Mama!
- [thunder rumbling]

383
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:56,494
- [young Matmat screaming]
- [foreboding music turns ominous]

384
00:24:56,578 --> 00:25:00,874
[Matmat] Butterflies! Butterflies!
The butterfly is coming back!

385
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,210
Ma! Ma!

386
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:09,299
[Patrick crying] Ma! Ma! Mama!

387
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,092
[young Matmat] Butterflies!

388
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,554
[breathes deeply] Hmm.

389
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,973
[Matmat whimpers]

390
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:22,938
[ominous music continues]

391
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:29,569
[ominous music crescendos]

392
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,656
[Pogi] That could only mean two things.

393
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,574
She likes you and you have a problem.

394
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,576
Do you have any problems aside from her?

395
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,704
You can have Satsat.

396
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,708
That's the last thing
you can take from Matmat.

397
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,878
I won't let you steal my patient.

398
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,380
I can take care of him better than you.

399
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,049
You're acting as if you know them

400
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:54,803
Why? Do you know me
well enough to talk to me like that?
