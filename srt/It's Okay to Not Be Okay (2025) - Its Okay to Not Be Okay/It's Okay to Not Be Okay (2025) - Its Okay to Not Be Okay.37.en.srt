179
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,341
To be honest, this is your fault.

180
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,551
How's it my fault?

181
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,762
Patrick, if you didn't hit my ex, then,

182
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,140
then there wouldn't be any trouble.

183
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,435
Papa wouldn't have
dragged me out of the hospital.

184
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,104
Uh, bro…

185
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,148
When you punched Bella's ex,

186
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,400
I said to myself,

187
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,528
if Patrick who always watches his temper

188
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,155
couldn't hold it anymore,

189
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,284
maybe I should also not
hold back my feelings for Bella.

190

["Bakit Naman Hindi" instrumental playing]

191

[clapping] It's true.

192
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,998
They're right.

193
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,334
You are to blame for all of this.

194
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,045
That's why

195
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,671
I already paid for your rooms.

196
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,007
And also our room.

197
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,300
Really, Miss Mia?

198
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,594
Thank you, Miss Mia!
Thank you! Thank you so much!

199
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,262
- You're welcome.
- You're the best!

200
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,765
I can't stay here overnight.

201
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,350
You're going to leave them?

202
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,061
If we go,
you're going to leave your patients.

203
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,647
Technically, I'm suspended.
Why should I look after them?

204
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,190
If you're suspended,

205
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,360
why are you insisting on
getting Kai back to the hospital?

206
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,988
Yeah, bro. Miss Mia is right.

Come on, Patrick.

209
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,706
You were the one
who inspired them to do all this.

210
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,541
Let's stay here for the night.

211
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,003
Then first thing tomorrow,
we'll get Kai back to the hospital.

- Have a seat.
- [Gemma] Hello, Matmat.

217
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,647
Where's Patrick?

218
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,150
Uh, he's not here.
He has to go to Montanesa.

219
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,610
That's why Matmat is staying here.

Patpat has to go somewhere.

He'll be home late.

223
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,452
Ah!

224
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,497
Matmat, how's your job working with Mia?

225
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,957
Have you done a lot?

226
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,710
W-We haven't done any.

227
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,922
Because she hasn't had any ideas yet.

228
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,842
But I gained a best friend.

229
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,677
Really? You're best friends now?

230
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,929
I-It's Mia.

231
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:06,434
She said we're best friends.
She's my bestie now.

232
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:11,730
If you guys are best friends,
you should invite her here.

233
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,150
She's not here.

I-I don't know. She also went out.

237
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,828
Huh? Both of them are gone?

238
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,748
Maybe Patrick and Miss Mia are together?

Oh, please, Madeth.

241
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,343
Are you a writer too like Mia?
You're making such plot twists.

242
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,096
No. Just maybe, right?

243
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,806
Patrick went out and Miss Mia too.

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,100
And wherever Patrick is,
Miss Mia's there too.

- Say 'ahh'.

Ah! Very good. There.

00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,567
- Oh, Madeth.
- Just maybe.

Just maybe.

Patrick, look.

The owner gave it to us.

261
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,163
It's flavored coconut liquor.

262
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,748
Do you think it's safe to drink?

263
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,669
Maybe it's a local product.

tell the funeral
parlor to do my makeup well

or else my spirit won't be at peace.

What are you doing?

Matmat is just
drawing before going to sleep.

Are you on your way home, Patpat?

278

No, it's uh…

282

[melancholic music continues]

283
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,860
I need to accompany someone.

284
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,696
Uh, a patient.

285
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,157

Are you at M-Mama Li's?

No, but I'm okay, Matmat.

O-Okay.

00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:22,671
Wake up early tomorrow
so you can commute faster.

290
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,466
Okay, Matmat.

291
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,720
Don't forget to brush your teeth
and your hair before bed. Okay?

292
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,891
Matmat knows that.
I can take care of myself.

293
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,227
Okay. Call me if you need me.

What are you saying?

I feel like a mistress
you're hiding from the legal wife

306
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,515
because you haven't told
Matmat that you're here with me.

308

and the wife ever been besties?

But thank you.

310
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,442
For being your secret lover?

For being Matmat's friend.

312

You're welcome.

[cicadas chirping]

316
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,166
I think this calls for a celebration.

317
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,419
Let's drink?

- What's wrong? Um…
- [dish water trickling]

Is your body tired?

322
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,237
Or did your heart get tired after hearing

323
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,490
that Mia and Patrick might be together?

[sullen music playing]

325
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,368
You said it yourself, right?

326
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,579
We're not meant for each other.

327
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,041

I'm not saying I still have hope.

But it's still hard to accept.

[gasps]

334
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,564
For me, this is what I believe in.

335
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,817
While you're still alive,
there's always hope.

336
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,821
But I hope I don't lose hope
when it comes to being with you.

337

There's no use. Madeth's in the bathroom.

- Hurry, come over here.
- Miss Li, hey!

339
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,668
Don't bother them. They might be
talking about something important.

340
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,712
Mama Li, that's not fair.

341
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,006
- Biases are for K-Pop fans.
- Shh!

342
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,508
What are you trying to say?

343
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,179
How come Vincent gets to
flirt with Gemma and I don't?

344
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,681
Okay, okay. I understand.

345
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,768
I'm all for whoever
my daughter wants, right?

346
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,897
But for now, maybe sit this one out?

347
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,149
Alright? Come on.

348
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,902
Let's go get some fresh air.
You look like you need it.

349
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,403
Come on, come on.

350
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,905
I'll even come with you.

351
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,406
[quirky music fades]

352
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,492
Has anyone ever told
you how annoying you are?

353
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,912
Of course. Many times.

354
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,624
But I don't really see it as a bad thing.

355
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,920
I see it as part of my
many endearing qualities.

356

You know, the thing about Mia.

368

She won't admit it,

Just like Patrick, I guess.

He's good at hiding his feelings.

He's good at avoiding his problems.

374
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,152
He's good at keeping secrets.

375
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,323
Maybe that's why
he's a good match for Mia.
