1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,711
I think I did a great job.

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,212
Where's my prize?

3
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:06,297
Good job, Mia. I'm proud of you.

4
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,050
Do you think Matmat will like my new hair?

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,051
Ugly.

6
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,386
What's wrong with it?

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,930
Patrick did a good job cutting my hair.

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,265
Patrick cut your hair?

9
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,975
I just helped Mia.

10
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:20,520
No matter what Matmat says,
I really like my hair.

11
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,563
So, from now on,

12
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:24,023
I want you to be the only one to cut it.

13
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:24,983
Okay.

14
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,694
Pogi! What's going on with you?

15
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:30,321
Lack of sleep, exhaustion, everything!

16
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,157
Sir Samuel kept us busy last night.

17
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,744
I heard her. She was humming.

18
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,829
Who? Your wife?

19
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,540
[humming]

20
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:45,336
I went out to get some fresh air
around that time, but I didn't see him.

21
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,506
So when you went out
to get some fresh air,

22
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,383
were you humming?

23
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:57,640
[theme music playing]

24
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,981
Was there,

25
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,068
someone humming last night?

26
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,823
Uh, maybe you heard something?

27
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,366
[birds chirping]

28
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,537
Maybe…

29
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,163
[gasps]

30
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:06,167
Maybe, it was the ghost!

31
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,462
They say there's a ghost here.

32
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,131
[somber music playing]

33
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,632
Maybe it was her.

34
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,634
Maybe she was the one singing.

35
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:21,975
[somber music continues]

36
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:32,610
[somber music turns unsettling]

37
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,779
[sinister chuckle]

38
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,032
What's so funny?

39
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,119
Nothing.

40
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,579
[chuckles]

41
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,955
It's just,

42
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,125
before they didn't care.

43
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,294
Now…

44
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,047
they're starting to notice her.

45
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,301
[unsettling music continues]

46
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,677
Who are you talking about?

47
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,179
The…

48
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,224
ghost.

49
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:09,188
[unsettling music continues]

50
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,523
[Zelda chuckles]

51
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:21,034
[unsettling music intensifies]

52
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,747
[thuds]

53
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,167
[unsettling music crescendos]

54
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,964
[Patrick] Do you think she's lying?

55
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,384
Because of my work,

56
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,803
I'm used to reading people.

57
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,015
And from what Zelda exhibited earlier,

58
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,142
she's hiding something.

59
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,563
But why would she hide
it if she knew it was just a song?

60
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,607
I'm not really sure.

61
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,859
Maybe she has a deeper reason.

62
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,362
Can I ask you for a favor?

63
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,572
What is it?

64
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,116
Keep an eye on Zelda.

65
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:07,330
Report back to me even
the tiniest detail you notice.

66
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,707
But just between us, okay?

67
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,877
[hesitates] Outside my job?

68
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,046
Uh, I guess you could say that.

69
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,632
Just tell me what you want in return.

70
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,300
[bright music playing]

71
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,510
Anything?

72
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,804
Name your price.

73
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:26,808
[bright music continues]

74
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,019
[bright music intensifies, fades]

75
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,107
[Mia] Matmat?

76
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,483
Are you leaving?

77
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,070
Yes, Miss Mia.

78
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,322
You're leaving without saying goodbye?

79
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,448
[quirky music playing]

80
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,118
I'm leaving now Miss Mia. Bye-bye.

81
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,703
Wait, where are you going?

82
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,538
[quirky music continues]

83
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,582
I… I'm meeting up with Patrick.

84
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,293
Bye-bye.

85
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,920
Where? What are you
and Patrick going to do?

86
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,008
I'm going to eat with Patpat, bye-bye!

87
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,551
I'm coming.

88
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,429
Coming where?

89
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,222
With you and Patrick.

90
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,141
With me and Patpat?

91
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,934
Can I come?

92
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:14,188
[quirky music continues]

93
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,690
[whimpers]

94
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:16,941
[quirky music ends]

95
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,235
[Matmat] The food's here!

96
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,321
Let's eat.

97
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,117
- Patpat, let's eat.
- [Patrick] It's still hot.

98
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,785
Miss Mia, eat.

99
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,539
[Patrick] Garlic?

100
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,917
[Mia] Why do you eat here?

101
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,794
Why?

102
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,005
There are so many other restaurants.

103
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,553
This is Patpat's favorite.

104
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,848
Why this one?

105
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,686
Haven't you eaten here before?

106
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,649
Try it.

107
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:08,034
[Matmat] Ever since Patpat was a kid,
this has been his favorite.

108
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,246
We used to come here,

109
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,249
with Mama every payday.

110
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:21,798
[sentimental music playing]

111
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,139
So, it's the nostalgia.

112
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,100
Now, I get it.

113
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:39,690
[sentimental music continues]

114
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,109
Are you crying?

115
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,737
Is it really that good?

116
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:50,993
[sentimental music continues]

117
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,667
Mmm.

118
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,752
It is good.

119
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,547
I get now why it's your favorite.

120
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,051
It's still Patpat's favorite, even now.

121
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,386
[sentimental music fades]

122
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,720
[Mia] How about you, Matmat?

123
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,889
Is this your favorite, too?

124
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,186
When Matmat puts in a lot of garlic.

125
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:22,692
But if you eat too much garlic,
your breath will stink.

126
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,777
- [chuckles]
- [Matmat] You need to brush your teeth

127
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,947
- so your breath won't stink!

- [thunder continues rumbling]

135
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,642
[Patrick] Be careful.

136
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,395
Matmat might not get
a ride now that it's raining.

137
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,688
Matmat, wait!

138
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,442
[playful music continues]

139
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,653
Did you have lots of garlic, Patpat?

140
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,323
- [Patrick] I didn't.
- Hey!

141
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,825
Wait for me!

142
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:20,583
[Matmat] Miss Mia had lots of garlic.

143
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,293
She's going to have bad breath.

[Patrick] Be careful, Matmat.

150

[Mia] Bye, Matmat!

Let's have coffee.

154
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,882
I have to go back to the hospital.

155
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,093
- Go back later.
- But I'll be late.

156
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,388
[huffs] Why didn't
you bring the car anyway?

157
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:19,392
[Patrick] I can't take
your car for my plans with Matmat.

[Li] I hope you're
okay with the food I cooked.

161
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,784
This is a lot, but I won't say no.

162
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,536
I hope I'm not imposing.

163
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,496
- But I'll take what you offer.
- [both chuckle]

164
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,249
That's to make up for Gemma troubling you.

165
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,709
Oh, that's nothing.

166
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:48,796
I actually want to thank you for not
thinking I'm a bad person. [chuckles]

167
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,215
We did consider reporting you.

[chokes]

169
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,387
But you brought my Gemma home so,

170
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,681
I guess you're a good person.

Thank you for not reporting me. [chuckles]

174
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,357
You don't look like you're from Maravida.

175
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,067
Did you just move here?

176
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,070
You could say that.

177
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,156
Actually Auntie,

[both giggle]

179
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,909
I have a small favor to ask you.

180
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,411
Uh…

00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,333
If it's something I can do, I'll help.

Dear, that guy helped you
when you were out of it from drinking.

I'm only returning his kindness.

189

Ma, we don't even know him.

190
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,105
What if he turns out to be dangerous?

191
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:52,151
Dear, I reviewed
the CCTV where you passed by.

192
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:56,447
My gosh, I thought he'd carried you
from the compound, but it was way farther!

193
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,867
You should be thankful
someone with a kind heart saw you.

194
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,036
Who knows whose place
you could've ended up in?

195
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,456
Ma, we can help in other ways

196

without letting them stay at our house.

197
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,377
He won't be living in our house.

198
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,836
He's going to rent.

199
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,505
That's pretty much the same.

200
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,715
We'll still see each
other around the compound.

Hold on a sec.

202
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,343
Why are you so against it?

203
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,803
Is it because you're embarrassed

204
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,473
or you feel conscious
because you've got a crush on him?

205
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,642
Ma! He might hear you.

206

If he fails to pay properly,
I'll ask him to move out.

please be nice to him, okay?

00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,858
[sighs]

368
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,402
I think I'll sleep here.

369
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,823
I thought you were going home?

370
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,826
[clears throat]
I'm way too exhausted, Patrick.

371
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,953
I just need a quick nap.

372
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,040
Why not sleep in the quarters?

373
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,208
I already tried.

374
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,212
I just couldn't get any rest
with all that pacing going on.

375
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,088
But here?

376
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,840
[blanket flapping]

377
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,508
No one will bother me.

378
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,011
- [exhales sharply]
- [Patrick] Alright.

379
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,471
Your helmet's in the locker room.

380
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,597
Sure.

381
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,684
[door closes]

382
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:44,576
[comical music playing]

383
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,787
[Kai whispers] I'll go first.

384
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,966
[Bella whispers] Ouch! Ow!

385
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,635
Be careful! You're hurting me!

386
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:17,901
[comical music continues]

387
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,420
[coughing]

388
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:43,510
[comical music continues]

389
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,015
- [door opens]
- [music ends]

390
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,350
[birds chirping]

391
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,697
Let's go!

392
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,199
Hurry!

393
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,037
- Come on!
- Time to go.

394
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,748
Good thing no one caught us.

395
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,625
- Nurse Pogi just had to sleep there.
- I know! It was really intense!

396
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,002
[Patrick] Really now?

397
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,130
You were hiding in there, weren't you?

398
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:24,593
[ominous music playing]

399
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:34,519
[ominous music swells, fades]

400
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,563
I've been tied down
to this place for so long

401
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,774
that freedom seems impossible now.

402
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,526
- [Mia] What's this?
- It'll keep your nightmares at bay.

403
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,446
She's already dead,
but she still lingers here.

404
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,073
I am my daughter's daughter.

405
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,783
But she doesn't control my life.

406
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,117
What's going on with Mia?

407
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,953
This never would've
happened if you'd paid closer attention.

408
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,832
It could've been avoided
if you hadn't insisted that Mia come here.

409
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,877
You talk as if you truly know them.

410
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,837
How come you never lost your cool?

411
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,547
When you fall in love,

412
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,008
you strive to become a better person.

413
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,762
Stop, Patpat!
It's wrong to hurt other people, right?

414
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,264
You requested for me to come back.

415
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,518
That's the last thing
you can take from me.

416
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,019
This is all I want.

417
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,814
No matter what, I'll always be with you.

418
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,190
Whenever I close my eyes,

419
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,442
her face is all I can see.

420
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,487
Just a simple glance
from her takes my breath away.

421
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,322
I don't like Miss Mia anymore.

422
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,865
She's taking what's mine.

423
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,826
I won't let her take Patpat from me.

424
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,953
Stop this, Matmat!

425
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,454
Go away, Miss Mia!

426
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,998
Never! He's mine!
