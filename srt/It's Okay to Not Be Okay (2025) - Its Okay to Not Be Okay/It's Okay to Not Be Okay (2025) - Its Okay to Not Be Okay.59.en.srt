<i>You're just a nurse!</i>

<i>I am not just a nurse!</i>

4
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:11,302
<i>I'm the only one who truly</i>

5
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,512
<i>You can let Olivia go.</i>

6
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,888
<i>What if she's your mom?</i>

7
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,890
<i>Don't you think it's</i>

8
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,559
<i>she wants to have Sir Samuel with her?</i>

9
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,853
<i>Why is she so interested in your dad?</i>

10
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:23,106
<i>When I say my mother is dead, she's dead.</i>

00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,024
<i>Time of death: 9:12.</i>

12
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,986
<i>- Samuel died because of you.</i>
<i>- No!</i>

13
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:31,740
[Matmat] <i>Is Mia sad?</i>
<i>Is that what sadness looks like?</i>

14
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:35,744

[breathing sharply]

18
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,309
[stuttering] I didn't…

19
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:45,814
M-Matmat didn't draw that.

20
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,734
M-Matmat wouldn't draw that.

21
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,113
The butterflies are following Matmat!

22
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:57,033
[sobbing] The butterflies
are following Matmat!

23
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,703
The butterflies who killed Mama
are after Matmat!

24
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:05,291
[crying] The woman was wearing that!

25
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,795
- Matmat doesn't want that!
- Matmat, breathe. Breathe.

26
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,506
I don't want that!

27
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,716
S-She'll kill us, Patpat!

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,301
No, no. I'm here.

00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:19,848
[crying hysterically]
She will! I hate it! I hate it!

30
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,600
We'll face the butterfly together,
remember Matmat?

[melancholic music continues]

32
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,107
That butterfly…

33
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,571
killed your mother?

34
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,489
[ominous music sting]

35
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,952
I hate it, Patpat!

36
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,748
- [Matmat crying]
- [Patrick] Matmat, breathe.

37
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,208
[Patrick] We'll face the butterfly.

38
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,752
[Matmat] I don't want to be here, Patpat!

39
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,421
[Patrick] Mia!

40
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,256
[Patrick] Doc, Aunt Li.

41
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,551
D-Don't leave me!

42
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:02,390
Dr. Anok, that's what
Matmat was telling you about!

43
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,311
No one can hurt you here. We're here.
No one will hurt you.

[melancholic music fades]

48
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,778
[sobbing] I know that butterfly.

49
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,448
Because it's one of a kind.

50
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,204
The person who designed that…

51
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,209
is my mother.

52
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:35,006
- [unsettling music playing]
- [Ingrid humming]

53
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,017
[Mia] <i>We're the only ones</i>
<i>who knew about that design.</i>

54
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,732
And now Matmat is saying…

55
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,569
that the woman who killed
your mother was wearing it?

56
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,531
[unsettling music continues]

57
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,033
Yes, Mia but--

58
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,161
And now it's on the mural.

59
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,748
What could that mean, Patrick?

60
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,587
[Matmat] Patpat!

61
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,674
Don't leave me, Patpat!

62
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,051
- Go back to Matmat.
- [music fades]

63
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,595
He's more important.

64
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,056
Leave me alone!

65
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,309
I need time to think.

66
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,730
Don't follow me.

67
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,317
I can handle myself.

68
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,695
[sniffles]

69
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,990

[music ends]

73
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,261
He's there! There.

74
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,721
There, he's there.

75
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,817
Matmat?

76
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,114
[Matmat sobs]
Are the butterflies still there?

77
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,116
[stammers] M-Matmat saw

78
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:29,162
Matmat saw two butterflies.

79
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,790
[sobs] A b-baby butterfly,

80
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,793
and a mama butterfly.

81
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,547
Yes, Matmat.

82
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,384
[gentle music playing]

83
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,137
But you don't dream
about it anymore, right?

84
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,515
[Patrick] You know…

85
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,351
I think…

86
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,315
I think it's just playing tricks.

87
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,026
[Matmat sobs]

88
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,278
It's tricking Matmat?

89
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,489
They're mean,

90
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,034
They're mean and they're tricking Matmat.

91
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,788
- [Matmat sniffles]
- Yes.

92
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,249
[Matmat sobbing]

93
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,794
They're jealous
because your work is beautiful.

94
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,630
[sobbing continues]

95
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,131
[Matmat] They're jealous

96
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,426
because Matmat's painting is beautiful?

97
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,886
So they ruined it?

98
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,931
Yes.

99
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,724
[Matmat sobs]

100
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,227
[Patrick] Matmat, remember you said.

101
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,482
When the butterfly comes…

102
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,861
we'll face it together?

103
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,614
[gentle music continues]

104
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,618
We'll be brave.

105
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,329
Right?

106
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,628
Matmat has to be brave.

107
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,797
That's right, Matmat. [sniffles]

108
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,592
[Matmat] Because I'm big now. [sniffles]

109
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,969
So I should,

110
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,681
Matmat should be brave.

111
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,099
[Patrick] Yes.

112
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,395
[Patrick] Shall we come out?

113
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,442
[gentle music continues]

114
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,068
[sniffles]

115
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,155
[Patrick] There.

116
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,077
- [Li] Matmat.
- Mama Li…

117
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,498
- [sniffles]
- I'll go cook <i>Cansi.</i>

118
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,917
Gemma's there, do you want to come?

119
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,298
Matmat wants <i>Cansi</i> but…

120
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:50,470
we still have to face the butterfly.

121
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,558
Patrick said it's just
someone playing tricks.

122
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,061
And people who play
tricks shouldn't be paid attention.

123
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,316
Don't pay attention.

124
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,819
- Matmat won't pay attention.
- Yes.

125
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,614
Is that okay, Patpat?

126
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,908
Mmm.

127
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,075
Yes, Matmat.

128
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,869
[sniffles]

129
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,413
Go on, I'll take care of Matmat.

130
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,916
I know Mia needs you. Go ahead.

131
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:24,253
Come on. We'll change your clothes,
you're drenched in sweat.

132
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,213
You might get sick.

133
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,049
Look at your back, it's soaked.

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,072
[Mia sobbing] I know it's somewhere here!

[grunts, pants]

140
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,661
It has to be somewhere here!

141
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,830
- [grunts in frustration]
- [object thuds]

142
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,543
[crying]

143
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,880
I don't want you to come back…

144
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,634
[sobs] I don't want you to come back.

145
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:18,558
You're going to take away
all the beautiful things I have now.

146
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:23,229
[sniffles, sobs]

147
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:30,027

[utensils clinking]

150
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,829
What are you going to draw, Matmat?

151
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,708
It's hard for me to draw, Gemma.

152
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,920
Matmat can't draw the butterfly yet.

153
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,926
Matmat.

154
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,595
Just take it slow.

155
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,847
If you can't do it today,
try again tomorrow.

156
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,184
If Matmat can't
finish the butterfly today,

157
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,437
he'll try again tomorrow.

158
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,522
I'll start with the face today.

159
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,274
Ah! You're drawing the face!

160
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,860
I know that! Let's practice it.

161
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,237
Come on. Which emotion
would you like today?

162
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,115
Would you like a-- No, I have an idea.

163
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,075
- How about shocked?
- [Li] He's gone through

164
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,661
a lot of difficult times,

165
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,372
- but he keeps giving his best.
- [tender music playing]

166
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,167
I have so much respect for that kid.

167
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,127
You're right, Mama Li.

168
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,046
Others would just give up right away.

169
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,257
He and Patrick.

170
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:37,720
They manage to face
anything that comes their way.

171
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,096
[music fades]

172
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,059
- Mia.
- [Mia sniffles]

173
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,896
Did she kill your mother?

[sullen music playing]

175
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,567
Ingrid Hernandez.

176
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,697
Was she your mother's killer?

177
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,326
[sullen music continues]

178
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,494
[Mia sniffs]

179
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,955
The butterfly that's
been haunting Matmat…

[sniffles]

181
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,461
Is it my mother's?

182
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,300
- Mia…
- And you knew.

183
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,428
[sniffles] You've known for a long time.

184
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,806
Mia, I haven't known long.

185
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,225
How long, Patrick?

186
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,686
How long have you known?

187
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,190
Only recently.

188
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,651
When Matmat helped Mister Tommy,

189
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,613
he was able to tell me and Doc Anok

190
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,490
what happened the night our mother died.

191
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,868
[sullen music continues]

192
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,328
[sobs softly]

193
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,913
So she's alive?

194
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,376
[sniffles, sobs]

195
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,965
That's why you've
been so protective of me.

196
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,718
Now it's all making sense to me.

197
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,595
[sniffles]

198
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:09,270
Is that why you keep
insisting I face Nurse Olivia?!

199
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:16,152
Did she paint
that butterfly on Matmat's mural?!

200
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,321
[sullen music continues]

201
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,739
I don't know.

202
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,452
- We're not sure--
- So, she's alive?!

203
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,288
Just tell me! Is she alive?!

204
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,583
I don't know, Mia.

205
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,877
I want to say no,
but with what's going on,

206
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,462
I just don't know.

207
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,423
[sobs] No, this can't be happening.

208
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,593
[sniffles] I don't
want her back in my life.

209
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,261
- [sniffles, sobs]
- [Patrick] Mia.

210
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,098
You two, leave!

211
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,309
- Mia, we're not going anywhere!
- Go away!

212
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,602
If your mother is really alive,

213
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,604
that's all the more
reason for us to stay.

214
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,190
You listen to me.

215
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,318
All of us will just end up getting hurt.

216
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,278
Why?

217
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,198
You think you're like your mother?

218
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,618
Mia, we're not
leaving each other, remember?

219
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,038
I can't keep that promise anymore.

220
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,749
Just leave!

221
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:18,839
[sullen music continues]

222
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,096
[music fades]

223
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,059
[Matmat] M-Mama Li cooked all of this.

224
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,354
She said you two should eat well.

225
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,273
Have you eaten, Patpat?

226
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,485
Not yet.

227
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,656
How about M-Mia?

228
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,869
[bird calling]

229
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,454
Not yet, Matmat.

230
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,666
She's not feeling well,
so she hasn't come out yet.

231
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,795
Mia's sick?

232
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,839
She needs to take some medicine, Patpat.

233
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,593
But b-before she takes some medicine,

234
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,971
she needs to eat something so that

235
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,597
so that she can be strong.

236
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:13,769
- [utensils clattering]
- [melancholic music playing]

237
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,938
She still won't come
out of her room, Matmat.

238
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:20,818
Matmat will take Mia some food.

239
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,862
Mia will listen to me because…

240
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,614
I'm the eldest.

241
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,953
Patpat, heat this up for me.

242
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,498
[melancholic music fades]

243
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,375
Oh, Doc, I need you to sign this.

244
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,543
Okay.

245
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,671
- Nurse.
- Ma'am Eden's not here yet?

246
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,006
Yeah, she's not here yet.

247
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,800
She hasn't come in to work for days.

248
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,051
Nurse.

249
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,721
- Have you contacted her?
- Yes, Doc, but…

250
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,514
We can't reach her by phone.

251
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,101
[Patty] We've already
informed Doc Anok but,

252
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,187
- doesn't it seem strange?
- [mysterious music playing]

253
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,772
I know, right?

254
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,442
I've been here for a while,
and she never calls in sick.

255
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:05,279
And she always tells us if she has
to leave, even if it's just for a while.

256
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:09,033
But now, it's been days
and still no word from her.

257
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,869
Where is she?

258
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,330
[mysterious music fades]

259
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,292
[stammers] Mia?

260
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,879
It's Matmat.

261
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:30,095
[creaking]

262
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,315
You need to eat.

263
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:48,989
You need t-to eat
what Matmat brought you.

264
00:15:55,454 --> 00:16:01,251
You need to eat so you can feel better.

265
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:05,923
Just have a small bite.
Just a small bite.

266
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,550
That's what Patpat said.

267
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,389
Thank you, Matmat.

268
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,140
But I'm not hungry.

269
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,105
Do you not like Matmat?

270
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,274
Do you not like your big brother?

271
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:32,408
You told me you wanted
me to me your big brother, but…

272
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,036
you're not listening to me.

273
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,040
That means you don't like Matmat anymore.

274
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,095
You're still my big brother.

275
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,725
[giggles] Okay.

276
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,353
T-Time to eat. Time to eat.

277
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:06,066
[pensive music playing]

278
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,111
- [sniffles]
- Mama Li made this.

279
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:13,615
[sobbing]

280
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:19,079
- [Mia sobbing]
- M-Mia is crying?

281
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:25,961
Are you going
through something very painful?

282
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:32,092
[sobbing, breath quivering]

283
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,761
Matmat…

284
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,683
I'm so, so sorry.

285
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:44,938
- [sobbing]
- [pensive music continues]

286
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,985
- [murmuring]
- [sobbing]

287
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,196
You have to look people in the eye

288
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:56,617
to show them your apology was sincere.

289
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,079
Look at Matmat.

290
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,797
Matmat…

291
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,513
I'm so, so… I'm so sorry.

292
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,515
[sobbing]

293
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,517
Shh, shh.

294
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,186
- I-It's okay.
- [Mia sniffles]

295
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,562
It's okay.

296
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:30,150
I accept your apology.

297
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,736
[whimpers, sobs]

298
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,280
H-Hey, stop crying.

299
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,117
- [crying]
- Shush now. Stop crying.

300
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,327
You should eat now.

301
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,912
Eat now.

302
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,997
[sniffles, sobs]

303
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:48,293
D-Do you want to hear some good news?

304
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,420
Matmat has some good news for you.

305
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,632
[Mia whimpers, continues crying]

306
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,219
[chuckles]

307
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,972
[pensive music continues]

308
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,140
Look.

309
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:06,353
That's what Patrick looked like

310
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,982
when he said he likes you.

311
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,359
[Mia continues crying]

312
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,946
That's the only time Matmat…

313
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,783
saw Patpat with a happy face.

314
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,745
[exhales deeply]

315
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,914
It's so beautiful. [sniffles]

316
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,669
It's the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

317
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,173
[pensive music swells]

318
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,883
- [Mia sniffles]
- Hmm.

319
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,594
I did a very good job?

320
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,471
Did Matmat do a good job?

321
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:48,312
I'll finally get to
finish drawing Mister Box,

322
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,813
Mask Boy,

323
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,942
and the Princess Without Feelings.

324
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:58,655
Mia and Matmat
will finally finish the book.

325
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:03,535
- [whimpers, sniffles]
- [pensive music continues]

326
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,788
You should eat.

327
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,542
You should listen to Matmat.

328
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,420
[pensive music fades]

329
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,546
[Vincent] Mia?

330
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,173
Mia?

331
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,591
Mia!

332
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,886
How are you? Matmat told me you're sick.

333
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,054
Are you okay?

334
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,434
What's this?

335
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,687
What is this check for?

336
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,149
For not fulfilling my contract.

337
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,402
Matmat and I won't be finishing the book.

338
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,404
What?!

339
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:41,907
[sighs]

340
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,451
- I won't finish the book, Vincent.
- [solemn music playing]

341
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,245
Work on another project.

342
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,872
You still have the
investment from Erika, right?

343
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,332
Yes!

344
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,626
But only because she loves your book!

345
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,964
Is this just a delay,
or you really won't finish it?

346
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,008
Mia, what's happening?

347
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,679
Look for another writer, Vincent.

348
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,014
[Mia] I'm done.

349
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,808
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,895
Mia-- [huffs]

351
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,064
[solemn music fades]

352
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,357
Hey, Patrick!

353
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,733
Boss, what are you doing here?

354
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,694
I should ask you that.

355
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,320
What happened to Mia?

356
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,072
Huh?

357
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,323
What happened?

358
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,993
The other day,
I thought Mia was just sick.

359
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,287
But now, she doesn't
want to finish their book.

360
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,414
Vincent, I don't know
what you're talking about.

361
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,581
[sighs]

362
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,252
Patrick, Mia doesn't want
to finish her book with Matmat.

363
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,421
Why? What happened?

364
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,091
All right, Vincent, I'll talk to her.

365
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,342
Huh?

366
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,928
[groans]

367
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,098
Congrats, Matmat!

368
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,351
Wow! Finally!

369
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,771
Matmat can now

370
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,815
draw faces.

371
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,151
So all you needed was his face.

372
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,694
Nice!

373
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,362
- Hey! What are you doing?
- [excited squeal]

374
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,822
Hey, hey, hey!

375
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,242
Madeth, you might crease it.
Patpat's face might get creased.

376
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,286
- Be careful with the paper.
- Oh, sorry.

377
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,620
Sorry, Matmat.

378
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,039
Sorry, Matmat.

379
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,458
[squeals] I'm just really happy, Matmat

380
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:18,545
because you're
finally working with Miss Mia.

381
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,173
I'll finally have some
money in my bank account.

382
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,674
[chuckles]

383
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,719
Mia can finally write the book.

384
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,554
And I get to work with her!

385
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,057
- Woo-hoo!
- You're amazing, Matmat!

386
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,141
[chuckles]

387
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:35,937
[somber music playing]

388
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:55,916
[Patrick] Mia?

389
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,459
Mia!

390
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,169
Mia!

391
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,170
Mia!

392
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,838
Mia, where are you going?

393
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,548
Mia! Mia!

394
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,092
[Patrick] Mia!

395
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,261
Mia!

396
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:13,100
[somber music continues]

397
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,186
Mia!

398
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:20,732
[somber music swells]

399
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:23,944
Mia!

400
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,864
[panting]

401
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,158
[sullen music continues]

402
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,417
- [panting]
- [somber music fades]

403
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,882
[Matmat] Why are we going back home again?

404
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,013
Is it because of the butterfly?

405
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,265
But…

406
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,978
we'll face the butterfly, right?

407
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,230
Yes, Matmat.

408
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,525
But for now, let's stay here, okay?

409
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,570
Did you and Mia fight?

410
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,322
Did you fight?

411
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:14,119
You should kiss again so you can make up.

412
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,831
We just have
something to talk about, Matmat.

413
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:22,252
Y-you should kiss to make up.

414
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,171
You must make up because…

415
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,550
Mia and Matmat still have work to do.

416
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,885
We still have work.

417
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,096
Don't worry, Matmat.

418
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,891
Mia and I will talk,
then you two will go back to work.

419
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:42,230
Okay, talk first,
then kiss, then make up.

420
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,065
Okay?

421
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:50,947
[phone ringing]

422
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:55,744
[dramatic music playing]

423
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,082
[phone ringing]

424
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:10,217
[dramatic music continues]

425
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,719
[Patrick] <i>Mia…</i>

426
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,472
<i>wherever you go…</i>

427
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,642
<i>Matmat and I will never leave you.</i>

428
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:29,110
[dramatic music continues]

429
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,075
[music crescendos]

430
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,371
[Mia] <i>I know you'll keep trying</i>
<i>to convince me to change my mind.</i>

431
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,081
<i>One last time.</i>

432
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,666
<i>I just want to protect you.</i>

433
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:46,628
<i>We should not be torn apart</i>
<i>for a sin we didn't even commit.</i>

434
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,590
<i>You think either Olivia or Eden</i>
<i>could be my mom?</i>

435
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,925
<i>She is not here, Patrick.</i>

436
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:55,136
<i>Ever since we found that</i>
<i>butterfly on Matmat's painting.</i>

437
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,682
<i>Mia's in danger.</i>
