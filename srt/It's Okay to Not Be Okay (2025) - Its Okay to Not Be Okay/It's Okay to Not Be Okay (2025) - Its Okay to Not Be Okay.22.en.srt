1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,086
- Why is he here?
- He's my new housemate.

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,879
Mia, you two won't get anything done.

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,464
You'll just mess around.

4
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,216
No. That's not true.

5
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:11,636
My safety pin will watch me.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,763
Patpat! Sorry.

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,599
Matmat's really sorry
about what happened last night.

8
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,601
It's okay, Matmat.

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,729
Sorry, I just got here now.

10
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:21,938
I'm all set.

11
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,773
Everything I need is here.

12
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,153
We'll stay here during the week
and go home to our apartment on weekends.

13
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,447
Matmat's top priority
is drawing at the hospital.

14
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,656
Yes to all.

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,075
The three of us will stay here together.

16
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,453
We're going to have so much fun.

17
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,787
[Jason] You will die…

18
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,665
if you don't leave that house right now!

19
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,083
[Patrick] Stop joking like that.

20
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,919
[Jason] Just come home now,
please Patrick. Come home.

21
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:52,177
[theme music playing]

22
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:49,359
- [machine beeping steadily]
- [light footsteps]

23
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:04,833
- [door opens, closes]
- [eerie music playing]

24
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,671
[machine continues beeping steadily]

25
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,096
[eerie music continues, fades]

26
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,604
Hey.

27
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,065
[panting]

28
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,025
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

29
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,655
- [exhales sharply]
- Are you sure no one saw you?

30
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,573
Yes, I'm sure.

31
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,534
[inhales deeply, exhales sharply]
This really hits different.

32
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,952
What do you mean?

33
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,328
That's just soda.

34
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,788
It doesn't even have sugar.

35
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:49,377
I was just pretending.
I know alcohol is not allowed in here.

36
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,503
[exhales sharply]

37
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,673
Tommy, you can leave if you want.

38
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:57,051
You just have to come back for checkups.

39
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,513
If you make me leave,

40
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,850
you'll lose the stool pigeon
who gives you inside information.

41
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:04,934
[laughing]

42
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,853
You're so old-fashioned.

43
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,938
People don't use
the term "stool pigeon" anymore.

44
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,692
Anyway, tell me the latest scoop.

45
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,903
Do you hear yourself?

46
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:19,657
You're the doctor here, yet I'm the one
you're asking about your patients.

47
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,827
They don't tell me how they really feel.

48
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:27,457
Well then, I should have
a cut in your salary. [chuckles]

49
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,792
How dare you try to make money off me!

50
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,629
First thing tomorrow, I'll call Eden

51
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,589
and ask her to process
your discharge papers.

52
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,258
Oh, come on. I was just joking.

53
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,261
Anyway, here's the latest scoop…

54
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,638
Wait, wait, wait.

55
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,181
I'll write it down. Go on.

56
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,642
Let's start with Elvie.

57
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:50,521
She bragged about her daughter again.

58
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:54,150
She even wanted
to set her up with Patrick.

59
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,195
And guess what Cynthia did.

60
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,076
She shared something scary again.

61
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,078
- Huh?
- [unsettling music playing]

62
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,330
[imitating ghost] Awoo…

63
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,165
[Tommy imitates ghost] Awoo…

64
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,002
Matmat's going to use the toilet.

65
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,465
M-Matmat's going to use the toilet.

66
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,926
[unsettling music continues]

67
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,094
Hmm…

68
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:26,099
[whimpering]

69
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:33,273
[unsettling music continues]

70
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:37,860
[mystical tone plays]

71
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:45,243
[unsettling music continues]

72
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,874
- [taps shoulder]
- [gasps]

73
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,710
[unsettling music fades]

74
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,842
Do you know
the story of Blue Beard, Matmat?

75
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,762
Blue… Blue Beard?

76
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,889
[unsettling music resumes]

77
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,184
It's about a rich man…

78
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,979
who lived in a big palace.

79
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,859
[Mia] Other people were scared of him

80
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,112
because of his blue beard.

81
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,782
[dramatic music sting]

82
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:29,370
He happily brought
his new wife to the palace.

83
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:35,460
- [birds chirping]
- [unsettling music continues]

84
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,006
[doors sliding]

85
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,431
[Mia] He gave all kinds of diamonds

86
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,850
and treasures to his wife…

87
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,727
[doors sliding]

88
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:01,235
…under one condition.

89
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:10,745
Never open the door in
the deepest part of the palace.

90
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,414
[dramatic music sting]

91
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,459
But she didn't obey him.

92
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,464
One day, while the man was gone,

93
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,384
- she opened the door.
- [lock clicks]

94
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,805
- [doors creak]
- Do you know what she saw?

95
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:34,685
- [dramatic music stings]
- The corpses of the man's former wives.

96
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,857
The man killed his former wives

97
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,652
who didn't obey him.

98
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,571
[unsettling music fades]

99
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,490
Mia told you that?

100
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,410
Why did Miss Mia tell me that?

101
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:56,165
[hesitates]
Was she trying to scare Matmat?

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,212
No. Maybe Mia just
didn't want you to go there.

103
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,632
Because…

104
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:09,303
Matmat would die if he went there?

105
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,806
Not really.

106
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,683
But you might get hurt.

107
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,185
This is an old house, remember?

108
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,480
Maybe some parts
haven't been fixed or cleaned yet.

109
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,775
Besides, you said
it was dark there, right?

110
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,527
Lie down.

111
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:32,493
Alright, Matmat won't go there.

112
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,953
Mm-hmm. [exhales sharply]

113
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,666
Patpat, but why…

114
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,087
were the people scared of the man?

115
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,047
Do you mean, Blue Beard?

116
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,429
Maybe because he had a blue beard.

117
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,974
Of course, the people
weren't used to something like that.

118
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:01,355
Should we be scared of
someone with a different beard color?

119
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:06,944
Should people be scared
of you if you're different?

120
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,696
[tender music playing]

121
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,364
It's not that.

122
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:14,076
Sometimes, we get scared
when something's unfamiliar to us

123
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,914
or when we're not
used to what we're seeing.

124
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,958
- [bed creaks]
- [grunts]

125
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,210
But Matmat…

126
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,129
that's just outward appearance.

127
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,549
What people should avoid is…

128
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,844
those who do bad things.

129
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,349
Mm-hmm. We should stay away…

130
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,184
from bad people.

131
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,769
Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,563
[tender music continues]

133
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,316
We should stay away from bad people.

134
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,400
Mm-hmm.

135
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,447
[snoring]

136
00:08:54,534 --> 00:09:01,499
- [snoring]
- [tender music continues]

137
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:17,181
[tender music continues]

138
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,106
- [door closes]
- [tender music fades]

139
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:39,287
[gentle music playing]

140
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,169
[grunts]

141
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,215
[inhales deeply, exhales sharply]

142
00:09:55,344 --> 00:10:00,182
[objects clattering, banging distantly]

143
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,727
[sighs frustratedly]

144
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,020
Vincent.

145
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,438
[light-hearted music playing]

146
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,731
Vincent!

147
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,401
[Matmat] Miss… Miss Mia, you're awake.

148
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,655
Do you always sleep this long?

149
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,326
[light-hearted music continues]

150
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,910
You cleaned the house?

151
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,163
We didn't just clean.

152
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,333
Patpat even went to the market.

153
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,209
He… He also did the laundry.

154
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,879
Some blankets have
already been hung outside.

155
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:35,760
Matmat will sweep, mop and wax the floors.

156
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,678
[Matmat giggles]

157
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,515
[light-hearted music continues]

158
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,268
[sizzling]

159
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,354
Matmat! It's time to eat!

160
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,940
[spoon clinking]

161
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,692
Miss Mia, it's time to eat.

162
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,909
Let's eat, Miss Mia.

163
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:05,706
[light-hearted music continues]

164
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,335
Let's eat.

165
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,633
- [bowl clanking]
- [light-hearted music fades]

166
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,761
Put the food on the table, Matmat.

167
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,391
[Matmat giggles]

168
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,397
Is this okay with you?
I don't know what you eat.

169
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,233
- Matmat likes sausages.
- I'm fine with it.

170
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,370
[plates, utensils clatter]

171
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,372
Sit down, Matmat.

172
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,547
- [utensils clatter]
- [birds chirping]

173
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,714
Fried rice?

174
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,306
I want more.

175
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:10,980
More.

176
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,233
[whimsical music playing]

177
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,652
Just get some more later.

178
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,614
Here.

179
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,199
[tapping]

180
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:30,541
[whimsical music continues]

181
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,889
Matmat, too.

182
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,558
Matmat wants some, too.

[tapping]

185
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,277
Just wait.

186
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:08,996
[whimsical music continues]

187
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:10,706
Here, Matmat.

188
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,837
Thank you, Patpat!

189
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,552
Yummy!

190
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,804
[whimsical music fades]

191
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:27,932
Samuel.

192
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,768
- Can you hear me?
- [machine beeping steadily]

193
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,354
Do you know where you are?

194
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,233
[machine continues beeping steadily]

195
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,734
Doc, any update?

196
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,654
[Emman] So far, his vitals are normal.

197
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,117
But this isn't the first time
he has complained of a headache, right?

198
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,577
Yes, doc.

199
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,580
His surgeon will pass
by later to check on him.

200
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,125
Doc, do you think
he's having complications?

201
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:58,963
I can't say for sure.

202
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,883
Let's just wait and see
what his surgeon has to say.

203
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,096
[machine continues beeping steadily]

204
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:28,200
[uneasy music playing]

205
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,785
Beautiful.

206
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,538
She is beautiful.

207
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,457
Come again, Samuel?

208
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,960
She…

209
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:43,048
She's like an angel sent from above.

210
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,260
Who?

211
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,222
My wife.

212
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,184
Mia's mother.

213
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,187
She's beautiful.

214
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,065
Is that so?

215
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,111
Mia's very lucky, then.

216
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:11,035
[uneasy music continues, fades]

217
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,828

[pensive music playing]

220
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,127
Matmat.

221
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,380
Patpat!

222
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:30,262
This is where Mama used to work.

223
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,890
Here at Miss Mia's house.

224
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,185
Yes. You still remember?

225
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,692
Mama stood by the gate, and she said…

226
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,530
"You good, Matmat?

227
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:53,077
Now, you know where Mama works."

228
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,829
Now, you know where Mama works.

229
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,707
- Big house. Big.
- Yes, big house.

230
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,752
It's so big
that it takes forever to clean.

231
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,880
Patrick, look after your brother, okay?

232
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,759
Matmat, stay inside the house.

233
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,178
Mama will be quick
so I can go home already.

234
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,222
- Yes, Mama. Yes, Mama.
- Hmm?

235
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,765
Don't worry about me.

236
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,393
The people I work for are nice.

237
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,687
They're good to me.

238
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:25,693
[poignant music playing]

239
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,195
Okay? My boss is here. Got to go.

240
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,619
Sir! Good morning!

241
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:40,541
[poignant music continues]

242
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:44,420
M-Miss Mia knows Mama.

243
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,297
Sorry, Matmat.

244
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,050
I already asked her,
but she doesn't remember Mama.

245
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,218
[poignant music fades]

246
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,971
A lot of people worked
for Mia's family, you see.

247
00:16:55,806 --> 00:17:00,728
Too bad Miss Mia didn't meet Mama.

248
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,896
Mama was really nice.

249
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,818
[birds chirping]

250
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,196
Let's go! M-Matmat will be late.

251
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,115
- We're leaving.
- [Mia] Matmat?

252
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,826
Don't worry.

253
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,245
I will drop you off.

254
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,709
Matmat will be late.

255
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,753
Get in the car.

256
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,338
You took forever to get ready.

257
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,674
This is how long I take every day.

258
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,385
[Patrick]
Then you should've eaten quicker.

259
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,348
[ominous music playing]

260
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,893
- [screaming]
- Matmat!

261
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,019
I'm sorry.

262
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,353
- I'm sorry.
- Who are you?!

263
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,438
Who are you?!

264
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,231
Miss Mia.

265
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,609
It's… it's me. I'm Dipong.

266
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,861
- I don't know you!
- I'll call the authorities.

267
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,447
Sir, please don't!
I'm the caretaker here.

268
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,241
Vincent didn't mention
there's a caretaker here.

269
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,495
I've long been the caretaker here.
I watch over the mansion.

270
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,622
Miss Mia, don't you remember me?

271
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,124
Would I be this
surprised if I knew who you are?

272
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,504
Patrick, I don't have time for this.
And you?

273
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,048
- Get out of here.
- Come on. Get out of here.

274
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,800
Miss Mia, don't you recognize me?

275
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,427
Tessie, the maid,
and I used to work here together!

276
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:19,681
Tessie Gonzales is
the mother of Matmat and Patpat.

277
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,934
[Dipong] He's right.
Her name was Tessie Gonzales.

278
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:26,939
[ominous music resumes]

279
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,234
[ominous music ends]

280
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,401
[Anok] Eden.

281
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,613
Don't let Mia visit Samuel for now, okay?

282
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,741
I'll talk to her if she insists.

283
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,867
Don't worry, doc.

284
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,036
Even if I don't stop her,

285
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,288
she won't even bother to visit her father.

286
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:47,334
Well, I think Samuel might've thought

287
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,837
Mia was a different person.
That's why he strangled her.

288
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,047
Keep in mind that he's a dementia patient.

289
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,132
Hold on.

290
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:54,883
A different person?

291
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,010
Who could that be?

292
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,763
- [unsettling music playing]
- I don't know.

293
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,598
Hmm…

294
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,227
I thought your spy had already told you.

295
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,563
[tongue clicks] Next time,

296
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,606
I'm going to lock up the stock room.

297
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:14,111
That way, the rats won't
have anywhere to hide at night.

298
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:20,200
[unsettling music continues]

299
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,037
Oh, no. We're busted.

300
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,415
- [unsettling music fades]
- I wonder who snitched.

301
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,295
Dear, when are you dropping by?

302
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,589
You're taking so long to visit.

303
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,178
Nurse Patty.

304
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,598
Talk to Elvie. She's crossing the line.

305
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,975
She always steals food from Bella and me.

306
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,185
That's true, nurse.

307
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:51,440
She said her daughter would bring us food,
but she still hasn't shown up.

308
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,110
- [Cynthia] So annoying.
- But you can share food, right?

309
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,487
My hunger won't let me share.

310
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,115
She'll go berserk. You want to meet her?

311
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,243
Just promise me you'll come, okay?

312
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:08,332
I hope the guy I want you to meet
will be on duty when you come here.

313
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,004
[Zelda] She's rich, isn't she?

314
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:18,258
She said her shawl came from overseas.

315
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:24,014
But why is she acting
like a hungry, poor woman?

316
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,266
Alright.

317
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,809
I'll talk to her.

318
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,979
- [somber music playing]
- [receiver clatters]

319
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,565
[Elvie] Whoo! [chuckles]

320
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,860
Oh, wait. Where are you going?

321
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,528
My daughter's coming.

322
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,990
Um, Miss Elvie, do you want
to take a walk in the garden?

323
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,450
Come on. We still have time.

324
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,994
Yes, but my daughter's coming!

325
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,746
Let's take a walk in the garden first.

326
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,165
- Come on.
- But I want to wait for her.

327
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,376
- [Patty] Let's go to the garden first.
- [somber music fades]

[gate creaking]

329
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,506
You said you used to work with Tessie.

330
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,632
Yes.

331
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,217
Did you know her personally?

332
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:04,304
You might know what
happened to her on the day she died.

333
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,601
[birds chirping]

334
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,812
She came to work that night.

335
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,399
She went home.

336
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,610
And then she was killed.

337
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,154
[uneasy music playing]

338
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,406
She was killed?

339
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,490
Yes.

340
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,576
She was mugged by robbers.

341
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,578
That's what they said.

342
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:33,041
[uneasy music continues]

343
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,961
[Mia] Your brother
is really crazy, Matmat.

344
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,881
He picked the worst time to ask questions,
just when we're about to leave.

345
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,802
[exhales sharply]

346
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,306
But…

347
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:52,144
if I were you and your brother,
I'd leave this place right away.

348
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,730
[uneasy music continues]

349
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,814
But why?

350
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,817
Because she'll come back.

351
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,404
Who?

352
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,864
Who's coming back?

353
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,158

[foreboding music continues, fades]

360
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,825
I think something's missing.

361
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,577
Butterflies land on flowers, right?

362
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,703
I don't like butterflies.

363
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,622
You and your brother
should leave Mia's house.

364
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,623
Is the owner kicking me out?

365
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,375
You guys living in
the house isn't helping Mia.

366
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,627
You're thinking about your mother.

367
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,045
Shut up.

368
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,255
I said shut up!

369
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,841
Intense depression turns into psychosis.

370
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,051
No connection to reality?

371
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,928
Did you come back for me…

372
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,430
Mama?
