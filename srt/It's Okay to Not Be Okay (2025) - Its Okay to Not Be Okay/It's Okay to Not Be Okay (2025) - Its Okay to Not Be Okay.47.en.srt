Yeah.

I didn't. She just left.

Okay, don't go outside.
I'll try to catch up to her.

Did you come here for her?

61
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,894
Are you here because of your patient…

62
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,689
and not because of me?

63
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,024

You always make me feel like…

67

I come second, Matmat is your priority.

68
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,709
And now…

69
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,045
You're here…

[somber music continues]

71
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,303

about your own patient.

72
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,515
Mia, it's not like that.
I was worried about you too.

73
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,183
That's exactly what it's like, Patrick.

74
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,772
Once you leave here and find her,

75
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,900
you're going to take
her back to the hospital.

76
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,362
Just like what you did to Junjun and Kai.

77
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,199
Once you've taken care of them,

78
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,120
you're going to check on Matmat.

[somber music continues]

80
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,168
Because that's what you always do.

81
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,130
And then you'll come back to me.

82
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,967
Mia, that's not…

83
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,635
It's like that.

84
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,098
You'll always put them…

85
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,476
before me.

if he didn't come here for me?

[sighs heavily]

91

Leave.

Yeah, security said
they last saw her at Ventura Street.

131
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,803
We asked the neighboring
town for assistance and CCTV footage.

132
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,805
Ventura Street?

133
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,974
What could she possibly
be doing over there?

134
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,727
[Anok] She's at Mia's house.

135
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,981
Patrick called.

136
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,192
Mia said Zelda was there.

137
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,528
Should we call an ambulance?

138
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,822
There's no need. She isn't there anymore.

139
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,700
Gemma, please update the police.

140
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,661
Tell them to start searching
for Zelda around where Mia's lives.

141
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,580
- Okay, doc.
- Maybe she hasn't gone far.

142
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,500
I'll tell our security
to keep monitoring our area.

How are you feeling? You good?

149
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,096
Doc, I'm fine.

150
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,433
But, I was hoping I could
request leave for tomorrow.

151
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,059
I got injured during work hours.

152
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,353
I don't feel fully recovered yet.

153
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,648
I'll approve it.
Since you also got a sedative shot.

154
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,275
You can skip work.

155
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,777
And the next day too.

156
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,779
Then come to work at all

157
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,782
so I can find a new nurse
to replace you in this hospital.

Nurse, you said you had somewhere to be?

163
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,550
If you want, I can instruct Patty myself.

164
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,344
It's okay, doc. I'll do it.

165
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,137
Zelda is my patient.

166
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,057
I need to stay
and oversee her safe return.

167
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,310
Okay then. It just seems like
you're going somewhere special.

168
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,729
I can do it some other time.

169
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,855
Okay.

We need to dress your wound.

No one asked you to.

175
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,628
It doesn't even hurt.

[soft music continues]

We need to stop this, Patrick.

178

Stop holding on to what we had.

179
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,773
This ends right here.

00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,899
Now.

181
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,238
That's what you told me.

182
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,074
Those words hurt,

183
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,242
more than this.

184
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,082
Why are you acting like this?

185
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,085
I told you that it's my birthday.

186
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,004
I want to be with you.

187

00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:03,381
are considered family to me and Patpat.

373
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,635
Oh, Matmat. You don't want to share food.

374
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,930
You don't want to share your brother.
Where do I stand?

375
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,932
What? When do I get to win?

376
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,101
Hey! Hey, Matmat!

377
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,310
I'm still talking to you.

378
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:18,980
You said you're
going to buy me ice cream.

379
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,401
Yes, I will. Wait for me.

380
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,161
Is it true
that Zelda almost died earlier?

381
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,206
[tender music playing]

382
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,083
Did my Papa strangle her?

383
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,172
Don't worry about it.

384
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:02,065
[tender music continues]

385
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,666
[tender music fades]

386
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,377
[inhales deeply]

387
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,129
[ominous music playing]

388
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,380
[shears snaps]

389
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:32,679
[Zelda whimpering]

390
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:37,893
No, no! Don't! Please don't!

391
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,437
What are you going to do?!

392
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,065
I don't even know you!
I didn't do anything to you!

393
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,942
- You don't know who I am?!
- [shrieks] Aah!

394
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,277
Look at this scar!

395
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,487
- You did this to me!
- [whimpering]

396
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,323
- You did!
- [sobbing]

397
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,533
I don't know what you're talking about!

398
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,285
Stop it, Ingrid!

399
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,163
- [gasps]
- [ominous music fades]

400
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,247
Ingrid?

401
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,668
- You're wrong.
- [foreboding music playing]

402
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,961
I'm not--

403
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,214
I'm not Ingrid.

404
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,966
You think you're fooling me, huh?

405
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:14,095
Believe me!
I don't know what you're talking about!

406
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,182
Everyone thought you were already dead!

407
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,976
I'm the only one
who saw you rise from the lake!

408
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,896
I'm the only one
who knows you're still alive, Ingrid.

409
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,899
- Just me!
- I'm not Ingrid!

410
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,943
- Enough!
- [shrieks] Aah!

411
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,195
- This is my chance to get back at you!
- [foreboding music continues]

412
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:35,700
I waited a long time for
the day that I could finally kill you!

413
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,202
[shrieks] Aah!

414
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:41,289
I'm not! I'm not Ingrid!

415
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,541
I'm her fan! Just her fan!

416
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,627
A stalker! I'm just a fan!

417
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,254
My name is Zelda!

418
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,381
You're really going
to keep on lying, huh?

419
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,092
That's the truth! I'm telling the truth!

420
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,845
I know a lot about her
because I've followed her life!

421
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,138
That's the truth!

422
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,058
You came back to the mansion
to return to your daughter!

423
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,268
No!

424
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,062
No! I was there to read the book!

425
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,230
The book!

426
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,108
I wanted to read the book!

427
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,901
Ingrid's last book!

428
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,112
The book that didn't get published!

429
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,197
Please! Please believe me!

430
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,991
- Believe me!
- [foreboding music intensifies]

431
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:20,328
I'm not Ingrid! I'm not Ingrid!

432
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,331
I'm not Ingrid!
I'm telling the truth! [shrieks]

433
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,292
I'm not Ingrid!

434
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,627
Stop!

435
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,630
- [shrieking] Aah!
- [foreboding music crescendos]

436
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,216
<i>Patrick, look at me. You're blooming.</i>

437
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,677
<i>Your face looks like</i>
<i>you have a happy filter on.</i>

438
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,931
<i>- Did they catch her?</i>
<i>- Not yet, Matmat.</i>

439
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,850
<i>Who are you to make</i>
<i>decisions about my patient?</i>

440
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,643
<i>Did you really take care of him?</i>

441
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,063
<i>He always gets nightmares</i>
<i>about butterflies chasing him.</i>

442
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,815
<i>I have to keep an eye on him, Mia.</i>

443
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,276
<i>Are you saying that this is our destiny?</i>

444
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,030
<i>While I'm by Matmat's side,</i>
<i>will you stay by mine?</i>
