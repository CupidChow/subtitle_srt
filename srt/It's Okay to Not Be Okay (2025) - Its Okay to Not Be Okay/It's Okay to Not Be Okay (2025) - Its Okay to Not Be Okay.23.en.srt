[Matmat] Stop the car, Patpat.

Patpat, I'm going to the mess hall.

20
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,867
I want to get there before Doc Anok.

Matmat, wait!

22
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,704
It's like your brother just rode a jeep.

23
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,208
This is nice.

24
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:09,671
From now on,
we can all drive here together.

25
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,217
Patrick, what's wrong?

26
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,808
Hello? Patrick?

27
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:29,440
I was thinking that next time,
you should go first.

28
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,484
Why?

29
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,154
We can all go together.
What's wrong with that?

Matmat…

00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,526
I like the confidence!

44
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,445
That's why I chose you to paint this wall.

45
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,449
But Matmat, I think something's missing.

46
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,580
No. Nothing's missing.

47
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,708
I painted the view from outside.

48

Nothing's missing, Doc.

49
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,756
The garden you painted has flowers.

50
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,177

There are. Maybe you didn't see them.

54
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,777
Just the other day, I saw a butterfly.

55

You're the painter.

But as the one who asked you to paint,

68
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,981
think about it, Matmat.

69

No butterflies.

I don't like butterflies.
I don't like them following me.

did you see Mia come in today?

Yes.

We've been apart for so long.

Just the other day!

130
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,390
I met a really handsome guy.

- He's tall, has fair skin,
- [music turns tense]

132

and is so patient.

- [Patrick] Mia!

- Let go of me!
- Mia.

[tense music continues]

138
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,573
You have a class to teach.

139
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,992
The patients are waiting for you.

[Mia exhales sharply]

00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,121
Get her away.

142
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,708
Let's go, Elvie?

143
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,086
- Why?
- You have to drink medicine.

144
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,587
Come on.

145
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,382
What happened, dear?

146
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,424
[Patrick] Come on.

147
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,510
[Elvie] Tell Mama what happened.

148
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,178

Nurse Patty is giving
Elvie her medicine, ma'am.

152
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,750
You said Mia was with Elvie?

153
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,503
Yes, she thought Mia was her daughter.

154
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,755
I'm not surprised.

155
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:54,427
Doc Emman said severe
depression can turn into psychosis.

156
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,137
Psychosis?

157
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,017
So, she’s under the delusion
that Mia is her daughter?

158
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,102
That's exactly what psychosis feels like.

159
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,190
Is it because her daughter
doesn't pay her a visit?

160
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,695
Patrick, her daughter is dead.

161
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,072
But that's not her reality.

162
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,491
That's why she believes
her daughter's still alive.

163
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,037
So she needs help with both symptoms.

164
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,246
Three, actually.

165
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,914
First, her psychosis.

166
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,959
We need to bring her back to reality.

167
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,337
Second, her depression.

168
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,631
She's lost interest in life.

169
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,133
And third, grief.

170
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,135
Ah…

171
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,304
- It's more than just sadness.
- [somber music playing]

172
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,723
It's also the grief of
losing someone she loved.

173
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,309
Especially that Elvie's a mother.

174
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,648
They say a parent's
soul shatters more deeply

175
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,108
when they lose their child.

176
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:55,905
[somber music continues]

177
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,823
By the way, how's Mia?

178
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,994
She's already at her class.
I'm actually on my way there.

179
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,539
Did she mention anything
about what Elvie told her?

180
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,125
She didn't.

181
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,419
- That would be helpful in Elvie's case.
- [somber music fades]

182
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,349
This is my first time
experiencing a silent class.

183
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,143
She had so much
to say in the previous class.

184
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,478
But now, she's totally silent.

185
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,730
Maybe she's possessed.

186
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,981
[Cynthia] Possible.

187
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,110
Her behavior is off
from how she normally acts.

188
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,529
Maybe she didn't get enough sleep.

189
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,823
No, she's possessed.

190
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,325
[Kai] Should we talk to her now?

191
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,663
[Bella] No Kai, we can't do that.
What if she's really possessed?

192
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,456
She might hurt you.

193
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,419
No. The real Miss Mia is
playful and speaks harshly.

194
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,087
But she's so quiet now.

195
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,340
Let's just leave her alone
to contemplate world peace.

196
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,259
No, we have to do something.

197
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,677
[uneasy music playing]

198
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,221
Or else, the demon won't leave her body.

199
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,975
Wait. I'll try to sense it.

200
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:10,438
[uneasy music continues]

201
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:17,236
[Cynthia humming dramatically]

202
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,823
- Hey.
- Just stay there.

203
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:27,371
- [uneasy music continues]
- [humming continues]

204
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,081
Uh, Miss Mia.

205
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,834
Miss Mia?

206
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,920
Uh, what's our lesson to discuss today?

207
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,213
Shut up.

208
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,133
What? [chuckles awkwardly]

209
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,803
- What was that, Miss Mia?
- I said shut up!

210
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,846
Shut up!

211
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,851
[uneasy music continues, fades]

212
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,103
[Bella crying softly]

213
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,355
- [Kai] Bella, are you okay?
- [Bella sniffling]

214
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,399
[Kai] What did you say to Miss Mia?

215
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,319
[Bella] Kai, did I do anything wrong?

216
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,529
Is your class over?

217
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,448
Yes, Patrick. It's over.

218
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:07,203
Nurse Patrick. What's wrong with Miss Mia?
Why was she like that?

219
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,747
What happened?

220
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,249
[Kai] She was so quiet earlier.

221
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,337
When Bella approached her,

222
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,630
she suddenly screamed.

223
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,381
"I said shut up!"

224
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,799
Just like that.

225
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,261
[birds chirping]

226
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,390
Did I do something wrong?

227
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,309
I just asked her a question?

228
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,102
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

229
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,812
That's true, Bella.

230
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,942
Miss Mia needs a more powerful force.

231
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,152
[Cynthia breathes dramatically]

232
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,695
Where did she go?

233
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,739
All of a sudden she went over there.

234
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,119
Kai, take Bella to Nurse Patty.
She might need to take her medicine now.

235
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:56,544
Boss, Patrick probably won't talk you.
He's on duty.

236
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,295
Madeth, we need to talk to him.

237
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,548
If we can't stop Mia,

238
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,384
we'll have to make Patrick
and his brother leave the house.

239
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:04,885
Okay?

240
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,721
- That's him!
- Patrick! Wait, wait, wait!

241
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,306
I need to talk to you.

242
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,641
I'm still on duty.

243
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,060
Wait, please! You have break time, right?

244
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,853
I just really need to talk to you about--

245
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,230
- Mia?
- Yeah!

246
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,690
Yes! That's right!

247
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,150
- We need to talk to him.
- I'll just look for Mia.

248
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,443
W-Wait.

249
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,238
- [frustrated sigh]
- Boss, it's okay.

250
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,281
Come here.

251
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,782
Boss, I'll just have you admitted here

252
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,411
so you can talk
to Patrick any time he's on duty.

253
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,496
Alright? And who knows,

254
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,082
they might finally cure
your bizarre personality.

255
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,626
- I'll get you admitted here.
- Ah…

256
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,711
[Madeth] Come on.

257
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,880
Listen.

258
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,007
Once the money starts
flowing into the publishing house,

259
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,926
I'll use your bonus as
payment for your confinement,

260
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,220
and have them
house you in the tiniest room.

261
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,307
Your suggestions don't help at all.

262
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,559
No?

263
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,768
[Vincent sighs, clicks tongue]

264
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,813
But, why is he looking for Mia?

265
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,610
[huffs]

266
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,369
- Hey!
- This is a hospital.

267
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,163
Smoking is strictly prohibited.

268
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,832
What happened?
Why did you leave during class?

269
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,002
Give that back to me!

270
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,129
Is this about your
encounter with Miss Elvie?

271
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,507
I don't want to talk about it.

272
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,009
She reminded you of your mom.

273
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,305
You found yourself
wishing she were still alive.

274
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,688
That's why you felt so shaken back--

275
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,732
You seriously believe that woman?

276
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,320
That sick woman who's
lost her own grasp of reality?

277
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,531
- Mia, I only asked--
- Of course I'm going to react like this.

278
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,783
[somber music playing]

279
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,285
Because even after all of these years,

280
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,329
she still bugs me.

281
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,373
Her fans. You.

282
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,583
- Mia--
- You wish she were still alive?

283
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,751
For what?

284
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,754
To ask her more of your questions?

285
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:04,838
An autograph?

286
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,258
You're no different
from her obsessive fans.

287
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,471
All of you still want to believe that
she's alive to hear more of her story.

288
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,847
Well, guess what?

289
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,140
[somber music continues]

290
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,600
She's dead.

291
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,396
She is dead, Patrick.

292
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,482
And do you know why?

293
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,986
Because I've long forgotten her.

294
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,489
So, stop asking me about her.

295
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,117
Because she is dead to me.

296
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,998
[somber music continues, fades]

297
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,082
Mm-hmm.

298
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,085
Okay, just give me an update.

299
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,253
Thanks.

300
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,298
A patient of yours has gone missing?

301
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,219
She's just around
the corner. She's not lost.

302
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,181
You look worried.

303
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,017
You can't find her?

304
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,312
Elvie had an episode.
Of course I'm going to look worried.

305
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,565
But just like I said, she's not missing.

306
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,691
[tense music playing]

307
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,610
Olivia, aren't you being negligent?

308
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,866
Look who's talking.
Does Junjun's incident ring a bell to you?

309
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,243
[tense music continues]

310
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,870
So, we're counting now?

311
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,247
You've made way more mistakes than I have.

312
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,623
[tense music continues]

313
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,042
You're that confident?

314
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,293
[Eden] Yes.

315
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,588
I notice even the smallest of things.

316
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:34,011
[dramatic music stings]

317
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,095
Good for you.

318
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:40,726
[dramatic music stings]

319
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,644
[tense music fades]

320
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:50,527
[quirky music plays, fades]

321
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,155
Couldn't you have
waited for me to finish my shift?

322
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,033
Because I know
you won't talk to me anyway.

323
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,659
So, I took the initiative to do it now.

324
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,120
Patrick, let me get straight to the point.

325
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,665
I want you and your brother
out of Mia's house. That's all.

326
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,960
Does the owner want us out?

327
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,003
Boom!

328
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,172
Boss, that's one point for him.

329
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,423
He's got a point.

330
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,549
[Vincent sighs exasperatedly]

331
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,176
Patrick,

332
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,844
I've been her manager for years now.

333
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,680
I know what's best for her and what's not.

334
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,351
You and your brother living with her?

335
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,103
That's not good for Mia.

336
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,397
[Madeth sighs]

337
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,650
Boss V, can I try?

338
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,943
Is that okay with you? Okay.

339
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,655
Uh, this is my take on this, okay?
Listen very carefully.

340
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,740
Look.

341
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,201
Boss Vincent's main concern is

342
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,455
that Miss Mia won't be productive
during her stay here in Maravida.

343
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,333
And then there's the matter of his heart.

344
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,545
He's afraid you might
be taking her away from him.

345
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,046
- Hey, hey!
- Right?

346
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,006
What are you talking about?
I didn't say that.

347
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,509
I know, but that's
what's in your heart of hearts.

348
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,428
What your heart
would say, if it could speak.

349
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,974
So, you want us gone
just for money's sake?

350
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,725
No, no. Not at all.

351
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,979
I'm concerned for Mia.

352
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,313
Okay, Patrick?

353
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,525
Patrick, let me put it this way, okay?

354
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,694
If you can assure Boss Vincent

355
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:18,115
that Miss Mia will resume
writing as soon as possible,

356
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,910
staying at her house won't be an issue.

357
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,245
Problem solved.

358
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,583
I'm not taking anyone from anybody.

359
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,794
And Mia will resume
writing when she feels like it.

360
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,505
I'm going back to work.

361
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,507
[mellow music playing]

362
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,884
Well…

363
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,969
I think that's settled, boss.

364
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,513
It was a done deal, right?

365
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,057
You're still Miss Mia's manager.

366
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,142
- Thank you!
- Welcome!

367
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,518
- Thank you, not really.
- You're welcome.

368
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,061
[Elvie] Sweetheart.

369
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,355
Sweetheart, did I do something wrong?

370
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,025
Let's talk about it. Come on.

371
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,236
Oh, and we still haven't
talked about that handsome nurse.

372
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,739
The one I'm suggesting for you?
Let's talk, sweetheart.

373
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,782
- That handsome nurse?
- What do you want?

374
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,285
[Pogi] Miss Elvie?

375
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,287
I just want to have a chat with you.

376
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,831
So you were just
here all along, Miss Elvie.

377
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,374
I missed you so much.

378
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,293
Walk with me.
Ma'am Olivia's been looking for you.

379
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,337
But we're not done talking yet.

380
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,422
It's the first time we've
seen each other in ages.

381
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,758
It's time for your medication, remember?

382
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,427
Also, you still have
exercises to do with the other patients.

383
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,887
I think we should go now.

384
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,347
I'll see you later, okay, sweetheart?

385
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,015
Come on, miss.

386
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,434
[Elvie] But we're still catching up--

387
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,062
She rarely visits me.

388
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,063
Sweetheart!

389
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,357
Sweetheart, we'll talk later!

[pensive music fades]

397
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,295
Matmat!

398
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,881
I cooked some <i>torta.</i>

399
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:44,386
We have a lot of chopped vegetables
at home so I thought of making <i>torta.</i>

400
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,555
[stammer] Matmat…

401
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,308
Matmat eats <i>torta.</i>

402
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,852
- Thanks, Mama Li.
- [Li chuckles]

403
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,895
Oh, wait. Come.

404
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,105
Let's go over there.

405
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,442
So?

406
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,402
What did you two talk about?

407
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,866
Patrick said…

408
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,870
that we're better off as friends.

409
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,622
Oh, that's why you were mad

410
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,125
because you got <i>basted</i> (rejected)?

411
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,085
What's "<i>basted</i>"?

412
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,926
Oh, Matmat, it's…

413
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,345
- Uh, it's--
- Patpat!

414
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:32,225
Patrick, join us.
I feel like you haven't had lunch yet.

415
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,602
I'll eat later, Mama Li.

416
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,813
You'll eat with us, Patpat?

417
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,941
- Matmat, I still need--
- We should always eat together.

418
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,779
You heard him. Join us.

419
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,572
Sit down.

420
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,282
Eat.

421
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,201
Patpat, what does

422
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,203
"<i>basted</i>" mean?

423
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,084
I was supposed to explain it to him

424
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,169
but you suddenly arrived.

425
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,379
Matmat,

426
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,299
I'll tell you later. Eat first, okay?

427
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,472
[spoon clanks]

428
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,183
So, the word <i>"basted"</i>

429
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,769
Is it Tagalog or English?

430
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,314
Tagalog, but finish your food first.

431
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,151
Here, Matmat.

432
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,321
Have this <i>embutido</i>
made by Mama. It's good.

433
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,366
Mama Li, looks like
you used a lot of ground pork.

434
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,201
But wait, there's more.

435
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,495
There's also <i>lumpia shanghai </i>at home.

436
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,872
- Because one of the kids
- [melancholic music playing]

437
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,209
releases her stress
by cutting up vegetables.

438
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,420
Ma, which kid you're talking about?

439
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,214
[Li, Gemma chuckling]

440
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,966
Matmat, it's me.

441
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,885
Sometimes Mama
still thinks of me as a kid.

442
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,012
M-Ma,

443
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,474
Gemma is old. Look how tall she is.

444
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,268
She's not a kid anymore.

445
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,520
- [Gemma, Li chuckle]
- You're right. She's not.

446
00:23:59,229 --> 00:23:59,980
Join them.

447
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,606
- Thank you, Ma.
- Dig in.

448
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,651
[melancholic music continues]

449
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,529
Oh, no, dear.

450
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,656
That's the guy
I wanted to introduce to you.

451
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,450
Oh no. Someone beat you to it.

452
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,828
[melancholic music continues]

453
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:15,954
Don't worry.

454
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:19,583
I'll find a way to set
you up on a date with him.

455
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,668
You two look good together.

456
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,880
Dear. Dear, don't worry.

457
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,840
I'll find a way, okay?

458
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,133
Don't be mad.

459
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:34,389
Dear, talk to me.
I told you, you should listen to Mama.

460
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,473
- Dear--
- Stop it!

[Elvie sobs softly]

469
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,872
I saw her dead body.

With all the blood

471
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,503

Skull cracked.

No. That's not true.
