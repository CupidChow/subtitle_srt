1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,128
Mia Hernandez…

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:06,965
has antisocial personality disorder.

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:10,176
Who would still buy
your book if they found out

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,845
the writer's mentally unstable?

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,306
People like him deserve to die.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,183
What if he dodged it and you fell instead?

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,019
- You could've died.
- And so?

8
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,355
It's not like it's the first time
someone's tried to kill me.

9
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,399
Come here, hold on.

10
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,109
- What?
- Wait.

11
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,654
The butterfly hug isn't enough.
It only works when you're with me.

12
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,824
So I want you to be my safety pin.

13
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,659
- Safety what?
- Safety pin.

14
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,202
Someone I can rely on.

15
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:41,541
Aah!

16
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,917
[cries]

17
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,086
Matmat, I'm here.

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,672
- They're coming to take Matmat!
- Matmat!

19
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,258
No one's taking you.
We'll move away from here.

20
00:00:55,096 --> 00:01:02,270
[theme music playing]

21
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,734
He's the one
who disrupted your event!

22
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,821
Ow! Ouch! Ouch!

23
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,739
- You're the lunatic!
- [woman] What?!

24
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,866
It's you who's spouting nonsense.

25
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,743
[influencer] The boy that
the dad touch on the head

26
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,036
has a medical condition.

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,498
He just wants to blame Mia
for what he did wrong.

28
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:07,127
So, Mia girl, you have my support!

29
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,587
[man] She's a public personality.

30
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,214
Mia should really be more careful

31
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,050
with her words and actions in public.

32
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,719
[woman] For me, Mia was right.

33
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,639
I mean she gave the man
a taste of his own medicine.

34
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,432
He could've just walked away.

35
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:25,478
See Miss Mia, people understand your side.

36
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,521
[door opens]

37
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,815
Mia? Mia, we need to talk.

38
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,151
If it's about what
happened at the bookstore,

39
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,111
don't worry about it. People get me.

40
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,780
It's not that. Come here, come here.

41
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,908
It's about Dennis.

42
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,327
What? He's alive.

43
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,705
Exactly the problem, he's alive.

44
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,583
Oh…

45
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,459
You want him dead?

46
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,794
[quirky music playing]

47
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,922
- You want me to kill--
- No, Mia! What are you thinking?!

48
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,924
[exhales deeply]

49
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:59,429
What if Dennis talks
and says you pushed him?

50
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,724
Are you asking me?

51
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:03,600
Yes!

52
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,935
No. Ugh!

53
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,645
[clicks tongue]

54
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,898
The thing is…

55
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,776
you keep getting into
this mess after mess.

56
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,528
Don't you notice?

57
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,157
Oh, Vincent…

58
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,493
I know you'll figure something out, right?

59
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,999
[breathes deeply]

60
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,375
I know, I know.

61
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,544
I know I can, but…

62
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,338
[quirky music continues]

63
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,716
…maybe sometimes,
you could help me too?

64
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,637
Don't just vanish without a word.

65
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,683
[quirky music continues]

66
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,976
Where'd she go?!

67
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,479
Yes, boss.

68
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,981
Me and Miss Mia are close.

69
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,859
She tells me all her life plans.

70
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,902
[thud]

71
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,405
Ugh!

72
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:07,205
[quirky music continues, ends]

73
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:13,795
- [upbeat music playing]
- [ship horn blares]

74
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,677
[chains rattling]

75
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,099
[Jason] We are home!

76
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,477
- [Patrick] Come on!
- [Jason] I missed this heat!

77
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,229
Ugh!

78
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,440
Hmm, smells fishy!

79
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,985
- [Gemma] Patrick!
- [Jason] Excuse me.

80
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,278
Excuse me.

81
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,947
[Gemma] Matmat!

82
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,704
- [Jason] Hi, Gemma.
- Welcome back to Maravida!

83
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,956
- [chuckling]
- [upbeat music fades]

84
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,541
Matmat…

85
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,210
is it okay that we came back here?

86
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,090
Do you remember this place?

87
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,720
It's okay.

88
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:10,393
[pensive music playing]

89
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,859
Shall we go?

90
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,528
- [Jason] Come on, let's go!
- Let's go! Let me help you.

91
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,822
[Jason] Thank you, gorgeous!

92
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,407
- Let's go.
- So where are we eating?

93
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:25,908
[Patrick grunts]

94
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,744
- [car alarm beeps]
- [Jason] Let's go, Matmat!

95
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,872
[Jason] Hey! Wait for me!

96
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,046
[engines revving]

97
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:47,388
[engines rumbling]

98
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,314
This is our house.

99
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,940
- Jason--
- Present!

100
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,276
You'll stay downstairs.
It's a big space!

101
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,944
Oh! Thank you, Gemma love.

102
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,405
Matmat, slow down!

103
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,075
- [Jason] Matmat, wait for me!
- [Gemma] Did you miss the beach?

104
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,953
I'm going to swim at the beach.

105
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,830
[Gemma chuckles]

106
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,124
- Don't worry about Matmat.
- [Matmat] Hmm!

107
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,044
The compound
owner's actually our relative.

108
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:22,757
They trusted Mama to manage this place
since the neighbors trust her.

109
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,009
So Matmat's safe here.

110
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,345
That's awesome!

111
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,972
Your mama's got
power around here! I like it!

112
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,265
[laughs]

113
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,101
Come on, I'll show you your room.

114
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:37,355
Okay. Matmat, come on.
Let's check our room.

115
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,732
Gemma, by the way,
you haven't given me your account number

116
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,610
so I can send the rent for me and Matmat.

117
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,987
[Jason] Gemma love,
that's kind of unfair!

118
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,366
Patrick hasn't even paid
yet but you're already chasing me!

119
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,245
Hey! You had so many requests
for your room, I had to get it fixed.

120
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:56,499
Yours just needed a bit of cleaning.

121
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,876
Come on, let's go.

122
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,674
Welcome to your new home!

123
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,342
- Wow!
- Oh, wow!

124
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,468
Wow?

125
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,637
Your room's right here.

126
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,807
It's beautiful! Just like you!

127
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,142
- [Gemma] Wow, huh?
- [Matmat] Wow!

128
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,852
[Gemma] It's already been cleaned.

129
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,437
[Jason] Whoa, it's huge!

130
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,606
[light-hearted music playing]

131
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,526
Patpat, this place is amazing!

132
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,279
[chuckles]

133
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:32,285
[light-hearted music continues]

134
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,582
You like it?

135
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:46,841
[light-hearted music continues]

136
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,511
[Patrick] We're finally back, Ma.

137
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,223
But this time,
we're starting over differently.

138
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:59,187
[light-hearted music continues]

139
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,398
[waves crashing]

140
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,610
[Li] Coming home's
better when there's soup waiting!

141
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,695
- [Matmat exclaims]
- [light-hearted music fades]

142
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,946
Let's eat!

143
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,781
- Come on, let's eat.
- Thank you.

144
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,533
This is too much.

145
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,160
You didn't have to go and do all this.

146
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,872
I just cooked what Gemma bought.

147
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:21,250
That shrimp? She ordered
it from her uncle the other day.

148
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,335
Ma!

149
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,420
Hmm?

150
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,048
Patrick, I feel like I know you already.

151
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,634
Gemma talks about you a lot.

152
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,802
Ma, let's eat, right? [chuckles awkwardly]

153
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,763
[Gemma] Patrick, what do you want?

154
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,766
You must be Matmat?

155
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,687
Matthew Gonzales, 35 years old.

156
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,855
Just call me Matmat.

157
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,358
Hi, Matmat.

158
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,862
Uh, I heard about your mother.

159
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,406
Where did you live here before?

160
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,450
In Kahilom village.

161
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,328
Kahilom village?

162
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,872
What's your mother's name?

163
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,917
Tessie Gonzales, 38 years old.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,212
Mother of Matmat and Patpat.

165
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,590
I know her.

166
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:13,302
She used to buy food
at our eatery all the time.

167
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,056
Oh, what do you want to eat?

168
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,102
[Matmat] Anything, just not Jason's pares.

169
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,103
What?!

170
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,815
But you always finish it when
I serve it to you! You're unbelievable!

171
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,733
Let me do it, Miss Li.

172
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,735
Just call me Mama Li.

173
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,946
That's what everyone here calls me.

174
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,615
Mama… Mama Li.

175
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,784
Mama Li…

176
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,578
If it's okay with you,

177
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,871
I'd love to be like a mother to you too.

178
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,125
What do you think, Matmat?

179
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,294
We already have a mama.

180
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,254
Can we have two?

181
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,840
Can we call her Mama too?

182
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,594
Is that okay with you, Matmat? [chuckles]

183
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,847
[chuckles] Happy day!

184
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,181
- Happy day!
- [light-hearted music playing]

185
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:05,813
- Happy day!
- [everyone exclaiming] Happy day!

186
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,523
[music ends]

187
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,941
[inaudible PA announcement]

188
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,067
Where's his room?

189
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,114
[Dennis] To my dearest followers…

190
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:20,703
I'm in the hospital
because of Mia Hernandez.

191
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,371
- I'll tell you everything…
- Dennis!

192
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,124
about your favorite writer,
tonight, 7 PM on my socials--

193
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,250
Wait! Hold on!

194
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,796
Dennis, can we please talk first?

195
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,506
- Talk?
- Yes.

196
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,634
All I wanted was an interview.

197
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,969
And this is what I got!

198
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,430
I have a witness.

199
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,433
Mia's boyfriend.

200
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,060
Boyfriend?!

201
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,103
Hey! Mia doesn't even have a boyfriend!

202
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:52,276
I'm taking Mia down and
suing her for my physical injuries!

203
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,654
Don't come near me!

204
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,574
Even if you hurt me now, I'll still sue!

205
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,286
[Dennis's voice] Just one night.

206
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,457
Mia, think of it as a one-night stand.

207
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,045
That's enough for me to stay quiet.

208
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,595
You think I didn't know
you were recording me this whole time?

209
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,681
I'll just have this edited.

210
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:27,019
And everyone, including your followers

211
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,439
will know just how
much of a pervert you are.

212
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:36,779
[quirky music playing]

213
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,242
Dennis. Here, have some fruit.

214
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,536
I picked it myself.

215
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,331
Hello, friends!

216
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:53,129
Big reveal time about Mia Hernandez!

217
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,799
She's the kindest person!

218
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:01,387
She's the reason I'm here in the hospital

219
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:06,434
because she paid my hospital bills!

220
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,520
You're heaven-sent, Mia.

221
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,731
Thank you so much!

222
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,568
- [emojis bubbling]
- [quirky music crescendos]

223
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,198
[line ringing]

224
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,535
Madeth, come meet me.

225
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,120
I want updates.

226
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,417
[elevator dings, opens]

227
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:40,217
[mellow music playing]

228
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,025
[Matmat screams] Butterflies!

229
00:12:56,108 --> 00:13:00,571
- They're coming back!
- [Patrick] Mama! Mama!

230
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:04,408
- [Patrick] Mama! Mama!
- [Matmat] Mama!

231
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:12,124
- The butterflies are coming!
- Mama! Mama!

232
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,418
Sorry, Mama,
it took me this long to visit.

233
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:19,548
[mellow music continues]

234
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,759
We couldn't come
back right away because…

235
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,679
Matmat and I kept
moving from one place to another.

236
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,433
We lived wherever we could.

237
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,690
Whenever someone kind enough took us in,

238
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,776
I'd leave Matmat there for a while

239
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,528
whenever I had a job.

240
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,491
But we'd never stay there long.

241
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,411
[screaming]

242
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,455
[Matmat] The butterflies!

243
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,749
- They're here!
- [Patrick] Matmat!

244
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,919
They're coming after Matmat! I want to go!

245
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,380
[Patrick] They won't take you!
We're leaving!

246
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,466
Okay? We're leaving this place!

247
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,846
We kept moving from one place to another.

248
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,685
That's how we've been…

249
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,647
for so many years.

250
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,233
[mellow music continues]

251
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,443
I decided it's time to come back, Ma.

252
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,908
Maybe being here will help Matmat
face his fear of butterflies.

253
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,454
And so we don't have
to keep moving around anymore

254
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,793
and finally live a quiet and stable life.

255
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:43,674
[music intensifies]

256
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,928
[exhales]

257
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,014
It's hard, Mama.

258
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,434
It's hard.

259
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,441
But we have to face it.

260
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,321
I have to face this.

261
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:17,082
[mellow music softens, continues]

262
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,552

[wind blowing softly]

264
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,433
[Gemma] Nurse Patty?

265
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,519
- She's here.
- Okay, thank you.

266
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,689
Who's here?

267
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,192
[Gemma] Oh, it's Cynthia Graciano.

268
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,985
Thirty-five years old.

269
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,947
Dealing with
dissociative identity disorder.

270
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,908
What are her other distinct identities?

271
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,829
An 8-year-old girl
called Little Chin Chin.

272
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,249
- Nurse, please fix up her room.
- [Patrick] What triggered it?

273
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,794
Trauma caused by her father.

274
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,880
She comes all the way from Estrella Sur.

275
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,341
She's been in and out several times.

276
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,096
Your patients really do
come from all over, huh?

277
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,472
Mm-hmm.

278
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,432
They choose this
place because it's isolated.

279
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:19,353
[gentle music playing]

280
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,356
[Gemma] I'll show
you where the patients stay.

281
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,317
If they're not at the dining area,

282
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,902
they'd be in their rooms.

283
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,699
Make sure to change their sheets
and pillowcases every other day.

284
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,452
Don't hesitate to ask
anyone if you need help.

285
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,163
Or me. I'll help you.

286
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,417
Follow me.

00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,003

[Cynthia whining] I don't want to!

289
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,092
- [Patty] Come on.
- I said no!

290
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,678
- Let's go.
- I don't want it here!

291
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,348
Let's go, Chin Chin.
Look, your room's really nice.

292
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,352
- [crying]
- See? We're here.

293
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,271
[whining] I don't want it here.

294
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,024
Chin Chin,
why don't we lay on the bed now?

295
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,026
This bed's nice.

296
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,527
[continues crying]

297
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,864
- [Patrick] We want you to be comfortable.
- Welcome back, Cynthia!

298
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,325
I mean, Chin Chin.

299
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,870
[gentle music continues]

300
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,123

302
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:29,465
I don't want to be here!

303
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,966
Hush now.

304
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,386
Chin Chin…

305
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,555
Let's take your medicine.

306
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,892
I don't want that! I hate that!

307
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,852
I want candy!

308
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,855
- Candy?
- [continues crying]

309
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,651
After you take this…
I'll give you candy.

310
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,529
[whimpers, sniffles]

311
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,989
You promise?

312
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,158
- Promise.

- [sobs louder]
- There.

316
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,012
Hush now.

317
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,515
Get some rest now.

318
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,899
[pensive music playing]

319
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,652
Nurse Patty?

320
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,947
She's a patient, Zelda, right?
The one with depression?

321
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,698
[Patty] Yes.

322
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,494
She's friendly with the other patients,
but she's often alone.

323
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,540
Okay. Thank you.

324
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:51,505

[somber music playing]

329
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,258
Are you a new nurse?

330
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,803
Nurse aide.

331
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,348
[shuddering]

332
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,309
K-Kai.

333
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,730
Person with alcohol use disorder.

334
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,400
[continues to shudder]

335
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,361
Nurse.

336
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,780
It's nothing new to me.

337
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,074
I-I just want to go home!

338
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,285

I get myself treated,

342
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,549
get discharged after a month.

343
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,676
Then the moment I smell alcohol,

344
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,138
I relapse! I'm sick of going in circles!

345
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,600
You can get through this.

346
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,520
You're only saying
that because you work here.

347
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,272
[breathes shakily]

348
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,941
Want to know the truth?

349
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,861
I've had patients who got worse.

350
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,366
But I've also had one who recovered.

351
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,077
He's been sober for two years now.

352
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,790
- R-Really?
- Mm-hmm.

353
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,710
You're already here anyway,
so might as well try.

00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,589
[breathes shakily]

355
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,678
Let's go to your room?

Hey.

360
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,293
How's your first day going?

361
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,669
It's going well.

362
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,881
It's pretty good here, right?
Just look at the place.

363
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,969
It's great. The patients
look like they're just on vacation.

364
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,762
[chuckles softly] Let's go.

365
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,811
Who do you think's going
to be the new nurse manager?

366
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:53,854
I have no clue.

367
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,067
Gemma, I was hoping
to talk to Doctor Lumbera.

368
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,654
Sure, I'll take you to him.

369
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,282
Thank you.

370
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,578
[woman] I am so sorry. I have to run.

371
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,123
[doctor] Oh, no problem, ma'am.
Thank you so much.

372
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:16,001
You're one of
the biggest donors of this hospital.

373
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:19,796
If it weren't for people like you, we
wouldn't be able to accommodate patients

374
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,174
who can't afford a facility like this.

375
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,093
Thank you very much.
You're very welcome, okay?

376
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,470
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Okay.

377
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,807
Doc, this is Patrick.

378
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,310
- Doc, I'm Patrick.
- Ah! Patrick.

379
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,062
Come, let's talk inside.

380
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,898
[Gemma] I have to go. Go on.

381
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,785
Person in the autism spectrum?

382
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,205
And has post-traumatic stress disorder?

383
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,040
Yes, Doc.

384
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,502
We've been moving from
place to place because of his trauma.

385
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,756
Sure, Patrick. Bring your brother here.

386
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,966
[gasps softly] Thank you, Doc.

387
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,386
You can deduct the fees from my salary.

388
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,263
Don't worry about that, Patrick.

389
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,016
We have a charity
care program in this facility.

390
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,936
The fee will be very minimal.

391
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,355
- Really?
- Yes!

392
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,149
Thank you so much.

393
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,943
I'm happy to help.

394
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,411
- [elevator bell dings]
- [elevator doors open]

395
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,872
I knew it.

396
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,083
What do you mean by "I knew it"?

397
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,877
You knew Sir Nurse is in Maravida?

398
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,337
No.

399
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,381
I knew that he's from there.

400
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,051
Oh, yeah. It's his hometown.

401
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,762
But, Miss Mia, did you also know that…

402
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:55,142
Sir Nurse works at the hospital
where your father is confined?

403
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,064
No.

404
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:09,156
[mysterious music playing]

405
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,741
I-Is that okay with you?

406
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,704
I thought you didn't like your father.

407
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,039
Is it okay--

408
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,249
[door slams shut]

409
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,043
Miss Mia?

410
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,754
[knocking]

411
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,049
Miss Mia, can I go home now?

412
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:32,137
[mysterious music continues]

413
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,805
Why am I even asking?

414
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,349
I can just leave.

415
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,227
I should go now.

416
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,521
- [giggling]
- [mysterious music ends]

417
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,762
- [whimsical music playing]
- [Mia] "In the middle of a forest,

418
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:19,100
in a grand palace lived a princess.

419
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:24,856
She was lonely for she was always alone.

420
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,360
As the princess continued
tossing stones into the river,

421
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:31,905
she unexpectedly hit something…

422
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,074
A young boy.

423
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,453
The princess had
unknowingly saved the boy.

424
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,082
From that moment on,

425
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:47,003
the shadow that once
loomed over the princess vanished."

426
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,925
"Why do you keep following me?

427
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,762
Do you want to be my friend?"

428
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:06,439
[uplifting music playing]

429
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,034
It's you, right?

430
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:27,627
[uplifting music continues]

431
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,676
We'll see each other again soon.

432
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:42,058
[ominous music plays]

433
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,060
We have to strike while the iron is hot.

434
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,437
Where's Mia?

435
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,314
From what I see,

436
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,817
you really want
your brother to overcome his fear.

437
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,153
But it all has to start with him.

438
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,197
The light bulb… The light bulb…

439
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,491
They say, that's how
the spirits in the hospital

440
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:02,078
warn that something bad is coming.

441
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,458
Finally.

442
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,044
We meet again.
