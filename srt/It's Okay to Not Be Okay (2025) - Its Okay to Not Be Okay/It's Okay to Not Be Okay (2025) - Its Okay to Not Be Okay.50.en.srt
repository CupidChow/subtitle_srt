you never get tired
of fighting with Matmat.

Didn't you tell me
that I should earn Matmat's trust?

That I should always be on his good side?

What's it about?

364
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,353
- [keyboard clacking]
- Nothing's finalized.

365
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,022
But this is going to be fun.

366
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,442
Mia, give me something!

367
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,110
Come on!

368
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,488
Hey.

369
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,406
Fine! Fine!

370
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,243
I'll talk to Rose.
She'll be your illustrator.

371
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,120
Who said I want a new illustrator?

372
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,167
Um…

373
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,255
Miss Mia, is Matmat
still doing the illustrations?

374
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,339
Yes.

375
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,717
I thought you and Matmat
weren't on good terms.

376
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,302
Nothing will change.

377
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,304
He's still my illustrator.

378
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,182
[quirky music continues]

379
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,852
[Vincent breathing heavily]

380
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:15,774
- [keyboard clacking]
- [quirky music continues, ends]

381
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,742
[rustling]

382
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,460
Matmat?

383
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,254
[Matmat] <i>Patpat?</i>

384
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,839
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

385
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,757
[chuckles softly] Not yet.

386
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:46,013
It's almost time to clock off
and you haven't eaten lunch?

387
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,725
Well, I snacked on some bread earlier.

388
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,686
And besides, I'd rather just eat at home.

389
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,856
M-Mensa.

390
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,401
<i>The restaurant?</i>

391
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,905
Let's eat there after work.

392
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:09,077
Okay. My shift just ended.
I'll just change.

393
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,662
I'll see you there.

394
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,206
Okay.

395
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,084
[phone beeps]

396
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,586
- [camera shutter clicking]
- [Vincent] Post on her account

397
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:22,841
with the caption,
"My next heartwarming story. Soon!"

398
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,719
- [camera clicking]
- My stories aren't heartwarming.

399
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,015
Change it to heartbreaking.

400
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:33,602
Go. Take more
pictures from different angles.

401
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,857
[camera shutter clicks]

402
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,652
[keyboard clacking]

403
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,406
By the way, Mia…

404
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,784
OK Hospital called.

405
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,910
It's about your father.

406
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:54,623
[melancholic music playing]

407
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,126
They said he can no
longer undergo surgery

408
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,045
because of the tumor in his brain.

409
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,050
Tumor or not,

410
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,511
my father is already dead to me.

411
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,889
Mia, he's your only family left.

412
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,265
I've long been an orphan.

413
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,392
You know this, Vincent.

414
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,853
I no longer have family.

415
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:20,315
[melancholic music continues]

416
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,192
[keyboard clacking]

417
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,027
- Maybe you could call--
- Leave.

418
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,490
- But, Mia--
- I said leave.

419
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:34,079
- [keyboard clacking]
- [melancholic music continues]

420
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:52,681
[melancholic music continues]

421
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:17,789
[melancholic music continues]

422
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,753
[music fades]

423
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,131
[line rings]

424
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:32,179
[phone ringing]

425
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,096
Mia?

426
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,347
Let's go out.

427
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,351
I can't today.

428
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,103
Why not?

429
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,983
Matmat asked to hang out.
That doesn't happen often, so I would.

430
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,401
I'll go with you.

431
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,487
Let me come with you. Please.

432
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,697
[sighs]

433
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,616
[chuckles softly]

434
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,832
<i>If I give some away,</i>
<i>you might take everything.</i>

435
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,293
<i>Patpat only belongs to Patpat.</i>

436
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,295
<i>Patpat is happy?</i>

437
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,505
<i>Is this for your book?</i>

438
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,548
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

439
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,258
<i>Out of all the books I've written,</i>

440
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,136
<i>- I really want this one to get published.</i>
- [Patrick] <i>Why?</i>

441
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,764
<i>Because it's inspired by the three of us.</i>
<i>You, me, and Matmat.</i>

442
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,307
<i>Happy day!</i>

443
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,225
<i>Hi, Matmat.</i>

444
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,518
<i>Patpat, what is she doing here?</i>

445
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,270
<i>Matmat, come on! I want siblings too!</i>

446
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,564
<i>I want a brother like you!</i>

447
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:29,152
<i>Sometimes, we have to do things</i>
<i>to find inspiration.</i>

448
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,948
<i>My heart is big enough to share my love.</i>

449
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,534
<i>For Matmat and for you.</i>

450
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,786
<i>Face your fears.</i>

451
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,289
<i>Patrick's been affected</i>
<i>by your phobia of butterflies.</i>

452
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,166
<i>Patpat's affected?</i>

453
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,003
[Matmat] <i>Are you afraid of</i>
<i>butterflies too, Patpat?</i>

454
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,922
[Olivia] <i>There's someone out there</i>

455
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,132
<i>who wants to harm Samuel and Mia.</i>

456
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:55,053
<i>He thought I was Ingrid!</i>
<i>He wanted to kill me!</i>
