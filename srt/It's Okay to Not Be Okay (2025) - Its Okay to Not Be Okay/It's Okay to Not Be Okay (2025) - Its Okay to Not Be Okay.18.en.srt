1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,585
Everyone has emotions.

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,755
We should know how
to express our feelings.

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,965
Liar!

4
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,383
- Matmat.
- Patpat is a liar!

5
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,635
- Liar! Patpat is a liar!
- Matmat.

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,011
We'll go to the neighbors and

7
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,930
find someone who can take you home.

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,432
Who said I'm going home?

9
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,475
- I'm not leaving.
- Mia, don't be stubborn.

10
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,435
- Come on.
- No!

11
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,937
[Jason] Bro! My friend!
Let's have some drinks!

12
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,480
Matmat--

13
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,648
Fine, you can stay.

14
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,108
- [Jason] Let's drink.
- No, thanks.

15
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,484
I'm fine.

16
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,236
The pipe…

17
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,197
broke so… our place is flooded.

18
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,490
Just look after Matmat, okay?

19
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,992
Once you're done cleaning,

20
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,869
knock on my room
and we'll have this together.

21
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:39,914
Patpat doesn't want to sleep with Matmat?

22
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:44,085
If Patpat wants Matmat to stay here,

23
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,628
it's okay.

24
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:53,887
[theme music playing]

25
00:01:56,407 --> 00:02:03,248

31
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,811
[sighs] Uh, Mama…

32
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,775
[papers rustling]

33
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,704
I'm sorry, Mama.

34
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,874
I wasn't accepted into
the University of Marlow.

35
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,169
[Eden] Stu…

36
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,795
Stupid!

37
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,714
I'll try again next year, Mama.

38
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,799
[Eden] Such a failure.

39
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,345
I don't have a child who's a failure.

40
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:44,182
[somber music playing]

41
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,518

[pensive music continues]

45
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,944
[pensive music fades]

46
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,862
[Li] Add some yam-flavored.
How much is the total?

47
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,864
- [vendor] One hundred.
- [Li] Alright, here.

48
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,658
Hey.

49
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,160
Here.

50
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,287
Dear!

51
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,289
[Gemma] Ma.

52
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,666
Well? How was your long shift?

53
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,669
- I'm so tired.
- My poor daughter.

54
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,753
[both grunt]

55
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,005
[exhales deeply]

56
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,966
Why did you buy so much?

57
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,592
This one's for Patrick.

58
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,386
This is for Jason and Matmat.

59
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,554
And this one's for us.

60
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,349
Patrick and Matmat aren't together?

61
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,268
Matmat slept in Jason's room.

62
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,186
Matmat hit Patrick last night.

63
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,981
So I thought they should
sleep separately last night.

64
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,442
I'll give this to Patrick.

65
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,529
Psst. Gemma.
It's too early to try to charm him.

66
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,156
Come on, Ma.

67
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,741
[chuckles softly]

68
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,035
[hurried footsteps receding]

69
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,580
[Gemma] Patrick!

70
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,082
I brought you some bread.

71
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,461
- [lock thuds]
- [gate creaks]

72
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,926
Why are you here?

73
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,347
Hey!

74
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,099
I asked you a question.

75
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,185
What are you doing here?

76
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,353
Are you blind?

77
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,774
Isn't it obvious with what I'm wearing?

78
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,070
I woke up like this because I slept here.

79
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,489
In there.

80
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,911
How about you?

81
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,872
What are you doing here?

82
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,001
[paper rustling]

83
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,422
I didn't know you had
a side hustle as a baker.

84
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,342
I live here.

85
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,512
And Patrick's our tenant.

86
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,015
Ah…

87
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,939
So it was your idea…

88
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,609
for him to come back to Maravida.

89
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,154
I was also the one who referred
him for a job at the hospital.

90
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,201
So, you can say that he's
here in Maravida because of me.

91
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,120
[chuckles softly]

92
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,412
Wow.

93
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,457
Well…

94
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,128
That's what friends are for.

95
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,549
Friends help each other.

96
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,928
[comical music playing]

97
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,096
Oh?

98
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:14,934
[comical music continues]

99
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,811
Are you more than friends?

100
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:20,565
[comical music continues]

101
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,692
Have you already
confessed your love to him?

102
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,571
That's none of your business.

103
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,615
Ah…

104
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,536
So you still haven't confessed to him.

105
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,038
[chuckles]

106
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,957
I beat you to it.

107
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,210
I told him…

108
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,005
"I love you."

109
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,965
"I love you, Patrick!"

110
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,927
[comical music continues]

111
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,971
You're just saying that to piss me off.

112
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,514
No. It's true.

113
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,808
That's what I really told him.

114
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,480
I told him with all my heart. I even
said it in Tagalog. I literally said…

115
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,692
[in Tagalog] I love you!
I love you so much, Patrick!

116
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,863
And I guess he accepted it, because…

117
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,239
Here I am.

118
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,576
[scoffs] I don't believe you.

119
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,370
After that…

120
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,415
He can't help but stay by my side.

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,418
That's why…

122
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,297
I let him have me.

123
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,424
I mean…

124
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,470
I gave him what he wanted.

125
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,306
[comical music continues]

126
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,599
- [loud thud]
- [music ends]

127
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,185
Are you done with your fantasy?!

128
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,520
Are you done hoping?!

129
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,314
Leave Patrick alone, Gemma.

130
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,441
He's really mine.

131
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,819
Do you really have
to own whatever you want?!

132
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,322
That's not love, Mia!

133
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,242
- That's called obsession!
- [Mia scoffs]

134
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,161
You're such a hypocrite.

135
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:01,499
You act kind in front of other people,
pretending to be a sweet, sweet girl.

136
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,334
But the truth is…

137
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,753
You have a nasty mouth!

138
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,046
- [slap]
- [Gemma huffs]

139
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,757
[laughing]

140
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,218
- You're a real witch.
- [Mia laughs]

141
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,304
At least I'm not plastic.

142
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,515
- [breathes sharply] Ow, stop it!
- [menacing music playing]

143
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,809
- [Mia] Mm?
- Mia, let go of me!

144
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,519
I'm not done with you!

145
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,563
- You think you're lovable?!
- [Gemma screams]

146
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,732
- Let me go!
- No one will ever love you!

147
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,858
[Gemma] I said let me go!

148
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,402
- [Mia] Take this!
- [whines]

149
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,822
Ow! Stop it, Mia! It hurts! Let me go!

150
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,824
- Mia, stop it!
- [Patrick] Enough!

151
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,618
- That's enough!
- I'm not done yet!

152
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,786
I said enough!

153
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,247
- [Li] What's going on here?!
- Calm down!

154
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,915
- What's wrong?
- [gasps]

155
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,000
You're here?

156
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:49,171
[menacing music continues]

157
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:02,727
[menacing music continues]

00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,608
[menacing music fades]

159
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,403
How come it's my fault? She slapped me!

160
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,865
- She started it. She provoked me!
- It doesn't matter who started it.

161
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,367
- Why are you siding with her?!
- I'm not taking sides!

162
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,120
You only called me out!
I'm the only one you dragged out here!

163
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,913
You're putting all the blame on me!

164
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,416
Obviously, you're taking sides!

165
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,126
You act like a child.

166
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,003
Go home.

167
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,672
Why are you staying here?

168
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,132
You're better to leave this place.
I'll help--

169
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,425
Can you stop?!

170
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,511
You have no right to tell me
what to do or where to live,

171
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,597
because you don't own me!

172
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,517
[sullen music playing]

173
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,978
You heard what
Gemma and I spoke about earlier?

174
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:46,854
Yes!

175
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,357
And even if I didn't,

176
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,692
you still have no right to say that.

177
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,403
- [sullen music continues]
- [cash rustling]

178
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,655
Go home.

179
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,073
You're on your own.

180
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:02,370

[Li] Patrick. Patrick.

184
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,757
Go check on Matmat.

185
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,344
He's alone outside.
I don't know what he's thinking.

186
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,179
Alright. Thank you. I'll handle it.

Matmat.

194
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,429
Nothing.

195
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,556
It's not wet.

196
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,392
There's… no water.

197
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,227
There's…

198
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,146
…no flood.

199
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,857
The floor is dry.

200
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,317
- It's not wet.
- Matmat.

201
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,529
Matmat.

The flush is working.

206
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,711
Matmat, I'm sorry.

207
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,800
You didn't tell me Miss Mia was here.

208
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,970
You didn't tell the truth.

209
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,723
That's lying, right?

210
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,726
Sorry, Matmat. It won't happen again.

211
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,894
I'm so sorry.

213

W-What happened here?

214
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,572
Where?

215
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:05,326
W-What happened
to Miss Mia here in the house?

216
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,077
Nothing, Matmat. Nothing happened.

217
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,205
Some… Something happened.

218
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,541
Miss Mia's wearing your clothes.

219
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,961
Matmat, it was raining hard.
We were soaking wet.

220
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,508
The rain wouldn't stop,
so she spent the night here.

- [pensive music continues]
- [Matmat breathing sharply]

222

Matmat.

223
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,309
Matmat, I promise
that's all that happened.

[unzipping]

225
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:33,938

[hangers clattering]

227
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,946
You… You should've let
Miss Mia wear this instead.

228
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,573
Y-Your clothes…

229
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,910
are cheap and ugly.

230
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,204
This is more expensive.

231
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,498
You should've let her wear this instead.

232
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,833
Uh…

233
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,669
Okay, Matmat.

234
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,255
Next time,
I'll have her wear your clothes.

235
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,341
Patpat makes bad decisions.

236
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:06,345
Matmat has two expensive shirts.

237
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:10,224
Y-You should've let her wear this instead.

238
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,143
Patpat really makes bad decisions.

[door slides open]

240
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:21,402
- Dear, are you okay now?
- [Gemma sniffling, crying]

241
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,821
Uh…

242
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,742
I brought some bread rolls.
I put some filling in them.

243
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,955
I already heated them
up to match your temper.

244
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,456
Just joking.

245
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,376
[Gemma sobs] Ma.

246
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,087
Why is he like that?

247
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:42,923
[sobs]

248
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,050
Dear, didn't you tell me before

249
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,052
that Mia's always been like that?

250
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:51,640
You said she bullied you. So why are you
surprised when she pisses you off?

251
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,934
[sobbing continues]

252
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,311
[sniffles] Ma!

253
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,606
It's annoying, because…

254
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:02,860
[sniffles] Why did Patrick
just take Mia aside?

255
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,486
[sobbing]

256
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,364
I also pulled Mia's hair!

257
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,619
But why didn't he get mad at me, Ma?!

258
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,996
- Wait one minute.
- [quirky music playing]

259
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,207
You're crying because
Patrick didn't get mad at you?

260
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,710
[sniffles] He also touched Mia.

261
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,922
But he didn't even glance at me, Ma.

262
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,215
Ma, am I invisible?!

263
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,343
Explain it to me a bit more, dear.

264
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,427
Ma.

265
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,095
Ma.

266
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,140
If Patrick gives Mia more attention,

267
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,976
that means they're closer!

268
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,144
You have a point.

00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,646
[sobbing, sniffling]

270
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,939
They've been here for weeks,

271
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,192
but he's never asked
me to hang out in their room?

272
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,738
And Mia easily was able
to spend the night here?

273
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,449
They probably didn't do
anything inappropriate, dear.

274
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:54,161
Oh, Ma! [sobbing loudly]

275
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,205

- Boss, it's kind of upsetting.
- [Vincent] Mm?

280
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:10,219
I traveled all this way,
and this is only what I get to eat?

281
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,512
It feels…

282
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,514
wrong.

283
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,599
What do you want, Madeth?

284
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,935
You want me to scrimp on your meals,

285
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,020
or cut down your salary?

286
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,607
Boss, that's not fair.

287
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,860
You're seriously eating
triple the amount of food I'm having.

288
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,278
- Oh, come on.
- So unfair.

289
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,406
It's not a surprise
whenever I'm here in Maravida.

290
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,116
I'll always go for Gri-Ste-Cev.

Gri-Ste-Cev? What's that?

292
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:37,579
Gri-Ste-Cev. Grilled, stewed, and ceviche.

293
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,083
Enough with the talking!
Give me the good news please!

294
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,752

- Alright, boss. Here it is.

- I have some news, boss.
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

Get ready, boss.

297
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:52,428
The second batch of printing
for The Demon Kid was stopped.

298
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,554
It was stopped.

00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,347

- It didn't reach the quota.

300
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,974
- Three bookstores, boss.
- [offbeat music playing]

301
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:01,061
There were three bookstores
that canceled their pre-order.

- What?!
- They canceled it.

303

And also, Make it Writing Instruments

You asked me to sort them out, right?

309
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,416
They won't continue the deal

310
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,461
unless they talk to Miss Mia personally.

311
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,338
They want to talk
to Miss Mia and her alone.

Welcome back to reality.
Stay with me, okay?

What should we do, boss?

00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,361
We have lots of problems to deal with.

Is Mia your girlfriend?

00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,542
Why did you borrow my motorcycle?

341
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,377
Was it to pick her up?

342
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,213
You gave her food,

343
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,384
took her home and let her sleep there.

344
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,597
Bro, I know you're a good person.
You're practically a saint.

345
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,600
But I don't believe
you did that out of kindness.

346
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,980
Mia is not my girlfriend, okay?

347
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,774
Okay, then you're just crazy.

348
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,442
Come to think of it.

349
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,653
You're not her boyfriend,
but you act like it.

350
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,281

It was Mia who did that.

Every time you see that wound,
it should be a reminder

363
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:01,033
that Mia is dangerous,
especially when you're near her.

364
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,411
Yes, you're right.

365
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,289
Thanks for reminding me.

366
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,790
[Jason chuckles] You bet.

367
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,294
I'm right. I'm just looking out for you.

368
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,297
Maybe I need someone to always remind me.

369
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,381
I mean…

370
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,884
I'm being forgetful lately.

371
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,138
You're not old yet.
You should eat more peanuts.

372
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,225
No, bro. These past days…

373
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,435
I've been forgetful.

374
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,854
I forgot about the butterflies.

375
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,524
I should be finding answers
about what happened to Mama,

376
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,068
but that's not what I'm doing.

377
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,696
I even forgot about Matmat.

378
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,578
I shouldn't be forgetting him.

379
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,247
[bottle thuds]

380
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,125
You're being forgetful
because of that woman?

381
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,460
I shouldn't let that happen.

382
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,381
We're here in Maravida
for Matmat's sessions.

383
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,967
For his therapy.

384
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,761
To help him
rid of his fear of butterflies.

385
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,434
I should focus on Matmat.

386
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,519
[bottle opener clinks]

387
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,191
Butterflies…

388
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,652
Therapy…

389
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,029
Matmat.

390
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,287
[bottles clink]

391
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,290
[bottle thuds]

392
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,126
[Jason] Ah.

393
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,378
[morose music playing]

394
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,132
You drove to get me in
the rain and slept beside me.

395
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,551
How could you kick me out just like that?

396
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,469
Hmph! Hmph!

397
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,888
[grunts] I don't deserve such treatment!

398
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,181
- [grunting]
- [stomping]

399
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,726
[huffs] You're making me confused!

400
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,062
Why do you keep
sending me mixed signals! Huh?

401
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,481
[morose music ends]

402
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:05,657
[quirky music playing]

403
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:18,420
[quirky music continues]

404
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,258
[quirky music ends]

405
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,634
[door opens]

406
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,637
Oh. [grunts]

407
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,556
- [door closes]
- [Patrick groans]

408
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,852
[Patrick breathing heavily]

409
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,271
Matmat?

410
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,864
[Patrick groans]

411
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,242
[soft thud]

412
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,082
[sliding, squeaking]

413
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,458
Matmat?

414
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,630
- [tender music playing]
- [clattering, squeaking]

415
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:06,593
- [thud]
- Where is my favorite brother?

416
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,847
- [chuckles]
- [thuds]

417
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,851
Hmm.

418
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,396
My favorite brother.

419
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,567
What about you, Matmat?

420
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,695
Who's your favorite?

421
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,574
Is it me or Mia?

422
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,452
Because for me…

423
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,913
it's you.

424
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,792
You're the only one I have.

425
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:45,882
[tender music continues]

426
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,768
[tender music fades]

427
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,147
You deserve a love
that makes you complete and happy.

428
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,690
Is it because you like someone else?

429
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,484
[Vincent] What do you need?
Do you need an assistant?

430
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,570
[Mia] She can't stay here.
I have a new housemate.

431
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,988
What will we do for fun?

432
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,531
Trust me, Matmat.

433
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,867
You'll enjoy where we're going.

434
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,869
- I thought you were with him.
- Matmat left?

435
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,287
Yes, he's with Mia.

436
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,957
Miss Mia's house is huge.

437
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,168
If you want to live here,

438
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,670
you have to sign this.
