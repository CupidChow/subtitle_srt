If this is a prelude to how
you are when you're relaxed,

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,755
I want to see the full version.

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,881
Close your eyes first.

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,675
You'll like this.

5
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:12,595
- What's this?
- Satsat, meet Mia.

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,056
Mia, meet Satsat.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,726
To chase away nightmares.

8
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,602
I'll treat you

9
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,481
to your favorite batchoy.

10
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,192
That's not Matmat's favorite,

11
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,778
that's Patpat's.

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,406
Mama always said

13
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,994
you loved going to Maravida's Original.

14
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,164
That's why we kept eating there.

15
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,834
I'm sorry I lean on you so much.

16
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,878
I'll make it up to you.

17
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,088
I love you so much.

- It's him.

20
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,607
Patrick!

21
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,110
What's that?
Are those for us to change into?

22
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,195
Are we having classes again?

23
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,446
No.

24
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,949
You don't have a class.
That's why you're exercising.

25
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,701
Oh, is that so?

26
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,538
Maybe Miss Mia is
here to visit her dad again.

27
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,291
Mia is here?

28
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,879
Yes, we saw her earlier
so we thought we had a class today.

29
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,758
- She and her father aren't close.
- Ah, whatever.

30
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,969
- Even if we don't have a class,
- [quizzical music playing]

31
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,472
I still want to talk and apologize to her.

32
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,058
I think she got mad at me

33
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,686
when I kept asking her questions.

34
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,187
Where did you see her?

35
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,730
There in the lecture room,

36
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,066
and then she went around like this.

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,234
Thanks.

Exercise will help with your therapy.

41
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,038
So you should begin exercising here.

42
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,167
And then, once you're discharged,

43
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,294
try doing Zumba.

44
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,379
It's really fun.

45
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,173
Have you tried doing it?

46
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,717
Ah, no.

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,262
But whenever I watch
people doing Zumba in the plaza,

48
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,681
it makes me happy. [chuckles]

Even if your last
conversation ended badly,

I believe that your daughter
would want you to keep living your life.

- They kept convincing me to teach here,

and now they're suspending me? [huffs]

Miss Elvie, Nurse Patty
is looking for you. Shall we go?

69
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,873
Uh, Patrick.

70
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,251
I actually want to talk to her.

[unsettling music continues]

72
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,548
Doc Anok told me…

73
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,302
that you're not my daughter.

74
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,433
That's confusing.

75
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,059
What's so confusing?

76
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,352
[music fades]

77
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,272
You should be able
to recognize your own daughter.

78
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,690
I think we should go.

79
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:20,278
If I've done anything
to you or if I've caused a problem,

80
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,781
because of my condition,

81
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,074
I apologize.

82
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,909
- I got suspended.
- [tense music playing]

83
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,370
- Mia, please. She's lucid right now.
- It's the truth.

84
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,122
I got suspended.

85
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,916
And no one even told
me that I was suspended.

[music turns somber]

87
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,211
I apologize.

Uh, if you want,

89
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,468
I can talk to Dr. Anok.

90
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:49,891
I'll convince him
to get you out of suspension.

[somber music continues]

92
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,566
I like that.

93
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,862
It looks expensive.

- Mia!
- What?

100
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,464
She's stuck in here anyway.

101
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,675
She doesn't need it anymore.

102
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,136
- Mia, give it back--
- Okay.

103
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,890
If that means I can make it up to you,

104
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,184
then you can have it.

105
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,063
Great. That was easy.

106
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,442
Thank you.

107
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,030
Why did you give it to her?
Your daughter gave that to you!

Patrick, it's fine.

109
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,036

Your brother is very talented.

I'm sure he'll do a great
job illustrating your book.

I'm sure of that too.

Do you know what
his current favorite book is?
