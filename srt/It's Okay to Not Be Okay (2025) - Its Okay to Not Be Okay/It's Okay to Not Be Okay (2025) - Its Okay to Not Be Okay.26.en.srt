00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:02,338
Are you having nightmares again?

00:00:02,421 --> 00:00:04,091
Ever since I came back here.

00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:04,967
- Come on.
- No!

4
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:06,054
- We're leaving.
- Miss Mia…

5
00:00:06,137 --> 00:00:07,431
Let go of her!

6
00:00:11,105 --> 00:00:13,068
You were just like Prince Charming.

7
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:14,278
- Come back…
- [Madeth] Boss, wait!

8
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:15,864
…when you can face
Mia like decent people.

9
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:17,117
I'd run away with you.

10
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:20,040
Just say when and I'll drop everything.

11
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:21,417
- Give me that.
- Mia!

12
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:23,003
- [phone ringing]
- Give me that.

13
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:25,551
Hello?

14
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:26,761
Where's Patrick?

15
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:27,846
Say hi.

16
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,976
Patrick, why you didn't go to work today?

17
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,062
You were absent?

18
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:33,191
You said it was your day off.

19
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:35,362
You were absent from work today,

20
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:37,616
so we can get fresh air together?

21
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,370
You told me that I should leave.

22
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:40,372
To run away.

23
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:43,712
But how am I supposed to go
if you were holding me this tight?

Do you want to know
what I dreamed about last night?

27
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:49,260
You said you couldn't remember?

28
00:01:50,512 --> 00:01:51,639
It was my Mama.

29
00:01:53,643 --> 00:01:55,605
I dreamt about her again.

30
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:58,236
Again?

31
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:01,701
Every time it happens,

32
00:02:01,784 --> 00:02:03,997
I always wake up feeling so shitty.

33
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,173
But this time…

["Kathang Isip" instrumental continues]

35
00:02:11,929 --> 00:02:13,725
This time I got lucky.

36
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:16,981
I got some help.

["Kathang Isip" instrumental continues]

Looks like you'll always
be getting some fresh air now.

you can face Mia like decent people."

Am I not human?

44

Do I look like an alien?

45
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:54,640
The audacity of Patrick to say that to me!

[clink, thud]

47
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:03,742
I was there when Mia
first went through all that!

That's why I know how to help her!

49

[Gemma] Hey!

50
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,050
You're a grown man and you're so loud!

51
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:13,428
You're being annoying!

52
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:15,348
I can't even choose what song to sing!

53
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:17,060
It's true…

54
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:19,356
I'm genuinely concerned for Mia.

Even if they all think badly of me,

I won't leave her.

- I won't.
- Leave her!

I'm not leaving Mia.

59
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:36,933
- Because we're a team.
- [bottles clinking]

60
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,816
And teamwork makes the dream work!

Whatever!

62
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:45,367
That means nothing! [chuckles]

you're getting on my nerves!

There are no good songs! [bangs]

Why are they all love songs?!

69

Wait! Why does your voice sound familiar?

This is Gemma Bautista,

Move! Get out of my way!

78
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,620
You're such a nuisance! Just like Mia,

Don't talk about Patrick like that!

Hey! You've slapped me twice already!

00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:01,644
You deserved it!

95
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:04,107
You're not doing your job right!

96
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,155
You shouldn't have let
Mia come here to Maravida!

[sobs] I think this is my fault.

I'm the reason
Miss Mia's class got canceled.

Of course not.

You didn't do anything wrong, right?

112
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:48,696
It's my fault. [crying]

113
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,082
Not everything's about you.

114
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:56,253
You think the world revolves around you?

115
00:05:58,383 --> 00:06:00,595
That was harsh.

for them to get any closer.

It's big.

Patrick, I wanted to know…

148
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,612
Is Mia your girlfriend?

149
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:34,324
Huh?

150
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:37,664
Well, aren't you and
Matmat staying at her place?

151
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,668
So are you two living together?

152
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:40,754
No, Doc.

153
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:43,008
And no, Mia's not my girlfriend.

154
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:45,680
Why'd you miss work yesterday?

155
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,936
I just had to take care of something.

156
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,815
You were taking care of Mia?

157
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:51,859
Doc…

158
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:54,948
Okay, okay!

159
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:57,663
Patty reported something to me.

Elvie was following
Mia before she fainted.

161
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,179
Do you know why?

162
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:13,026
Mia told me she didn't do anything wrong,

163
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:17,536
but she did tell her,
her mother already passed away.

164
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:19,247
Mia told you that?

165
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,500
Doc, come on!

166
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,378
No, I mean that's a good thing.

167
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,173
If Mia told you that,

168
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:27,221
maybe that's what shocked Elvie.

169
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:30,477
She thinks Mia is her daughter.

170
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:34,068
And Mia thinks Miss Elvie is her mother.

171
00:08:36,532 --> 00:08:39,078
Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised.

[music turns uneasy]

180
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:13,689
She just disappeared.

[ominous music sting]

00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:18,073
Into thin air.

183
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:24,127
- They said they tried to look for her.
- [pensive music resumes]

184
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,089
But after seven years,

185
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:29,053
they had Ingrid declared dead.

[unsettling music playing]

187
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:43,081
Did you think that was yours?

188
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,544
Well, it isn't.

189
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,262
You thought it was over?

190
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:54,312
Well, big mistake.

191
00:09:54,395 --> 00:10:00,282
[unsettling music intensifies]

- [unsettling music fades]
- [footsteps receding]

193
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,129
When Mister Samuel came here,

194
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:11,262
did he leave any relatives or employees
at the mansion with Mia?

195
00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:13,851
I don't think so.

196
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:16,231
As far as I know,
it was just the two of them.

197
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:20,155
Both sides of Mia's parents had no family.

198
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,616
As a matter of fact,

199
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,372
Mia was the one
who brought Samuel here, to the hospital.

200
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,505
- [Dipong] She will come back.
- [ominous music sting]

201
00:10:29,298 --> 00:10:32,764
Ma'am… Ma'am Ingrid.

202
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:34,100
[ominous music sting]

203
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,689
Why'd you ask?

204
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:38,734
No reason.

205
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:41,907
Maybe we could ask
someone about their family.

206
00:10:47,836 --> 00:10:52,136
[Anok] Samuel,
what do you remember about your family?

207
00:10:54,015 --> 00:11:01,154
- [Samuel humming]
- [unsettling music playing]

208
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:09,003
Too much love is not love.

209
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:16,936
[unsettling music continues]

210
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:18,856
[ominous music sting]

211
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:22,404
What really
happened to your family, Samuel?

212
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:27,581
[unsettling music crescendos]

213
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,920
Do they have an activity out here, ma'am?

214
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:31,882
Aren't they supposed
to be in class with Mia?

215
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:36,432
Were you not informed
that Mia's class has been suspended?

216
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:38,228
N-No.

217
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:40,065
After the incident,

218
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:45,284
Doc Anok decided
that she's not healthy for the patients.

219
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:47,121
And for Mia's sake too.

220
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:51,504
[Pogi] One more time! Let's go!
Three, two, one, let's go!

221
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:53,718
One, two, three, four.

222
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:54,887
Alright, smile!

223
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,266
[Eden] This was Doc Anok's suggestion.

224
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:00,606
He thought it would cheer up the patients

225
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:03,486
since they're sad
that they don't have class.

226
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:06,827
[Patrick sighs]

227
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:08,622
I understand them.

228
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:11,544
Mia's a gifted storyteller.

229
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:13,214
Have you read her books?

230
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:18,308
[birds chirping]

231
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:23,026
No.

232
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,697
Children's books aren't my thing.

233
00:12:26,282 --> 00:12:29,538
I much prefer, love stories.

234
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,881
- You're a romantic--
- With revenge.

235
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,427
Or horror.

236
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:37,764
[sorrowful music playing]

237
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:39,810
That's what I like.

238
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,396
- Patrick.
- Ma'am?

239
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,233
I need assistance.

240
00:12:43,316 --> 00:12:45,445
Okay. Excuse me.

241
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:51,792
[sorrowful music continues]

242
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:56,927
[music fades]

243
00:12:57,011 --> 00:13:00,309
They say that a great
story can start from an image.

244
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:03,481
So maybe I can find
inspiration from your drawings.

245
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:07,866
[stammering] Matmat is here to draw

246
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:11,832
without a story?

247
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:13,126
I have ideas.

248
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,880
I have lots of them.

249
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:16,132
I just want more.

250
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:23,063
Does Miss Mia want
to see Matmat's old drawings?

251
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:25,108
Do you want to see them?

252
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:26,152
Alright.

253
00:13:26,235 --> 00:13:29,742
I might find a brilliant idea there.

254
00:13:29,826 --> 00:13:31,245
What's that?

255
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:34,920
T--This is Trexy with Mama Dinosaur.

256
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:39,470
I don't want to write about dinosaurs.

257
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:43,061
T--Trexy's story is good.

258
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:46,985
He lost his Mama Dinosaur.

259
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:49,657
Then when he woke up,

260
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,830
he was at Chacha's house.

261
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:53,916
[Mia chuckles softly]

262
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,049
You remind me of my
professor at the University of Marlowe

263
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,970
who also had a fascination for dinosaurs.

264
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,230
University of Marlowe?

265
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:06,357
It's in the UK.

266
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:08,863
That's where I studied creative writing.

267
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:14,415
You went to school far away from here?

268
00:14:14,498 --> 00:14:16,836
Yes. Why? You don't believe me?

269
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,721
It should be here.

270
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:28,109
Here.

271
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,990
Emilia Hernandez.

272
00:14:31,074 --> 00:14:32,743
University of Marlowe.

273
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,040
So, no.

274
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,548
We will not be writing about dinosaurs.

275
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:43,556
Think of something.

276
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:55,330
[whimsical music playing]

277
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:59,046
Like a safety pin.

278
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:05,392
A person who can be a safety pin.

279
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:11,904
[whimsical music intensifies, fades]

280
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:16,414
[gulps]

281
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:26,476
You said you'd
introduce me to your daughter.

282
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:30,400
She's not coming.

283
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:31,611
Why not?

284
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,076
She's not coming because she's dead.

285
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:38,625
[Elvie] I'll give it for 150 pesos.

286
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,086
[male customer] Could you go lower?

287
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:44,637
[Elvie] That's the cheapest
fish you can buy here.

288
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:47,226
Thanks! Here's your change.

289
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:50,983
Come get your fish!

290
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:53,154
- [female customer] How much?
- It's fresh!

291
00:15:53,238 --> 00:15:54,490
- Ma!
- 150 pesos.

292
00:15:54,573 --> 00:15:56,661
- I have a gift for you.
- One kilogram, please.

293
00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:58,414
Alright. Here's a basket.

294
00:15:58,498 --> 00:15:59,960
Take your pick.

295
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,629
Ma, you have to open it.

296
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,007
- Please.
- What is it?

297
00:16:03,091 --> 00:16:05,262
You'll love it. I got it for you.

298
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,522
What is this?!

299
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,025
- Uh…
- Hmm?

300
00:16:12,109 --> 00:16:14,113
- Why, Ma?
- This looks expensive!

301
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:15,907
Why are you buying these things?

302
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:17,035
You don't like the color?

303
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:19,790
- I can replace it.
- No, I don't like it!

304
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:21,919
You can use this
when you visit me in London.

305
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:23,756
You spend so much--London?!

306
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,468
I'm not going there!

307
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:26,846
My goodness!

308
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:28,224
Come get your fish!

309
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:32,232
Ma, are you still
against me working abroad?

310
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:37,117
You can earn
the same amount of money here.

311
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:38,536
Just stay here.

312
00:16:39,455 --> 00:16:41,375
Who else will take over this stall?

313
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,133
[indistinct background chatter]

314
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:48,681
I got you this because it's
your birthday this weekend.

315
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:52,272
I even took time off
work just to be with you.

316
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:54,193
Do you not appreciate that?

317
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:58,284
Don't rub it in
that you have money now, Jana!

318
00:16:58,368 --> 00:16:59,453
My god!

319
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,042
- Is that what you think I'm doing?
- [morose music playing]

320
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,419
Why?

321
00:17:03,503 --> 00:17:04,838
Hmm?

322
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:09,723
So just because I didn't get
to spoil you when you were young,

323
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:12,145
you're showing off like it's my fault?

324
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:14,692
I'm not showing off!

325
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:18,616
I just want to show
you that I can provide for both of us!

326
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,453
That is showing off!

327
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:23,459
Are you ashamed of my livelihood?!

328
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,801
Ma, there's nothing
wrong with selling fish.

329
00:17:27,885 --> 00:17:33,146
What I don't like is how you
disregard my feelings and my needs!

330
00:17:34,523 --> 00:17:37,154
Oh, enough with the tears!

331
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:39,825
Enough with the drama! Stop crying!

332
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:42,456
I don't have time for your damn feelings!

333
00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:49,553
[morose music continues]

334
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:55,982
[Elvie] Almost a kilo.

335
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:58,488

[loud crash]

337
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:01,243
Jana?! Jana!

[horn blaring]

339
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:03,539
Jana!

My child!

343
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:13,016
[woman] Poor thing!

344
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:15,397
The girl is dead.
The mom must be devastated.

345
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,655
[Elvie crying] My child! My child!

346
00:18:19,738 --> 00:18:23,162
[somber music continues]

347
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:25,709
My child!

[wailing] My child!

[wailing] My child!

00:18:39,903 --> 00:18:44,538
[somber music continues]

354
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:47,294
[crying]

355
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:51,969
I wish I had been a good mother to her.

356
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:56,395
I wish I were a good mom.

357
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,441
[crying]

358
00:18:58,524 --> 00:19:01,071
[somber music continues]

359
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:03,660
[Tessie] Always take care of your brother.

360
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,747
Always protect him, okay?

361
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:10,047
Always be there for him.

362
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:14,723
I had you…

363
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:18,856
because your brother needs you.

364
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:26,497
[somber music continues]

00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:37,602
[Elvie crying] If only…

00:19:39,815 --> 00:19:40,984
If only…

367
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:43,781
- [Elvie crying]
- [somber music fades]

368
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:45,660
Mia?

369
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:47,330
Mia?

370
00:19:47,414 --> 00:19:48,708
- [Matmat] She's not here.
- Ah!

371
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,464
[stammering] She took a nap.

372
00:19:51,547 --> 00:19:56,307
She's resting because
Mia and Matmat worked.

373
00:19:58,561 --> 00:19:59,980
She's resting?

374
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:02,611
And she's getting some sleep.

375
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:04,531
A peaceful sleep.

376
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:09,917
Matmat, has Mia been writing here?

377
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,962
[Stammering] Mia writes there.

378
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:16,722
Sometimes, she works on her laptop.

379
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,395
[birds chirping]

380
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:21,690
If she's writing,

381
00:20:21,774 --> 00:20:24,279
that means she's working on her story!

382
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:26,742
Matmat, do you think
Mia's doing okay here?

383
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:28,454
Hmm…

384
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:30,458
Mia's doing okay.

385
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,169
She's not sick.

386
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:35,092
Mia and Matmat are working together.

387
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,305
Oh my gosh.

388
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:39,977
[gleeful sigh] Thank you, Lord!

389
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,189
You know, the last time she was here--

390
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,112
Oh god, Matmat! What a pain!

391
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:50,832
Uh, Mia, I've talked
with the staff of OK Hospital.

392
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:55,090
- They said Sir Samuel's all settled there.
- [melancholic music playing]

393
00:20:55,174 --> 00:20:56,469
Um…

394
00:20:56,552 --> 00:20:58,389
[luggage thuds]

395
00:20:58,473 --> 00:21:01,979
[Vincent breathing heavily]

396
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:04,066
Maybe it's time…

397
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:08,451
you say goodbye to this place.

398
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:13,294
I will never miss this place.

399
00:21:16,634 --> 00:21:21,100
[melancholic music continues, fades]

400
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:24,148
That's why I don't want her here.

401
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:28,324
I don't want her
to remember all the bad memories.

402
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:32,874
M--Mia is okay.

403
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,003
She doesn't seem sad.

404
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:38,093
[quirky music playing]

405
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,972
Okay, okay.

406
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:43,980
Matmat, if you say she's okay here,

407
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:46,861
that means she's okay for now,
then it's okay with me!

408
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:52,581
[quirky music continues]

409
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:54,668
[quirky music intensifies, fades]

410
00:21:55,085 --> 00:21:57,340
- [glass clinks]
- [liquid trickling]

411
00:21:58,467 --> 00:21:59,469
Alright.

412
00:22:01,473 --> 00:22:03,394
What's bothering you? Tell me everything.

413
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:07,026
It's my mom.

414
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:13,205
[waves lapping distantly]

415
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:14,290
Bro,

416
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,670
do you think…

417
00:22:21,054 --> 00:22:23,559
she regrets what she did to me?

418
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:27,984
You mean,

419
00:22:29,363 --> 00:22:31,992
when you needed
to step up for your brother?

420
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:38,004
Or when you weren't
even circumcised yet…

421
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:40,593
[chuckles softly]

422
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:46,312
…and she left
you with a huge responsibility?

423
00:22:46,397 --> 00:22:52,324
[tender music playing]

424
00:22:53,744 --> 00:22:56,458
Will it make you feel better if we assume

425
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,921
that she regrets what she did to you?

426
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:04,600
Yes.

427
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:10,486
[tender music continues]

428
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,739
Maybe.

429
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:16,916
I don't know anymore, bro.

430
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:24,431
[sobbing]

431
00:23:24,514 --> 00:23:26,685
Stop it. You're going to make me cry.

432
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:29,441
[tender music continues]

433
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:31,194
You're unfair.

434
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:32,822
You always do this.

435
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:35,536
You make me feel sad when you're sad.

436
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,914
[both sobbing]

437
00:23:36,997 --> 00:23:38,208
[liquid trickling]

438
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:42,007
[exhales sharply]

439
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:43,511
[sniffles]

440
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:46,182
Hey, Aunt Tessie!

441
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:51,819
My friend has been
heartbroken since birth!

442
00:23:52,946 --> 00:23:56,453
You made him suffer a lot! I hate you!

443
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:58,290
- Argh!
- [glass shatters]

444
00:23:58,373 --> 00:23:59,960
[Li] Hey! Stop that!

445
00:24:00,043 --> 00:24:03,843
[tender music continues]

446
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:05,722
[sobbing] I'm sorry, bro.

447
00:24:06,598 --> 00:24:07,726
Leave me!

448
00:24:09,312 --> 00:24:11,817
Auntie Li, I wasn't talking to you.

449
00:24:12,736 --> 00:24:14,823
I'm having a moment here.

450
00:24:14,906 --> 00:24:16,326
Jason!

451
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:18,664
- Can't you give her a little respect?
- [tender music fades]

452
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,462
She's already dead.
And she was still a mother.

453
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:26,680
You don't get it.
Look at him. He's been very tired.

454
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:29,018
[Jason sobs]

455
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,395
Here. Eat this.

456
00:24:32,734 --> 00:24:33,903
Thank you.

457
00:24:35,322 --> 00:24:36,659
[plate thuds]

458
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:40,332
[waves lapping distantly]

459
00:24:40,415 --> 00:24:44,591
Do you really think Tessie had it easy?

460
00:24:48,683 --> 00:24:53,274
I only have Gemma,
but I still had a hard time raising her.

461
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,738
What more for a mother of two,

462
00:24:55,822 --> 00:24:57,992
and one has a condition?

463
00:24:58,076 --> 00:25:02,585
[gentle music playing]

464
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:05,508
But this isn't about who had it easier.

465
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:10,643
I don't know everything
your family went through.

466
00:25:12,856 --> 00:25:14,316
But I know…

467
00:25:15,611 --> 00:25:17,866
and I'm very sure…

468
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:23,544
that no mother would
want her child to suffer.

469
00:25:23,627 --> 00:25:28,596
[gentle music continues]

470
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,223
That's why…

471
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:32,896
even though it's hard,

472
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:36,360
try to understand her, okay?

473
00:25:37,697 --> 00:25:43,709
[gentle music continues]

474
00:25:47,634 --> 00:25:50,013
Oh! Let me take a shot.

475
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:53,061
- Where's my drink?
- The bottle is almost empty.

476
00:25:53,144 --> 00:25:54,731
This last shot is yours.

477
00:25:54,815 --> 00:25:56,484
Fine. Come on, let's drink.

478
00:25:56,568 --> 00:25:58,572
Let me join you. Come on.

479
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:02,747
- [glasses clink]
- Cheers.

480
00:26:02,831 --> 00:26:08,049
[gentle music continues]

481
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,427
[Jason] It's empty now.

482
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:14,896
[mellow music continues]

483
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,488
[gentle music fades]

484
00:26:19,572 --> 00:26:23,037
If this is a prelude to how
you are when you're relaxed,

485
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:24,624
I want to see the full version.

486
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,799
I can only give you the trial version.

487
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:29,885
[chuckles]

488
00:26:30,678 --> 00:26:33,851
I'll take you to your favorite--

489
00:26:33,934 --> 00:26:37,776
That's not Matmat's favorite.
Mama said it was your favorite.

490
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:39,905
Matmat would always
wake up in the middle of the night

491
00:26:40,489 --> 00:26:43,077
because of his nightmares.

492
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:44,956
Now, you'll not be sleeping alone.
