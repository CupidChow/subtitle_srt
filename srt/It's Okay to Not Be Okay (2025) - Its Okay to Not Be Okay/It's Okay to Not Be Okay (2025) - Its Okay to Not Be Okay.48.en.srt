What will you do?

183
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,744
We'll still look for her.

184
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,579
Have you had breakfast yet?

185
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,832
M-Mm-hmm.

186
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,333
I-I had fried rice,

187
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,962
sausage, and eggs at Mama Li's.

188
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,549
Okay, Matmat.
I'm going to the hospital now.

189
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,343
I'll try to get home early so
we can have dinner together.

190
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,846
Matmat has to go.

191
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,849
Bye-bye.

192
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,810
- Okay. Take care--
- [disconnected tone]

193
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,978
Matmat?

194
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,188
Hello, Matmat?

195
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,984

- [chuckles]

197
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,662
[nurse] Let me do that, ma'am.

198
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,663
No need.

199
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,874
I can take Samuel to Doctor Emman.

200
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,167
Alright.

201
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,376
Thanks.

202
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,214

204
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,143
Everything's going to be alright.

205
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,271
I'll be waiting while
you're having your checkup.

206
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,570
[music fades]

207
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,946
Nurse Gemma.

208
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,657
How are the patients?

209
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,993
We're done with
the morning rounds, ma'am.

210
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,870
I mean, patient Samuel.

211
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,706
Ah! He's got a checkup with Doctor Emman

212
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,957
following last night's incident.

213
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,919
Patty also said they'll run some tests

214
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,130
and consult with
his neurologist and surgeon.

215
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,716
I hope the results
and feedback is positive.

216
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,010
Samuel has been unwell for so long.

217
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,722
Hopefully, his tumor hasn't come back.

218
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,475
How about patient Zelda?

219
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,437
They still haven't found her.

220
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,607
After she left Mia's,

221
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,776
Zelda was last seen at Barangay Hillside.

222
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,113
Who knows where Zelda is now.

223
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,953
Maybe we should vacate her bed now.

224
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,663
Ma'am?

225
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,122
[unsettling music playing]

226
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,541
But Doc Anok advised us

227
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,626
to be ready for
when she comes back.

228
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,919
[scoffs]

229
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,714
Zelda wasn't even
stable when she ran away,

230
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,299
how do you expect her to come back?

231
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,594
I was just thinking, Nurse Gemma,

232
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,681
the hospital's waiting list is so long.

233
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,599
Instead of having an empty bed,

234
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,434
maybe we should start arranging things

235
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,852
for a new patient.

236
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,189
Anyway, I'll discuss
this with Doctor Anok.

237
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:21,151
For now, you can ask
the nurse aide to clear Zelda's things.

238
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,778
Okay? Thank you.

239
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,824
[unsettling music continues, fades]

240
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,909
[Cynthia] Is she really not coming back?

241
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:33,956
She's only been gone for
a day and already has been evicted,

242
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,708
without any warning.

243
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,169
I'm just following orders.

244
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:43,382
Don't worry, if she returns and
you already have a new roommate,

245
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,176
I'm sure Doc Anok will be considerate.

246
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,678
Okay.

247
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,767
- Patrick.
- Yes?

248
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,229
You look glowing today.

249
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,857
- [light-hearted music playing]
- What?

250
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,111
It's like there's
a happy filter on your face.

251
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,323
Does my face look like
a cellphone screen to you?

252
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,368
I'm serious!
That's exactly what I'm seeing.

253
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:16,874
Mind you,
I haven't used my shaman powers yet.

254
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:20,920
But something good happened, huh?

255
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,379
[snickers] Nothing.

256
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,089
- [Cynthia] Come on.
- Go get some fresh air.

257
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,674
Want me to join you?

258
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,843
It's fine, I can manage.

259
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,555
If the sun hits you,
it will highlight your glow even more.

260
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,806
Thank you.

261
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,850
Hey, can you smile again?

262
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,311
- Look at that smile.
- Go on.

263
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,896
Alright.

I don't see what I want on the menu.

274
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,936
W-What do you want?

275
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,524
I want you and Patrick
to come back to the mansion.

- Jason!

Jason!

280
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,953
- [Jason] Yes, Matmat?
- Come on, let's talk.

281
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,871
Mia, I'll take your order.

282
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,707
- You can order anything.
- Matmat?

283
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,792
- I'll take your order.
- Hey, Matmat.

284
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,585
- Who do you want to talk to?
- Matmat--

285
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,461
Not you.

286
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,171
I want to talk to Matmat.

287
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,507
Mia, wait!

288
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,717
- That's--
- Matmat?

- That's for employees only!

[Jason] Mia, you can't go there.

- Matmat, wait.
- Mia!

- Let's talk.

Matmat, did you hear that?

00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,481
Hey, let's talk!

302
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,900
Sure, you'll convince
him with all that shouting.

N-No!

Just get out of my way.

- Fifty?!
- Matmat, let's talk.

00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,038
Let's talk properly.

309
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,332
Mia, seriously,
I don't think Matmat's okay.

310
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,084
Can you just leave him alone for now?

311

I-I don't want to go back to your house.

314

I'll just tell you while you're working.

315
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,642
Matmat, you're still my illustrator.

316
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,560
So I want to discuss with you

317
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,396
the new concept for my next book.

318
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,941
And it's because of you.

[tender music playing]

320
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,696
Because of this…

this drawing you gave me.

00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,494
Threw away.

323
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,704
Matmat didn't give you that.

324
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,164
He threw it away.

325
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,710
Because of this drawing you threw away,

326
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,672
I thought of a new concept.

327
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,594
There are three souls that will journey

No.

332
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,905
I won't take no as an answer, Matmat.

- Yes.

I'll report you to the police.

340
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,718
I'll say that you, Matmat Gonzales…

341
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,720
failed to honor his contract.

342
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,434
That's called breach of contract.

343
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,313
You signed a contract but you're not
doing your part as an illustrator.

344
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,568
So if you don't want to get sued…

345

Matmat, come with me.

Eden!

363

Who are you
to make decisions for my patient?

364

Let's not talk here?

365
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,617
No, we'll talk here!

366
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,703
You have no authority
to have Zelda's bed cleared.

367
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,247
She'll be back.

368
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,582
Are you sure?

369
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,543
How do you know she'll be back?

00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,087
Did she tell you?

371
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,506
Did you even really take care of her?

372
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,551
She's only been gone for one day!

373
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,511
Okay.

374
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,889
Olivia, the patients here are voluntarily.

375
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:10,227
So if they leave or run away,
it shouldn't be our concern anymore.

376
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:14,398
So as early as now,
it's better if we admit a new patient.

377
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,858
Because there are many
on the waiting list.

378
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,277
Don't you want that?

379
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,737

sucking up for a promotion!

383

I'm only saying the truth, Olivia!

384
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,958
So with one less patient,
isn't that better?

385
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,753
You'll have more time
to take care of patient Samuel.

386
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,423

I'm still wondering.

Why did Zelda go to visit Mia?

418

Doc, I can't think of
any other reason except that

419
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,042
she just wanted to greet Mia.

420
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,001
It was her birthday.

[Pogi] They're here!

[Eden] You're doing that to yourself

429

care about her anymore!

- Thank you.
- Alright, Jason.

Fine!

then pay me back for everything I spent.

Matmat won't return anything.

He owes nothing.

442

You lived in my house
and ate the food I bought.

443
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,474
That was Mia's decision.

444

that you were my illustrator.

Oh no.
