1
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,680
I can't take it off Lin Ran

2
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,039
I told you not to move

3
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,630
Hurry up and help

4
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,510
I can't take it down

5
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,160
let me see

6
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,830
Don't worry, let me take a look for you

7
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,720
Relax

8
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,190
You tap

9
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,590
You tap

10
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,310
Let me take a look for you

11
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,039
Tap you tap

12
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,080
You tap

13
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,120
I relax

14
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,310
relax

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,870
pain

16
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,720
lighter

17
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:43,800
relax

18
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,190
Take it easy, the more you stretch it, the tighter it becomes

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,270
Relax

20
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,400
Don't work hard

21
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:49,950
take it easy

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,039
Hi mom

23
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,230
It's okay i'm okay

24
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,680
good

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I will tell my classmates

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,080
Lin Ran

27
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,270
My sister is okay

28
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,440
real

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Do you have something tonight

30
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,670
My mother said she would have a banquet at home

31
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,630
Say thank you

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,110
No

33
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,470
I always feel tight in my chest

34
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,470
Feel something is going to happen

35
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,630
What's wrong

36
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,800
have no idea

37
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,079
Weiwei said that the store will take stock tonight

38
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,550
Why haven't you come back for so long?

39
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,190
this late

40
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,240
I called her before

41
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,720
I feel something is wrong with her

42
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,750
It must be this Lin Ran who annoyed her again

43
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,240
Uncle, you are too prejudiced against Lin Ran

44
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,520
Maybe Lin Ran later

45
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,670
Sent Weiwei back

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,360
Don't think about it, go to sleep

47
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,110
You are sleepy, go to sleep

48
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,030
I can not sleep

49
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,550
I'm so sleepy

50
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,190
I can't stand it anymore

51
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,910
I went to bed first

52
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,240
Hey

53
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,470
slight

54
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,360
You finally answered the phone

55
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,520
Where are you

56
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,000
I got hurt today

57
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,880
Then I can't find you

58
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,080
My today

59
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,320
Fell off the bed

60
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,600
Twisted the foot

61
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,040
slight

62
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,200
Tang Weiwei, you speak

63
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,160
let's break up

64
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,070
slight

65
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,270
Why are you breaking up with me

66
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,110
Don't we want to be good?

67
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,510
You are trying to play a truth or dare with Li

68
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,070
Yes or no

69
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,760
Even if it's a death row prisoner

70
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,390
At least know what I did

71
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,880
Then what did i do you tell me

72
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,600
We are not suitable

73
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,270
What is inappropriate

74
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,830
You tell me why we are inappropriate

75
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,920
What did i do wrong you tell me i change

76
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,390
Everyone said I was wrong

77
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,880
Everyone says we two don't match well

78
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,600
I work hard to withstand these pressures

79
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,510
I try to make myself better

80
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,880
So good that everyone can forget

81
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,920
The age gap between the two of us

82
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,320
But i can't do it

83
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,640
I can't get better

84
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,350
Lin Ran

85
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,160
I'm just an ordinary person

86
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,920
I will be tired too

87
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,070
I miss my boyfriend

88
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,200
Not a child living in an ivory tower

89
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,920
I don't want to be forever

90
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,440
Trapped in the fairy tale you weave

91
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,000
Tang Weiwei

92
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Tang Weiwei

93
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,920
Although it's not public, no one in the department knows

94
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,790
Ji Han is the suitor who drives away Lin Ran from the palace

95
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,070
But Lin Ran never speaks every time

96
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,070
If this is not true love

97
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,600
Then I don't believe in love anymore

98
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,550
I got hurt today

99
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,320
I can't find you either

100
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,910
My today

101
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,760
Fell off the bed

102
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,080
Twisted ankle

103
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,400
dad

104
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:10,960
slight

105
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,840
Me and your brother

106
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,710
Go out and do something

107
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,440
You take a good rest today

108
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,880
remember to eat

109
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,840
Hey

110
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,000
Hey Weiwei

111
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,440
What are you doing

112
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,640
Go shopping

113
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,760
slight

114
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,440
slight

115
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,030
slight

116
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,080
You were silent on the phone for three minutes

117
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,400
Tang Weiwei

118
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,590
What are you doing

119
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,880
Crocodile law says

120
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,880
If a crocodile bites your foot

121
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,080
You try to break free of your feet with your hands

122
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,640
Then it will bite your feet and hands at the same time

123
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,150
The more you struggle

124
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,320
The more it bites

125
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,000
So in case a crocodile bites your foot

126
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,640
Your only solution

127
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,670
Just sacrifice that foot

128
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,200
What crocodile

129
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,030
Think about

130
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,150
Should I close the dessert shop?

131
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,640
It's like that crocodile

132
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,320
The more I struggle

133
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,520
It hurts me more

134
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,150
slight

135
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,280
Did you encounter something

136
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,030
Since I decided to open a dessert shop

137
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,840
My life is full of twists and turns

138
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,670
No one supports

139
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,470
Finally opened

140
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,520
Poor performance

141
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,030
Pitiful passenger flow

142
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,910
Jin Zichuan also told me to stop the loss in time

143
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,470
slight

144
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,550
I remember your psychology

145
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,200
There are a few words like this

146
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,280
When you are about something

147
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,280
When I believe 10,000%

148
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,590
Will come true

149
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,840
When you are pregnant with something

150
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,670
When there is a very strong expectation

151
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,520
What you expect will appear

152
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,760
Do you say i am right

153
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,590
Believe in the law and the law of expectation

154
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,760
right

155
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,520
If the world

156
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,550
The only one who won't betray you

157
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,520
Only you

158
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,320
So why don't you try it yourself

159
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,400
Believe in yourself

160
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,110
good

161
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,200
I understand

162
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,030
thank you

163
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,910
What are you telling me thank you

164
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,440
Isn't it beating?

165
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,910
Good

166
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,840

Mr. Jin

168
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,670
The AR project we followed up before

169
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,110
It's basically finalized for the time being

170
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,670
Your colleagues in the public relations department

171
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,230
Call me over

172
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:08,910
I'm in a hurry

173
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,150
good

174
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,110
Mr. Jin

175
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:16,910

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,790
Mr. Jin

178
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,080
Mr. Jin

179
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,030
Copywriting

180
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,350
Go

181
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,080
Xu Jian

182
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,080
Drag this side too

183
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,350
good

184
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,200
Wait a minute

185
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,030
You can open the door directly for business

186
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,880
Never let my sister get tired

187
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,200
dad

188
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,230
slight

189
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,640
Wei Wei

190
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,080
I didn't let you rest at home for a while

191
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,400
Why are you here so early

192
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Have I eaten the meal?

193
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,280
slight

194
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,710
You ran here thirsty at noon, right

195
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,110
Brother pour you a glass of milk

196
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,440
Is it because of Lin Ran?

197
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,230
Brother said you and Lin Ran are not the same

198
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,080
Inappropriate

199
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,590
Sooner or later, I have to go through this

200
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,590
fine

201
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,080
Who was young

202
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,080
Haven't had any emotional experience yet, right?

203
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,550
You'll be at ease

204
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,880
Eat and sleep

205
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,080
Body first

206
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,350
The sky is falling and there is your brother

207
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,710
And dad

208
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,110
Father as a mountain

209
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,880
I am your backing

210
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,470
Ok ok let's not talk about this

211
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,910
What do you want to eat at night

212
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,790
Dad go home and make it for you

213
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,280
right

214
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,470
I want to eat

215
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,150
Sweet and sour pork ribs

216
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,590
Candied Taro

217
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,840
No problem, this dad is the best

218
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,110
Promise you go home

219
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,800
You can eat warm meals

220
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,430
Xu Jian hurry home and go

221
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,069
go

222
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,040
What's wrong

223
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,710
Go

224
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,920
We are here

225
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,829
She can't vent

226
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,190
Walk around

227
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Everyone says we two don't match well

228
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,680
I work hard to withstand these pressures

229
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,560
I try to make myself better

230
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,950
So good that everyone can forget

231
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,950
The age gap between the two of us

232
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
I miss my boyfriend

233
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,880
Not a child living in an ivory tower

234
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,400
I don't want to be forever

235
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,680
All in the fairy tales you weave

236
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,560
Both parties agree to break up

237
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,430
Unilateral agreement

238
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,400
Unless widowed

239
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,230
separate

240
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,190
Tang Weiwei

241
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,280
Don't you think about it

242
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,280
slight

243
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,760
Did Li want to come to you lately?

244
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,560
Just by phone

245
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,230
What's wrong

246
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,520
Is she in a bad mood

247
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,470
No

248
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,470
She deleted my WeChat

249
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,400
Never answer the phone

250
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,880
Did the two of you quarrel?

251
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,710
still is

252
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,880
What did you say wrong

253
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,950
slight

254
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,310
Can you help me tell her

255
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,190
There is really nothing between the two of us

256
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,680
what

257
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,830
She has always cared about the man who is the so-called best friend

258
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,590
So I think

259
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,470
The biggest problem and obstacle between the two of us

260
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,350
May be you

261
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,430
Barriers between you

262
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,230
I

263
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,560
As an expert in psychology

264
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,110
I like Li Xiang

265
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,950
You don't know

266
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,880
Then I'll go first

267
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,430
thanks

268
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,230
Good you go slowly

269
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,400
You said

270
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,430
What did I do wrong, she wants to break up with me

271
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,520
Why

272
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,350
Am i treating her badly

273
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,400
So good

274
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,310
Then why can't she see

275
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,230
Lin Ran, don't be like this

276
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,520
She must see it

277
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,680
And she's so cruel

278
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,350
Left me behind

279
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,880
brother

280
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,070
But I still like her so much

281
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,350
Listen to my advice

282
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,350
Brothers like brothers

283
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,470
This woman

284
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,310
Just like clothes

285
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:35,470
you

286
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,230
Throw it if you should

287
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,230
On the matter

288
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,230
Throw it

289
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,040
Throw right

290
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,350
Come and let me throw it for you

291
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,110
You are the clothes

292
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,160
Your whole family is clothes

293
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,710
that is

294
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,190
What's so fierce

295
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,430
I'm not doing this for you

296
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,190
Turn your face when you say turn your face

297
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,350
Really

298
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,280
Go away

299
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,640
Tang Weiwei

300
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,070
Why are you breaking up with me

301
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,590
I worked hard for so long

302
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,520
Just let you agree to be with me

303
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,520
Now here you are

304
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,190
Becomes unilateral

305
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,760
Am i doing something wrong

306
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,710
You tell me

307
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:23,760
I change

308
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,520
What's your drink

309
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,470
Look at this

310
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,430
They told me to throw away

311
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
But i'm not willing

312
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,680
Because you gave it

313
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,040
sister

314
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,350
Why grew up

315
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,350
Every time i do something wrong

316
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,710
You will forgive me

317
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,800
But why not this time

318
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,590
Even if you don't treat me like a boyfriend

319
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,950
Treat me like a brother

320
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
I don't want you to leave me

321
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,430
How much did you drink

322
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,880
Drink like this

323
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,560
Come and drink some water

324
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,070
It's syrup

325
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,350
Lin Ran

326
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,230
Are you OK

327
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,430
Lin Ran

328
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,110
Lin Ran

329
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,470
Lin Ran

330
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,280
Are you OK

331
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Hurry, hurry, be careful

332
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,000
Weiwei don't worry

333
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,520
Lin Ran, he's okay

334
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,800
do not worry

335
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,000
Out

336
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,520
Lin Ran

337
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,950
How is the doctor

338
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,920
Now the patient's blood pressure is restored

339
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,070
Heart rate also stabilized

340
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,590
Allergic signs have been sent for inspection

341
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,430
Now basically out of danger

342
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,800
Observe in the intensive care unit tonight

343
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,190
Depends on the situation tomorrow

344
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,680
If everything is ok

345
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,400
Can be transferred to the general ward

346
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,310
Thank you doctor

347
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,040
Thank you doctor

348
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,350
Lin Ran

349
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,400
rest assured

350
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,350
He's okay

351
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,590
I'll pay the fee

352
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,640
Have something to eat

353
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,640
give

354
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,400
I'm not eating

355
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,160
You go busy with your business

356
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,590
I want to be alone

357
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,280
good

358
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,880
I put it here

359
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,760
Wei Weijie

00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,950
Lin Ran

361
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,950
Is he okay

362
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,680
Don't be too tired

363
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,640
Pay attention to rest

364
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,710
My brother asked me to sign a contract

365
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,680
I have to go first

366
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,350
good

367
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,430
Lin Ran's parents called me today

368
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,760
them

369
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,160
I want Lin Ran to go abroad for treatment

370
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,310
The hospital has been booked

371
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,400
Will pass soon
