00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,840
Isn't that weird?

178
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,600
The draft of the thesis.

179
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,880
I don't think anyone would handwrite one.

180
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,840
I think Wei Wei saved it on her computer.

181
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,080
Online theft?

182
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't really understand this,

183
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
but I have the contacts of
a few computer science graduates.

184
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,080
I'll look them up.

185
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,280
Got it.

186
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
I'll send it to you.

187
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,000
Done.

188
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,760
Why does the account look familiar?

189
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,160
Online account tracing and investigation.

190
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,000
Isn't this Gu Zhen?

191
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,040
Does the fool know how to do this?

192
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,520
Do you know him?

193
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,080
Who's that?

194
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,040
How dare you come here!

195
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,160
Why are you here?

196
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,080
You're a jinx.

197
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,760
There's a dog behind you.

198
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,440
Where is it?

199
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,400
What are you doing?

200
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,520
Why are you going in?

201
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,560
Are you trespassing on my property?

202
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,760
I'll call the cops.

203
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,320
Where are you going? What are you doing?

204
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,280
I'll call the cops, okay?

205
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:02,880
Go away!

206
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,120
What are you doing?

207
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,640
Why do you treat me as an outsider?

208
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,280
Sit here.

209
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,920
I'll talk to you nicely.

210
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,720
What do you want?

211
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,400
Go on.

212
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,440
I heard you're capable.

213
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,680
You're a hacker, right?

214
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,240
So

215
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,800
are you interested in a deal?

216
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,160
Are you

217
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,240
turning to me

218
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,280
to copy a thesis?

219
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,760
I didn't know

220
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,480
you're rather smart.

221
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,360
You're rather intelligent.

222
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,240
You're a genius.

223
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,200
However,

224
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,160
I don't need you to copy a thesis.

225
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,600
I need you to identify
someone who copied a thesis.

226
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,880
How does that sound?

227
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,600
When you hear this,

228
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,200
do you

229
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,520
have a sense of righteousness?

230
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,680
So, you need me to do you a favour.

231
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,880
Yes.

232
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,200
I can't

233
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,160
help you for nothing.

234
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,880
Tell me.

235
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,800
What do you want in return?

236
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,600
Just nice.

237
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,240
My cousin

238
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,520
wants me to pick a few projects.

239
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,360
I don't understand them.

240
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,360
Take a look

241
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,480
and pick one.

242
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,640
Then,

243
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,280
work for me. What do you think?

244
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,920
I didn't know

245
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,880
you're rich.

246
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,040
You're working on
online income generation.

247
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
You're busy with this.

248
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,120
Of course.

249
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,200
Do you know my dream?

250
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,400
My dream

251
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,520
is to become 007 of China's online world.

252
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,360
Fine.

253
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,280
You'll be nicknamed 250 (a fool).

254
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,240
Just do this, an art exhibition.

255
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,320
I can help you.

256
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,680
You?

257
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,920
Are you sure?

258
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,840
Take a look here.

259
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,720
The address

260
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,600
is our school.

261
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,200
Let me see.

262
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,840
Is it?

263
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,160
Not bad.

264
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,320
Come here.

265
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:57,920
Come on.

266
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,560
What are you doing?

267
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,720
Aren't we working on it?

268
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,440
We are,

269
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,600
but not this.

270
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,120
Aren't we having an art exhibition?

271
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,120
Where are you going?

272
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:58,880
Done.

273
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,040
Take a look.

274
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,320
The e-mail that provided the tip-off

275
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,480
is indeed Dong Zhe's.

276
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,800
I copied the two documents
he complained about.

277
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,040
One is titled Tang Wei Wei's Thesis.

278
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,080
I transcoded the original e-mail.

279
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,320
Counter-path-tracing is done,

280
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,040
but this can only prove that

281
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,120
Dong Zhe hacked Tang Wei Wei's e-mail.

282
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,880
For the rest,

283
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,360
you're on your own.

284
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,880
So, it's Dong Zhe.

285
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,760
Da Fei, look.

286
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,320
I want to find out
whether there's plagiarism

287
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,360
in two theses.

288
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,400
You're well-connected.

289
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,480
Do you have a way?

290
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,920
It'll be best

291
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
if he's a thesis plagiarism checker

292
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,840
or I'll be at my wits' end.

293
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,800
There's one.

294
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,880
He's known as a human
CNKI in another faculty.

295
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,680
A human CNKI?

296
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,280
Come on, I'll explain to you.

297
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,760
Let's go.

298
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,560
This guy

299
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,760
is famous in the circle
of assignment helpers.

300
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,080
His strengths are

301
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,480
speed and quality.

302
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,880
Your fees of checking for
plagiarism won't go to waste.

303
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,520
However, he's rushing for work these days.

304
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,640
The demand far exceeds the supply.

305
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,200
It's hard to trace him

306
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
these days.

307
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,720
All right.

308
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,240
How about this?

309
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
Let's act separately.

310
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:07,920
Okay.

311
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,400
Hi.

312
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,600
Have you seen this guy before?

313
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,960
No.

314
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,240
Okay, thank you.

315
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,680
It's fine.

316
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,960
Hi, has he been attending classes lately?

317
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,760
No.

318
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,480
Thank you.

319
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,080
Hello.

320
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,720
Have you seen him?

321
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,640
No.

322
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,160
Thank you.

323
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:33,800
Hi.

324
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,360
Has he been attending classes lately?

325
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,160
Hi, do you know him?

326
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,280
No.

327
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,200
Thank you.

328
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,080
Excuse me.

329
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,600
No.

330
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,040
Thank you.

331
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,520
Brother Ran, how is it?

332
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,480
I asked all of his classmates.

333
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,040
They said

334
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,840
he spent more time part-timing.

335
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,880
Therefore, you and I

336
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,000
should

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,040
release the news now.

338
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,480
[Handsome reward to
meet a crazy deadline.]

339
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,280
Are we going to just wait?

340
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,599
Why are you so stupid?

341
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,400
We're fishing, you know?

342
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,440
As long as you cast the net

343
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,599
and use a generous amount of bait,

344
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,920
next,

345
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,760
the fish will take the bait.

346
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,160
Give me an address.

347
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,480
It's rather complicated here.

348
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,080
We'll talk face to face.

349
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,400
Coke.

350
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,080
You can go.

351
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,680
I got the evidence. Let's go.

352
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,920
I'll go now, bye.

353
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,480
Keep in touch on the phone!

354
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,640
He's rather reliable.

355
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,200
I found these two original drafts.

356
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,080
The times of publication are different.

357
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,800
Here's all the evidence
of the thesis plagiarism.

358
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,040
President

359
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,720
and professors,

360
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,040
these are sufficient to prove

361
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,360
I didn't commit academic fraud.

362
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Nor did I pretend

363
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,360
to be this junior.

364
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,040
Do you want to take a look?

365
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,720
[It's suspected to have plagiarised
points of view and text expression.]

366
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,320
I knew it.

367
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,440
[It's suspected to be
overall plagiarism.]

368
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,040
My student wouldn't commit plagiarism.

369
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,400
There's concrete evidence.

370
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,280
Can the school restore

371
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,320
Tang Wei Wei's qualification to
sit for a postgraduate exam?

372
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:35,920
Don't worry.

373
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,920
The school will punish

374
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,200
the culprit.

375
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,880
Senior.

376
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,200
Are you driving me into a corner?

377
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,720
I didn't mean to frame you.

378
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,080
Someone incited me to do so.

379
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,200
Someone framed me.

380
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,720
You...

381
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,480
If you don't believe me,

382
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,440
I'll jump off a building.

383
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,520
Wow.

384
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,480
You're even here.

385
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,080
I want to make another complaint

386
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,680
about the student at your school

387
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,640
for colluding with a gangster

388
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,240
to monitor me illegally.

389
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,520
Is this a top scholar

390
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,720
of your school?

391
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,200
No.

392
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,720
I didn't spy on him.

393
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,480
You didn't?

394
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,000
Whenever I go to work

395
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,960
or do anything, you follow me.

396
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,040
I'm protecting you.

397
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,320
Do I need that?

398
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,400
You're protecting me?

399
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,880
You blocked my food deliveries

400
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,560
and ate all the meat.

401
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,400
Being a vegetarian is
good for your health.

402
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,440
Fine.

403
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,240
Why did you follow me to the toilet?

404
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,160
Why didn't you mention the fact

405
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,920
that you asked me to
pass the paper to you?

406
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,200
Anyway,

407
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,360
you must punish the culprit.

408
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,680
You'd better

409
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,760
summon their parents.

410
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,080
I need an explanation today.

411
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,240
Mr. Dong.

412
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,920
We're aware of this now.

413
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,400
Look,

414
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,400
we'll inform Lin Ran's parents,

415
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,560
but it's a separate matter.

416
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,040
According to the investigation.

417
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,160
Ms. Tang Wei Wei is innocent.

418
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,760
The school will restore her
qualification for postgraduate exam.

419
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,200
and punish

420
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,360
your cousin severely.

421
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Ms. Wang.

422
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,760
Call Lin Ran's parents.

423
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,240
Okay.

424
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,880
Hello.

425
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,720
Are you Mr. Tang Jian Guo?

426
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,600
Can you come to the school
in the afternoon?

427
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,480
Boss.

428
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,160
I think we...

429
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,480
What's wrong with your eyes?

430
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,840
Boss!

431
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,200
Boss!

432
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,080
Go away! What are you doing here?

433
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,560
Bye, uncle.

434
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,320
Get lost.

435
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,280
Uncle Tang.

436
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,600
I know I was wrong.

437
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,280
If they didn't threaten Wei Wei,

438
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,680
I wouldn't have troubled you to come.

439
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
Look.

440
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,480
In school,

441
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,800
I tend to be obedient

442
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,160
and get off from school on time.

443
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,160
I even play games with you at night.

444
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,160
Look at yourself.

445
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,600
You're a university student,

446
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,000
yet I was summoned.

447
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,600
It's embarrassing.

448
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,480
You even made me a lot of promises.

449
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,120
You never

450
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,680
do anything right.

451
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,000
Uncle Tang.

452
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,400
I know I was wrong.

453
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,640
It won't happen again.

454
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,160
Again?

455
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,720
Lin Ran.

456
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,560
Be smart.

457
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,640
I'll kill whoever

458
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
that harms my daughter.

459
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:00,840
Great.

460
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,960
However, at the key moment,

461
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
you're useful.

462
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,040
I didn't dote on you for nothing.

463
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,720
It's my duty.

[Dean's Office]

467

is partially responsible for this.

consideration.

All right.

Okay, Miss.

You have a fresh perspective.

482
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,920
However,

483
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,160
you're too focused.

484

It's as if you're studying
just for the sake of studies.

for you to pause,

487
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,480
think about it

488
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,280
and find out more,

489
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,520
it's a blessing in disguise.

490

You're still young.

491
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,280
You need a goal in life.

Then you'll have limitless possibilities.
