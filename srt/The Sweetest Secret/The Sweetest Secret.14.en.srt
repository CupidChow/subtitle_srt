Shut up!

Wei Wei, I don't understand.

177
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,150
Why would you fall in love with this punk?

178
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,520
He's not a responsible man.

179
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,590
How can he protect his family?

180
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,840
Stop it.

181
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,880
I'm your uncle.

182
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm doing this for Wei Wei's sake.

183

184
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,550
Enough.

185

So, let's catch up with each other.

191
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,320
I don't want to talk about
something else. Now, let's eat.

192

I need to go to the washroom.

193

Everything is fine.

Don't be nervous.

203

It's just a chit-chat.

Boss.

205
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,760
I admit

206
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,590
I misbehaved,

207
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,280
but it didn't affect my work.

208
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,350
I'll be careful.

209

212

Our company's financing

213
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
has been stalled.

214
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,880
So, I'm thinking to let you handle this.

215
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,280
You're part of this company.

216
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,080
You should contribute something.

217

Don't reject this order.

219

Mr. Jin and I don't know each other well.

220
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,640
We just meet by chance.

221
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,320
Mr. Jin told me that

222
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,280

[And that we are friends.]

230

[Don't tell me]

[she wants us to be more than friends?]

234
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,550
[As expected from her.]

[Since we are friends,]

thank you with a meal.]

[Don't you have something else to do?]

245

[Then what should we do?]

[This lady]

[I should deduct her points.]

[Well, that's not necessary.]

This is Lin Ran's fault.

You shouldn't target on Wei Wei.

We'll think about this together, okay?

I asked you to come back
to solve this problem.

00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,470
since the first day I like you.

345
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,430
Is that so?

346
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,520
This is called mere-exposure effect.

347
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,710
Research shows that

348
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,400
people tend to

349
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,830
develop a preference for things

350
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,640
when they are familiar with them.

351
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,070
We are at a public place.

352
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,040
Tang Wei Wei.

353
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,190
Uncle, what are you doing here?

354
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,160
You brat.

355
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,000
You know Wei Wei is pregnant.

356
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,230
Are you out of your mind?

357
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,310
I can't believe you try to separate them.

358
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,880
Do you want to see her child

359
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,350
to be born without a father?

360
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,710
That's not it, uncle.

361
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
I didn't think it through.

362
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,040
I just wanted to find
someone to distract her.

363
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,830
You call this a distraction?

364
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,040
I'll beat you to death today!

365
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,590
Uncle.

366
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:02,950
Stop right there!

367
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,190
I'm sorry, uncle.

Stop.

I'm really sorry.

I'm really sorry, uncle.

375
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,590
I won't do that again.

376
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,680
You never listen to me.

I'm still in the game.

00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,710
No. Look at this.

389
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,470
Look at their couple nickname.

390
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:18,880
You see, Wei Wei

391
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,430
never changed her name once in 18 years.

392
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,800
This is Lin Ran's fault.

393
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,110
He's a bad influence on Wei Wei.

394
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,830
Exactly. He is a bad influence.

395
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,000
I wanted to separate them,

396
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,950
but you stopped me.

397
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,680
Uncle, do something.

398
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,830
At this rate,

399
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,310
Wei Wei will be on the moon.

400
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,950
Lin Ran even induced her

401
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,920
to open a store.

402
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,520
Once she pays for the store,
you can't take the money back.

403
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,830
That won't happen.

404
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,280
I already terminated her card.

405
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,950
Goodness, uncle.

406
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,430

518
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,950
that suits your preference.

519
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,160
I am sure you are

520
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,920
a reasonable person.

521
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,070
How about this?

522
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,280
I have a place,

523
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,400
but it has

524
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,640
already booked by another client.

525
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,310
Also, it can be

526
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,640
a little complicated.

527
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,350
Are you interested?

528
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,680
Don't worry.

529
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,520
If it's the perfect place for me,

530
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,710
money is not a problem.

531
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,190
All right then.

532
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,950
Let's go.

533
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,350
Okay.

534
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,560
Let's take a look at the place first.

535
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,800
[Ran.]

536
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,280
[Help me.]

537
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,310
[Your teacher is killing me.]

538
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,640
[What kind of paintings
should we exhibit?]

539
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,710
[What kind of technique?]

540
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,830
[And how many should we prepare?]

541
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,880
[I already amended]

542
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,000
[the last proposal.]

543
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,310
[You can have a look.]

544
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,830
[I still don't get it.]

545
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,710
[What are they for?]

546
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,880
[What is the drawing technique?]

547
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,590
[What does the colour mean?]

548
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,000
[The portraits are ugly.]

549
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,470
[I don't want to pick!]

550
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,160
[I'm busy now. We'll talk next time.]

551
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,950
What do you think?

552
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,470
I will take this one.

553
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,950
Like I said before,

554
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,880
someone else booked this place.

555
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,710
If you really want it,

556
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,310
the price...

557
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,230
Give me your price.

558
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,640
It could be a little
more expensive than before.

559
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,230
Are you okay with that?

560
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,590
The balance is insufficient.

561
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Why don't you use another card?

562
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,310
Why don't you try it again?

563
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,310
Okay.

564
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,710
It's still the same.

565
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,190
Do you have another card?

566
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:31,640
Good morning.

567
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,680
Xiang.

568
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,710
Xiang.

569
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,800
Don't you think

570
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,920
this is a stroke of luck?

571
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,680
Nonsense.

572
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,040
I'm really allergic to it.

573
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,310
I can't stand the smell.

574
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,040
Xiang.

575
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,560
This just arrived.

576
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,430
Just put it down.

577
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,400
Why are you standing here?

578
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,430
Get back to work.

579
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,950
Hello.

580
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,950
Jin Zi Chuan.

581
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,280
Are you messing with me?

582
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,110
What's wrong?

583
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,230
You give me lilies every day.

584
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,310
Are you crazy?

585
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,190
Don't you like it?

586
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,680
You can throw it away then.

587
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,310
Are you kidding me?

588
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,680
You send me flowers every day.

589
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,310
My boss needs to pass them
to me personally every day.

590
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,160
How can I throw the flowers?

591
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,560
I...

592
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,430
You are playing hard to get.

593
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,000
Why don't you just say I'm a sly woman

594
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,920
who takes advantage of you?

595
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,760
You psychopath!

596
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,000
Who was she talking to?

597
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,190
What's going on?

598
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:07,950
Gu Zhen.

599
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,280
Don't mind about me.

600
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,230
You can continue.

601
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,800
Lin Ran is...

602
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,190
What's wrong with him?

603
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,230
Is he pulling a prank on me?

604
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,560
He's really smart.

605
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,950
He knows that marketing is
important in today's society.

606
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,710
He knows
the indispensable part of paintings.

607
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,110
Look.

608
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,350
He has done
a great job at this exhibition.

609
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,230
What do you mean?

610
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,640
Look at this.

611
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,590
Here.

612
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,920
Look at these.

613
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,430
Between Kandinsky's

614
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,160
and Malevich's art,

615
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,920
he put in some other
paintings as a transition.

616
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,280
That's really a good idea.

617
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,280
Let me see.

618
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,880
I'll go first.

619
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,880
Uncle Tang.

620
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,470
The pregnancy is fake,

621
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,110
but my feelings for her are real.

622
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,680
I have liked Tang Wei Wei for a long time.

623
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,950
I really want to be her boyfriend.

624
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,760
I want to

625
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,110
I want to be with you openly.

626
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,800
Someone said

627
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,920
if you could fake it
for the rest of your life,

628
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,950
maybe someday it would come true.
