1
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Why are you here

2
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,440
how

3
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,039
You're still mad at me

4
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:46,910
Tang Weiwei

5
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,190
Lin Ran

6
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,550
grow old together

7
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,550
Weiwei, you are looking for me

8
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,360
What are you doing

9
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,550
eat cake

10
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,400
Wei Wei

11
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,830
You are a married woman

12
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,030
You have to pay attention to the impact

13
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,190
What effect

14
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,630
You control your girlfriend

15
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,270
A married woman is also my husband

16
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,079
do you know

17
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,550
Lin Ran

18
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,360
Wei Weijie

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,000
I think the Michelin ones are not tasty

20
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,670
Birthday

21
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,880
You have to skewer

22
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,630
I don't know what everyone likes to eat

23
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,880
Bought some casually

24
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,360
Don't bother you

25
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,390
It's just one birthday

26
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,829
I spend with Weiwei every year

27
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,360
I'm not a kid

28
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,720
I don't care about this thing either

29
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,960
Yes, you don't have to make up your birthday

30
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,670
Let it go

31
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,360
Let's all go

32
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,079
Let's go let's go

33
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,470
No one is going

34
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,720
You do not care

35
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,750
I care

36
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,960
I have baked desserts in it

37
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,190
Go get it quickly

38
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,670
hurry up

39
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,800
Ok i go

40
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,720
Happy birthday to you

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,550
Happy birthday to you

42
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,000
happy Birthday

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,670
Blow the candle

44
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,630
Yesterday something happened suddenly

45
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,320
Keep everyone waiting

46
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,960
Really embarrassed

47
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,520
All my own

48
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,600
Why are you talking about this?

49
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,160
that is

50
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,600
Wait for me to finish

51
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,880
What about today

52
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,000
the most important is

53
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,520
I want to formally be in front of everyone

54
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,030
Apologize to Lin Ran

55
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,550
You never need to apologize to me

56
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,110
You never need to apologize to me

57
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,960
alright, alright

58
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,720
do not talk

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,079
Our first cup

60
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,880
Happy birthday Jing Linran

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,550
Happy birthday

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,790
Lock the door

63
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,070
No key

64
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,920
The two of us are locked

65
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,880
You know what i am so happy today

66
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,350
Are you satisfied?

67
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,830
I think the air is sweet now

68
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,040
Let's go

69
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,670
Lock the door and go home

70
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,720
You say we

71
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,110
It's been a long time since I was so leisurely

72
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,320
Came out for a walk

73
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,040
Li Xiang

74
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,830
Your lips are so soft

75
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,790
Much softer than my ex boyfriend

76
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,230
How soft is it

77
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,720
or

78
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,600
Arrange for you both to try

79
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,270
Let's get married

80
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,200
What did you say

81
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,920
Our relationship has made such a big progress

82
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,110
So must

83
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,070
What happened to the relationship

84
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,880
Isn't it normal for men to love women?

85
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,350
you

86
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,510
Lin Ran

87
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,600
Leave them alone

88
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,760
go

89
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,640
Let's go

90
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,640
go

91
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,600
Inside please

92
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,390
Hello come in

93
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,070
I'll go to the back kitchen first

94
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,040
Please come in

95
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,440
good

96
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,600
Hello inside

97
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,000
roll

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,600
I went in first

99
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,070
go in

100
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,510
Ok

101
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,040
Time to go in

102
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,670
I laughed stiffly this morning

103
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,600
Excellent students are really not good

104
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,830
Let you bring tea and hand water

105
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,510
Then do you go

106
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,760
Then I'll go to welcome the guests

107
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,920
Ji Han

108
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,830
You are leaving now

109
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,440
There will be Wei Weijie's dessert feast in a while

110
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,040
I'm afraid I won't be able to catch up with the ten o'clock plane

111
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,670
Let's talk to everyone individually

112
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,400
Row

113
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,760
Then after you go out

114
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,880
take care of yourself

115
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,000
be careful

116
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,470
gone

117
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,200
goodbye

118
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,760
Safe journey

119
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,640
Where's Ji Han

120
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,000
I just received a message

121
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,000
Not long after leaving

122
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,110
Maybe the school gate hasn't arrived yet

123
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,080
gone

124
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,840
It smells like we go to school

125
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,880
It smells like that

126
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,670
correct

127
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,110
I heard Lin Ran say before

128
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,840
You have to go back to school to prepare for graduate school

129
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,030
I'm also worried about adult banquets

130
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,550
I can't do it alone

131
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,470
Yes

132
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,910
I know you must be busy today

133
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,470
So I want to help

134
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,710
Thank you

135
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,710
Waiting for you to pass

136
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,320
Lin Ran and I treat you to a big meal

137
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,880
Ji Han

138
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,440
Gu Zhen

139
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,080
Shouldn't you be at school

140
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,520
I have something to tell you

141
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,110
Say it

142
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,400
I

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,670
I

144
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,030
I

145
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,840
If you can't tell, I'll go

146
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Text me

147
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,790
I like you

148
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,910
I know

149
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,880
You may be going abroad soon

150
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,280
But if you don't want to be exotic

151
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,840
I can study TOEFL and U.S. Graduate Admission Test

152
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll find you when the time comes

153
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,640
you

154
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,440
Would you give me a chance

155
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,640
This confession

156
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,760
Lin Ran asked you to come

157
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,030
Lin Ran asked you to come

158
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,150
no no

159
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,320
Not this time

160
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,150
Actually many times before

161
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,910
All my own

162
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,640
Want to stay with you a little longer

163
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,520
but

164
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,280
I dare not say

165
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,400
Sorry

166
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,960
so

167
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,150
Do you want to be my girlfriend

168
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,880
I'm going to Cornell University in New York

169
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,520
Then do you promise me

170
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,960
I say

171
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm going to Cornell University in New York

172
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,590
I know you just said

173
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,230
Then do you promise me

174
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,910
Ji Han

175
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,400
Are you answering me or not?

176
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,790
Gu Zhen

177
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,230
you are stupid

178
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,790
Safe journey and wait for me to pass

179
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,320
Hello

180
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,880
Can i add you to wechat

181
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,350
I am her husband

182
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,470
What's the matter

183
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,440
Can tell me

184
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,280
Excuse me

185
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,080
go

186
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,550
You get Hou Fei

187
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,000
good

188
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,110
how

189
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,670
Really angry

190
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,550
What do you think

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,960
How can you be so jealous?

192
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,550
You are the reincarnation of vinegar

193
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,670
That person just asked you for WeChat

194
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,030
Why do you give

195
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,000
Didn't you give him your WeChat?

196
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,320
I can't give it

197
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,670
I make sugar-free cake

198
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,790
To compensate you

199
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,710
Head off

200
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,000
I will wait if I don't come

201
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,440
Are you going to give him WeChat

202
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,550
Stop messing around

203
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,030
I didn't bother

204
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,550
Looks like you have to leave a mark

205
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,400
Let others know that you are married

206
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,670
Why isn't Weiwei coming yet?

207
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,880
Where's Lin Ran

208
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,280
They should be almost there

209
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,000
Wait a moment

210
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,710
Do not worry

211
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,960
Dear leaders

212
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,790
Alumni

213
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,350
The luncheon is about to begin

214
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,110
under

215
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,350
First represented by our school board

216
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,640
President of Huanuo Group

217
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,550
Mr. Jin Zichuan gave a speech on stage

218
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,110
Why are you coming in

219
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,840
Kisaragi

220
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,440
The cake I told you to bake just now

221
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,280
Is it roasted?

222
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,110
You help me take it out

223
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,200
good

224
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,150
What cake

225
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,150
Vinegar cake

226
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,790
Who uses vinegar to make cakes?

227
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,110
You fooled me

228
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,150
Of course the vinegar is used for the little vinegar.

229
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,520
Wei Weijie

230
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,230
The cake is ready

231
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,440
So fragrant

232
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,550
Seems quite successful

233
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,470
Quickly try your vinegar cake

234
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,000
feed me

235
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,670
How about it

236
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,400
Small vinegar

237
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,230
Is it delicious

238
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,200
Is sweet

239
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,440
Sweet

240
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,590
Kisaragi

241
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,200
What's going on

242
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,880
Let me see

243
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:28,790
I

244
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,760
I take you to the hospital

245
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,000
No

246
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,000
You stay here to make the cake

247
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,880
I let Hou Fei go with me

248
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,030
Ruyue, take Lin Ran to the hospital

249
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,200
Hou Fei is a man after all

250
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Not careful enough

251
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,230
Hurry you guys go

252
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,910
Hurry up

253
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,280
Okay okay okay

254
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,670
You make the cake well

255
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,080
Where are you going, Brother Ran?

256
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,880
Looking for you

257
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,670
You hurry up and take him to the hospital

258
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,840
You go to the hospital first

259
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
I'll go back and have a look

260
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,710
The kitchen is on fire

261
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,590
slight

262
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,840
Hurry up with me

263
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,320
go

264
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,320
Run fast

265
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,000
Go fast

266
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,880
Hurry up

267
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,640
What's the situation

268
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,110
Weiwei is still in the kitchen

269
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,470
Let's go see

270
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,520
Here

271
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,880
slight

272
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,440
slight

273
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,550
All right

274
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,310
slight

275
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,880
Do you feel uncomfortable

276
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,230
Until now my heart is still pounding

277
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,000
You will die if your heart doesn't beat

278
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,110
The heart is made of myocardium

279
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,710
Myocardium is excitable

280
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,830
Conductivity

281
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,230
Automatic rhythm

282
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,350
Don't talk about it

283
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,430
Give me a cell phone

284
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,640
During the celebration party of a well-known university in this city

285
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,230
Fire broke out in the back kitchen

286
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,430
So far

287
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,040
Twenty-five people have been injured

288
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,430
The specific cause of the fire is still under investigation

289
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,190
Preliminary inference

290
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,110
Because of improper operation by the pastry chef

291
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,520
And cause a fire

292
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,110
What's the matter with this newspaper

293
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,000
Send it casually without verification

294
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,560
fine

295
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,430
The police found out

296
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,000
Will pay me innocence

297
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,070
okay

298
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,920
Don't think too much

299
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,950
rest well

300
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,000
Is Lin Ran's song good?

301
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,880
I learned this from Ji Han specially

302
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,110
You did it

303
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,710
I do not understand what you're saying

304
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,280
You did it

305
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,190
You called me out today

306
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,950
Just to tell me this

307
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,560
I asked if you did it

308
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,190
Lin Ran

309
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,560
Actually, I wanted to make this song a long time ago

310
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,640
I played it for you

311
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,280
It's called "Dance of Flowers"

312
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,160
Talking about

313
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,760
Everyone has a beating little flower in his heart

314
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,430
When you meet someone you like

315
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,350
It can't help but

316
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,070
Beating a beautiful melody

317
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,950
No flower in your heart

318
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,280
Only selfish

319
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,830
You still have the face to mention Ji Han

320
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,880
School celebration clothes

321
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,590
notebook

322
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,560
You did it all

323
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,830
Ji Han forgive you

324
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,680
I have nothing to say

325
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,070
But Tang Weiwei is my girlfriend

326
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,310
Why are you doing this

327
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,520
I do not have

328
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
I'm not doing all this for you

329
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,190
for me

330
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,920
Did I ask you to harm people?

331
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,880
I also like Ji Han

332
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,760
I also like Wei Wei

333
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,560
They are all good people

334
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,800
You think i don't know these are all wrong

335
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,830
But what can i do

336
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,470
I am also suffering

337
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,710
They obviously have so many

338
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,400
But I still want to occupy you

339
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,400
But I am different

340
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,680
I only have you

341
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,520
You admitted

342
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,070
There is no evidence

343
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,430
Why should i admit

344
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,350
Moreover

345
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,230
Do you think they are really good to you

346
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,400
Tang Weiwei

347
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,590
I'll give you cakes with sugar

348
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,950
Almost killed you

349
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,310
only me

350
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,040
I am the Lin Ran who loves you the most

351
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,280
Lin Ran

352
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,350
Do not touch me

353
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,680
Believe it or not, I'll call the police now

354
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,230
for you

355
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,430
I don't even want the bottom line and dignity

356
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,920
How can you bear to ruin my future

357
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Do you think you are like this

358
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,470
Is there a future?

359
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,560
Lin Ran

360
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,350
If you stay with me

361
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,160
I can listen to you everything

362
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,190
I am willing to dedicate everything I have

363
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:44,830
Finished

364
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,040
Lin Ran, don't go

365
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,000
Do not touch me

366
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,830
Survey results show

367
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,640
Circuit valves on the back kitchen site

368
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,040
Traces of man-made twists

369
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,470
Lead to a sharp increase in load

370
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,310
Eventually caused a fire

371
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,070
Please cooperate with the police investigation

372
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,880
How is Weiwei

373
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,230
almost done

374
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,520
You go entertain the guests first

375
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,280
Hard work

376
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,760
Then i'll pass

377
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,430
Let's go

378
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:16,560
correct

379
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,310
The sugar-free cake I prepared for Lin Ran

380
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,280
You help me do it

381
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,680
Wei Weijie

382
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,920
Lin Ran

383
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,400
In fact, I always like someone

384
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,880
I do it this way

385
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,280
Is it wrong

386
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,640
Let's go

387
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,280
Morning

388
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,950
Morning

389
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,000
look

390
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,190
Are you winning a prize?

391
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,430
Basic operation

392
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,880
I had expected it a long time ago

393
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,040
Pretty good

394
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,040
Is there a reward?

395
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,640
no

396
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,430
Go brush your teeth

397
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,920
Is there a reward for brushing your teeth?

398
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,760
Go brush your teeth

399
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,640
Hey

400
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,760
Is it a wedding company?

401
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,520
that

402
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,880
You help me prepare a few sets

403
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,800
Marriage plan

404
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,710
right

405
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,350
The more the better

406
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,590
Handsome uncle

407
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,350
Set off

408
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,070
I'm your uncle

409
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,230
Did you say the departure?

410
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,760
I said I just set off

411
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:41,880
Good good

412
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,310
Let's go

413
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,400
Walk around

414
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,560
So beautiful

415
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,000
I want this

416
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,590
good

417
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,000
satisfied

418
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,190
pretty good

419
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,040
Hey

420
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,830
Wei Weijie

421
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,230
Hurry up

422
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,110
I take you to a place

423
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:55,880
Hurry up

424
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,640
where to

425
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,710
Know when you go

426
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,160
Come

427
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,400
Slow down

428
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,000
Go fast

429
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,430
Where to go

430
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,190
Let me tell you

431
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,710
I'll know when I go

432
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,160
Come on

433
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,520
slight

434
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,520
dad

435
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:53,950
daughter

436
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:54,950
Dad just

437
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,350
Don't take care of you anymore

438
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,070
but

439
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,000
Dad found one

440
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,430
Take care of you for me

441
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,590
slight

442
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,950
You must be happy

443
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,400
slight

444
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,710
Go

445
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,520
Go

446
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,000
Wei Weijie Burning Brother

447
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:58,950
I wish you happiness

448
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
Twenty-eight years ago

449
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,470
You came into this world

450
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,470
Six years later

451
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,590
I follow you

452
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,400
Come together

453
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,590
We grew up together

454
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,000
Angry for the first time

455
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,160
Lin Ran, can you take it seriously

456
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,640
Will this word be written?

457
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,160
You see for yourself how you write

458
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,880
Rewrite

459
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,830
First heartbeat

460
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,680
stop

461
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,640
First kiss

462
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,950
what are you doing

463
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,230
There is a mosquito on your face

464
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,920
You are the mosquito

465
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,880
A lot, a lot of the first time

466
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,040
We did it together

467
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,590
You make me a better person

468
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,430
so I hope

469
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,350
All the strange things in the world from now on

470
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,920
Can learn with you

471
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,760
From life to life

472
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,190
All year round

473
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,070
Four seasons as before

474
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,520
Tang Weiwei

475
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,680
marry me

476
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,040
Marry him marry him marry him

477
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,000
Marry him marry him marry him

478
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,430
Marry him marry him marry him

479
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,520
Marry him

480
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,430
Get up first

481
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,950
Existential loneliness means

482
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,110
Self-individual

483
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,400
With other lives

484
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,710
The unbridgeable gap

485
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,400
slight

486
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,160
It's all time

487
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,280
Why are you still endorsing?

488
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,280
many people

489
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,560
Use to form an intimate relationship with the other party

490
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,110
To escape the inherent anxiety of loneliness

491
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,830
But if I am willing to promise you

492
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,350
Only one reason

493
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,160
that is

494
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,950
I love you

495
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,190
You dare to bring me here

496
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,190
When I was not happy when I was young

497
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,520
Will be here

498
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,080
And this parking lot

499
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,000
Now working with Huanuo

500
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I gotta

501
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,150
The hostess with it

502
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,280
Come and be alone with it

503
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:45,950
slight

504
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,670
do not be afraid

505
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,520
Everything started again

506
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:52,840
I am here

507
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,430
and

508
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,630
I have a family

509
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,360
What about this extreme sport

510
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,520
It won't suit me anymore

511
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,710
What about extreme sports in the future

512
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,630
Limited to

513
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:09,950
and you

514
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,000
By the way, I remember one thing

515
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,320
On your birthday

516
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,600
Didn't I say that I am in the library

517
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,470
actually

518
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,040
I am racing here

519
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Lin Ran

520
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,950
How many things are you hiding from me

521
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,630
Then need you

522
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,670
Spend the rest of your life

523
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,470
Learn by yourself
