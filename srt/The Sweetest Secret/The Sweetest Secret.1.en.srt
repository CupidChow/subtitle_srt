00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,600
who ruined my son's relationship?

520
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,320
How atrocious.

521
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,440
I knew you're distasteful
the moment I saw you.

522
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,840
Listen up.

523
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,080
Get lost.

524
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,080
Homewreckers

525
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
are immoral.
