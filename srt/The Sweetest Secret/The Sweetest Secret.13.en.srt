my Brother Ran, right?

178
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,920
Hold on.

179
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,360
Share with me your lousy ideas.

180
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,160
I'll take a bath.

181
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,960
Brat, you...

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,480
What's wrong?

183
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,400
The printing house recommended by you

184
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
increased the price.

185
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,120
I could only turn to you.

186
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,200
What's the problem, Ms. Li?

187
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,320
Mr. Jin, look.

188
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,560
We have so many orders now.

189
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,720
Our schedule is packed

190
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,040
and we're short-handed.

191
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,160
I seek your understanding.

192
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,560
It'll be great if you pay us more.

193
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,320
It's a huge field

194
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,600
with so many competitors.

195
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,280
Other than quality,

196
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,560
integrity matters, too.

197
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,800
Be it in life or in a business,

198
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,880
you should have integrity

199
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,760
in order to expand your business.

200
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,920
I don't want to hear
theories from rich people.

201
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,840
Anyway,

202
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,760
I won't agree to it

203
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,280
if you don't pay more.

204
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,120
Fine.

205
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,720
You don't have to complete the deal.

206
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,800
Return the deposit to her in full.

207
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,040
Otherwise, at the rate you're going,

208
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,800
I wonder how long
your printing house can last.

209
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,120
Let's go.

210
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,760
I'll find another printing house for you

211
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,960
and supervise it.

212
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,080
Mr. Jin, I should treat you to a meal

213
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,840
to express my gratitude then.

214
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,120
Sure,

215
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,840
but please get off me.

216
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,280
You're petty.

217
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,240
I, Lin Ran,

218
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,760
officially repent

219
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,440
to Ms. Tang Wei Wei now.

220
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,920
[Letter of Repentance]

221
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,520
Firstly,

222
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,480
I shouldn't keep anything
from my other-half,

223
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,040
insert a bracket here,

224
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,680
although there's a valid reason.

225
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,520
End of the bracket.

226
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,480
Secondly,

227
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,760
I shouldn't have done it as
I was aware that it's wrong.

228
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,120
Thirdly,

229
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,800
I shouldn't object to your point of view.

230
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,960
I feel really guilty

231
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,640
and regretful.

232
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,760
That's why I drafted this
letter of repentance

233
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,360
to apologise to you

234
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,640
and correct my incorrect attitude.

235
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,080
Due to my negligence...

236
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,600
[I was wrong. I'm sorry.]

237
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,880
[Blessing]

238
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,000
[I was wrong. I'm sorry.]

239
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,240
Wei Wei.

240
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,240
I was wrong.

241
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,600
No.

242
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,840
Listen to me.

243
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,120
Wei Wei!

244
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,000
Wei Wei!

245
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,080
May I know

246
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,800
whether you sent the wrong address

247
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,280
for a parcel collection?

248
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,680
Your little sweetheart is here.

249
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,720
Please collect it.

250
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,440
I was wrong.

251
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,560
Please forgive me.

252
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,600
I promise you

253
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,840
that

254
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,760
I won't do it anymore.

255
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,040
You said that.

256
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,720
I did.

257
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,200
Are you

258
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
still mad?

259
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,680
I was at fault, too.

260
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,960
I was possessive.

261
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,240
One's desire to control

262
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,040
is an expression of the inner fear

263
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,880
in a person with little sense of security.

264
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,760
He or she usually uses
high-pressure control

265
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,480
to prevent others from
defying his or her will.

266
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,040
It's easy to prevent it.

267
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,760
I mean

268
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,200
you don't have to force yourself.

269
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,600
We can live with the differences.

270
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,600
Come on.

271
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,680
I ordered a lot of dessert.

272
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,320
Why were you so sure

273
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,960
that I'd forgive you today?

274
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,040
Of course.

275
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,960
I'm your little sweetheart, okay?

276
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,160
Let's go.

277
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,160
Are you drunk?

278
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,760
I shouldn't have let you eat the liqueur.

279
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,520
What did you say?

280
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,400
I said you're awesome,

281
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,000
you could eat a lot

282
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,360
and you're not bad.

283
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,520
Lin Ran.

284
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,360
You'd better quit

285
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,320
motorcycle racing.

286
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,960
Who told me

287
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,240
about living with differences?

288
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,360
Fine,

289
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,720
I'll quit right away.

290
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,680
I'll quit tomorrow.

291
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,920
Ji Han.

292
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,920
The quota for exchange students

293
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,600
is precious.

294
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
Work hard.

295
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,760
I know, sir.

296
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,920
I won't let you down.

297
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,640
In the coming days,

298
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,680
you must make preparation.

299
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,320
Don't worry, sir.

300
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,600
Come on, everyone!

301
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,720
I'm treating you to milk tea today.

302
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,120
Thanks, Brother Ran.

303
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
There're all types of flavours

304
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,760
for your selection.

305
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,880
Why are you so happy today

306
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,079
that you're treating everyone to milk tea?

307
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,160
Well,

308
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,280
today,

309
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,440
a wonderful thing happened,

310
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,599
thanks to you.

311
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,640
Me?

312
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,760
The milk tea is nothing.

313
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,680
During weekend,

314
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,200
I'll treat you to a fine meal.

315
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,720
What a coincidence.

316
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,319
I have good news, too, today.

317
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,440
After you.

318
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,000
Forget it, I'll tell you first.

319
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,319
I'm

320
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,760
finally in a relationship, everyone.

321
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,640
It's real this time.

322
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,520
Congratulations, Brother Ran.

323
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,440
Congratulations, Brother Ran.

324
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,320
Congratulations, Brother Ran.

325
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,880
Therefore,

326
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,480
it's kind of awkward now.

327
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,480
Well,

328
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,160
we'd been helping each other
to block our admirers.

329
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,680
Maybe you should get
another person to do it.

330
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,080
After all, I'm

331
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,320
attached now.

332
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,600
It's inconvenient.

333
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,120
It's okay.

334
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,760
We are not really in
a relationship anyway.

335
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,800
If you have someone
you like, it's even better.

336
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,240
Who do you like?

337
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Tell me.

338
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,480
I'll get him for you.

339
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,440
What's the good news you
want to share with me?

340
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,760
Nothing.

341
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,360
Today,

342
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,080
the teacher praised me.

343
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,120
The teacher praised you?

344
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,920
That's great.

345
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,280
How about this?

346
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,720
I'll go out and figure out

347
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,960
how to sign a contract
with a European school.

348
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,760
By then, I'll have both love and career.

349
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,560

00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,800
Mr. Jin and Mrs. Jin, take care.

524
00:24:59,320 --> 00:24:59,960
You misunderstood.

525
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,880
I'm not.

526
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:03,880
Come on.

527
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,200
Mr. Jin!

528
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,880
What a coincidence.

529
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,240
Boss.

530
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,960
Mr. Jin.

531
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,920
Li Xiang?

532
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,280
Why are you here?

533
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,800
Of course, I'm here to
find a printing house.

534
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,920
Originally

535
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,360
Ms. Li was in charge of the printing.

536
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,560
Time is running out.

537
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,240
Why isn't there news from you?

538
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,520
I'm thinking that

539
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
it shouldn't affect the company's
second pre-sale.

540
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,480
Therefore,

541
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,520
I acted on my own

542
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,000
and contacted this printing house.

543
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,200
Li Xiang.

544
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,720
You're unbelievable.

545
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,040
If you couldn't handle it,

546
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,080
you should've told us.

547
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,000
Luckily I'd been paying attention.

548
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,640
Otherwise...

549
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,920
It's been hard on you, editor.

550
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,280
Not at all.

551
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,880
However,

552
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,040
you don't understand certain things.

553
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,880
For a printing house of this scale,

554
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,440
they have their list of orders.

555
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,160
You can't simply

556
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,400
get into the list.

557
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,560
Therefore,

558
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,600
I advise you

559
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,360
not to make futile effort.

560
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,680
I see.

561
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,040
I don't want the second
pre-sale to be affected.

562
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,720
So, I have to give it a try.

563
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,120
Luckily I'm here today.

564
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,880
By the way, boss,

565
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,800
I studied overseas

566
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,960
with the boss here.

567
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,240
More or less,

568
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,160
I have a say in this.

569
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,280
Editor, you're well-connected.

570
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,560
It's okay.

571
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,520
However,

572
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,440
you might

573
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,040
have come here for nothing.

574
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,760
Thanks, Li.

575
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,080
It's thanks to Mr. Jin.

576
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,600
Without him,

577
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,920
I wouldn't have been able to do this.

578
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,040
Am I right, editor?

579
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,720
You only rely on men.

580
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,920
It's because you are not
good enough for that.

581
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,600
Isn't the drama exciting?

582
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,680
Mr. Jin, have a safe trip.

583
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:25,920
Stop!

584
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,360
Why are you outside

585
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,000
a girl's window in midnight?

586
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,320
Wei Wei, I just don't get it.

587
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,880
Why are you into this useless guy?

588
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,640
There's insufficient credit.
