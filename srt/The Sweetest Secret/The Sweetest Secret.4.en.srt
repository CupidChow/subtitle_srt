I found another group of lads
in Blind Dates Corner.

Take a look at this.

This one is not bad.

Every time I see you going
to Blind Dates Corner,

22
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,360
I feel bad.

23
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,280
I don't want to hide it from you anymore.

24

Why are you bowing?

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,640
Sister Wei Wei actually has a boyfriend.

26
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,800
She did not get to tell you.

27

Is he good-looking?

30

Wei Wei is unbelievable.

31
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,600
Why didn't she tell me?

32
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,000
His surname is Lin.

33

He is 1.84 meter tall

and 22 years old.

35

Don't talk nonsense. Isn't that you?

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,079
Stop playing around. Be serious.

37

Do you really mean what you say?

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,520
No.

No way.

We are childhood friends.

We have known each other for years.

I think it is a good thing.

48

Although you and Wei Wei

49

aren't related by blood,

50

they will definitely urge
you to get married, right?

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,680
After that,

82
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,600

Enough.

178
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,680
Are you mocking me?

179
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,760
No, I'm not.

180
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,520
I just want to ask you

181
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,200
if you still want me
to be your son-in-law.

183

Let me introduce you to another person.

Mr. Dong,

through my professional
psychological evaluation,

I think you are mental.

If you keep pestering me,

200
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,600
I will call the police

201
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,560
and ask them

202
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,280
to record your information

203
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,600
and inform your workplace.

204

You...

205

What are you trying to do?

206
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,720
How dare you cheat on me.

207
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,400
Just you wait.

208
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,960

This is a draft for the next issue.

I will make changes if
you find it unsatisfactory.

223
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,920
Just leave it there.

224

Xiao Xiang,

how many years have you worked for me?

Since I joined the company,

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,360
it has been four or five years.

228
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,960
It has been so many years
in the blink of an eye.

229
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,760
You must have heard

230
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,640
I will have changes in
work arrangements recently.

231
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,520
Keep up your good work.

232
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,159
I will do my best.

233

There is a party coming up.

Tickets to this party

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,880
are in high demand,

238
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,600
because it is filled with young talent.

00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,680
Thanks, editor.

Wei Wei,

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
why are you still in bed?

244
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,240
Wake up.

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,640
We are going to this party tonight.

246
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,160
There might be young and handsome men.

247

You don't know what I
went through this morning.

248
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
I need to rest.

No, you have to join me.

This is for your own good.

Wake up.

Hello, everyone.

Hello.

257
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,560
Are you

258
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,760
this desperate nowadays?

259
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,720
Are those in their forties or
fifties "young and handsome"?

260
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,440
After my promotion as the editor-in-chief,

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,800
I have to get to know more people.

Besides,

263
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,520
old or young,

264
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,600
they are all men.

265
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,400
It is more or less the same.

266
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,320
You must be busy. Go ahead.

267
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,280
The cake seems tasty.

268
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,880
Get some.

269
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,720

What is wrong with you?

273
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,600
I'm so sorry.

274
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,960
Are you blind?

275
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,480
What is going on?

276
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,120
I'm sorry.

277
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,680
Do you have any idea how
expensive this dress is?

278
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
You cannot afford it in a million years.

279
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,520
She did not purposely bump into you.

280
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,760
Do you have to be so mean?

281
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,480
What? Do you think you are a millionaire?

282
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,960
Who are you?

283
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
How dare you speak to me in that tone.

Who let you in?

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,320
Ms. Tang.

286
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,680
Security!

287
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,400
Watch your behaviour in public places.

288
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,680
Mr. Jin.

289
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,080
You are right.

290
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,760
Those of us here

291
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,160
won't do such things.

292
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,360
I wonder what means they used

293
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,960
to get in.

294
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,000
I haven't introduced you.

295
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
They are my friends.

296
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,560
I apologise

297
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,600
if they offended you in any way.

298
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,360
So, you are Mr. Jin's friends.

299
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,320
You did not tell me.

300

Really?

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,080
Well, you seemed fierce.

309

That was just an act.

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,800

311
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,800

Do I have to make it so clear?

why I told you to come over today?

342
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,360
It's because I skipped class

and broke the school rule.

Not really,

520
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,120
but I take a break occasionally.

521
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,160
Try this blanched choy sum.

522
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,520
Thanks.

523
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,520
Ji

524
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Xiao Han.

525
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,840
You must be tired from painting all day.

526
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,480
Here, let me feed you.

527
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,920
This is Mapo Tofu.

528
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,200
It is fine.

529
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,960
Look.

530
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,720
You were scolded by the head
earlier on because of me.

531
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,040
I should treat you kindly,

532
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:58,880
right?

533
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:03,920
Lin Ran,

534
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,960
just go ahead and eat more.

535
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,600
What got into you today?

536
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,520
Eat.

537
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,960
I need to go to the washroom.

538
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,720
Me, too.

539
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,200
Tang Wei Wei,

540
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
you owe me an explanation.

541
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,440
I don't need to report everything to you.

542
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,200
Don't forget

543
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,680
we are in a relationship right now.

544
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,960
You're dining with the girl.

545
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,360
That's why I'm dining with Mr. Jin.

546
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,480
Besides,

547
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,160
our relationship is fake.

548
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,800
Well, in my case, I can explain.

549
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,120
We are...

550
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,720
I don't want to hear it.

551
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,200
I don't want to hear it.

552
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,040
I don't want to hear it.

553
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,040
Who is it?

554
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,760
[Lin Ran.]

555
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,000
I am here.

556
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,600
Where are you?

557
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,640
I am going to challenge you!

558
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,360
I am at Youxin Restaurant.

559
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,000
Come over.

560
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,360
Wait for me there.

561
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,920
Don't think of running away!

562
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,280
Sorry to make you wait.

563
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,360
Here.

564
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:01,960
Try this.

565
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,280
Okay. Have some.

566
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,240
Lin Ran,

567
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,240
she must be the person you like.

568
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,520
She is my girlfriend.

569
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,360
Lin Ran!

570
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,880
Lin Ran,

571
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,600
what a hypocrite.

572
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,320
How dare you trick me
in front of my cousin!

573
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,080
Let's settle old scores once and for all!

574
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,000
How do you want to do it?

575
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,480
Cousin.

576
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,160
Go upstairs first.

577
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,680
Cousin.

578
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
Lin Ran did it on purpose.

579
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,800
I am sure of it.

580
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,720
Go.

581
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:45,920
Ms. Tang,

582
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,840
this happened so suddenly.

583
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,440
Sorry.

584
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,520
It is fine.

585
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,120
I understand.

586
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,640
Please go on.

587
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,560
Then I will get going.

588
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,080
Bye.

589
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,160
You must be terrified.

590
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,360
Why don't I

591
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,760
send you home?

592
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,120
Let's go.

593
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,160
Sir,

594
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,400
we appreciate your kindness.

595
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,400
I will pay for your laundry

596
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,120
and I've also apologised.

597
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,280
Can we go now?

598
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,320
No.

599
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,680
You poured wine on others and scolded us.

600
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,120
You even threw money
around to humiliate people.

601
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,800
You have to sit down and drink with me

602
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,560
until I am satisfied.

603
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,440
You want to drink, right?

604
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,200
How do you want to do it?

605
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,230
I will drink with you.
