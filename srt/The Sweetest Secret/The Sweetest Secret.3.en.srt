According to Optics,

the principle of primary colours

214
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,080
objects to the idea of
mixing colours on a palette.

215

It proposes colour splitting.

216
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,799
Therefore, Neo-Impressionism
is known as pointillism.

please send him to the field.

350
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,000
Thank you.

351
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,440
What is your relationship with him?

352
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,240
Why are you looking for him?

353
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,200
I treat him like a brother.

354
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,200
Brother Ran!

355
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,200
Stop!

356
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,240
Brother Ran!

357
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,040
Stop running!

358
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,480
Brother Ran!

359
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,040
Brother Ran!

360
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,480
Lin Ran!

361
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,880
Lin Ran, let me out!

362
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,480
Buddy?

363
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,560
I was wrong.

364
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,160
Buddy.

365
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,240
I'm sorry.

366
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,960
Where are you going?

367
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm coming.

368
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,680
How dare you show up here.

369
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,240
Uncle Tang.

370
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,840
I'm being pursued.

371
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,200
Please save me.

372
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,440
What happened?

373
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,600
I don't know.

374
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,960
Did you offend

375
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,000
a member of the mafia?

376
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,840
No.

377
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,840
If you did,

378
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,160
I'll call the cops for you.

379
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,400
He's a schoolmate of mine.

380
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,560
He's a lunatic.

381
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,760
He wouldn't stop chasing me around.

382
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,480
Uncle Tang.

383
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,000
What are you doing?

384
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,880
At the Blind Dates' Corner,

385
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,200
I selected some elites.

386
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,480
Look at this one.

387
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,760
A postgraduate student at
one of the best universities.

388
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,520
His education background
is similar to Wei Wei's.

389
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
He's good-looking as well.

390
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,920
His eyes are too small.

391
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,760
It's like they are never opened.

392
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,840
Bad genes will be
passed down to the child.

393
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,160
What about this one? He's a civil servant.

394
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,400
The benefits are great.

395
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:20,880
Look at him.

396
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,840
His head is too huge.

397
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,560
Men like these are slackers.

398
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,040
Look at this one.

399
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,760
He has the drunkard's nose.

400
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,360
He's unhygienic.

401
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,960
He's too tanned.

402
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
That's enough.

403
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,080
You're doing this on purpose, Xiao Ran.

404
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,160
Are my choices really that bad?

405
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,240
Uncle, listen to me.

406
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,360
If the first impression

407
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
between two people aren't great,

408
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,280
things will not go well from then on.

409
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,320
As for these defective beings,

410
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,160
I shall get rid of them for you.

411
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,120
I'll gather another list tomorrow.

412
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,600
Uncle.

413
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,160
Sister Wei Wei is a great girl.

414
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,840
Marriage can wait.

415
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,880
Besides, Sister Wei Wei
is only 28 years old.

416
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,440
Only 28?

417
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,760
It is an understatement.

418
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,600
She will not be able to
get married if this goes on.

419
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,680
If nobody marries her,

420
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,560
I will.

421
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,920
Cut it out.

422
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,800
Well,

423
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,839
I'll be sleeping over
for the next few days.

424
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,920
What did you say?

425
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,280
Well,

426
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,760
I'd like to sleep over
for the next few days.

427
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,839
Thanks, uncle.

428
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,760
It's been a few days.

429
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,040
Are you able to help me or not?

430
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,760
By the way,

431
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,240
what made you move in?

432
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,200
Before senior year,

433
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,760
I'd been living here.

434
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,160
Is there an issue?

435
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,760
Do you still want your certificate back?

436
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,840
Listen to me.

437
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,640
Give me some time
to cook something up.

438
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,560
I'm going to pull the ultimate move

439
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,800
and retrieve the certificate.

440
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,520
Do you understand?

441
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,600
My shoulders

442
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,560
are so sore.

443
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,200
Tang Wei Wei.

444
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,280
Give me a good massage.

445
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,240
Of course.

446
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,520
It's my turn.

447
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,880
Stay in there forever if you can.

448
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,400
Lin Ran.

449
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,560
Your form teacher called

450
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,240
and said you skipped two days of classes.

451
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,760
Xiao Ran.

452
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,320
Why did you skip classes?

453
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,680
Uncle Tang.

454
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,080
Have you visited
Blind Dates' Corner recently?

455
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,200
Sister Wei Wei, what's wrong?

456
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,520
Did you choke?

457
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,000
I told you to be careful.

458
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,760
It'll be bad if you choke.

459
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,880
If we follow your standards,

460
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,240
I haven't found a suitable one.

461
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,560
Well,

462
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,640
stop looking then, Uncle Tang.

463
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,200
Check me out.

464
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,440
I'm handsome, intelligent and charming.

465
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,280
Also, I'm talented.

466
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,240
I'm the perfect candidate.

467
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,040
Don't you agree?

468
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Finish your food.

469
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,000
Cut it out.

470
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,800
Brother Ran.

471
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
What are you doing here?

472
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,400
You're finally here.

473
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,800
Don't go.

474
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,360
Listen to me.

475
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,160
I've been waiting for
three days and three nights.

476
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,120
Give me a hand.

477
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,760
Just say a word to my brother.

478
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,960
Tell him you've forgiven me.

479
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,680
If he does not reactivate my ATM card,

480
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,640
I will not be able to survive.

481
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,480
Help me out.

482
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,240
I promise

483
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,480
I'll never pester you again.

484
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:10,960
All right.

485
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,480
Lead the way.

486
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,040
Please.

487
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,360
Buddy.

488
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,000
Cousin.

489
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,240
I've repented and changed my ways.

490
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,480
I acknowledged my mistakes.

491
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,200
Lin Ran can confirm it.

492
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,640
Isn't that true?

493
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,560
Yes.

494
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,000
In your dreams.

495
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,560
Mr. Jin.

496
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,400
While restricting

497
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,720
his finance, I believe

498
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,120
you should restrict his
personal freedom as well.

499
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,160
This brat

500
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,840
not only distributed flyers at my campus,

501
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,920
I can't even return home, thanks to him.

502
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,640
You...

503
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,200
Sit down!

504
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,920
Cousin.

505
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,240
Let me explain.

506
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,840
Honestly...

507
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'll watch him closely from now on.

509
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,320
Don't worry about it.

510
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:00,840
It's a minor issue.

511
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,400
Anyway,

512
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,760
is Tang Wei Wei your sister?

513
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,880
Why would you ask?

514
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,840
Nothing, I'm just...

515
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,560
Tang Wei Wei

516
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,600
has incredibly low EQ.

517
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,360
She's a nuisance to everyone.

518
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,640
Most importantly,
she's a pathological liar.

519
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,720
She's a horrible person.

520
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,640
You shouldn't be interested in her.

521
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,560
Anyway, I have things to attend to.

522
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,200
I need to go.

523
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,480
You...

524
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,400
[So many people are
interested in Tang Wei Wei.]

525
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,800
[I'm already 22 years old.]

526
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,560
[It's time for me to
be in a relationship,]

527
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,560
[right?]

528
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,480
[Get ready.]

529
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,680
[I'm getting your certificate back.]

530
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,320
Xiao Ran.

531
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,640
I got another list of guys
from Blind Dates' Corner.

532
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,560
Take a look.

533
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,240
This isn't bad.

534
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,000
He's pretty good-looking.

535
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,640
Uncle Tang.

536
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,280
Every time you head
to Blind Dates' Corner,

537
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,480
I feel really upset.

538
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,400
I can't hide it from you anymore.

539
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,360
What are you doing?

540
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,760
Sister Wei Wei is already seeing someone.

541
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,920
She hasn't been able to tell you.

542
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Really?

543
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,640
Who is he?

544
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,040
How does he look?

545
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,960
I can't believe Wei Wei.

546
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,720
Why didn't she tell me sooner?

547
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,120
His last name is Lin.

548
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,000
184 cm.

549
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,920
22 years old.

550
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,640
Don't be ridiculous.
You're describing yourself.

551
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,200
Cut it out. This is a serious matter.

552
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,760
Are you serious?

553
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,640
This can't do.

554
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,240
No.

555
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,560
No way.

556
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,440
Don't be ridiculous.

557
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,080
Why not?

558
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,920
Uncle Tang.

559
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,360
Wei Wei and I grew up together.

560
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,000
We're childhood friends.

561
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,960
We've known each other for years.

562
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,320
I think it's great.

563
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,000
Although you and Wei Wei

564
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,240
aren't related by blood,

565
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,320
you're like her brother.

566
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,040
She practically watched you growing up.

567
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,200
Xiao Ran.

568
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,640
I can't believe Wei Wei is playing
along to your nonsense.

569
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,000
I can't believe it.

570
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,200
Uncle Tang.

571
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,880
Wei Wei is pregnant!

572
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,280
Do not forget.

573
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,680
We're dating right now.

574
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,080
Since you could share
a meal with the girl,

575
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,920
I could share a meal with
Jin Zi Chuan as well.

576
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,400
Besides,

577
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,110
our relationship is just an act.
