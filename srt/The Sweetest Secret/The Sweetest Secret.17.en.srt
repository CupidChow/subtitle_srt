1
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,830
The pregnancy is fake but the relationship is real

2
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,120
I have liked Tang Weiwei for a long, long time

3
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,360
I really want to be your boyfriend

4
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,120
I think

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,759
Be with you openly

6
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,270
You have been with me for one day

7
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,039
If you want to be so free, you can go to Weiwei

8
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:41,830
I am not familiar with Wei Wei

9
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,910
Dessert Shop Inspection

10
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:46,160
Do you know that there is a word called "No silver three hundred taels here"

11
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,160
original

12
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,360
I am your brother

13
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,800
now

14
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,479
I am your boyfriend

15
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,630
Come on, see for yourself

16
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,960
This is what I gave you on the opening day

17
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,390
You have to hide it when you go back

18
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,520
Don't be discovered by Uncle Tang

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,800
thanks

20
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,079
you are welcome

21
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,390
Let's go back

22
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,550
OK, good night

23
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,520
Bye-Bye

24
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,630
A new store opened

25
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,390
Take a look

26
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,720
congratulations

27
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,030
Auspicious opening

28
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,320
Auspicious opening

29
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,080
Congratulations

30
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,190
All right

31
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,470
What's wrong

32
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,960
I take you to the hospital

33
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,390
No

34
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,190
So busy

35
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,000
You go

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,829
There are so many of us, let's go

37
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:29,750
That Weiwei

38
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,800
Hurry up and take Lin Ran to the hospital

39
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,470
Brother is watching that store

40
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,520
It's okay to go

41
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,270
go

42
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,360
Everyone, let's work

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,960
It's all gone

44
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,079
Hey boss

45
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,079
Is such that

46
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,910
I heard

47
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,390
When a store opened here

48
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,160
Firecracker bombed

49
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,030
Our security issue must be dealt with

50
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,240
Yes Yes Yes

51
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,470
Good job

52
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,750
Good bye like this

53
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,030
Doctor

54
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,270
Is he seriously injured

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
He paints

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,190
Will it affect in the future?

57
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,110
Not less than

58
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,270
Bandages can be removed in three days

59
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,320
But you parents

60
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,000
Pay attention to later

61
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,829
How dangerous are fireworks

62
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,670
She is not a parent

63
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,720
Is my girlfriend

64
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,320
It's not like okay

65
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,000
Pay for medicine

66
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,950
Remember not to touch the water

67
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,790
Thank you doctor

68
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,440
Walk around

69
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,480
Xu Jian

70
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,920
You are really good

71
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,040
Weiwei has a brother like you

72
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,159
Really hell

73
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,510
You still have the mind to play games here

74
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,390
Let's work

75
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,600
Annoying

76
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,550
Straightforward

77
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,350
Add ten

78
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,200
Mr. Jin

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,270
The information you want

80
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,830
You sit down

81
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,200
good

82
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,440
You said

83
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,070
Do I care too much about the value

84
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,640
This B

85
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,600
Obviously not as good as A

86
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,760
Under what circumstances did you say

87
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,159
People would choose B

88
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,790
Lard blindfolded

89
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,790
B's data is really bad

90
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,880
There are also more deductions

91
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,270
It is really

92
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,510
Not suitable for marriage and love

93
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,000
But I think Editor Li is very cute

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,550
very good

95
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,760
You're happy

96
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,640
Mr. Jin

97
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,550
Time is almost up

98
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,880
I'll wait for you in the car

99
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,510
What made it so fragrant

100
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,510
Trotters soup

101
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,200
Complement shape

102
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,390
I'm not a pig

103
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,790
And me

104
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,550
But sister's

105
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Sweetheart

106
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,510
It looks so fragrant, so good

107
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,110
Drink it

108
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,600
So delicious

109
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,880
Still thinking about the dessert shop

110
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,760
Forget it

111
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:26,920
Smile

112
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,390
How can I not want to

113
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,440
So many things happened right after opening

114
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,350
I think I might be cursed

115
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,350
You are really cursed

116
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,440
Cursed by Eros

117
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,880
Drink, drink, drink

118
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,159
really not bad

119
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,470
Isn't this the shop that hurt people?

120
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,080
Why are you still shopping here

121
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,840
Know i just forgot for a while

122
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,590
thanks for coming

123
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,320
thanks

124
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,840
welcome

125
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
How did you come

126
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,550
You don't find me

127
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,640
I'm not happy yet, I'm looking for you

128
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,790
I tell you

129
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,230
Lick the dog to the end

130
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,000
Everything

131
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,790
What are you talking about

132
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,910
No one compares himself as a dog

133
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,320
Don't make trouble

134
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,960
Let people see

135
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,280
where

136
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,030
Let me tell you Wei Wei

137
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,880
Think about it yourself

138
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,440
Our day before

139
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,670
How much time is together

140
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,320
now

141
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,590
How many days and how long have you left me in the cold

142
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,470
Sure enough, women are like this

143
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,470
Throw it away

144
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,200
Ruthless

145
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,000
Let you heal at home

146
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,910
How can you raise a bitter woman in a boudoir?

147
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,350
I can't leave the shop alone

148
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,640
Stay with you every day

149
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,760
alright, alright

150
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,520
I close early today

151
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,710
Go back with you

152
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,640
No need to go home

153
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,790
You will get off work later

154
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,590
I'll pick you up

155
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,350
Take you to a place

156
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,840
Then you go back first

157
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Someone watching

158
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,080
Where is anyone here

159
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,910
Just the two of us

160
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,520
No one

161
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,030
Just someone

162
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,670
Go fast

163
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,150
Do you think this looks good

164
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,200
nice

165
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,880
can you hear me

166
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,320
Can hear

167
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,320
Tang Weiwei

168
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,590
share happiness

169
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,840
Happiness becomes double

170
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,470
Sharing sad

171
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,710
Sadness will be halved

172
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,790
What make you feel unhappy

173
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,080
you can tell me

174
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,590
Because a heart is small

175
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,350
And i'm big

176
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,840
If you mess up

177
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,670
Stuff all inside

178
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,000
That would feel very crowded

179
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,030
Classmate Lin Ran

180
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,710
Where did you learn these

181
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,910
What kind of chicken soup

182
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,790
I am coaxing you very seriously

183
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,960
Have been coaxed

184
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,910
Tang Weiwei

185
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,230
Can you learn to be a lover

186
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,590
Instead of being my sister

187
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,520
Can you respect me

188
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,960
I will work hard

189
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,350
slight

190
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,280
Let's get married

191
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,080
Didn't we get married long ago?

192
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,030
The kids are there

193
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,550
It turned out to be a dream

194
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,030
Although it's a dream

195
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,910
But progress is gratifying

196
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,230
victory is in sight

197
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,880
What's wrong

198
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,200
I asked you what's wrong

199
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,000
Burning brother

200
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,590
Ji Han memorized you

201
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,030
The exchange student quota has been cancelled

202
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,790
This matter

203
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,350
You have to ask the teacher

204
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,400
Go back to get a good understanding

205
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,030
Thank you director

206
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,760
do you understand

207
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,910
Goodbye director

208
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,840
director

209
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,710
Do you want to ask this

210
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,350
About the contract of the art exhibition

211
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,840
Already going through the process

212
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,280
no

213
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,000
It's about Ji Han

214
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,550
what are you thinking

215
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,670
I warn you

216
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,350
You have a great future now

217
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,550
Don't do stupid things

218
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,470
Are you listening?

219
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,520
I know your kindness

220
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,350
But that day

221
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,350
Things started because of me

222
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
You are so unclear

223
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,670
I remembered it to Ji Han

224
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,320
Inappropriate

225
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,350
One person to do things one person to do

226
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,320
Things start from me

227
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,400
The punishment should also be memorized

228
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,030
What do you know

229
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,400
Do you know that in such an exhibition

230
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,200
Fights

231
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,470
What a terrible thing

232
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,230
I tell you

233
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,030
All the media saw it

234
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,030
Over Europe

235
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,230
Very dissatisfied

236
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,110
Take it seriously

237
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,710
If it wasn't for me to suppress it for you

238
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,470
You think you can stay out

239
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,320
what are you thinking

240
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,470
director

241
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,200
For whatever reason, Lin Ran

242
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,880
She really did it first

243
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,670
Even if you lifted my office

244
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,150
I can't get my exchange student quota

245
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,760
What do you think school rules and disciplines are

246
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,550
Play house?

247
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,640
Why are you so depressed here

248
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:13,760
Hey

249
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,200
What do you think

250
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,320
You are very free

251
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,080
What's wrong with you

252
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,200
What's unhappy

253
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,280
Say it makes me happy

254
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,880
Not Gu Zhen

255
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,030
Are you interested

256
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,790
We had a fight here two days ago

257
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,030
Now we two elders

258
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,670
Nothing at all

259
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,520
On the contrary, it is Ji Han

260
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,640
Memorized punishment

261
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,550
She also lost her exchange student quota

262
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,640
Are you happy

263
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,470
What exchange student

264
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,230
no

265
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,440
How is she now

266
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Did you comfort her

267
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,320
I have a family

268
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,350
Why don't you go

269
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,150
I can't go

270
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,110
If i don't go

271
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,910
No one wants her back

272
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,030
just you

273
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,790
I can't do it, but my brother can do it

274
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,520
My brother is a shareholder of your school

275
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,470
real or fake

276
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:01,910
correct

277
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,110
Don't you forget

278
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,910
First put that depot

279
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,880
I signed the contract

280
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,230
Give your brother a call with your cell phone

281
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,000
I told him fast

282
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,350
Remember the contract

283
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,710
Beauty

284
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,520
Beauty

285
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,640
What are you doing

286
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,880
Didn't I say everything

287
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,910
Lin Ran let me come

288
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,880
Help take care of you

289
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,040
you go

290
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,000
Why

291
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,880
You go

292
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,520
You went out to buy groceries at six o'clock in the morning

293
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,710
Aren't you just to give Weiwei food?

294
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,470
I don't dare to be greedy

295
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,760
Send it in by yourself

296
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,520
I'm your uncle

297
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,760
I let you go, you go

298
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:28,830
Why are you old

299
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,070
Still awkward

300
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,430
If you care, be upright and care

301
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,280
I won't go i won't go

302
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,880
you go

303
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,560
It'll be cold in a while, go go go

304
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,760
Getting older and more hypocritical

305
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,560
My dad did it

306
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
Also put more onions

307
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,920
Uncle him

308
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,880
I won't give it to you by myself

309
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,680
I'm afraid I can't help nagging

310
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,470
You don't like to listen

311
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,000
slight

312
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,110
It's okay

313
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,470
We will get better in the future

314
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,000
Opening day

315
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,230
Brother is confused, brother is wrong

316
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,590
Sorry

317
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,880
I will not do it again

318
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,230
Brother will stay with you from now on

319
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,680
Make this dessert shop well

320
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,470
elder brother

321
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,350
Try my newest researched dessert

322
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:44,760
How about it

323
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,190
it is tasty

324
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,710
Weiwei, don't be discouraged

325
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,430
All beginnings are hard

326
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,640
Business will get better

327
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,800
correct

328
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,070
this

329
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,280
I brought more

330
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,190
You help me show it to my dad

331
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,760
He hasn't eaten my dessert for a long time

332
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,400
Row

333
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,880
What are you looking for

334
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,560
I want an exchange student quota

335
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,350
You make a price

336
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,560
Do i seem to be short of money

337
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,920
Don't you want my parking lot

338
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,640
We can develop together

339
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,190
Flying in the sky and running on the ground

340
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,520
I can give you whatever you want

341
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,590
but

342
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,400
Except Tang Weiwei

343
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,830
I think you misunderstood

344
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,950
Although I am a businessman

345
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,000
But not all business

346
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,070
Education is the foundation of the country

347
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,680
I won't let one

348
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,190
People who don't have any cultivation value

349
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,280
To waste national resources

350
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,800
I think you also misunderstood

351
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,350
She is qualified enough for this classmate

352
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,040
Just to help the classmates

353
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,880
Lost place

354
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,800
I'm just

355
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,190
Want to help her get back what belongs to her

356
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,350
Is that classmate you

357
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,920
Except Tang Weiwei

358
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,470
I don't want to owe any woman favors

359
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,520
I don't want to have anything to do with them

360
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,560
If she is really talented in learning

361
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,070
It's okay to have one more place

362
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,000
but

363
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,520
I don't want to make this deal with you

364
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,880
I can pay for the parking lot

365
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,310
But you have to do me a favor

366
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,590
I want a woman's information

367
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,190
no

368
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,590
Tang Weiwei is my girlfriend

369
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,430
You think too much

370
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,470
What i want is

371
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,280
Li Xiang's Information

372
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:31,920
Li Xiang

373
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:54,920
classmate

374
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,680
Almost done

375
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,560
I'm closed

376
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,920
You in the end

377
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,230
How long will it take to see

378
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,070
Do you think I want to see you

379
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,280
Lin Ran asked me to come and help

380
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,110
Burning forest burning forest burning forest burning let you help

381
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,950
What help

382
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:14,920
Help

383
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,880
help

384
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,350
The school committee temporarily added a place

385
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,350
Recorded you back

386
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,760
you want

387
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,190
Thank you Lin Ran

388
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,040
If not this time

389
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,590
He begged the school committee

390
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,310
Your quota is not guaranteed

391
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,230
Director, I see

392
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,680
Go go go go

393
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,590
Ji Han

394
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,160
How about it

395
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,350
Have you said it?

396
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,640
All agreed

397
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,400
Lin Ran

398
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,880
thank you

399
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,710
Thank me why

400
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,070
We are good brothers

401
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,110
Good brother what do you say thank you

402
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,560
Good brothers to us

403
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,400
Don't think too much

404
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,430
Tell you

405
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,800
When you go abroad,

406
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,590
Don't shame me

407
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,470
do not worry

408
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,880
After i go abroad

409
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,950
I'm sure I don't know you

410
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,520
Just do

411
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,350
What's wrong

412
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,880
Where does it hurt

413
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,000
Neck is itchy

414
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,230
or

415
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,590
I will give you a psychological test recently

416
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,430
How do you feel that your illness is getting worse

417
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,070
Doesn't you smell sweet and allergic?

418
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,230
Will not

419
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,280
Don't make a fuss

420
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,800
Maybe it's just eczema

421
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,000
Mr. Jin, please wait a moment

422
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,640
thanks

423
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,520
Wei Wei is looking for someone

424
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,800
Okay

425
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,350
Mr. Jin

426
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,280
Take a look

427
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,560
This new product planning

428
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,350
Let's not talk about it

429
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,880
I came today to suggest you

430
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,430
Since your store opened to the present

431
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,880
I hope you change hands as soon as possible

432
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,710
Stop loss in time

433
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,350
Is it so bad?

434
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,160
Assistant Wang did market research

435
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,000
And the future prospect analysis of your store

436
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,920
condition

437
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,190
May be worse than you think

438
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,920
Do you want to listen

439
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,760
Mr. Jin

440
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,920
Let's go out and talk

441
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,640
I don't want him to know

442
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,190
good

443
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,280
Lin Ran

444
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,680
Help me take a look at the store

445
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,190
good

446
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,350
When it opened

447
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,430
It really affects us a lot

448
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,070
But I have been developing

449
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,310
Healing desserts

450
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,160
As long as the gimmick can be started

451
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,520
There should be a chance

452
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,350
Mr. Jin, I want to hold on

453
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,880
Isn't this Xiaotang?

454
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,070
Came out with boyfriend

455
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,520
Not aunt

456
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,920
What's so shy about this

457
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,560
It's really not that he is my boss

458
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,640
Pity

459
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,560
You two

460
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,110
Looks good

461
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,230
big boss

462
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,280
You consider considering our Xiaotang

463
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,950
Auntie, you misunderstood

464
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,230
Auntie, eat slowly

465
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,560
I'll take you to the surrounding environment

466
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,040
Our main audience distribution

467
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,920
Is the nearby university town and food street

468
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,190
Aunt

469
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,640
How do they match well?

470
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,760
I think it's a good match

471
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,590
Do not you think so

472
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,470
Dafei

473
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,760
What do you mean by a person on the road

474
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,430
Just like-minded people

475
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,710
Then why some people

476
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,070
It's not all the way

477
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,830
I'll check it for you

478
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,760
With

479
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,680
Brother, listen

480
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,400
There are several standards

481
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,160
First

482
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,430
Inconsistent thoughts

483
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,070
Tang Weiwei is a science

484
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,800
I am a liberal arts

485
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,000
Article 2

486
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,280
Inconsistent interests

487
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,880
Tang slightly likes desserts

488
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,070
But I like motorcycles

489
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,110
Article 3

490
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,640
Inconsistent living habits

491
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,590
That person

492
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,190
Can't eat sugar

493
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,640
Can't drink alone

494
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,310
Does this count as a different lifestyle?

495
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,110
Where is such a hapless couple?

496
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,040
Are you sick?

497
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,160
Hello what's wrong

498
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,280
Have you finished talking with Jin Zichuan?

499
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,920
We're done today

500
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,070
Let's go to a movie together

501
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,110
I think our feelings

502
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,070
It is necessary to train

503
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,000
The same lifestyle

504
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,350
I still have something

505
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,640
You go home first

506
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,230
Bye-Bye

507
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,590
Hey

508
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,350
Where is such a hapless couple?

509
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,310
Sick

510
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,350
I'm back

511
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,110
What's wrong with you

512
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,000
Are you uncomfortable again?

513
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,110
No fever

514
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,830
Did you eat candy?

515
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,350
Also said that I didn't eat sugar

516
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,350
are you feeling better

517
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,350
I'll get you something to eat

518
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,470
What's wrong

519
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,880
I can eat candy now

520
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,190
Can still eat sweet

521
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,430
We are a pair right

522
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,110
Stop awkward

523
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,280
Shop just opened

524
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,710
Everything is not on track

525
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,350
Of course I have to take care of it

526
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,710
Like I took care of you before

527
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,520
Understand

528
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,710
sister

529
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,760
Take me home

530
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,230
what

531
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,190
it is me

532
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,950
I'm sick again at home alone

533
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,470
There is no hot water at home

534
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,920
I don't know how to cook

535
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,920
You have the heart to leave me here alone

536
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,710
I knew why today

537
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,950
Who was arguing at the beginning

538
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,350
To move out of my house

539
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,590
I'm afraid you will look down on me

540
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,430
If i always live in your house

541
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,470
Then you will always treat me as your younger brother

542
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,350
I don't want to be your brother

543
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,430
We are all together

544
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,400
I want to leave you

545
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,830
Want to be closer to you

546
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,520
Save your red apricot out of the wall

547
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,230
Go away

548
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:27,830
do not want

549
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,560
Go away

550
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,590
stand up

551
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,470
Stop messing around

552
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,280
Eating sugar is too dangerous for you

553
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,950
About the opening of the new store

554
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,560
My dad keeps arguing with me

555
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,520
If you move back now

556
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,800
Just blatantly touching the bad

557
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,350
not to mention

558
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,280
My cousin returned to China till now

559
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Have been living in my house

560
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,350
You go back now

561
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,070
It must be messy

562
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,230
slight

563
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:00,950
You believe me

564
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,950
I will be able to handle it

565
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,280
good

566
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,800
very hungry

567
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,310
I really want to eat noodles

568
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,040
Actually today is my birthday

569
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,880
I want to say

570
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,310
I like you

571
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,230
This should be our school

572
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,680
Accepted as the sweetest

573
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,040
If this is not true love

574
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,760
Then I don't believe in love anymore
