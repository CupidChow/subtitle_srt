00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,400
Do you need

178
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,280
any adjustments?

179
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,110
No need.

180
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,789
Everything is good.

181
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,030
I'm glad to hear that.

182
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,110
This is odd.

183
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,440
Why did the teacher ask me to come

184
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,670
and meet the guest personally?

185
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,150
Who is it today?

186
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,280
Sir.

187
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,440
Mr. Gu.

188
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,520
This is

189
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,350
Lin Ran from our art school.

190
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,840
Lin Ran.

191
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,760
This is the representative
from our sponsor.

192
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,590
Gu Zhen. You can call him Mr. Gu.

193
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,440
Mr. Gu?

194
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,080
Mr. Gu.

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,640
Great then.

196
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,350
Let him explain to me.

197
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,470
Gu Zhen.

198
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,030
What are you staging here?

199
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,470
Lin Ran.

200
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,200
Where's your manner?

201
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,320
Director.

202
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,670
I realise your student

203
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,910
is quite untalented.

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,640
Youngsters are immature.

205
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:29,880
Please don't take it to heart.

206
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,710
I'm thirsty.

207
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,550
Is there any water?

208
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,470
Yes.

209
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,640
We have a water dispenser.

210
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,670
I'll get some water for you.

211
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,110
No need.

212
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,960
I want him to bring it to me.

213
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,710
I want a cup of iced Coke.

214
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,520
Go. Hurry up.

215
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,590
Mr. Gu.

216
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,080
Please come this way.

217
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,590
Let me show you around.

218
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,670
At Southeast Union University,

219
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,080
we hold this art exhibition

220
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,230
every year.

221
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:07,910
Not bad.

222
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,230
Thank you.

223
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,670
Is that all?

224
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,030
Are you not going to open it for me?

225
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,350
Open it?

226
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,320
Help him open it.

227
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,520
Gosh!

228
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,440
Mr. Gu.

229
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,230
You ruined my clothes!

230
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,670
What's the matter with you?

231
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,280
Are you all right?

232
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,350
I just brought it here.

233
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,080
I don't know this would happen.

234
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,590
It's fine.

235
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,230
Let me help you wash it.

236
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,150
I don't want your help!

237
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,230
I want him to do it!

238
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,590
Lin Ran, let me tell you!

239
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,470
I will not help you with the exhibition!

240
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,320
Never

241
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,640
and ever!

242
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,440
Why are you so hard to please?

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,910
I brought you water

244
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,790
and opened the bottle for you.

245
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,520
Don't you have a washing machine at home?

246
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,840
Why should I wash your cloth?

247
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,960
You're the one who doesn't
have a washing machine!

248
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,710
Let me tell you.

249
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,640
This has to be dry cleaned!

Lin Ran.

251
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,320
Yesterday,

252
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,030
I

253
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,760
removed your name from the exhibition!

254
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,910
Don't ever think of participating it!

255
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,440
You removed my name?

256
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,350
How dare you removed my name?

257
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,760
Yes.

258
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,520
Lin Ran!

259
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,150
Lin Ran, let go!

260
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,320
I drafted the whole proposal

261
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,080
and you removed my name?

262
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,670
Yes, I removed your name.

263
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,110
You removed my name?

264
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,670
Yes!

265
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,840
How dare you?

266
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,550
Stop!

267
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,550
Mr. Gu.

268
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,400
My teeth.

269
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,790
I cannot feel my teeth.

272
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,880
Hello.

273
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,550
I'm the sponsor of this exhibition.

274
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,110
I was busy this morning.

275
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,030
So, I asked Gu Zhen to come on my behalf.

276
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,110
Zi Chuan.

277
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,280
I'm sorry

278
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,080
to make you rush here
despite your busy schedule.

279

What's the matter?

280
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,320
Zi Chuan.

281
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,280
He punched me first.

282
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,000
My tooth cracked in half.

283
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,590
You taunted me first.

284
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,440
You even tried to remove my
name from the exhibition.

285
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,230
I'm sorry to ask this,

286
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,110
but do you both know each other?

287
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,710
No. Who would know a guy like him?

288
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,440
Yes, we do.

289
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,670
You should have said earlier.

290
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,230
Look at this mess.

291
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,880
Mr. Gu even hurt his teeth.

292
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,440
I'm terribly sorry.

293
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,200
It was my oversight.

294
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,840
No,

295
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
it's our fault.

296
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,880
I'm sorry for bringing trouble
to the school.

297
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,840
Gu Zhen was even hurt.

298
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,550
We will take responsibility.

299
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,760
Since you all have apologised

300
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,710
and expressed your stands,

301
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,470

this matter

303
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,760
is settled now, okay?

304

Sorry.

I shouldn't have given
that gassy Coke to you.

to the dentist first?

I'm terribly sorry for today.

I'll take Gu Zhen to the dentist.

331

Don't worry.

332
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,470
Actually, today,

333
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,590
I have something to tell you.

334
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,110
What is it?

335
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,960
Do you remember that I told you

336
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,590
you're my ideal girlfriend candidate?

337
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,520
Yes,

338
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,840
but I still think that

339
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,230
rationality is not the only

340
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,470
factor for a relationship to work.

341
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,790
I think

342
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,320
that is sufficient to
start a relationship.

343
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,960
Although it may be illogical,

344
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,440
I think

345
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,350
we should still give it a shot.

346
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,910
I'm sorry.

00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,230
Excuse me.

353
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:21,710
I'll have to go.

354
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,150
Father.

355
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Wei Wei, you're home.

356
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,030
Come here.

357
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,840
Wei Wei.

358
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,440
Look at the research I've done.

359
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,080
There are three jobs
that related to your studies.

360
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,400
First, a civil servant.

361
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,840
Second, a psychologist at a university.

362
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,880
Third, a psychological consultant
at a company.

363
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,960
I can help you if you want to
be a teacher or a consultant,

364
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,840
but

365
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,000
if you want to be a civil servant,
you need to work it out by yourself.

366
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,150
However, I'm sure my daughter

367
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,230
would be able to make it.

368
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,840
Anyway,

369
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,790
I think

370
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,960
you should become a teacher.

371
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,880
It suits you better.

372
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,230
It's pure and simple.

373
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,840
Most importantly,

374
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,030
you must like it.

375
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,910
A job is for a lifetime.

376
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,000
You must be happy with it.

377
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,520
Father.

378
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,960
Why are you looking at these?

379
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,030
You're my daughter.

380
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,960
I'm worried about your future,

381
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,440
okay?

382
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,470
Father.

383
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,590
Do you know why I wanted
to study psychology?

384
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,110
In the beginning,

385
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,520
Lin Ran would end up in hospital
whenever he ate sweets.

386
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,150
So, at that time,

387
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,080
I was determined to cure him.

388
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,280
After that, I saw you looking

389
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,710
at mother's photo all the time.

390
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,230
You don't want to meet someone new.

391
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,030
So, I wanted to help you move on.

392
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,790
After studying psychology
for so many years,

393
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,910
I didn't help anyone.

394
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,790
Instead, I only

395
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,200
suffered myself.

396
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,320
Father.

397
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,030
I know you're doing this for my sake,

398
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,200
but I chose this path

399
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,440
not because I wanted a stable job.

400
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,760
Father.

401
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,110
I wouldn't be able to

402
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,030
accept this for now.

403
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,080
Also...

404
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,200
Father,

405
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,710
thank you.

406
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,000
Silly girl.

407
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,230
You don't have to thank me.

408
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,880
Are we there yet?

409
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,880
Yes.

410
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,560
Sit here.

411
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,430
Come here.

412
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,430
Forward. To the right.

413
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,110
Sit down.

414
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,350
Take a seat.

415
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:37,950
Sit down.

416
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,430
That's right.

417
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,640
Look.

418
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,920
How beautiful.

419
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,520
I wanted to take you
to look at the stars today,

420
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,110
but there aren't any tonight.

421
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,680
So, I made this instead.

422
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,230
When I was doing this,

423
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,350
I kept thinking of you

424
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,190
because you are

425
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,520
the kind of person

426
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,040
who never gives up

427
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,110
reaching for the stars.

428
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,800
Now,

429
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,560
you're like the sky.

430
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,710
Gentle

431
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,710
and beautiful.

432
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,920
Do you want to start treating me again?

433
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,830
Why are you suddenly bringing this up?

434
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,190
I'm your boyfriend.

435
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,590
Next time, I want to

436
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,560
eat sweets with you.

437
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:42,830
All right.

438
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,710
In the beginning,

439
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,000
I was only interested
in detailed hypnosis.

440
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,680
When I was in university,

441
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,560
other than classes and
working on my dissertation,

442
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,920
I was always in the research room.

443
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,950
We had volunteers by time to time

444
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,590
and we would offer consultation.

445
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,280
However,

446
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,470
my dissertation and results

447
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,560
were null

448
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,230
because I

449
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,400
was unable to hypnotise anyone.

450
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,830
I would end up falling asleep myself.

451
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,560
Truth be told,

452
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,590
I'm worried.

453
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,230
I've failed too many times.

454
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,350
I haven't tried in too long.

455
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:27,830
Don't worry.

456
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,680
Let's try it.

457
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,160
I don't know if you can hear this,

458
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,110
but I've always been afraid.

459
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,760
I was afraid that my constant pursuit

460
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,230
would annoy you.

461
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,800
However, if I didn't do that,

462
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,590
I would only be

463
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,400
your naughty

464
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,350
and stupid brother who doesn't eat sweets.

465
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:41,830
In that case,

466
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,800
would you have liked me?

467
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,760
Lin Ran.

468
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,000
I like...

469
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,680
What did you say?

470
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,400
I like you.

471
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,190
Are you saying

472
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,430
Tang Wei Wei likes Lin Ran?

473
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,040
I, Lin Ran,

474
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,560
will officially reflect on myself

475
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,230
for Tang Wei Wei.

476
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,800
Firstly,

477
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,760
I shall not hide anything from you.

478
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,670
[I was wrong. I'm sorry.]

479
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,350
Secondly,

480
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,640
I shouldn't repeat any mistakes.

481
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,000
Thirdly,

482
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,680
I should always agree with you.

483
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,830
Today, I harbour the deepest regret

484
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,520
and guilt

485
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,640
as I pen this reflection.
