3
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,630
Let go of my girlfriend.

4
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,590
Your girlfriend?

5
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,680
Not girlfriend.

6
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,800
You lied to me.

7
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,950
You bullied Wei Wei.

8
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,039
I don't like you since the beginning.

9
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,000
Hey.

10
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,479
You should stop going for a blind date.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,720
You can't find a good man

12
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,080
with your current condition.

13
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,400
Mind your own business.

14
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,509
Why?

15
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,479
Does women's temper get worse

16
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,160
as they age?

17
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,039

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,590
Sorry, I'm late.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,480
You're here.

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,360
Wei Wei.

22
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,510
Welcome.

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,160
How dare you come?

24
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,630
You just left me behind yesterday.

25
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,880
Forgive me.

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,750
Wei Wei.

27
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,550
You are so arrogant.

28
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,520
Everyone waited for you.

29
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,670
You didn't greet us.

30
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,110
Instead, you and Li Xiang
whispering to each other.

31
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,670
I'm really sorry.

32
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,440
Something held me up.

33
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,800
You need to drink three glasses
of wine as a punishment then.

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,470
Yes.

35
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,390
She is right.

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,390
Ignore her.

37
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,079
She means no good.

38
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,550
Everyone knows you'll change
as soon as you drink.

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,110
Let's drink.

40
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,630
We haven't seen
one another for a long while.

41
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,000
Cheers.

42

Cheers.

Where is Lin Ran?

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,520
He made such a trouble,

45
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:51,079
but he just escaped?

46
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,000
What else do you want?

47
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
Are you tired of living?

48
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,030
Yes.

49

Wei Wei.

52
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,830
I see that you're so busy.

53
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,110
Is your boyfriend checking on you?

54
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,600
It's a spam call from a property agent.

55
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Who will believe it,

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,550
right?

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,110
I heard this not long ago.

58
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,960
Mr. Tang went around the neighbourhood

59
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,470
to seek a boyfriend for Wei Wei.

60
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,630
Really?

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,440
Wei Wei.

62
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,030
You're turning 30 years old soon.

63
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,829
You should grab
the opportunity when it comes.

64
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,750
It's 2020.

65
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,750
Women don't spend their time and value

66
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,320
on men anymore.

67
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,829
Moreover,

68
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,390
Wei Wei already has a boyfriend.

69
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,550
She doesn't need a blind date.

70
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,880
Boyfriend?

71
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,190
Does she have a boyfriend?

72
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,910
Why don't you bring him along

73
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,829
and introduce him to us?

74
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:37,270
Exactly.

75
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,030
Bring him over.

76
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,440
Anyway, she is in a relationship.

77
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,470
Enough.

78
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,470
Let's not talk about this.

79
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,440
Let's drink.

Tang Wei Wei.

86
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,110
Reply me. Do you hear me?

87
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,880
I have to pick up this call.

88
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,630
You guys continue chatting.

89
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:06,720
Wei Wei.

90
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,800
Look at you.

91
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,880
You didn't talk much during the meal.

92
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Is it because

93
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,240
we are incomparable

94
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,440
with you?

95
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,720
Don't say that.

96
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,110
Wei Wei is doing great.

97
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,350
She has just completed
her bachelor degree.

98
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,640
I heard you're doing a PhD.

99
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,790
She is

100
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,550
her lecturer's favourite student.

101
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,110
Doctor-to-be.

102
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,160
Tell us about your boyfriend.

103
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,200
We're curious.

104
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,670
Who has the courage

105
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,510
to woo an elite like you?

106
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,670
Yes, Wei Wei.

107
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,720
Tell us.

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,790
Who is that brave guy?

109
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,070
Xiao Yin's husband is

110
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,830
the deputy director of
the Food Administration Bureau.

111
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,070
My husband is
the general manager of Hongtu.

112
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,159
Perhaps

113
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,510
they know your boyfriend.

114
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,950
I have no boyfriend.

115
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,790
Then you should tell us earlier.

116
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,320
You've been keeping us curious.

117
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,270
Aren't you

118
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,230
being very proud of yourself?

119
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,920
Who says she has no boyfriend?

120
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,390
Isn't that Lin Ran?

121
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,720
He has grown up.

122
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,670
Why?

123
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,550
Are you still following around Wei Wei?

124
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,880
That's right, Wei Wei.

125
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,200
Even if you want to save your face,

126
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,230
you shouldn't ask Lin Ran to come.

127
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,040
We know one another so well,

128
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,350
don't we?

129
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,950
Besides,

130
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,550
Lin Ran was

131
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,920
popular among girls.

132
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,880
Yes.

133
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,480
Look at your age gap.

134
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,440
Your age gap is probably six to seven years.

135
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,320
Do you really think
you deserve a young boy?

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,830
That's very funny.

137
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,760
Why doesn't she deserve me?

138
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,550
If she doesn't deserve me,

139
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,600
how about you?

140
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,760
We're just saying.

141
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,790
Don't take it to heart.

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,040
I need to go to the washroom.

143
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,270
Wei Wei.

144
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,040
[If she doesn't deserve me,]

145
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,720
[how about you?]

146
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,110
No way.

147
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,920
Not Lin Ran.

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,950
Why not?

149
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,830
How dare you ask?

150
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,200
I came to save you.

151
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,040
Is this how you repay my kindness?

152
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,270
You know what?

153
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,440
Bai Lu kept crying when she couldn't

154
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,270
beat you in the study.

155
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,200
Xiao Yin is her lackey.

156
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,040
If I didn't come today,

157
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,760
you'll be the victim of bullying.

158
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,230
You don't know anything
about the adult world.

159
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,110
Do you think

160
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,510
this gathering is necessary?

161
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,830
It happens once a year.

162
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,510
We were classmates after all.

163
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,159
You concern about the social norms.

164
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,920
That means you're old.

165
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,159
Yes, I'm old.

166
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,720
Tang Wei Wei, let's flee.

167
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,640
Pardon?

168
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,350
Let's flee.

169
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,880
Leave this

170
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,790
displeasing place.

171
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,000
My bag is inside.

172
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,270
I'm your boyfriend.

173
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,550
I know what to do.

174
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,200
Let's go.

175
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,920

176
