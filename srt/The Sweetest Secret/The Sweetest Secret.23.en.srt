1
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,510
Shut up

2
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,360
Lin Ran

3
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:31,870
Forget it before

4
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,229
My sister is married now

5
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:34,080
You still got involved

6
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,039
Do you want to ruin her happiness

7
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,550
First thing

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,160
It's me and Tang Weiwei

9
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,830
already married

10
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,000
Bastard

11
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,190
pardon

12
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,950
slight

13
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,759
That schedule is really a misunderstanding

14
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,550
And am I in a hurry?

15
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,630
Take the initiative

16
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,509
Otherwise, I really won't have a chance

17
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,910
That Miss Tang is really young and promising

18
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,960
It took half a year

19
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,670
Just manage the shop so well

20
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,720
Is someone supporting me?

21
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,910
I think she is wearing a ring on her hand

22
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,390
No more

23
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,720
It's all my family's own efforts

24
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,000
Her family is really relieved

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,440
Let her be here alone

26
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,550
Care about her

27
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,550
Maybe

28
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,360
Feeling broken

29
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,390
What are you two talking nonsense

30
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,079
Freeze said

31
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
Why are you here

32
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,830
how

33
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,270
You're still mad at me

34
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,550
Don't be angry with me

35
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,910
The psychological journey of anger

36
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,829
Need to include serious thinking

37
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,000
mood

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,390
External behavior

39
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,360
The correctness of the object

40
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,520
I'm done

41
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,440
in other words

42
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,910
I'm not angry anymore

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,600
Not angry anymore

44
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,750
I just think

45
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,830
It's useless to vent pure anger

46
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,880
so

47
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,390
I put anger

48
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,630
As

49
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,200
Feedback control

50
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,230
Row

51
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,350
You don't have to be angry

52
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,110
It's pretty good to listen to your studies

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,640
Xiaoyi

54
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,160
here I am

55
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,920
What does feedback control mean

56
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,550
Anger expression of feedback control

57
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,110
Can promote a positive change

58
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,040
For example

59
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,320
Parents are disciplining their children

60
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,640
Still throwing stones

61
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,920
Like a child

62
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,110
Tang Weiwei

63
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,670
Why grew up

64
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,880
No matter what i do

65
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,510
I look like a child in front of you

66
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,600
Still remember

67
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
When my parents threw me to Uncle Tang

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,830
You have been taking care of me

69
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,480
It might be an instinctive reaction

70
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,790
Until the first year of high school

71
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,230
I insist on going out

72
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,040
Go live on campus

73
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,510
Lin Ran

74
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,320
Take care of yourself after moving out

75
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,070
There is

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,830
Don't eat sugar

77
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:22,950
good

78
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,000
Then I found

79
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,390
Actually at that time

80
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,950
I like you

81
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,830
Maybe you don't remember

82
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,670
Was a

83
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,070
stop

84
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:38,920
go

85
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
Then you hug me

86
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,760
Ran home from the school gate

87
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,270
I didn't scold me

88
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,110
From that time

89
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,760
I realized

90
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,920
I can't take you anymore

91
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,320
I saw it as my childhood sweetheart

92
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,600
And me

93
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,830
Want to follow in your footsteps

94
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,230
Want to stand with you

95
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,000
want to

96
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,670
Marry you home

97
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,110
original

98
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,830
Your plan

99
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,550
Earlier than your watch

100
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,390
Don't confess

101
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,390
What can i do

102
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,110
You are good with everything

103
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,480
There are a lot of reasons to prevaricate me

104
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,830
I can't hold you back

105
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,510
What can i do

106
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,640
I'm too hard

107
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,480
I

108
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,880
Seems hungry

109
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,670
Come on me to carry you

110
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,830
Jump up

111
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,480
simply put

112
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,640
Although the effect of anger is small

113
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,160
but

114
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,350
If you meet a good tolerant

115
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,480
Accept negative emotions

116
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,200
Allow it to exist

117
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,390
And express

118
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,350
We will all grow up

119
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,720
Learn the harmony of life

120
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,510
So as to harmonize the essence of contradiction

121
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,390
coordination

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,320
Mutual love

123
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,320
Drink tea

124
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,880
Biluochun

125
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,270
Fresh today

126
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,350
Drink without eating

127
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,110
eat

128
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,350
waiter

129
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,270
Hello

130
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,510
Want a green

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,640
Bean cake

132
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,640
OK

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,760
Chief Executive

134
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,390
Your sentence is so cute

135
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Thank you baby

136
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,440
Think about

137
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,670
I think you now

138
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,720
Should we focus on

139
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,790
Put it on our date

140
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,270
I'm here

141
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,350
What do you mean

142
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,600
Let me delete my friend

143
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,830
I divided you into a fish pond

144
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,640
Your free and happy single room

145
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,590
How many people squeeze a pool next door

146
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,909
Why are you talking weirdly today

147
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,710
Good

148
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,110
Let's go to the opera

149
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,910
Someone just gave me two opera tickets

150
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,880
I pushed

151
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll see you on the weekend

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,670
High unhappy

153
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,590
Come hurry up

154
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,230
Wait for me, slow down

155
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,200
You didn't take anything

156
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,230
Fast in front

157
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,350
You see they are putting on Kongming lanterns

158
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,960
Want to play

159
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,840
I'll get you one

160
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,550
want to

161
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,550
wait for me a while

162
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,880
brother

163
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,200
Do you have more

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,470
Give you one

165
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,030
thank you

166
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,960
You are welcome

167
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,080
What the hell are you doing

168
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:44,960
look

169
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,400
Tang Weiwei

170
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,670
Lin Ran

171
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,030
grow old together

172
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,550
I'm going to sleep

173
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,110
stand up

174
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,640
Choose one of the floor corridors

175
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,910
I choose

176
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,150
bed

177
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,150
I helped you choose

178
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,440
floor

179
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,110
What are you doing

180
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,880
Good night

181
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,350
I didn't expect the school flower to be a dog licking

182
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,320
is this real

183
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,280
House collapsed

184
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,230
Heartbroken

185
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,400
This is my goddess

186
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,400
That's right, how can a school flower

187
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,230
seriously

188
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,470
I do not believe

189
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,400
I didn't expect her to be like this

190
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,080
Still doing such a thing

191
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,520
Isn't this the school flower?

192
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,790
Shameful

193
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,280
It turns out that they are both fake

194
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,960
Is it Lin Ran

195
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,550
it's okay no problem

196
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,000
It seems to be

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,350
I just said she posted upside down

198
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,440
You still write

199
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,590
How does it feel to see a goddess licking a dog?

200
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,880
fine

201
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
You ignore them

202
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,550
Ji Han

203
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,880
Burning brother

204
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,200
Hundred Thousand Hurry

205
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,400
Something happened to Ji Han

206
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,760
I'll go back right away

207
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,550
Ji Han

208
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,520
It's okay

209
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,400
do not be upset

210
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,080
Burning brother

211
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,320
How about it

212
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,590
Did you find out who did it?

213
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,960
It's a new trumpet

214
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,150
Did not leave any information

215
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,440
I asked the forum management

216
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,280
Check registered mobile phone

217
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Calling past is also an empty number

218
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,000
I checked

219
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,910
I can find

220
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,670
Ji Han

221
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,400
Don't be sad

222
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,640
Yes indeed

223
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,200
Why didn't I think of it, you can check it

224
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,590
so

225
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,030
Me and Dafei

226
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,470
Check the IP of the post first

227
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,280
Ji Han

228
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,470
Du Ruyue

229
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,790
You just accompany her for a while

230
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,230
Let's try our best to keep this matter to a minimum

231
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,030
and

232
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,840
Tens of thousands

233
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,760
I can't let Tang Weiwei know

234
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:32,910
Burning brother

235
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,640
Do not worry

236
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,550
Everyone is not talkative

237
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,960
Can you really find it

238
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,590
can

239
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,550
Surely

240
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,150
Then let's go together too

241
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,110
No need no more

242
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,790
You are waiting here

243
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:45,910
Gu Zhen

244
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,550
Big fly

245
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,840
Walk around

246
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,550
How is the situation

247
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,350
I have checked the IP data

248
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,000
But want to determine who it is

249
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,470
It's really troublesome

250
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,150
what does it mean

251
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,350
simply put

252
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,110
I found

253
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,000
Is the IP address of the last two digits hidden

254
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,790
Theoretically

255
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,400
There may be two digits in it

256
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,280
Or three digits

257
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,350
In other words

258
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,760
Computer with the same IP data in front

259
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,520
There may be dozens or hundreds of

260
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,150
but

261
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,640
Just confirm the posting time

262
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,400
And then put the computers that have been active during this time period

263
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,440
List all

264
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,640
Check one by one

265
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,790
Should be able to find out who posted it

266
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,590
Okay you kid

267
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,760
My brother Gu, break off

268
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,440
nice

269
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,200
Come here, let me check for you

270
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,440
Why the post is gone

271
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,760
What's the situation

272
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,760
I do not know

273
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,350
Why is it gone

274
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,200
Get it out

275
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,760
Get it out

276
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,440
I try i try

277
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,550
How did you come

278
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,640
Ji Han asked me to bring you some water

279
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,520
How is the investigation?

280
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,840
Don't mention it

281
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,400
It was fine just now

282
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,470
Sudden

283
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,840
Nothing nothing

284
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,400
It's a coincidence

285
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,110
Did I bother you

286
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,230
I'll go now

287
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,470
Bye-Bye

288
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,840
Check it slowly

289
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,910
You say

290
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,640
Most likely to get the diary

291
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,400
Could it be Du Ruyue?

292
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,960
You are here

293
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,840
Du Ruyue

294
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,440
What's wrong

295
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,030
It's okay

296
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,880
Just want to tell you

297
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,760
We just found the address

298
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,710
Yes

299
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,400
That's great

300
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll go back and tell Ji Han now

301
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:51,880
Du Ruyue

302
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,880
I remember

303
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,520
You have an exam next week, right

304
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,230
Part-time job is very delayed for review

305
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,790
You next week

306
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,760
Resign from the dessert shop

307
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,200
It's okay

308
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,520
I don't miss the exam part-time

309
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,310
And Wei Wei is also very kind to me

310
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,069
I mean

311
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,280
you

312
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,560
Resign

313
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,710
Hello everyone

314
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,000
Otherwise, everyone won't be able to get off the stage

315
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,400
You go back

316
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,710
Kisaragi

317
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,760
Hurry up

318
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,230
Come try my new sugar-free cake

319
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,640
How about it

320
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,880
good to eat

321
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,880
good to eat

322
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,190
I'll also have a taste

323
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,710
Ji Han

324
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,800
actually

325
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,190
I always wanted to thank you in person

326
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,430
thank you

327
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,310
no thanks

328
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,280
I want to ask you

329
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,560
You think

330
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,560
Who is most likely

331
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
Get your diary

332
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,880
What do you want to say

333
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,520
What do you think of Du Ruyue

334
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,520
Did you find something?

335
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,470
good

336
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,400
Lin Ran

337
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,640
I see what you mean

338
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,350
You can know it in your heart

339
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,070
Gone

340
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:45,830
Lin Ran

341
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,640
What's wrong

342
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,560
actually

343
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,560
I should apologize to you in person

344
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,040
Because of my personal reasons

345
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,470
Trouble you

346
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,950
and

347
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,280
Liking you is actually my business alone

348
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,040
Can be friends with you

349
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,190
I'm already happy

350
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,520
I know that after you and Weiwei are together

351
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,680
I already put it down

352
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,590
So that diary

353
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,070
I didn't take a good look

354
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
It's okay

355
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,880
Can be liked by a good girl like you

356
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,070
I should thank you

357
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,040
It's a pity

358
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,880
Our revolutionary friendship cannot be kept

359
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,950
Let's go

360
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,830
How did you find this store

361
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,920
Hello

362
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:30,950
Your dessert

363
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,590
thanks

364
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,040
Tell me

365
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,760
This

366
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,280
Why is it so hot today

367
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,310
It must be hot in August now

368
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,430
You say this August

369
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,070
Is there an important day?

370
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,710
Do you remember

371
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,680
No

372
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,560
Why not

373
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,350
Think about it for me

374
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,000
Really not

375
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,920
The last time I confessed to you

376
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,520
When

377
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,430
some days ago

378
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,800
last week

379
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,230
last month

380
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,350
no

381
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm talking about the kind of formal

382
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,560
Once a year

383
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,680
Ritual

384
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,590
Your birthday

385
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,760
Then what

386
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,400
At once

387
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,830
Birthday

388
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,520
My birthday is past

389
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,040
I didn't mean your birthday

390
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,950
I mean

391
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,110
A guest is coming

392
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,110
I'm going to work first

393
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,070
You should go back to school and prepare

394
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,680
hurry up

395
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,680
boss

396
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,640
I want this

397
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,680
good

398
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,230
Hello

399
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,110
Hello

400
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,000
Is my cake ready

401
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,280
All right

402
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,560
You can come and get it now

403
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,520
OK

404
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,680
I'll get it right away

405
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,640
Hey Juyue

406
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,640
Wei Weijie

407
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,830
A customer in the shop ate something

408
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,000
Seems to be poisoned

409
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,400
I took him to the hospital

410
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,310
Do you want to come over

411
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,880
Ok ok

412
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,590
I will be right over

413
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,640
Who are you

414
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,400
Hello

415
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,470
I'm the owner of Tanyun Dessert Shop

416
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,470
As soon as it happened

417
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,880
I rushed over immediately

418
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,000
How is the patient

419
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,470
Is it convenient for me to go in and have a look

420
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:56,590
correct

421
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,470
this is

422
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,190
Supplements I bought for patients

423
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,400
So you are the owner of the dessert shop

424
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,280
Today, you almost ate people to death

425
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,110
do you know

426
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,830
This year

427
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,190
You can open a shop even with such a black heart

428
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,040
You guys

429
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:08,950
Imported ingredients

430
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,230
Won't you check it in advance?

431
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,160
Really sorry

432
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,400
But you can rest assured

433
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,680
Our ingredients are purchased uniformly

434
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,470
Also undergoes strict inspections

435
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,880
So there will never be a safe situation

436
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,350
Did the doctor say the reason?

437
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,350
What do you mean by that?

438
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,040
You don't want to be responsible

439
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,310
My daughter

440
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,110
She is in your shop

441
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,760
Eat the problem

442
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,950
Now you say you are not responsible

443
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Do you still have a conscience

444
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,520
No no no

445
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,920
That was not what I meant

446
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,880
Then what do you mean

447
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,160
I tell you

448
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,920
My daughter

449
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,520
If she has any shortcomings

450
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,710
I will never let your store go

451
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,710
Wei Weijie

452
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:55,950
It happened suddenly

453
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,800
It's normal for them to be emotional

454
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,190
Don't worry

455
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,350
fine

456
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,040
You go back first

457
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,800
I stay to see

458
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,680
What else can i help

459
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,400
Wei Weijie

460
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,280
People from the Food Safety Bureau came here this afternoon

461
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,280

462
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,230
Wei Weijie

463
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,640
You go back first

464
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,070

465
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,470
Xiao Yin's husband

466
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,400

467
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,430
Where is my husband

Deputy Director of the Security Bureau

470
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,470
Xiao Yin

471
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,350
Do you have time

472
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,230
I am coming now

473
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,430

00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:36,950
Come in quickly

477
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,400
Come everyone

478
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,000
Let me introduce to everyone

479
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:40,680
this

480
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,040
Is my old classmate

481
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
People but

482
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,590
Top students

483
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,640
University bully

484
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,590
You talk for a while

485
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,590
You have to converge

486
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,070
Come

487
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,590

Sit down

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:53,800
Wei Wei

491
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,190
Have a drink with everyone

492
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,160
I

493
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,350
Don't know how to drink

494
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,160
The little girl can't drink

495
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,040
Don't drink

496
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,880
What's wrong

497
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,760
Isn't it enough to learn?

498
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,430
People always have the first time

499
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:08,880
Moreover

500
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,190
So many people are here

501
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,190
Wei Wei

502
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,430
Isn't this not giving me face?

503
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,110
Yes yes

504
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,310
Come come

505
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,160
Have a drink

506
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,560
That

507
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,230
so I

508
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,470
To everyone

509
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,470

510
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,920
Good drink

511
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,000
Weiwei hasn't come yet

512
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,160
Not allowed to eat

513
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:47,950
Did you hear

514
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,800
When is she coming

515
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,680
This dish is cold

516
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,470
I'm almost starving to death

517
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,800
Wait a while

518
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,640
Wait a while and won't die

519
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,070
Coming soon

520
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,640
Weiwei builds such a big shop on her own

521
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,950
There must be more guests today

522
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,640
Closed late

523
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,280
or

524
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,920
I call her

525
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,310
Good to make a call

526
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,190
Deputy Bureau

527
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,590
I come today

528
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,590
I want to ask you for news

529
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,710
After your bureau goes to the commercial store to sample

530
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,230
How long will it take to know the result?

531
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,680
if

532
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,160
Really detected something

533
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,830
What will happen

534
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:21,920
Miss Tang

535
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,710
Your shop is

536
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
It's a dessert shop

537
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,310
Call

538
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,280
Miss Tang

539
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,110
What about us today

540
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,280
It's a private party

541
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,470
So about the shop

542
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,350
Just follow the process

543
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,000
You misunderstood

544
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,880
I didn't want you to help

545
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,280
It's just something happened in the store

546
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,310
I

547
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,000
I don't know what the process is inside

548
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,280
So I don't have any points in my heart

549
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:43,830
Just want

550
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,280
Consult with you

551
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,190
husband

552
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,470
You say our old classmates

553
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,680
Rare to see once

554
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,280
This hasn't been renewed yet

555
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,400
Good for you

556
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,520
Talking about official business again

557
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,070
Wei Wei

558
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,880
Let's ignore him

559
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,430
Come

560
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,110
Let's do one

561
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,110
I really can't drink

562
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,000
Xiao Yin

563
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,950
I really have a business deal today

564
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,310
I don't care about your business and crooked things

565
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,800
I only know

566
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,310
I want to accompany my old classmate

567
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,160
You two drink first

568
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,920
Don't let him drink if you can't drink it

569
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,070
Miss Tang

570
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,160
From sampling to results in our bureau

571
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,000
It takes about three working days

572
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,350
If there is a problem

573
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,070
That

574
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,000
husband

575
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,640
Didn't you say it yourself

576
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,000
Let's not talk about official business at private gatherings

577
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,280
Don't slap yourself in the face

578
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,160
Lai Weiwei

579
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,760
Let's drink one

580
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,760
Come come come come come

581
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,950
Call us back when you heard

582
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,590
Pico phone keeps not answering

583
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
Will something happen to her

584
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:58,800
I gonna go see

585
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,950
What's that birthday

586
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,830
Then let's eat or not

587
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,070
Yes

588
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,000
I think this is also good

589
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,760
Hey brother

590
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,000
People found

591
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,040
At Wangjiang Road Clubhouse

592
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,190
good

593
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,350
Look how good you sing

594
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,760
right

595
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,880
that

596
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,040
I'll leave first

597
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,680
Why are you leaving so soon?

598
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,040
I still have something

599
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,160
Then I won't send you off

600
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,680
Slow down

601
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:04,950
Bye-Bye

602
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,920
be careful

603
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,040
Bye-Bye

604
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:07,640
Bye-Bye

605
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,190
Miss Tang

606
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,680
thanks

607
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,560
slight

608
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,110
Miss Tang

609
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:25,880
you

610
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,560
do you know it

611
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,520
I am her husband

612
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,830
thanks

613
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,520
pain

614
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,280
What happened to you

615
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,920
What's wrong with me

616
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
What did you do tonight

617
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,040
you

618
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,590
Would rather go and drink with those people

619
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,000
Don't want to come to me

620
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,950
I'm afraid what day is today

621
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,710
You forgot all about it

622
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,560
I know today is your birthday

623
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,880
Then you know that I am for my birthday

624
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,920
How many days have been set up

625
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,760
You know how many times i got the process right

626
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,430
I called everyone

627
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,880
Just to be fair and honest

628
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,760
Stand in front of you

629
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,560
Fend off all the rumors for you

630
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,640
But the result

631
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,590
Six o'clock

632
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,760
Seven o'clock

633
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:24,760
Eight o'clock

634
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,640
Nine o'clock

635
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,110
It's twelve o'clock, Tang Weiwei

636
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,800
No answer to the phone, no reply

637
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,230
I almost thought you had an accident

638
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,800
I almost called the police, you know

639
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,830
I really have business

640
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,190
Your business is for

641
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,160
Drink with those people

642
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,000
Lin Ran, can you tell me something

643
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,590
I don't make sense

644
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,920
I don't make sense

645
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,400
Should make you drunk to death outside

646
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
do you know

647
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,560
You are not calm at all now

648
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,760
I don't want to talk to you

649
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
We will talk tomorrow

650
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,230
Your birthday present

651
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,350
today

652
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,040
Food poisoning among customers of dessert shop

653
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,430
I'll go to Xiao Yin's husband for help

654
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,350
Phone muted

655
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,160
I didn't hear

656
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,800
Sorry

657
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,590
Is it okay?

658
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,070
Then why didn't you say it earlier

659
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,640
Did you let me talk

660
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,160
Are you satisfied with the trouble now?

661
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,430
Let's calm down

662
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,230
whats the matter

663
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,400
Talk tomorrow

664
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,280
I'm tired

665
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,430
I'm going back

666
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,230
I painted it with the paint you gave

667
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,470
What you said

668
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,910
Can it be recovered?

669
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,470
I don't want to calm each other down

670
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
I just want to be passionate

671
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,320
All boiling for you

672
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,360
Sorry

673
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
I misunderstood

674
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,040
Hello students

678
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,320

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,150
Thanks classmates

689
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:32,950

You don't think

695
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,320
I did it for you

696
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,870
In short

697
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,670
This time

698
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,190

00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
Closed so early

709
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,670
Is it because there is a date

710
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
Need to prepare in advance

711
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,190
Mr. Lin

712
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,360
Please sit down

713
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,800
Wait

714
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,840
okay

715
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,630
Well done

716
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,630
Nice to have you

717
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,280
I used to make her angry

718
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
Make me a cake

719
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,280
such a pity

720
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,080
I can't eat

721
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,430
real

722
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,190
rest assured

723
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,470
This is not punishment

724
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,280
I'm not angry either

725
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,430
How about it

726
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,630
Feel

727
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
Feel okay

728
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,910
This is a special sugar-free cake

729
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,630
It's a gift from me

730
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,360
make up

731
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,390
I missed your birthday for the first time

732
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,080
starting today

733
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,190
I won't treat you like a kid anymore

734
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,670
Will face up to the relationship between the two of us

735
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:46,760
after

736
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,040
I'm wrong

737
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,430
You can correct me too

738
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,600
You are wrong

739
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,910
I will correct you too

740
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,630
What about this cake

741
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,470
Is my sincerity
