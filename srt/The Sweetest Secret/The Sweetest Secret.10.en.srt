Why are you suddenly in school?

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,560
Did you miss me?

178
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,800
I didn't know where to go.

179
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,480
So, out of the habit, I came to school.

180

Wei Wei.

181
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,400
Are you unhappy?

182
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,560
No.

183
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,040
I'm just bored.

184
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,520
Bored?

185
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Why are you bored?

186
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,800
I feel

187
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,760
as if I'm the only one with free time.

Are you alone?

Both.

201
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,640
Indeed. Having a dessert

202
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,200
will release much dopamine.

203
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,160
It makes people happy.

However,

206
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,800
when the blood sugar drops,

207
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,160
dopamine becomes less intense.

208
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,880
One's mood returns to normal.

209
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,240
It can last

210
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,480
half an hour at most.

Actually,

I didn't really want to go
for postgraduate studies.

230

I just thought I should do it.

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,080
So, I did it.

232
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,400
However, when I did,

233
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,600
I had to face the reality.

Dong Zhe

Apart from studying,

there's no option for me.

00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,560
He's the culprit.

246

He doesn't even think he's wrong.

Moreover,

he should be the one that's
unhappy. He should be punished.

250

He should be struck by thunder.

251
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,360
You should overcome the tribulation

252

and become great.

The organiser is happy,

348
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,520
but do you think I have no idea?

349
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,480
These paintings

350
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,400
are not even a tenth of your ability.

351
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,680
You're shouldering

352
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,240
the responsibility of the school.

353
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
You must submit

354
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,600
works that can best
represent your ability.

355
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,440
I bought supper for you on the way.

356
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:32,960
Thanks.

357
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,760
You're reliable as usual.

358
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,600
It's just two paintings.

359
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,120
Why are you still drawing?

360
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,080
The head didn't rush you.

361
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,560
What to do?

362
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,080
I have to make time

363
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,000
to date my girlfriend.

364
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,120
By the way,

365
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,040
since you're here,

366
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,720
take a look.

367
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,520
I pick these spots for a date.

368
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,160
Please tell me which is the most suitable.

369
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,800
Dating spots?

370
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,120
What about this?

371
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,200
[Watch a play at a theatre.]

372
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,200
[Visit IKEA.]

373
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,080
Not bad.

374
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,560
I'll pick this then.

375
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,600
You want to go on a date, right?

376
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,320
I'll bring you on a date.

377
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,120
You'll surely be surprised.

378
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,040
Come on.

379
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,040
Eight.

380
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,000
Nine.

381
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,720
Ten.

382
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,160
What are you doing?

383
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,680
