1
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,590
slight

2
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,870
Why are you breaking up with me

3
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,360
Don't we want to be good?

4
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,950
You are trying to play a truth or dare with Li

5
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,509
Yes or no

6
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,039
slight

7
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,400
Can you help me tell her

8
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,120
There is really nothing between the two of us

9
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,509
what

10
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,630
Barriers between you

11
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,400
I

12
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,360
slight

13
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,000
Eat bowl of noodles

14
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,440
Come to eat

15
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,600
slight

16
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,270
Lin Ran's parents

17
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,520
Gave me a call today

18
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,800
When will they come back

19
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,390
them

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,880
I want Lin Ran to go abroad for treatment

21
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,720
Go abroad

22
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:39,960
right

23
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,320
They are abroad

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,440
Find special

25
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,360
Specialist in allergies

26
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,270
The hospital has been booked

27
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,110
Will pass soon

28
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,190
His disease is always a hidden danger

29
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,630
I want your cousin

30
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,960
Over there

31
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,160
Take care of him

32
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,750
Because he knows well abroad

33
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,750
But you have to take care of yourself

34
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,750
You have the strength to care about them

35
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,550
Right

36
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,320
I see

37
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,520
I take a call

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,800
Eat slowly

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,910
The patient's condition is now stable

40
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,670
Don't worry

41
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,360
Thank you

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,880
fine

43
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,800
Ji Han

44
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,000
How did you come

45
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,240
He is still sleeping

46
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,829
Lin Ranta

47
00:03:59,079 --> 00:03:59,600
What's wrong

48
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,520
He's okay

49
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,030
The condition is stable now

50
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,520
Do not worry

51
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,600
I'll go out first

52
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,630
Can you help me take a look

53
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,320
boss

54
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,480
You are wrong on this dessert

55
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,270
What I want is not matcha mille

56
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,000
immediately

57
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,670
I'll change it for you right away

58
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,160
boss

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,200
You are wrong on this dessert

60
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,320
I did not order the matcha mille

61
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,110
Sorry sorry

62
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,830
I will change it for you now

63
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,160
boss

64
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,230
Are you OK

65
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,510
I have something else

66
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,440
I'll go first

67
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,600
I don't want this either

68
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,440
I'm sorry

69
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,230
Weiwei what's wrong with you

70
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,230
It's okay

71
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,000
slight

72
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,270
I am coming

73
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,920
never mind

74
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,600
Sit and rest

75
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,550
I'll wipe it for you

76
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,480
It's okay

77
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,510
It's in the past

78
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:02,950
Hey

79
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,230
Hey

80
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,000
Wei Wei

81
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,880
The doctor came just now

82
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,270
Said Lin Ran's situation is stable now

83
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,110
no problem

84
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,510
You don't have to worry

85
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,600
Come and have a look

86
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,760
good

87
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,320
I am going now

88
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,160
What's wrong

89
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,600
Lin Ran is fine

90
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,720
I'm going to see Lin Ran

91
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,830
good

92
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,440
Why don't you go in

93
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,230
fine

94
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,160
I just look at it

95
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,200
He woke up anyway

96
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,350
Cry if you want

97
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,550
Don't hold back

98
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't get me wrong

99
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,230
I am here on behalf of the school

100
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,070
We misunderstood

101
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,350
What did you do with Lin Ran just now?

102
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,550
he

103
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,350
Are you ok

104
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,230
He's okay

105
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,320
Already done

106
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,840
Thank you for taking care of him

107
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,000
Wei Weijie

108
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,760
Why don't you go in and see him

109
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,400
I see

110
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,320
I i actually

111
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,880
I think you should be tired too

112
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,960
You go back and rest first

113
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
We go in

114
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,200
Lin Ran's business

115
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,520
What do you think

116
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,400
Think about

117
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,030
do you know

118
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,320
If now

119
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,200
I am twenty years old

120
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,550
I will hug him

121
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,470
Or marry him

122
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,960
But I am twenty-eight now

123
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,280
To maintain the relationship between the two of us

124
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,470
emotion

125
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,000
Just the blood of his boy

126
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,880
until one day

127
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,280
The trivialities of life

128
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,520
Polished up the enthusiasm

129
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,550
He will find

130
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,640
I am older than him

131
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,030
Maybe he will hate me then

132
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Hate me when he was young

133
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,350
Didn't stop this relationship

134
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,710
Let it happen like this

135
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,470
Think about it

136
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,080
I feel i'm by his side

137
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,520
Like a time bomb

138
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,280
Will explode at any time

139
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,960
slight

140
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,080
That cup of sugar water was just an accident

141
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,840
Don't think too much

142
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,710
All things happen

143
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,350
There must be a reason

144
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,520
Today's accident

145
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,670
Maybe it's a providence

146
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,710
I don't want to be his crocodile

147
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,350
I don't want him to sink deeper and deeper

148
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,790
slight

149
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,550
leave me

150
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,200
He has more choices

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,670
Every choice

152
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,280
May be better than now

153
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,320
I don't want to drag him down

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,110
No matter what

155
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,640
I will be by your side

156
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,440
You go first

157
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,670
I want to be alone

158
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,320
do not Cry

159
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,760
I'll go now

160
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,960
Wake up

161
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,960
Tang Weiwei

162
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,000
I thought you were gone

163
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,030
Rub my eyes

164
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,000
Uncle and aunt contacted a foreign hospital

165
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,520
They also take time off these days

166
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,840
They want

167
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,110
Let you check thoroughly

168
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,550
What's wrong with this

169
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,080
are you going

170
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,440
I went to the hospital and it was good

171
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,400
The doctors are also in contact

172
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,590
all of them

173
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,550
An expert who specializes in allergies

174
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,840
I'm asking if you are going

175
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,200
Uncle and aunt are very worried about you

176
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,520
this time

177
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,840
It was my fault

178
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,550
I'm asking you

179
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,350
You as a girlfriend

180
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,790
are you going

181
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,590
You let me go

182
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,670
You don't go and you chase me away

183
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,520
Lin Ran, calm down

184
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,960
Then answer me

185
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,440
Then look at me

186
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,670
Lin Ran

187
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,320
Uncle and aunt are very worried about you

188
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,960
They want you to treat the disease

189
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,880
I don't care what they think

190
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,790
I don't care what they say

191
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,320
I'm asking you

192
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,320
Are you going to drive me away

193
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,280
Tang Weiwei, let me tell you

194
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,440
This time i'm leaving

195
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,710
Won't come back again

196
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,880
It's good for us

197
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,000
Tang Weiwei, let me tell you

198
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,069
This time i'm leaving

199
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,560
I won't come back again

200
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,800
slight

201
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,430
Can you let it go

202
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,430
I have no idea

203
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,470
Maybe back then

204
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,430
Shouldn't be together

205
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,230
Now separately

206
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,830
Maybe it won't be that sad anymore

207
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,560
Can you really put down Lin Ran

208
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,560
I am so much older than him

209
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,560
If you know this paragraph

210
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,950
Is a wrong feeling

211
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,680
I still insist

212
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,160
What's the difference between this and lying to him

213
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,590
Jin Zichuan is right

214
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,000
Stop loss in time

215
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,560
Maybe it's the right choice

216
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,350
It's okay to put it down

217
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,880
Can't let go

218
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,000
Everything will pass

219
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,800
I am here

220
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,830
When he came to my house

221
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,880
I picked him up

222
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,070
Watch him leave now

223
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,560
It's a beginning and an end, right?

224
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,400
Let's go

225
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,560
thanks

226
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,430
Let's go

227
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:53,830
go

228
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,560
welcome

229
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,470
Hello sister

230
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,110
I want this

231
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:00,830
Swiss Snow

232
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,160
good

233
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,760
Lin Ran

234
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,800
elder sister

235
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,880
Excuse me

236
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,070
So thank you sister

237
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,520
Excuse me

238
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,160
Wei Weijie

239
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,430
Wei Weijie

240
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,800
Wei Weijie

241
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,590
What's wrong

242
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,520
The cake is baked

243
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:54,950
good

244
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,310
I'll take a look

245
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,680
Lin Ran, can't you stop being so naive

246
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,680
Where am i naive

247
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,640
Hurry back to school for me

248
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,110
do not want

249
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,190
I like that cat

250
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,040
Even if

251
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,040
It's just good on rainy days

252
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,190
I like you better

253
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,710
Even if

254
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,760
Just pretend to be a lifelong couple

255
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,800
Tang Weiwei

256
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,280
No matter what others think of you

257
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,350
I will always believe in you

258
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,160
Then my wish is

259
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,520
my goal

260
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,760
my life

261
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,230
All you

262
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,280
I can eat candy now

263
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,070
Can still eat sweet

264
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,920
We are all the way

265
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,710
Right

266
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,280
Even if you don't treat me like a boyfriend

267
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,710
Treat me like a brother

268
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,680
I don't want you to leave me

269
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,160
Tang Weiwei

270
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,400
I like you

271
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,350
The patient is in an emergency

272
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,040
Prepare for defibrillation

273
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:17,760
OK

274
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,350
The emotional arousal model includes three sub-systems

275
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,590
First

276
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,110
Comes from inputting information to the environment

277
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,230
Perceptual analysis

278
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,470
second

279
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,830
Is in long-term life experience

280
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,560
Reduced

281
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,950
Internal model of external influence

282
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,190
include

283
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,400
Past, present and expectations for the future

284
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,590
third

285
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,430
Perceptual analysis of reality

286
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,680
And based on past experience

287
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,590
Cognitive Processing Comparative System

288
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,710
Hey

289
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,230
Help me book the earliest air ticket to the U.S.

290
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,350
How are you

291
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,190
Master, turn around and go back

292
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,160
Wei Weijie

293
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,040
Today, a guest ordered small cakes

294
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,040
The dessert master can't mount that kind of flower

295
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,470
It's ok

296
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,000
Let me do it

297
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,160
Wei Weijie

298
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,070
Is this a new product you made

299
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,000
So beautiful

300
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,350
Sister is amazing

301
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,640
Can make something different every time

302
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,230
This is broken

303
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,350
Let's eat it ourselves

304
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,560
But I think the shape is very unique

305
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,230
Why don't we push new products

306
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,190
But this cake

307
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,070
Doesn't look too sweet

308
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,590
Can be frustrating

309
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,560
Since we are making mood cakes

310
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,830
That sad and depressed

311
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,000
It's also a kind of mood

312
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,400
Right

313
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,350
That

314
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,710
Just call it dark clouds

315
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Weiwei, let me tell you

316
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,230
You're on fire

317
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,680
Don't forget

318
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,830
The dessert shop has been three weeks in a row

319
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,160
Rushed to the city hot search

320
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,590
Your turnover

321
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,920
Add at least one zero at the end

322
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,160
The cover of our company is confirmed

323
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,470
Cover

324
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,190
Yes indeed

325
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,160
You are not here

326
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,830
There was a one two days ago

327
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,110
Dark Cloud Dessert

328
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,560
Is it hot overnight?

329
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,950
I'm in our company

330
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,520
Proposed a cover shot focusing on dessert shops

331
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,880
Our boss agreed

332
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,310
I'm shooting here in September

333
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,920
real or fake

334
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,070
Gold Ninety Silver Seal

335
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,880
Take a shot at the dessert shop

336
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Of course

337
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,310
With my push

338
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,710
Besides, your desserts are so hot here

339
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,110
Sure

340
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,830
Things are going well

341
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,110
I heard you are here

342
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,470
There are so many food bloggers

343
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,920
Often come to check in

344
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,230
If when it first opened,

345
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,070
Can be like now

346
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,520
Maybe there will be no later things

347
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,710
Don't think so much

348
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,640
correct

349
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,920
Our shooting is scheduled for next Saturday

350
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,520
Do you have any questions

351
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,560
Is there anything i need to cooperate

352
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,430
Nothing needed

353
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,560
What new product do you have

354
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,190
You want to tell me

355
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,110
Give me a menu

356
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,350
I look back

357
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,560
Must be passed on to the propaganda

358
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,430
The new product has not been developed yet

359
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,000
But you can try first

360
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,110
fine

361
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,920
You make everything delicious

362
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,070
Looks good

363
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,640
That

364
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,710
You are busy

365
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,310
I'm leaving now

366
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,190
Send me the menu

367
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,680
Mr. Jin

368
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,710
Why are you looking for me again

369
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:49,830
Busy working

370
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:51,920
Get in the car

371
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,950
Are you busy today

372
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,760
Your company has no business recently

373
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,800
thanks for your concern

374
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,950
Everything is ok in my company

375
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,590
no

376
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,590
You have been with me for three months

377
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,950
Just to add my WeChat back

378
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,830
Tang Weiwei's shop didn't sell

379
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,760
So you deleted my WeChat and the reason is not valid

380
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,880
What's wrong

381
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,040
I just want to delete

382
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,640
Do you have an opinion

383
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,430
You are not logical at all

384
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,280
are you available today

385
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,950
Let's eat together

386
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,040
what delicious food to eat

387
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,400
you will like it

388
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,680
For your positive sake

389
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,400
It's time

390
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:38,590
Let's go

391
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
This sweet

392
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,800
Still wrong

393
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,760
Do you want Lin Ran

394
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,070
you like him

395
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,560
But he

396
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,230
Satisfied

397
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,430
It's all you

398
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,560
Can't tolerate others

399
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,230
Even if the whole world talks about him

400
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,400
All said he was not good

401
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,230
You shouldn't believe him
