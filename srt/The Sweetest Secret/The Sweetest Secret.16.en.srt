00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,470
you have to ensure
the quality is good.

177
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,440
No problem.

178
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,030
OK.

179
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,320
Leave the rest to me.

180
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,960
It is a deal, Director.

181
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,400
You said so yourself.
It is a promise.

182

183
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,790
OK, OK!

184
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,350
I will get going, Director.

185
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,030
I have an exhibition to go to.

186
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,030
It is a deal!

187
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,200
Brother Ran, why
are you running away?

188
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,150
Lin Ran, don't run!

189
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,520
Why did you run away?

190
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,840
Did you sign the contract?

191
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,030
Yes.

192
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,440
I think.

193
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,710
Who are you asking?

194
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,110
You did not answer my
call or reply to my message.

195
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,400
What, are you Missing in Action?

196
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,230
There is a dog behind you.

197
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,640
Stop it already.

198
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,440
Why are you so persistent?

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I wordlessly refused,

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,880
you know?

201
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,400
Must I say it so you will believe?

202
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,910
Tell you what,

203
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,790
I am not selling it
anymore. Move aside.

204

You...

205
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,640
Hello, Brother.

206
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,200
I was tricked again.

207
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,000
This Lin Ran is too much.

208
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,470
He could not even
sign the contract.

209
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,400
What else can you do?

210
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,440

Thanks.

218
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,350
thank others nowadays?

219
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,200
So,

220
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,110
is there any other unusual
ways to say thank you?

221
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,080
Thanks for your help, Mr. Jin.

why don't we go for dinner

this evening?

OK.

to take things slowly?

if you don't return her card,

241
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,350
what happens if

242
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,440
she needs money?

243
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,670
What if she gets
tricked by others?

244
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,550
What if she goes astray?

245
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,910
Enough.

246
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,150
Seriously. Stop talking nonsense.

247
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,200
No, this won't do.

248
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,760
I have to...

249
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,840
I have to follow her just in case.

No, Wei Wei.

263
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,960
Isn't your card terminated?

264

going to bring Lin Ran.

you still have room for
improvement, got that?

297

Does not matter if
he goes to the gym or not.

terminate Wei Wei's card

335
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,350
because you don't want
her to open shop?

I happen to get her
the funds needed.

This CEO right here
provided the investment.

push the plot.

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,520
check out the photos.

521
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,560
OK, sure.

522
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:14,880
Very well.

523
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:15,640
All right.

524
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,070
You were following me
around the entire day.

525
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,950
If you have nothing better to do,

526
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,880
you can go to Wei Wei.

527
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,710
I don't know her well.

528
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,880
Her dessert shop for inspection.

529
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,160
Do you know of a saying,

530
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,760
"A guilty person usually
gives himself away"?

531
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,920
Excuse me. Excuse me.

532
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,280
Watch out!

533
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,640
Are you all right?

534
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,350
Thanks.

535
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:35,920
I am sorry.

536
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,710
Be careful, everyone.

537
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,640
Don't run into people.

538
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,560
Sure, Sister Xiang.

539
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,920
At work, Miss Li

540
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,160
is quite serious and responsible.

541
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,950
You have been monitoring all day.

542
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,590
So, you are here to
inspect work performance?

543
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,950
So?

544
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,470
How many marks are there?

545
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,950
Pass.

546
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,160
I am not talking about
your work scores.

547
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,070
I meant your total scores.

548
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:09,800
Miss Li,

549
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,640
why don't we try dating?

550
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,310
[Hello, Sister.]

551
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,590
Hello. What are you
doing right now?

552
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,160
[Rushing my assignments.]

553
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,950
[Backup No. 1]

554
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,830
[Sister, I really missed you.]

555
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,830
Then let's meet
at the usual place.

556
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,640
Bring your homework along.

557
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,830
I will help you with it.

558
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,560
Sure. Thanks, Sister Xiang.

559
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,950
See you tonight.

560
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Mr. Jin,

561
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,590
you see?

562
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,230
There are countless men
in the world.

563
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,520
I am not short of boyfriends,

564
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,350
nor am I interested

565
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,680
to accompany
my best friend's ex-suitor

566
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,920
to play some evaluation games.

567
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,400
Besides,

568
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
pardon me for saying this.

569
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,880
You are in love with the digits,

570
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,640
not me.

571
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,590
Has it begun?

572
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,880
Sister Xiang, it is ready.

573
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,000
How about lighting arrangement?

574
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,880
It is done.

575
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,520
It is ready?

576
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,040
Yes.

577
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,310
Let's begin.

578
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:58,710
OK.

579
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,400
Shop renovation

580
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,310
and the new product
trials are almost done.

581
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,470
What do you think?

582
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,520
It is a feeling

583
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,920
of longing.

584
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,640
Longing?

585
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,110
When I was little,

586
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,000
I had longed

587
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,760
for the future.

588
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,950
I remember when taking the
college entrance examination,

589
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,430
I even fantasized
about my perfect life.

590
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,710
But some time after,

591
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,070
the feeling was gone.

592
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,800
I have completely lost
confidence in myself.

593
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,710
So,

594
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:41,470
I decided to make a special promo.

595
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,470
The main tone is
confidence and anticipation.

596
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,640
That is because you don't know.

597
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,000
Someone

598
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,830
has been in love with you
since they were 15-years-old.

599
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,470
Furthermore,

600
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,190
you have always been the
person's subject of longing.

601
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,310
Oh, right.

602
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,520
I suddenly remembered.

603
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:06,920
About this...

604
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,190
Today,

605
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,430
there is an exhibition nearby.

606
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,040
My paintings happen
to be showcased there.

607
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,640
So, I am thinking

608
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,430
if you want to go take a look.

609
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,070
[Such fake acting.]

610
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,830
[You obviously chose this path.]

611
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,710
But I want to go back to
my shop to make desserts.

612
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,000
Go ahead.

613
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,640
But since it is
my boyfriend's painting,

614
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,710
I shall go and take a look.

615
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,000
Deal.

616
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,310
Make sure you keep your promise.

617
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,280
Let's go.

618
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,700
[Exhibition of Chinese and foreign art
paintings at Southeast Union University]

619
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,730
[Exhibition of Chinese and foreign art
paintings at Southeast Union University]

620
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,160
Ji Han, what are you doing here?

621
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,350
The rehearsal ended after you go.

622
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,000
I thought I will come and help.

623
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,880
OK.

624
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,350
Since you are here,

625
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,000
you can be our tour guide

626
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and introduce the place.

627
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,160
Sure.

628
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,800
Come in.

629
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,000
Let's go and take a look.

630
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,640
After you.

631
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,040
Sister Wei Wei, look.

632
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,190
Both are works by Lin Ran.

633
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,230
This one has many elements

634
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,230
but it has vibrant colours.

635
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:39,950
This

636
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,230
is the best painting
in our school.

637
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,070
It was once

638
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,430
sent to Europe to
participate in a competition

639
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,950
and won the Best Newcomer Award.

640
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,000
The teachers say

641
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,950
he has many inspirations

642
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,190
and will achieve much
more in the future.

643
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,190
This

644
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,430
is also Lin Ran's works.

645
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,920
It has a great sense of depth.

646
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,680
Doesn't it feel like

647
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,280
as if you are
part of the painting?

648
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,950
No, no.

649
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:07,160
I imitate the styles
of the masters.

650
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,110
I

651
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,190
cannot compare to them.

652
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,640
Stop.

653
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,040
Look at you.

654
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,470
So, smug after a few praises.

655
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,160
It can't be helped.

656
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,160
He is handsome and paints well.

657
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,230
That is his talent

658
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,590
though others may be envious.

659
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,070
Thanks so much.

660
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,310
I need to use the washroom.

661
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,070
You two go ahead and chat.

662
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,640
Lin Ran sure is popular
with the ladies.

663
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,310
Look,

664
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,000
the woman who just came

665
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,680
with such a sexy figure.

666
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,760
No wonder he ignored
Ji Han recently.

667
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,190
What did you just say?

668
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,680
Me?

669
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,640
I was saying the truth.

670
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,830
Lin Ran,

671
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,880
you are not yet an artist,

672
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,070
but you act like one.

673
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,920
What is that saying

674
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,680
which goes like,

675
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,560
girlfriends are the
source of inspiration.

676
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,760
So, that body

677
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,350
is directly related to
the quality of inspiration.

678
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,920
Say that again if you dare.

679
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,680
Forget it.

680
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,430
So what if I said that?

681
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,190
The exhibition is monitored.

682
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,920
Besides,

683
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,230
the investors
sent representatives.

684
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:13,680
Let it go.

685
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,950
Look,

686
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,230
The lover is defending
the girlfriend.

687
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,070
Lin Ran

688
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,310
did not take sides.

689
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,280
Well done.

690
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,280
You dare to hit me?

691
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,800
You want to fight?

692
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,280
Don't fight!

693
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,830
Don't fight!

694
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,590
Move aside!

695
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:40,070
Don't fight! Stop!

696
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,920
Don't fight! Stop!

697
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,800
Ji Han got disciplinary
actions because of you.

698
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,230
She was removed from the
exchange students program.

699
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,230
I will be responsible
for my own actions.

700
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,190
I am the cause of it

701
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,520
so I should be the one
who get disciplinary actions.

702
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,070
I want an exchange student's spot.

703
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,880
Just state the price.

704
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,280
I want information
about a certain woman.

705
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,190
No.

706
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,230
Tang Wei Wei is my girlfriend.

707
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,520
You overthink.

708
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,560
What I want is

709
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,350
Li Xiang's information.
