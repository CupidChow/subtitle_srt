Did your mother call you?

Yes, she did.

Don't say a word.

Judged by your mother's reaction,

What makes you think you can
get married if your parents aren't coming?

Then should I listen to them

174
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,470
Why did you suddenly change the model?

175
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,910
Why did you suddenly stop the shooting?

176
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,550
I'm in charge of the project,

177
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,790
but I was the last one
who found out about this.

178
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,590
Hey, there.

179
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,760
Long time no see.

180
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,640
Did you forget about us?

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,200
That night,

182
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,150
you and my cousin.

183
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,440
You woke up in the morning and...

184
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,280
Ms. Li.

185
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,790
I've reminded you.

186
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,280
We are the editor of a fashion magazine.

187
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,320
We need to be careful
about our private life.

188
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,280
It seems like

189
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,840
you didn't

190
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,150
bear my words in mind.

191
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,280
What do you mean?

192
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,550
Mr. Jin.

193
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,110
I'm sorry about that.

194
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,400
I know this is ridiculous.

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,790
Look at this.

196
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,230
Compare the covers of these two magazines.

197
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,150
Which one is better?

198
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,150
[Add! Like]

199
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,150
Where did you find this model?

200
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,470
A combination of
urban and rural flowers.

201
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,470
It's neither old fashioned nor modern.

202
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,200
What an odd aesthetic.

203
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,640
Of course, I'll choose this one.

204
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,960
Mysterious and sexy.

205
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,150
Hey.

206
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,640
Do you have the model's contact number?

207
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,400
What's going on here?

208
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,790
Mr. Jin, you're here.

209
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,910
Ms. Yang, what's wrong?

210
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,200
We have different opinions about
our cover model for the next issue.

211
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,790
So, I came to meet Ms. Li

212
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,960
to hold a meeting and discuss about it.

213
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,590
Let's do that now.

214
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,670
We are all ears.

215
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,790
Mr. Jin.

216
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,840
This way, please.

217
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,910
Your cousin gave me a cold-eyed stare.

218
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,910
He made me nervous.

219
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,080
Does he still hold a grudge against me

220
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,200
and try to strike back?

221
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,110
Don't worry.

222
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,110
He's busy deducting points.

223
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,550
Deducting points?

224
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,030
What does that mean?

225
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,000
[She put on too much makeup.]

226
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,110
[Deduct ten points.]

227
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,760
[The heels are too high.]

228
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,840
[Deduct ten points.]

229
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,520
[The skirt is too short.]

230
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,110
[Deduct ten points.]

231
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,110
The style of this model fits perfectly

232
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,030
with Xi Jia's motto,

233
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,440
which is innovative and advance.

234
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,230
It is the hottest
fashion trend of the moment.

235
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,880
However, we have sticked to

236
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,110
sweet style since the very beginning.

237
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,110
This is a sweet style as well.

238
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,080
Do you have stereotyped ideas

239
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,710
about sweet style?

240
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,470
For example,

241
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,960
a big waves hair?

242
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:46,910
Mr. Jin.

243
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,150
Do you have any suggestions

244
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,280
for this issue?

245
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,080
About this...

246
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,790
First of all,

247
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,790
a fast-selling makeup market

248
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,840
has not been defined.

249
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,760
The production line is ambiguous.

250
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,030
and will not be upgrade
in the near future.

251
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,320
The company won't get any profits.

252
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,550
The only publication company
who are willing to compromise

253
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,840
has such a low standard.

254
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,350
Do you still think we need to
discuss on this cooperation?

255
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,000
My time is precious.

256
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,080
So please excuse me.

257
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,760

258
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,960
This time, your record
is six seconds faster.

259
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,150
Are we going to practise again later?

260
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,080
So, are we still competing this year?

261
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,230
You have such a good record.

262
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,470
It will be such a waste
if you don't want to compete.

263
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,760
He's right.

will I get a monetary bonus?

274
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,030
Money? Well...

275
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,350
Never mind.

276
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,030

Yes.

Okay, you can continue.

287
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,710
Then,

288
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,960
she didn't dare to speak.

289
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,880
She walked right into her office
after the meeting.

290
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,230
The boss appoint me

291

It seems like

Mr. Jin was a great help to you.

No way.

296
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,760
He's a picky man.

297
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,200
He would never help me.

298
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,710
It's just that Ms. Yang's
taste is so ridiculous.

299
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,280
She was completely in a bind.

300
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,230
Besides, Jin Zi Chuan
didn't compliment me.

301
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,550
He just condemned the company.

302
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,880
I think you two are perfect together.

To be honest,

311
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,080
I think you should

312
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,670
think about it seriously.

313
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,200
You said you wanted to enjoy

314
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,670
and seek thrill in your life.

315

You said your hormones were raging.

Now...

317
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,520
It's still raging.

318
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,080
Think about it.

319
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,880
One of the strongest attractions

320
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,080
between a couple

321
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,350
is the pursuit of the whole self.

322
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,030
I think you've been using your emotions

323
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,640
to discover your true self.

324
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,030
Enough.

328
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,840
I don't need no man.

329
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,280
Fine.

330
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,880
Besides,

331
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,760
the theory of love is
different from the reality.

332
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,790
One more thing.

333
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,670
What's going on between you and Lin?

I think we're together now.

336
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,110
Really?

337
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,230
Then did you two

338
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,590
have done something together?

00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,110
Isn't she our senior in Psychology class?

340
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,880
I can't believe a pretty girl like her

341
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,910
would do something like that.

342
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,640
What do you know?

343
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,400
Pretty girls are the best liars.

344
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,150
You're right.

345
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,400
What are they talking about?

346
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,280
I think it's because of this.

347
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,480
[Plagiarism by a
Prospective Postgraduate Student]

348
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,150
Ji Han.

349
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,710
What's the matter?

350
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,400
Lin ran.

351
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,440
Did Wei Wei

352
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,840
face a problem in her studies?

353
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,080
What do you mean?

354
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,080
She seems to be accused of plagiarism

355
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,440
and snatched someone's spot.

356
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,350
That student is in
the lecturer office now.

357
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,640
Will everything be all right?

358
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,080
I don't know.

359
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,200
[Hello, the number you have dialled
is busy at the moment.]

360
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,640
I'll be on my way.

361
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,230
What did you say?

362
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,110
[You need to come now.]

363
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,470
[She's making a fuss
at the lecturer office.]

364
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,710
[They said if don't give
an explanation, you're done for good.]

365
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,590
What's the matter?

366
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,790
Something came up. I have to go.

367
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,150
Call me.

368
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,000
Tell me through the phone.

369
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,640
Okay. Goodbye.

370
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,520
She's really hard working.

371
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,829
Tell me.

372
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,760
Took advantage of someone's hard work,

373
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,040
plagiarised a paper,

374
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,069
and snatched one's spot
in the examination.

375
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,230
Will your school take action on all these?

376
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,589
Mr. Dong.

377
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,680
I think there has been
some misunderstanding here.

378
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:23,829
I don't buy that.

379
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,520
I would say

380
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,310
Tang Wei Wei has violated ethics.

381
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,590
Worst of all,

382
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,880
she fabricated the academic.

383
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,710
Do you think this kind of person

384
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,760
is qualified to get a PhD?

385
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

386
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,520
Young man.

387
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,230
Who do you think you are?

388
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,590
Just mind your own business.

389
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,280
Go on.

390
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,710
Lin Ran.

391
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,710
Tell them all
the nasty things Wei Wei did.

392
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,190
Let everyone know

393
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,110
that this pretty girl

394
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,000
is cunning.

395
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,830
I have heard about it.

396
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,350
So can you please ask
the irrelevant students to leave first?

397
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,310
Students, go back to your class.

398
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,350
Stop looking.

399
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,920
Go.

400
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,400
This young man here

401
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,430
is my boyfriend.

402
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,000
He has the right to defend my name.

403
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,640
So please show some respect.

404
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,470
Lin Ran.

405
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,190
You should go back.

406
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,590
Please.

407
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,680
Listen to me.

408
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,560
I'll wait outside.

409
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,800
You're really something, Tang Wei Wei.

410
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,520
I can't believe you're so flirty.

411
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,040
Since you're madly in love,

412
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,350
then why did you go to
the blind date in the first place?

413
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,070
You're filthy.

414
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,640
Dong Zhe

415
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,920
How should we settle this?

416
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,310
Are you the one who reported me

417
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,710
for plagiarising your paper?

418
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,230
Yes, it's me.

419
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,070
I chose my topic

420
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,430
after I consulted with the professor.

421
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,640
As far as I know,

422
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,230
of all the psychology students,

423
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,230
I was the only one who chose this topic.

424
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,000
I changed my topic later,

425
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,560
but I haven't told my mentor.

426
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,070
Don't waste your time
telling her all that.

427
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,350
She revised her thesis

428
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,430
long before you.

429
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,760
We have proof.

430
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,040
Mr. Dong.

431
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,280
Why didn't I know that

432
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,830
you have a sister?

433
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,710
Moreover, she's also
studying PhD in Psychology

434
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,000
at this university.

435
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,070
We don't keep in touch very often.

436
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,640
In most cases, individuals with
sub-optimal health status

437
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,560
have symptoms like

438
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,640
outbursts of emotions,

439
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,560
low spirits,

440
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,310
and lose one's concentration.

441
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,920
Can't you remember it?

442
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,710
All right then.

443
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,920
Let's talk about

444
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,520
three characteristics of loneliness.

445
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,800
It's because of
the lack of social interaction...

446
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,430
Are you still can't remember it?

447
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,230
I remember

448
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,000
because I stayed up all night

449
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,520
to amend it.

450
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,710
Did you say I plagiarise your paper?

451
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,520
Well, then show me your evidence.

452
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,590
Postgraduate student of
Psychology Department

453
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,920
at Union University, Tang Wei Wei

454
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,400
broke the academic ethics.

455
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,640
However, the school decided to
turn a blind eye on this matter.

456
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,950
She infringed her fellow student's rights,

457
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,830
and involved in a wild relationship.

458
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,880
I'm here today to ask for an explanation.

459
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,950
Or else,

460
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,230
I'm going to expose you all

461
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,310
to the media.

462
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,760
Let's see if you still have
that smug look on your face.

463
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,190
Wei Wei.

464
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,230
I know you tried hard
to gain a spot in the exam.

465
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,560
And I know there was an opening spot.

466
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,880
Still, I put a lot of effort

467
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,470
into my thesis.

468
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,680
Please return it to me.

469
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,640
Stop recording.

470
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,470
Mr. Dong.

471
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,950
Stop recording.

472
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,920
Since you wrote the draft

473
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,160
long before Tang Wei Wei,

474
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,430
we will allow your cousin

475
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,680
to continue her postgraduate studies.

476
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,640
Principal.

477
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,110
Also,

478
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,310
I will amend the list tomorrow.

479
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,710
Principal.

480
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,470
Tang Wei Wei.

481
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,880
What's the use of studying hard?

482
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,680
You can't even prove yourself innocent.

483
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,230
However, you have another option.

484
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,160
Beg me.

485
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,920
Truth will speak for itself.

486
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,800
I can't accept this!

487
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,760
I'll wait for you to come and beg me.

488
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,000
Let's go.

489
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,880
Wei Wei.

490
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,230
What's the matter?

491
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,400
Leave me alone.

492
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,070
Tang Wei Wei.

493
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,760
When I was young, I saw a cat

494
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,160
in front of the house.

495
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,880
It always went to the hallway

496
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,230
to avoid rain.

497
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,350
I fed it every day, but it hissed at me.

498
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,070
Uncle Tang asked me to give up.

499
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,190
However, I didn't believe it.

500
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,430
I think

501
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,310
if I didn't give up

502
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,310
and kept feeding the cat,

503
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,230
someday it will get used to it.

504
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,950
At least

505
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,640
on a rainy day,

506
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,070
I could see it

507
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,430
and took care of it.

508
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,230
I believed

509
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,160
it needed a company.

510
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,310
Just like us.

511
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,590
Tang Wei Wei.

512
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,590
No matter what other people think of you,

513
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,710
I'll always trust you

514
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,800
and support you.

515
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,520
We face this world together.

516
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,880
Lin Ran.

517
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,520
I didn't plagiarise.

518
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,280
I didn't take shortcuts

519
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,040
The school has disqualified me
from the examination.

520
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,470
I worked so hard

521
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,880
I even lied to my father
that I was pregnant.

522
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,160
I don't know how to face my father.

523
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,230
I don't want to go home.

524
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,470
The first draft of a thesis?

525
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,680
I don't think anyone
would hand write the draft.

526
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,880
Perhaps she wrote it on the computer.

527
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,950
This could be cybertheft.

528
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,160
This threatening email

529
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,190
was indeed from Dong Zhe.

530
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,230
I've checked the IP address.

531
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,400
However, this can only prove that

532
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,470
Dong Zhe did attempt to
blackmail Tang Wei Wei.

533
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,640
The rest

534
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,640
are on your own.
