1
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,590
leave me

2
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,440
He has more choices

3
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,720
Every choice

4
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,479
May be better than now

5
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,270
I don't care what they think

6
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,080
I don't care what they say

7
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,800
I'm asking you

8
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,950
Are you going to drive me away

9
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,800
Tang Weiwei, let me tell you

10
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,270
This time i'm leaving

11
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,680
I won't come back again

12
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,550
Apart from eating

13
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,080
Are there no other activities?

14
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,520
You don't like this place

15
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,670
Delicious is delicious

16
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,550
But you count

17
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,520
These three months

18
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,030
How many meals did you take me to

19
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,030
Restaurants all over the city have been eaten

20
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,670
Eight catties

21
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,270
I have gained eight pounds

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,630
Don't want to eat

23
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,110
Then we can make an appointment for a swim next time

24
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,829
Fitness appointment

25
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:26,880
About playing golf

26
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,000
never mind

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,270
I can still gain another two catties

28
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,880
I'm in the game

29
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,520
My boyfriend in online dating for half a year

30
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,110
Turned out to be a girl

31
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,960
I'm so angry I'm so angry

32
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,240
I was about to get married with my boyfriend

33
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,240
But his mother made a lot of demands

34
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,520
I don't think I am worthy of her son

35
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,079
Seven years of affection

36
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,520
What should i do

37
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,600
My girlfriend said

38
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,390
She is with me

39
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,630
Just because i look good

40
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,270
Do you want to break up

41
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,440
Online etc.

42
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,360
This banquet

43
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,270
Can be said to be our school

44
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,520
One of the most important activities

45
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,550
I never thought about it before

46
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,720
Dessert sponsor

47
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,550
this time

48
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,030
If it weren't for Lin Ran

49
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,440
Stayed up a few nights

50
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,320
Drew three exhibited works

51
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,160
The school leaders would not agree

52
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,110
This time

53
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,030
governmental support

54
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,750
Media from all over the city will come

55
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,880
For you

56
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,440
Is a good opportunity

57
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,670
Hold on

58
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,830
Lin Ran

59
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,390
This kid is nice

60
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,000
Amazing talent

61
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,950
When I first enrolled

62
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,880
I just fell in love with him

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,550
he

64
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,270
Really talented

65
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,480
Good talent

66
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,440
But it's useless

67
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,950
Lin Ran, this kid

68
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,270
A day of fun

69
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,159
I don't know how to think about my future

70
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,440
This is about to graduate

71
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,600
Have to plan for the future

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,110
You parents

73
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,000
Shangshangxin

74
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,640
This is

75
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,440
All the information about this adult banquet

76
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,920
Take a good look

77
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,830
Thank you director

78
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,160
Wei Weijie

79
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,440
have not seen you for a long time

80
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,110
have not seen you for a long time

81
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,720
Sister recently

82
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,040
Did you contact Lin Ran?

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,480
no

84
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,110
When he first went abroad

85
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,550
Because of the unaccustomed

86
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,230
Very sick

87
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,270
His parents don't have time

88
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,720
Pack things by yourself

89
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,070
Admitted to the hospital

90
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,830
Actually, doctors at home and abroad

91
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,160
The check results are the same

92
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,830
Said he has no problems with his health indicators

93
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,270
The doctor said

94
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,510
Is a mental disorder

95
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,720
Advise him to treat conservatively

96
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,920
But he doesn't listen

97
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,440
We all can't understand

98
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,830
Actually not eating sugar is for life

99
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,440
No effect

100
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,760
We don't know why

101
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,880
He has to eat candy

102
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,110
Maybe life is too bitter

103
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,320
I want to taste what it tastes like sweet

104
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,950
Actually I always feel

105
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,600
He shouldn't suffer

106
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,760
He to the whole world

107
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,790
All with kindness

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,880
Wei Weijie

109
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,600
look

110
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,920
just in front

111
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,320
This is i just enrolled

112
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,760
Know where Lin Ran

113
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,110
It was a coincidence at that time

114
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,720
I can't find where my classroom is

115
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,550
But remembered Lin Ran's name

116
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,760
Sister, what's wrong with you

117
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,830
It's okay to throw up and throw up

118
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,600
All right

119
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,270
Sister, what's wrong with you

120
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,670
Little sister

121
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,270
Let me see

122
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,510
never mind

123
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,159
Scared sister to death

124
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,670
The child is too young

125
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,000
Let her walk and don't eat

126
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,390
Trachea is too short

127
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,070
do you know

128
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,000
Go

129
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,350
Ball ball

130
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,440
Same classmate

131
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,110
thank you

132
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,200
You're welcome

133
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,440
Bye-Bye

134
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,390
elder sister

135
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,270
Actually that day

136
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,880
I only found out later

137
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,230
He doesn't eat sugar

138
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,350
He didn't reject me at the time

139
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,950
I should be afraid of embarrassment

140
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,000
actually

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,880
Lin Ran was pretty awkward at school

142
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,480
Just do what you want to do

143
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,760
others

144
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,830
No one cares

145
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,350
only you

146
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,230
Can make him intimidate

147
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,760
Tang Weiwei these three words

148
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,000
For Lin Ran

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,159
Like a curse

150
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,480
elder sister

151
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,440
I think

152
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,440
You should know

153
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,040
That day

154
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,110
I received a call from preschool that day

155
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,070
Said my sister is gone

156
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,070
I am very anxious

157
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,790
I just asked Lin Ran for help

158
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,670
He must not deliberately lie to you

159
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,040
He didn't mean to go cycling

160
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,480
That car is not his at all

161
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,510
It's cola

162
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,040
You always feel

163
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,160
Lin Ran is not growing up

164
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,950
That's because he wants to keep you

165
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,040
He cares about you

166
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,480
Lin Ran at school

167
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,670
He is loyal and enthusiastic

168
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,040
Stop talking

169
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,320
He's right

170
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,390
Sorry

171
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,270
I still have something

172
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,200
Wei Weijie

173
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,230
Sit down and take a rest

174
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,150
This summer

175
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,080
Air conditioning cold

176
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,910
thank you

177
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,350
look

178
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,320
not bad

179
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,880
let me tell you

180
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,590
elder sister

181
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,880
Do you want Lin Ran

182
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,960
I miss him a lot

183
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,550
you like him

184
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,520
But he

185
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,350
Full of satisfaction

186
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,520
It's all you

187
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
Can't tolerate others

188
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,470
elder sister

189
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Where's Lin Ran and I

190
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,200
Is a classmate of four years in university

191
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,030
Also the best comrade in arms

192
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,400
He will help me block all peach blossoms

193
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,640
I will help him refuse

194
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,150
All the girls he doesn't like

195
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,400
If there is really anything between us

196
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:03,840
Yes

197
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,150
Have me forever

198
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,880
Don't dare to deliver the sincerity

199
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,840
elder sister

200
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,960
Actually, I know what girls want

201
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,710
I also know

202
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,520
Your hesitation in this relationship

203
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,440
Lin Ranta

204
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,110
Both young and excellent

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,760
And a little bit of juvenile spirit

206
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,000
Many people will criticize him

207
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
But sister

208
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,640
Even if the whole world talks about him

209
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,880
All said he was not good

210
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,520
You shouldn't believe him

211
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,520
elder sister

212
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,960
Lin Ran, he's wholeheartedly

213
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,760
Hold a true heart in front of you

214
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,670
Can't you see anything

215
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,320
Ji Han

216
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,790
I know you this time

217
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,910
Come here deliberately

218
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,840
I also know your kindness

219
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,030
But Lin Ran and I have broken up

220
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,470
Still have a chance

221
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,470
there is none left

222
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,440
No chance

223
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,840
Sister you

224
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,790
slight

225
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,350
what happened to you

226
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,840
Li Xiang

227
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,640
You guys shoot

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,760
I won't be here anymore

229
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,960
elder sister

230
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,150
Why

231
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,080
You really figured it out

232
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,640
Weiwei, you're really okay

233
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,590
fine

234
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,790
slight

235
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,590
When did you come back

236
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,400
Just off the plane

237
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,280
Tang Weiwei

238
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,960
I know it was wrong now

239
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,470
When I can't bear it

240
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,320
Not by your side

241
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,840
Didn't share the sad things for you

242
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,550
Just take care of my own happiness, anger, sorrow and joy

243
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,840
Don't know your heart

244
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,470
Actually there are so many complicated things

245
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,080
I was really wrong

246
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,320
You can hit me and scold me

247
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,760
But can you

248
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,400
Don't drive me away

249
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,790
Don't don't want me

250
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,960
I didn't want you

251
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
You are still young

252
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,150
Feel two people together

253
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,880
You can spend the rest of your life together

254
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,280
But life is firewood, rice, oil and salt

255
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,590
There will always be the one who gets bored first

256
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,550
We will be better than ordinary couples

257
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,280
Usher in this day earlier

258
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,200
Because we are never equal

259
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,840
Maybe it's God's will

260
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,760
Are telling us

261
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,880
You shouldn't be tied to me

262
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,350
You can have a better choice

263
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,110
I don't want to wrong you

264
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,080
I am not wronged

265
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,470
I can give you a sense of security if you want

266
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,320
I want someone to shelter you from the wind and rain

267
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,470
I can do it too

268
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,280
What about sister and brother love?

269
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,550
except you

270
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,230
What is more important than you

271
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,200
Tang Weiwei

272
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,640
I really like you for a long, long time

273
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,470
Don't push me away, okay

274
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,280
good

275
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,520
slight

276
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,200
Which of these two do you think is good?

277
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,880
Dark bar

278
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,550
good

279
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,670
I'll try it

280
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,840
slight

281
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,640
What do you think of this one

282
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:20,760
slight

283
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,960
Look good or not

284
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,110
slight

285
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,640
What are you doing

286
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,760
Show Lin Ran

287
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,880
Old house on fire

288
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,520
Can't stand it

289
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,350
Say i am

290
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,080
You and Jin Zichuan

291
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,150
I heard

292
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,520
That dress is really good

293
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,880
looks nice

294
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,110
You keep picking

295
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,910
Lin Ran

296
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,320
Thank you Ji Han

297
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,040
Thank me

298
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,829
Thank me why

299
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,400
When abroad

300
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,800
If it wasn't for you to analyze it for me

301
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,109
Maybe I'm still in the shadow of broken love

302
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:11,880
Can't get out

303
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,109
If it wasn't for you to help me understand Tang Weiwei

304
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,829
Act for me

305
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,109
I haven't had the courage to come back

306
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,310
thank you

307
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,680
Suddenly become so polite

308
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,950
I'm not used to it

309
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,560
For you

310
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,400
Then go abroad

311
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,430
Should be used

312
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,000
Take it

313
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,560
It's hard for you to still think of me

314
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,000
Finally learned to be an individual

315
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,230
You mean

316
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,400
I didn't live a life before

317
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
What do you think

318
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,560
That line

319
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,760
I have to go first

320
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,190
The director wants me to sign the contract

321
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,110
I'm leaving

322
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:54,950
Lin Ran

323
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,760
What's wrong

324
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,830
I hope

325
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,590
You are always with the person you like

326
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,350
so

327
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,040
Even if I only be an ex-girlfriend for one day

328
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,920
You can rest assured

329
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,880
Row

330
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm leaving

331
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,230
The next three years

332
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,830
We hope your work gets better and better

333
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,760
What to paint for three years

334
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,560
Is my painting

335
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,830
They used it for three years

336
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,190
Then I hope my painting will be better and better

337
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,800
no problem

338
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,710
no problem

339
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,110
Bye-Bye

340
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,760
goodbye

341
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,400
Bye-Bye

342
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,230
Lin Ranna

343
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,920
You live up to the school's cultivation of you

344
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,400
Didn't live up to the teacher's expectations of you

345
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,950
teacher

346
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,520
Without your spur

347
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,590
There is no mine today

348
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,350
These three years

349
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,830
Are you brat

350
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,110
You have a fever today

351
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,110
Teacher, I'm serious

352
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,400
Good boy

353
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,760
Good job

354
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,590
Work hard

355
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,560
Yes

356
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,760
Go go go go

357
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,760
go with

358
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,830
OK, then I'm leaving now

359
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:49,800
Go

360
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,710
busy person

361
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,470
Finally back

362
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,070
Know you come back

363
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,110
Laid a new bedding for you

364
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,640
I'm sure to let you sleep until graduation

365
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,400
Over Europe

366
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,430
Signed a contract with me

367
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,160
If nothing unexpected

368
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,000
Will go for an internship this year

369
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,640
This is a good thing

370
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,310
this

371
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,040
For you

372
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,680
Lin Ran

373
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,470
What's wrong

374
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm not used to it because of you

375
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,310
What's not used to it

376
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:31,950
Let me tell you

377
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,190
I feel your warm welcome too

378
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,070
You talk

379
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,710
We are here

380
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,560
Lived for three years

381
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,070
Is there a day as clean as today

382
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,190
no

383
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,350
It's okay

384
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,710
Find out a lot before

385
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,190
Some gadgets before

386
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,400
Let me see

387
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,430
This is not when we took the exam

388
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,800
Did i give you a cheat sheet

389
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,190
Still keep it

390
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,880
Yes indeed

391
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,880
But I was caught by the invigilator

392
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,680
Didn't copy it at all

393
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,880
Yes

394
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,760
But I didn't give you out in the end

395
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,830
You dare to offer me

396
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,950
You are so righteous

397
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,040
Alright

398
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,110
Two big men

399
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,000
Have known each other for so many years

400
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,520
Don't give me a squeeze here

401
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,710
And me

402
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,560
Went on a date

403
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
You play by yourself

404
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,000
Bye-Bye

405
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:20,830
Bye-Bye

406
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,920
Burning brother

407
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,680
You just came back

408
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,070
Think you have changed a lot

409
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,830
I'm still a bit cautious

410
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,950
Speak like this

411
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,710
have to

412
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,590
That brother Ran who is more serious than friends is back

413
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,070
My heart

414
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,710
roll

415
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:39,920
Bye-Bye

416
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,560
Bye-Bye

417
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,710
Tang Weiwei

418
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
How do I feel that after returning home this time

419
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,760
Everything has changed

420
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,830
But nothing has changed

421
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,880
Have we become a little bit

422
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Rusty

423
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,350
Lin Ran, what's wrong with you

424
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,590
Shouldn't we be very passionate when we meet again after a long time?

425
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,000
But you don't stick to me at all

426
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
You said

427
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,800
Will it grow with age

428
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,160
Passion

429
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,310
Will slowly disappear

430
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,680
Lin Ran

431
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,560
I'm a fast runner

432
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,800
I pay more attention to life and reality

433
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,160
I don't have the time and energy to pay attention to emotions

434
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,800
Even if that emotion is my own

435
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,830
You don't want to break up again

436
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,310
Where did you want to go

437
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,470
I mean

438
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,760
If you are not even sure about yourself in the future

439
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,470
Then cherish every day

440
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,470
So what kind of future is certain

441
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,520
After the physiological needs are met

442
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
Safety requirements

443
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,920
It becomes the individual's first need

444
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,400
Psychologically speaking

445
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,710
Pursue a sense of security

446
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,830
Is an instinct to avoid danger

447
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,640
When we are dealing with things

448
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,560
Instinctively pursue

449
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,520
Controllability and certainty

450
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,640
If controllability is materialized in feelings

451
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,920
Maybe it can become a marriage

452
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,430
Tang Weiwei

453
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
If only married

454
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,230
To make you feel safe and at ease

455
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,190
Lin Ran

456
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,680
Rainbow

457
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,800
do you know

458
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,950
Someone said

459
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,040
I see a rainbow between lovers

460
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,710
It means forever

461
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,000
look

462
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,070
God is slapping you in the face

463
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,800
Let's get back together

464
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,040
Is it necessary to have a sense of ritual?

465
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,310
Do you have any gifts for me

466
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,680
No don't send

467
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,880
I heard that recently

468
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,040
Mood healing desserts are hot

469
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,950
It seems you made it for Li wanted

470
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,430
sister

471
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,000
I also want

472
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,070
How big is not ashamed

473
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,190
I'm not ashamed

474
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,070
Never ashamed of you

475
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,160
gone

476
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,560
Where to go

477
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:02,950
Go to see the sea

478
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,800
Where does this problem appear?

479
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,000
Wei Weijie

480
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,110
Rainbow is sold out again

481
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,040
Don't sell it if it's sold out

482
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,880
Sell out

483
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,520
Wei Weijie

484
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,350
what are you doing

485
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
Lin Ran

486
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,590
Clamoring for cake

487
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,070
I'll make a copy for him

488
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,830
By the way

489
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,710
Can you bring me a mold?

490
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,950
Lin Ran

491
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,880
let me tell you

492
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,760
I picked it for a long time

493
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,400
Selected this planning company

494
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,190
Their plan

495
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,710
All caused heated discussions on the Internet

496
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,160
Guaranteed not to bury your car yard

497
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,230
Let's go

498
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,000
We are satisfied

499
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,470
After the stadium infrastructure requirements

500
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,760
Also added

501
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,830
Fishing and horse riding adventure and other areas

502
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,070
Strive to build

503
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,000
Eating, drinking and having fun

504
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,560
High-end consumer entertainment venues

505
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,110
Can be described as complete

506
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,520
What is our position

507
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,920
What is the receiving crowd

508
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
This green area

509
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,760
Less than 50% of the total area

510
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,680
Will it lower the pitch of the pitch?

511
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,680
and

512
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,350
golf course

513
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,640
It was originally a high-end sports

514
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,040
But your configuration

515
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,920
But it's this low-end configuration

516
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,280
Does it look nondescript

517
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,920
Our view is beautiful

518
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,760
If the plan is implemented

519
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,560
We will be the only building complex in the city

520
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,230
Will definitely trigger a social trend

521
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:35,800
and

522
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,520
People-friendly route

523
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,470
Maybe it will open up more market opportunities

524
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,830
I don't want the scenery to be beautiful

525
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,920
I want to make a profit

526
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,160
I can't because of your sentence maybe

527
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,920
Just take a road that is completely opposite to the market

528
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,920
This is a business

529
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,680
Can't give Party B's plan to Party A

530
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,040
Lin Ran

531
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,190
I understand

532
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,160
This buddy belongs to you, talk to me about career

533
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,280
I talk to you about dreams

534
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,040
Still have to change

535
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,280
Huanuo's main focus is golf courses

536
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,680
The current plan is too even

537
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,520
The proportion of the stadium should also increase

538
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,560
But you ruined the planning theme like this

539
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,680
This is not just a place of consumption

540
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,950
Not just a stadium

541
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,230
What we want to build

542
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,560
Is an

543
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,560
Lin Ran

544
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,560
Finally started to rebuild

545
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,350
Your garage

546
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,310
Kind of twists and turns

547
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,830
Is our parking lot

548
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,470
Go

549
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,430
Watching TV

550
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,070
Yes

551
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,000
This male protagonist is too scared

552
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,590
I chased them for ten episodes and haven't chased them

553
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,880
waste

554
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,640
What a waste

555
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,350
Chasing a girl was mistaken for chasing a girlfriend

556
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,560
Sending a flower can still send the wrong variety

557
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,590
The funniest today

558
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,160
Third date

559
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,310
Also invite someone to eat

560
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,590
Big brother

561
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,640
You

562
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,070
Is the president of a multinational company

563
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,590
Or the chef of a chain restaurant

564
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,190
If this is me

565
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,040
I have long ago

566
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,000
What if it's you

567
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,230
Nothing

568
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,520
I don't watch

569
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,430
Boring

570
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,040
Look

571
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,190
I ask you

572
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,190
Why he can't catch it

573
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,640
possible

574
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,350
Not obvious enough

575
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,710
Not direct enough

576
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,160
Not enough impact

577
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,710
never mind

578
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,640
Don't watch

579
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,400
Really boring

580
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,000
Too scared

581
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,310
Lin Ran

582
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,760
I got the account book

583
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,830
Don't you want to use it

584
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,560
Why don't we make an appointment tomorrow

585
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,160
OK

586
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,640
Early tomorrow morning

587
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,070
I will give you a surprise

588
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,710
OK

589
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,760
I'll take the cake with me by the way

590
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,590
Are you going to sleep

591
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,520
I'll sing to you

592
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,760
I'm tired from work recently

593
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,280
Miss sister early

594
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,880
morning

595
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,710
Miss sister

596
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,310
morning

597
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,590
Miss sister

598
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,190
morning

599
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,000
Miss sister

600
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,190
what's up

601
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,950
It should be an elevator malfunction

602
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,640
Is anyone out there

603
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,430
Is there anyone out there?

604
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,680
Don't be nervous

605
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,470
It will be done in a while

606
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,680
Sorry

607
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,920
Our elevator has broken down

608
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,710
Maintenance has started

609
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,920
Please wait a moment

610
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,560
Can you let go

611
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,920
I have something to tell you

612
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,070
I am not a suitor of Weiwei

613
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,350
I am not familiar with her

614
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,590
What did you say

615
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,190
I'm not Tang Weiwei's suitor

616
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,560
Not your girlfriend's man

617
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,190
I like you

618
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,110
I want to pursue you

619
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,640
Life is a matter of life

620
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,040
You are sick, say these

621
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,000
Points will be deducted if you are not asked

622
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,800
You say again

623
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,830
Will fall

624
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
So what is your answer

625
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,040
We go out alive

626
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,230
I'll tell you when I get out alive

627
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,280
Will you promise me when you go out

628
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:23,760
Yeah

629
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,830
I promise you when I go out

630
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,110
Don't forget what you just said

631
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,070
Lin Ran

632
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,760
Tang Weiwei

633
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,430
you give me

634
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,470
Why

635
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,710
I am not awake today

636
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,190
You are cheating on marriage

637
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,040
Yeah, Tang Weiwei

638
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,230
I'm cheating on marriage

639
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,800
I'm not only going to lie to you today

640
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,070
I will lie to you tomorrow

641
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,310
Lie to you to stay with me

642
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,350
Lie to you love me

643
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,830
I'll lie to you to meet me again in the next half of my life

644
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,640
I have grown up

645
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,310
Weiwei followed me later

646
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,640
No one can bully her

647
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,160
My sister is married now

648
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,710
You still got involved

649
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,680
Do you want to ruin her happiness

650
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,160
I think you are less and less like your mother

651
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,160
My mother and I are originally different

652
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,470
I don't want to reproduce my mother's life
