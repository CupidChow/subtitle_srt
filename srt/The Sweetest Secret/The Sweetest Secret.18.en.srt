1
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,400
Tang Weiwei

2
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,800
share happiness

3
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,720
Happiness becomes double

4
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,550
Sharing sad

5
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,400
Sadness will be halved

6
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,800
You can tell me what's unhappy

7
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,509
If you mess up

8
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:35,360
Stuff all inside

9
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,870
That would feel very crowded

10
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,950
I want a woman's information

11
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:44,720
no

12
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,680
Tang Weiwei is my girlfriend

13
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,120
You think too much

14
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,830
I want the information from Li Xiang

15
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,630
Hanhan, are you too good-looking?

16
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,550
This skirt is absolutely perfect

17
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,120
Yan pressure

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,360
Absolutely

19
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,720
I will write a public tweet now

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You are too exaggerated

21
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,800
Month month

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,240
look

23
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,240
Good looking

24
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,830
Of course it looks good

25
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,320
And yours

26
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,880
My mine

27
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,190
This skirt is so pretty too

28
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,800
Go and change

29
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,470
forget it

30
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,670
go

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,320
Fast fast fast fast

32
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:51,600
This also looks good

33
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,110
I said you need to wear more skirts

34
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,160
It's a pity that this leg doesn't show up

35
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,470
Let me take a good look

36
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,630
What do you say

37
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,080
I wear this to school celebration

38
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,030
is it okay

39
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,600
of course

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,880
I bet with you

41
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Wear this

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,910
Surely many boys ask you for WeChat

43
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,440
But i guess

44
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,190
You are to show it to people you like

45
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,320
Month month

46
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,520
I can tell you

47
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,960
If you like someone, you must confess as soon as possible

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,550
Besides, we are all about to graduate

49
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,470
You can't be like me

50
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,720
The person I like again is still a mystery

51
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,030
Just a good classmate

52
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,270
Can't do this

53
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
Besides

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,390
School celebration

55
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,160
Normal people will definitely agree

56
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,470
do not worry

57
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,630
You look so good

58
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,470
God will take care of you

59
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,320
come on

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,390
I'll give you an assist at that time

61
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,800
Wish you a sweet love

62
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,520
Watch the excitement

63
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,630
Clothes for you two

64
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,630
Have you picked it yet?

65
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,670
The show starts at half past nine

66
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm waiting for you

67
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,070
Sorry it's closed today

68
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,270
This woman opens a shop

69
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,510
Just not great

70
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,790
Are you alright

71
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,480
Of course there is something

72
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,159
you know too

73
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,510
I'm in the company

74
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,440
Mainly responsible for the operation of the mall

75
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,390
A little shopkeeper like you

76
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,830
Not a grade

77
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,110
I condescend to come here today

78
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,790
Just because we met

79
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,480
I see your shop

80
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,510
Half dead

81
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,880
I can help you

82
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,040
are you crazy

83
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,000
Please leave

84
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,920
I can't speak more and more

85
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,440
I won't leave

86
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,350
Don't leave, right?

87
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,320
Hey

88
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,830
Manager Sun

89
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,440
What's the matter with the people in your property?

90
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,640
Why come to my shop to make trouble

91
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,040
And the person I'm meeting with isn't you?

92
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,480
Why does anyone come to my shop

93
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,480
Sit down if you want

94
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,230
Manager Sun will be here soon

95
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,040
and

96
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,230
Your internal affairs

97
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,880
You solve it internally

98
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,720
I have a camera in my store

99
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,640
If you want to do something

100
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,159
See you in court on Monday

101
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,640
Can't tell Tang Weiwei

102
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
Learned to complain

103
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,480
Let him come

104
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,720
You brother me

105
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,230
Wait here for him

106
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,480
Sit down if you want

107
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,159
I'll go if you don't go

108
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,320
Burning brother

109
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,390
Started the show

110
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,760
good

111
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,830
Lin Ran

112
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,390
Lin Ran

113
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,320
Thank you for being in the dean's office last year

114
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,350
Helped me pick up the book

115
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,790
I always wanted to say thank you to me

116
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,640
you are welcome

117
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,550
Lin Ran

118
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,110
Actually today is my birthday

119
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,320
I want to say

120
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,480
I like you

121
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,880
actually

122
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,510
Du Ruyue is telling me the truth and dare

123
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,880
Kisaragi

124
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
You are so honest

125
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,830
Everyone bullied you

126
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,600
Don't watch everyone

127
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,550
Are going to prepare for the show

128
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,350
Lin Ran

129
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,160
Lin Ran

130
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,480
Change place

131
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,550
never mind

132
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,790
Master, please hurry up

133
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,790
Dear alumni

134
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,760
Leaders

135
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,000
Fellow students

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,040
Hello everyone

137
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,720
Forever

138
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,070
Shengge high

139
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,440
Turmoil

140
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,000
What's wrong with Lin Ran

141
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,549
A group of talented people

142
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,549
Full of friends

143
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,440
fine

144
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,150
Winning friends like clouds

145
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,280
what happened to you

146
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,789
fine

147
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,470
I feel that the clothes are a bit loose

148
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,760
Please take care of the facade of our Academy of Fine Arts

149
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,840
Lin Ran Jihan brings you songs

150
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,790
Pink miss

151
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,110
Stay in this time and space

152
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,440
The dark clouds can't stop the throbbing

153
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,550
That smile

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,110
Is your face

155
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,470
Fill every night's dream

156
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Sweet memories about spring, summer and autumn and winter

157
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,110
Really good match

158
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,320
Fairy lovers

159
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,840
This should be our school

160
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,550
Accepted as the sweetest

161
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,470
They shouldn't be a couple, are they?

162
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,790
Although not public

163
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,280
But no one in the department knows

164
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,520
Ji Han is the main palace

165
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,320
Chasing Lin Ran's suitor

166
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,280
Lin Ran never speaks every time

167
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,350
If this is not true love

168
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,960
Then I don't believe in love anymore

169
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,110
Yes yes

170
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,000
They are the perfect match for the gods

171
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,880
My first couple of knocks three times

172
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,110
So top

173
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,320
What's wrong

174
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,320
Lin Ran

175
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,520
My clothes seem to be broken

176
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,200
Lin Ran

177
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,590
Is this a confession in disguise?

178
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,030
Sweet to death

179
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,200
I'm reluctant to let go after I get off the stage

180
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,230
Choosing a day is worse than hitting the sun

181
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,880
Why don't you make an official announcement today?

182
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,670
No need to hide it

183
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,440
Xiaotang

184
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,520
where have you been

185
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,350
Aunt

186
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,030
Why is my door locked?

187
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,880
The customer who just came out of your store

188
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,960
Seems to be hit by a car

189
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,000
The police are here

190
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,150
very messy

191
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,640
The property locked your door

192
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,440
Go to the property and ask

193
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,470
So thank you auntie

194
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,030
I'll go now

195
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,350
Lin Ran

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,590
Thank you just now

197
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,230
fine

198
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,080
what happened to you

199
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,640
What happened

200
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,710
I seemed to see Tang Weiwei on the stage just now

201
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,320
But she didn't come to me either

202
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,640
Never answer the phone

203
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,590
No information is returned

204
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,640
really weird

205
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,840
You said she was in the audience

206
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,110
Then she

207
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,840
Did she see a misunderstanding?

208
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:41,960
Misunderstand

209
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,470
She is angry

210
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,150
Jealous

211
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,590
Lin Ran

212
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,670
A girl really cares about you

213
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,230
She will definitely answer your call

214
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,000
Say again

215
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,760
Just like that situation

216
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,710
Normal people will be angry

217
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,880
Tang Weiwei is jealous

218
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,320
Hey

219
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,790
Why are you so happy

220
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,590
Tang is slightly jealous

221
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,280
He was jealous

222
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,030
strangeness

223
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,150
Dong Dongzhe

224
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,470
You guys know

225
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,000
Count as acquaintance

226
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,030
What's wrong

227
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,880
Is the car accident related to him?

228
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,230
The most difficult thing now is

229
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,880
The client is still in the hospital

230
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,030
The accident is not yet qualitative

231
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,440
Wait a moment

232
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,200
You're jealous, right

233
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,710
Wei Wei is jealous for me

234
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,000
I was just now

235
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,230
It's because Ji Han's clothes are out of order

236
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,670
That's why I hugged her

237
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,840
You little vinegar

238
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,960
It's really unreasonable to eat

239
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,030
but I like it

240
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,470
Are you jealous because you like me so much?

241
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,640
How can i coax you

242
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,230
buying clothes

243
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,550
Buy a skirt

244
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,550
watch

245
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,150
so

246
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,880
Simply

247
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,080
Marry me directly

248
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,710
Miss Tang, or

249
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,880
You should be busy

250
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,880
correct

251
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,760
Where is Manager Sun?

252
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,960
I'll go see him

253
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,230
correct

254
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,520
The cause of the accident is currently under investigation

255
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,790
Because it involves Miss Tang and your shop

256
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,910
So before the matter is clear,

257
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,520
Your shop

258
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,470
To temporarily suspend business

259
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,230
Please cooperate

260
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,200
thanks

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,640
You are welcome

262
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,000
Doctor

263
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,840
How is the patient

264
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,880
Patient now

265
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,280
The situation is not so optimistic

266
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,280
Mild stroke

267
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,640
Plus after the car accident

268
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,670
Emotional

269
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,640
It's hard to say when I will wake up

270
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,030
Thank you doctor

271
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,110
fine

272
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,640
Lin Ran

273
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,910
What are you looking for

274
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,080
Didn't you agree to come and pick a gift with me?

275
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,320
Pick a gift

276
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,440
Why am I still thinking

277
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,400
no

278
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,150
I'm picking you

279
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,640
You don't even know what people like

280
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,400
Licking his face and asking for marriage

281
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,200
simply

282
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,230
I took your ribs apart

283
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,280
Dog bone ring

284
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,110
You one

285
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:58,760
Me one

286
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,710
She one

287
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,590
no kidding

288
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,000
Help me think about what to do

289
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,710
What to choose

290
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,230
Why didn't I remember

291
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,430
Give a diamond ring

292
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,349
One forever

293
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,400
Lin Ran, where are you going

294
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,109
You two really want to see something

295
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,040
Look at the ring

296
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,470
What price do you want

297
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,640
The most expensive

298
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,520
You take a look at this

299
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,430
So rough

300
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,190
Generally men's rings are relatively simple

301
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,920
If you want other styles

302
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,230
We can customize it for you here

303
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,230
male

304
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,520
We want to see women's models

305
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,280
Yes indeed

306
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,310
Are you showing it to this gentleman?

307
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,800
Do you see me like a person of such a bad taste

308
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,280
Your kid is

309
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,190
If it's a lady

310
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,280
Please take a look at this

311
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,230
That's it

312
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,310
Could you please tell me your finger?

313
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,400
What refers to

314
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,590
you will not

315
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,880
I don't know Wei Wei's size, right?

316
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,880
what size

317
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,310
boss

318
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,310
These are broken

319
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,830
Throw it away

320
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,280
Finally got a little better

321
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,800
Closed again

322
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,430
Tang Weiwei

323
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,230
Are you crazy?

324
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,520
Don't we just have a little holiday

325
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,000
Are you looking for someone to blame me

326
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,310
One hundred thousand yuan

327
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,640
Have you seen one hundred thousand yuan

328
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,110
You quickly hand over the broken video to me

329
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,830
Or see you in the court

330
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,040
Mr. Dong

331
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,680
Are you having problems with the positioning of my store?

332
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,760
I am a dessert shop

333
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,470
Not a mental hospital

334
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,880
Can you come here every time

335
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,800
Are you crazy?

336
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,950
I have cultivation

337
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,920
I ignore you

338
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,430
But it doesn't mean I have it every time

339
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,310
Dong Zhe

340
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,400
Do you dare to come if you have the courage

341
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,350
Have you not been beaten enough?

342
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,760
You stop me

343
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,280
You are waiting for you

344
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,230
How about it

345
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,000
Did I come in time?

346
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,640
Lin Ran

347
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,000
What are you doing

348
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,400
I am not making trouble

349
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,400
I'm helping you

350
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,230
I do not need

351
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,280
You go to Ji Han

352
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:55,880
Tang Weiwei

353
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,830
can not tell

354
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,950
You are still a Shanxi little vinegar

355
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,190
Don't don't

356
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,560
so

357
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,230
I'll come tomorrow

358
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,950
Have a surprise

359
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:23,950
Aunt

360
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,350
I'll pour you some more water

361
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,400
slight

362
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,830
You are back

363
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,640
A guest at home came to see you

364
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,560
I'm going out to buy something

365
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,230
good

366
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,350
Auntie, you guys

367
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,310
Sit down and talk

368
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,590
Wei Wei

369
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,520
What about today

370
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,880
I'm taking my son

371
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,830
Apologize to you

372
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,230
mom

373
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,470
fine

374
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,470
My son has relied on him since he was young

375
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,880
Not easy

376
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,310
Not because of this

377
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,040
Ruin his future

378
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,160
mom

379
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,110
Aunt

380
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,280
If you are for

381
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,110
The accident comes

382
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,920
I can't help it

383
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,230
Then I can just say it

384
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,950
The waiter in your store said

385
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,070
Surveillance video can prove that I didn't push anyone

386
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,920
But you asked me to redeem one hundred thousand yuan

387
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,680
I don't have that much money

388
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,190
If you have to

389
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,800
I'll install it in installments

390
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,000
etc

391
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,760
My waiter

392
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,560
Take surveillance video

393
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,070
The surveillance in my store is not turned on at all

394
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,590
Aunt

395
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,350
Tomorrow you let Dong Zhe come to my store

396
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,430
If it was really made by my clerk

397
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,070
I will give you an explanation

398
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,430
Row

399
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,560
Then we won't bother

400
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,590
son

401
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,160
go home

402
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,710
I send you

403
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,110
I was just now

404
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,680
It's because Ji Han's clothes are out of order

405
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,830
That's why I hugged her

406
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,160
You little vinegar

407
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,230
It's really unreasonable to eat

408
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,800
The cause of the accident is currently under investigation

409
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,110
Because it involves Miss Tang and your shop

410
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,280
So before the matter is clear,

411
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,830
Your shop is temporarily closed

412
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,110
Please cooperate

413
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,280
The waiter in your store said

414
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,430
Surveillance video can prove that I didn't push anyone

415
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,070
But you asked me to redeem one hundred thousand yuan

416
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,310
I don't have that much money

417
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,350
If you have to

418
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,950
I'll install it in installments

419
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,430
stop

420
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,640
This person

421
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,560
She came to me yesterday

422
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,640
Open mouth is one hundred thousand

423
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,800
she

424
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,760
Indeed my employee

425
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,040
Let's take a look again

426
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
Did you see it

427
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,640
I said it wasn't me who pushed him

428
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,680
OK

429
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,680
You leave this to the property manager

430
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Should be fine

431
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,350
but

432
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,040
If you don't come to trouble

433
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,800
These things won't happen

434
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,430
How much to go to the hospital

435
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,400
Let's take a look

436
00:24:59,280 --> 00:24:59,880
alright

437
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,470
I'll go in a while

438
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,560
boss

439
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,160
no work today

440
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,470
What are you doing

441
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,070
I'm here to resign

442
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:30,230
People outside say that the business in the store is not good

443
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,160
Bad feng shui

444
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,230
That's why accidents happened one after another

445
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,880
And within two days

446
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,040
Won't be paid

447
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,710
So i thought

448
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,040
So you use monitoring

449
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,680
To corrupt others with 100,000 yuan

450
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,880
Whose store is as unlucky as yours?

451
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,560
There is no business but things happen every day

452
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,430
I knew this

453
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,680
I won't come at all

454
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,000
I wasted such a long time here

455
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Should I get some of the mental damage fee?

456
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,710
The conversation just now

457
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,110
I recorded it all

458
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,040
defamation

459
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,950
Add 100,000 yuan

460
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,830
Enough to sentence more than three years

461
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,560
Imprisonment for less than ten years

462
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,710
Hello

463
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,880
I'm here to specify the size of the ring last time

464
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,920
Lin's last name is 2073

465
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,310
Ok wait a moment

466
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,430
Lin Ran

467
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,710
Look, this ring matches my skin tone

468
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,520
Don't move

469
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,230
You leave it alone

470
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,040
I try one more

471
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,190
I can't take it off Lin Ran

472
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,760
I told you not to move

473
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,000
Hurry up and help

474
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,950
I can't take it down

475
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,760
let me see

476
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,310
Don't worry, let me take a look for you

477
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,310
relax

478
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:50,920
You tap

479
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:51,640
Don't worry

480
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:52,950
Let me take a look for you

481
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,830
Tap you tap

482
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,830

485
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,400

486
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,470
lighter

487
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,590
relax

488
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,880
Take it easy, the more you stretch it, the tighter it becomes

489
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,800
Relax

490
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,070
Don't work hard

491
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,880
take it easy

492
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,710

00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,430
You tap tap

502
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,110
Brother my hand

503
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,230
It hurts

504
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,920
Brother my hand

505
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,070
Lin Ran

506
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,430
How did you come

507
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,070
you

508
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,350
Think of a way

509
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,190
Do you want to cut it?

510
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:44,830
Can not do it

511
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,470
This is my hand, brother

512
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,520
No, this is the new model this year

513
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,470
Can't afford it

514
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,190
Cut open

515
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,040
I am a member customer of your store

516
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,950
I am responsible for the accident

517
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,190
sure

518
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
I told you not to do it

519
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,520
So many things

520
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,560
Net cause me trouble

521
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,400
Dare to dare in the future

522
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,230
say

523
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:05,760
what

524
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,110
Gone

525
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,560
What's wrong

526
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,950
The kindergarten teacher said my sister is gone

527
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:12,680
what to do

528
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,280
go

529
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,070
I take you to find someone

530
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,950
What about me

531
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,230
Come and go

532
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,880
Brother Ran bought the ring

533
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,920
Come, come, give me a car

534
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,680
Hey

535
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,230
What's the path behind the school

536
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,160
Come here right now

537
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,560
Whose store is as unlucky as yours?

538
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,000
There is no business but things happen every day

539
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,880
I knew this

540
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,190
I won't come at all

541
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,640
I wasted such a long time here

542
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,590
Should I get some of the mental damage fee?

543
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,950
I told you a long time ago

544
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,950
I won't let you open a shop

545
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,710
Did you listen to my advice?

546
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,070
Are you okay?

547
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,680
It's okay

548
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,880
I'll accompany you up to have a look

549
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,280
slight

550
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,310
Why are you breaking up with me

551
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,160
Aren't we good

552
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,190
Even if it's a death row prisoner

553
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,830
At least know what I did

554
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,950
I miss my boyfriend

555
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,830
Not a child living in an ivory tower

556
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,710
I don't want to be forever

557
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,070
Trapped in the fairy tale you weave
