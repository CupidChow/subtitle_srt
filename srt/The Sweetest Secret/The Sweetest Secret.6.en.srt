During university days, you have

Once you graduate,

149
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,880
you can become a lecturer.

150
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,080
Isn't that great?

151
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,710

You cannot go on like this anymore.

00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
you are proud,

156

but you cannot just do as you like.

If you don't want to major in painting,

it is fine.

159
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,960
Still, you have to at least
think what you want to do,

160
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,590
right?

161
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,550
You can't just fool
around all day, right?

162
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,400

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,320
your teachers, understand?

178
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,760
You can go now.

179
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,350
You are mine

180
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,030
after eating my homemade breakfast.

181
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,440
Childish.

182
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,030
[You are mine after eating
my homemade breakfast.]

183
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,200
Stop right there.

184
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,200
Father.

185
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,790
Whose luggage are these?

186
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,440
What do you think?

187
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,230
Did you tell Lin Ran

188
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,840
to move in?

189
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,450
He woke me up early in the morning.

190
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,710
I didn't even have a
good sleep last night.

191
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,670
He just threw things off
before going to school.

192
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,280
Seriously.

193
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,470
Did I ask Lin Ran to move in?

194
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,760
Why can't I remember?

195
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,840
What are you thinking?

196
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,400
Do you want people to gossip about us?

197
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,880
You just can't wait to
let him move in, can you?

198
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,280
Why not we decide on
the wedding date first?

199
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,280
Good thing I'm prepared.

200
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,150
Check this out.

201
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,590
Wei Wei.

202
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,550
Look. This is the wedding process.

203
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,280
Father.

204
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,400
I need to do some revisions to my study.

205
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,400
Let's talk about it next time.

206
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,760
Tang Wei Wei.

207
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,670
Let me tell you.

208
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,110
You can't avoid this forever.

209
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,030
Tang Wei Wei!

210
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,790
I'm going to give his father a call now.

211
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,320
He just left his son like this

212
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,640
to our family.

213
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,640
I can't believe him!

214
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,470
Hello.

215
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,520
Hello, Wei Wei.

216
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,520
Are you awake?

217
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,320
What happened last night was my fault.

218
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,710
I should have stopped you.

219
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,880
[I don't blame you.]

220
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,710
Who would have imagined

221
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,840
we would come across such people there?

222
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,080
Oh, right.

223
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,110
How were you last night?

224
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,910
How did you go back?

225
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,590
I...

226
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,230
[Which young man]

227
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,550
[made me sleep on a sofa?]

228
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,440
[Not me.]

229
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,200
[It was my cousin.]

230
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
[You were drunk last night.]

231
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,230
[My cousin sent you back.]

232
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,640
[Your cousin?]

233
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,760
[Who is your cousin?]

234
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,400
[Jin Zi Chuan.]

235
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,350
[You had too many drinks last night]

236
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,640
[and almost slept with him.]

237
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,960
[I wonder]

238
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,910
[how you opened his bedroom door.]

239
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,030
[Hey.]

240
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,280
[Help me thank your cousin.]

241
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,110
[I have to go to work.]

242
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,470
[So, I'll get going.]

243
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,550
[Goodbye.]

244
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,520
[Behave and stay at home, okay?]

245
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,670
[Take care!]

246
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,150
[Jin Zi Chuan?]

247
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,710
Why do I feel like

248
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,350
I missed a lot of things
after I got drunk?

249
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,760
I am glad you are fine.

250
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Let's thank him next time.

251
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,110
Ms. Yang.

252
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,320
Don't dismiss me.

253
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,640
Give me another chance.

254
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,880
Please.

255
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,230
I'll talk to you next time.

256
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,080
I need to get back to work.

257
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,960
I am hanging up.

258
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,080
Hurry up.

259
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,790
I won't pay you

260
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,080
if you keep wasting time.

261
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,110
Before you leave,

262
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,230
please hand in your resignation letter.

263
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,230
What is going on?

264
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,400
Your assistant is too incompetent.

265
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,910
I talked to the HR.

266
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,590
She will pack up and leave right away.

267
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,350
My assistant?

268
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,880
Who gives you the right to dismiss her?

269
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,550
I am the editor-in-chief.

270
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,790
Do you know what that means?

271
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,790
Not only is she your assistant,

272
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,280
she is also an employee of this company.

273
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,910
If I think she is
incompetent in her job,

274
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,280
I have the right to dismiss her.

275
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,320
Dismissal?

276
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,960
You follow her.

277
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,000
You follow her to HR department.

278
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,880
Let's see how much compensation
the company will pay you.

279
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,280
Thanks, Xiang.

280
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,150
You're welcome.

281
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,110
Get back to your work.

282
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,550
Don't move.

283
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,790
Your father is behind us.

284
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,000
We have to act properly.

285
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,350
Show him that we are lovey-dovey.

286
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,350
Then you do the dishes.

287
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,710
What's wrong?

288
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,550
I can do the dishes in the future.

289
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,790
Don't move.

290
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,640
Or else your father
will find out about us.

291
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,030
Just do the dishes, will you?

292
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,000
Stop cuddling.

293
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,150
Gosh.

294
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,640
Hello, Lin.

295
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,430
Yes, that is right.

296
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,829
Why are you blushing?

297
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,390
[Mother]

298
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,470
Hello.

299
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,590
[Hello, Xiao Ran.]

300
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,680
[I got a call from Uncle Tang.]

301
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,070
[Why didn't you tell us
about you and Wei Wei?]

302
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,310
We have lost contact

303
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,070
since you were busy with the project.

304
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,040
How am I supposed to tell you?

305
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,560
[Gosh.]

306
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,590
So

307
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,950
are you coming back?

308
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,000
[Before the research is concluded,]

309
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,040
[your father and I cannot leave.]

310
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,070
[We will discuss with Tang]

311
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,160
[whether you two can get married after]

312
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,560
[you graduate and Wei Wei
finish her postgraduate studies.]

313
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,520
No.

314
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,560
[I'm not saying you
two cannot get married.]

315
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,830
[Just wait a few more years.]

316
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,560
No!

317
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,280
I said no!

318
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,190
I don't want to wait anymore.

319
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,710
You kept telling me to wait.

320
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,000
The first orientation,

321
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,640
the first award ceremony,

322
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,560
and the first parent-teacher meeting.

323
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,590
I have been waiting for so long.

324
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,280
Now,

325
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,310
you even tell me
to wait to get married.

326
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,350
[Lin Ran.]

327
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:26,830
Mother.

328
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,160
Do you know what will I miss

329
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,560
if you keep telling me to wait?

330
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:31,920
My life.

331
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,310
Perhaps to you,

332
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,950
it is not as significant as the research.

333
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,880
Forget it. You don't have to come.

334
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:12,640
[Ran Ran.]

335
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,830
[I just got the news today.]

336
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,430
[I reported to
the organisation right away.]

337
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,560
[However, before
the research is concluded,]

338
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,040
[your father and I cannot leave.]

339
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,710
[So,]

340
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,160
[we will discuss with Tang]

[after you graduate]

[and Wei Wei finish
her postgraduate studies.]

344
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,710
What is wrong, Ran?

345
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,710
Are you in a bad mood?

346
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,400
Say,

347
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,830
how good would it be if all things

348
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,350
are as simple as racing.

349
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,470
Motorcycle racing is not simple.

350
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,280
The competition is coming.

351
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,920
So far, our contestants

352
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,160
have not been decided yet.

353
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:03,880
Ran.

354
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,160
Have you ever considered about it?

355
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,470
About what?

356
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,710
To participate in the competition
as a professional contestant.

357
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,680
I have seen the contestants in the team.

358
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,400
Their chances of winning are too small.

359
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,470
You are different, Ran.

360
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,640
If you join the competition,

361
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,590
I am sure you will win.

362
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,800
Winning a championship in this big event

363
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,160
might fetch our team

364
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,310
a few promising candidates.

365
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,590
Forget about it.

366
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,430
I am going home.

367
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,040
Okay.

368
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,040
[Be a professional contestant
is too risky.]

369
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,640
[I don't want]

370
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,110
[to be hunted down by Tang Wei Wei.]

371
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,590
What is with those dark circles?

372
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,000
I have been trying to
catch up on assignments.

373
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,680
Assignments?

374
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,430
I already submitted mine.

375
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,470
You haven't?

376
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,710
Could it be the one that Zhang said?

377
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,190
The large painting that needs to be
handed in by end of this semester?

378
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,000
I finished that long time ago.

379
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,070
I was worried about my score.

380
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,110
So, I drew two paintings.

381
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,590
Don't you usually score full marks?

382
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,680
Could it be...

383
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,710
Did you...

384
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,280
Did your marks get deducted after
you substituted me in the class?

385
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,350
That's not it.

386
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,310
I am just worried

387
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,470
that I did not score enough marks.

388
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,070
Okay.

389
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,160
Grab a drink, everyone.

390
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,710
Why didn't you buy one for yourself?

391
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,560
It is fine.

392
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,350
I don't need it.

393
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,400
Thanks.

394
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,190
You can have mine.

395
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,040
Lin Ran, what is wrong?

396
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,830
Do you have no inspiration?

397
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,800
I am still thinking.

398
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,040
Forget it. I'm going out
to find some inspiration.

399
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,680
Actually,

400
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,880
I have something to tell you.

401
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,070
If you want to marry Wei Wei,

402
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,310
you must first have the financial ability.

403
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
You are still studying.

404
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,400
What's your plan

405
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,520
after you graduate

406
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,470
and where are you going to work?

407
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,950
You need to have your own plans.

408
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,920
The theory of love is
different from reality.

409
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,350
One more thing.

410
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,230
What is going on between you and Lin Ran?

411
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,230
Tell me honestly.
