1
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,400
Tang Weiwei these three words

2
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,630
For Lin Ran

3
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,800
Like a curse

4
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,190
You always feel

5
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,720
Lin Ran is not growing up

6
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,360
that is because

7
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:35,590
He wants to keep you

8
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,550
He cares about you

9
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,400
Tang Weiwei

10
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,160
When I can't bear it

11
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,120
Not by your side

12
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,509
Didn't share the sad things for you

13
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,479
Just take care of my own happiness, anger, sorrow and joy

14
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,590
Don't know your heart

15
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,190
Actually there are so many complicated things

16
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,160
We all got the certificate

17
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,630
After that

18
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,080
That

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,030
I

20
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,830
I should call your brother

21
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,520
still is

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,270
Where to go

23
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,550
how

24
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,320
The scenes in these paintings

25
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,829
Looks so familiar

26
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,910
Because of these places

27
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,520
All the places we have been

28
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:37,800
And me

29
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,960
Just want to record them all

30
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,520
How is this studio

31
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,440
Good

32
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,270
I think

33
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,670
Bring us all the memories with you

34
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,320
All in my heart

35
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,440
Are you here

36
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,320
Confess the assets?

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,190
Post-marital assets

38
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,390
This is your place

39
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,790
Forbid you to play racing

40
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,159
You are playing the racing track

41
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,720
Let's go let's go see the next place

42
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,040
Next place

43
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,270
Waiting for the wedding news to be announced

44
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,200
You can prepare for the wedding

45
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,390
slight

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,350
Do you like Chinese or Western

47
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,230
wedding

48
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes indeed

49
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,000
I remember when you were young you seemed to say

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,160
Do you like that candy castle?

51
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,510
do not

52
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,670
Don't

53
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,790
We got married

54
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,270
I don't know how to tell my dad yet

55
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,790
If you don't want to say

56
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,830
I'm going to talk about it

57
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,070
Let's wait

58
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,040
My dad can't stand this kind of stimulation

59
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,640
I tell you this

60
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,070
I want you to know

61
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,640
I have grown up

62
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,000
It's not that little boy anymore

63
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,950
In the future

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,040
I can protect you

65
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,350
Support you

66
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,790
Be your support

67
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,760
Deputy Editor-in-Chief Li

68
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,670
Do you have anything to say

69
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,160
I haven't done it

70
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,110
The report letter is clearly written

71
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,480
And pictures of you, Jin Zichuan and Ning Meng

72
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,830
Conclusive evidence of bribery and malfeasance

73
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,830
You still have the face to quibble here

74
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,550
I really respect your mentality

75
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,230
Then let the police come to investigate

76
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,550
Also save me from pestering you here

77
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,200
You really don't take the company's reputation in your eyes

78
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,510
Did you go to the police station alone for you?

79
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,320
Laughed at by the entire industry

80
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,720
Li Xiang

81
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,159
I only give you half a day now

82
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,510
If you can't clear the suspicion

83
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,480
good

84
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,070
Take the blame and resign

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,640
good

86
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,480
Hello

87
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,920
The call you dialed is turned off

88
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,550
I will briefly say today

89
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,600
Your sales department

90
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,200
Some next work arrangements

91
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,270
Should increase efforts

92
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,640
Including contract review

93
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,110
Evaluation of the salesperson system

94
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,550
All aspects must be strengthened

95
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,070
good

96
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,510
So

97
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,070
Shut down

98
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,549
Let's continue the meeting now

99
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,030
Hello, Miss Ning

100
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,000
I am Li Xiang

101
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,200
Is it convenient to say a few words?

102
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,520
Deputy Director Li

103
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,280
It's okay to speak up

104
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,640
good

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,640
That's it

106
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,030
Last time I asked you to speak for Huanuo Company

107
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,230
this matter

108
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,960
I haven't had time to report to the company

109
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,910
The company has some guesses about me now

110
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,150
I hope you can help

111
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,110
Help me prove it

112
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,400
This is an internal matter of your company

113
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,710
It's not so good for me to participate, right?

114
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,790
Don't you know Mr. Jin well?

115
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,350
Just ask him for help

116
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,590
Then you are busy

117
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,440
I'm leaving now

118
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,030
Miss sister

119
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,840
Miss sister

120
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,110
Miss sister

121
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,910
Deputy Editor Li is back

122
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,670
how's it going

123
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,080
No need to install

124
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,960
Look at me sick

125
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,350
I'm not uncommon in this position

126
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,790
Waiting to receive my resignation letter

127
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:49,960
Li Xiang

128
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,200
Li Xiang

129
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,280
what do you mean

130
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,640
You are justified in accepting bribes and dereliction of duty, right?

131
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,640
What to look at

132
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,910
Are you okay?

133
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,550
Go with her if nothing happens

134
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,840
Sleepy

135
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,440
Then we go home

136
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,960
do not want

137
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,670
How many days have you not been back?

138
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,230
Tang Weiwei

139
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,400
Hide for a while

140
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,470
Can't hide

141
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,470
Isn't it all to blame you

142
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,440
I panic when I see my dad when I get home

143
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,710
To prevent the two of us from getting married

144
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,320
I still think about how to tell him before going back

145
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,030
Row

146
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,760
it's all my fault

147
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,200
I'll find a way for you

148
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,960
Hey

149
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,200
slight

150
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,230
I seem to be drinking too much

151
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,840
Where are you

152
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,550
You send me the location

153
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,470
I am coming to find you now

154
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,200
good

155
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,350
Who

156
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,150
Li Xiang

157
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I have to go and save her

158
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
Not allowed to go

159
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,960
But she seems to be drunk

160
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,550
Because i think

161
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,550
There is a person

162
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,350
More suitable than you

163
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,550
Who

164
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,440
Are you OK

165
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,520
fine

166
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,150
How did you come

167
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,910
I quit my job for you

168
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,280
Such a big favor

169
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,840
How do you pay it back

170
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,880
what

171
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,960
Don't drink, you drink too much

172
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,640
Here

173
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,200
Have you recently

174
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,960
Something unhappy happened

175
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,520
It's not because of that Miss Yang

176
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,440
Make things difficult for me over and over against me

177
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,640
Still slander me

178
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,440
I can only resign

179
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,080
Even if you encounter something unhappy,

180
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,880
You can't drink booze alone

181
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,350
What will be the difficulties in the future

182
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,550
I will accompany you to face it

183
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,790
How come Mr. Jin is free today?

184
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,590
Two days ago

185
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,790
I trust your deputy editor

186
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,550
Miss Li Xiangli

187
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,350
Do things

188
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,670
Unexpectedly, it hurt her to resign

189
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,640
Take a look

190
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,400
Editor-in-Chief Yang of your company

191
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,880
By taking bribes

192
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,590
Put inappropriate people in the magazine

193
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,000
In addition, by improper means

194
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,790
Slander and suppress colleagues

195
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,200
Bring one's own charge

196
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,590
On an innocent colleague

197
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,550
Deceive

198
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,670
Boss Chen

199
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,320
If you don't want these things to appear in the papers

200
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,030
I advise you to deal with it as soon as possible

201
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,440
This

202
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,840
It's our negligence

203
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,030
Mr. Jin

204
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,590
This thing

205
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,470
Strictly check

206
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,760
Just two days

207
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
I hope to see your results

208
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,840
And Li Xiang's reinstatement notice

209
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,550
I'm leaving now for nothing

210
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,640
uncle

211
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,710
You can

212
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,760
Your age

213
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,840
All indicators are normal

214
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,200
what

215
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,030
It's occasional irregular heartbeat

216
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,910
It is recommended to play less Glory games

217
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,440
Don't talk nonsense

218
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,350
Am I worried about your sister?

219
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
What do you think about your sister?

220
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,470
It's a dessert shop all day long

221
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,760
Dessert Shop

222
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,350
I am

223
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,790
It's really impossible to go on like this

224
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,880
Uncle, what do we think

225
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,520
Think of a way to persuade Weiwei

226
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,000
You have no chance for her to develop new goals

227
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,400
Let me find a way

228
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,200
Think of any way

229
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,880
I'm your uncle

230
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,840
I can do it

231
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,080
Do not worry

232
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,910
Why are we here

233
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
You'll know when you arrive

234
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,230
Mr. Jin

235
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,790
Miss sister

236
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,400
Mr. Jin

237
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,320
Big brother

238
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,640
What do you wanna do

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,960
Originally Miss Yang

240
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,230
I like to talk about the relationship between the two of us

241
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,550
We are going to

242
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,400
Miss sister Jin

243
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,670
Make sure that it matters

244
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,640
What does it matter

245
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,640
that is

246
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,200
Abnormal relationship

247
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,400
I guess this book should be

248
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,520
"Bingshan President Qiao Editor"

249
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,520
Hello miss yang

250
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,000
Hallucinations

251
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,590
Went to the wrong house

252
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,640
Editor Yang has resigned

253
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,840
Reason of time

254
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,400
The decoration here hasn't changed

255
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,000
Resigned

256
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,200
She took so hard to get me away

257
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,440
Actually resigned

258
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,200
Is she sick?

259
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,470
and

260
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,230
This office

261
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,400
It's yours from now on

262
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,030
Happiness comes too suddenly

263
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,840
I'm a little dizzy

264
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,069
so cute

265
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,950
Li Xiang

266
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,950
What's wrong

267
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,160
Do you want to be my girlfriend

268
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,280
You have followed me all the way

269
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,950
Don't you have anything to ask?

270
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,280
Given your status

271
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,590
Today

272
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,760
I don't deduct points

273
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,160
Then she doesn't need you to do other business

274
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,160
You refunded her a lot of the deposit

275
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,400
Otherwise your behavior

276
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,160
I just see how long your factory can last

277
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,640
I'm not talking about the score of your work

278
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,110
Is your total score

279
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,350
Let's try to socialize

280
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,230
what to do

281
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,190
I seem

282
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,520
Really like him

283
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,190
now that

284
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,710
So sincerely asking questions

285
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,950
so I

286
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,000
Try

287
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,070
You guys rush forward

288
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,680
Come and help me

289
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,760
You rush forward, you

290
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,000
Can you fight

291
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,350
Hurry up

292
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,000
Hurry up

293
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,560
quick

294
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,710
coming

295
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,160
Lie down

296
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,680
dad

297
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,760
Weiwei, you're here

298
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,230
Come

299
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,560
Come see your dad

300
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,470
My heart is uncomfortable

301
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,190
Are you alright dad

302
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:20,640
Wei Wei

303
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:21,920
Where's dad

304
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,800
Getting older

305
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,920
This heart

306
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,520
The spleen is not good at all

307
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,680
Uncle Li with you the other day

308
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,310
Play all night

309
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,400
I just feel sick

310
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,350
Wei Wei

311
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,560
I told you before

312
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,040
Your own path

313
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,310
You have to go by yourself

314
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,880
Look at dad

315
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,920
Poor health

316
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,040
hope you can

317
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,950
Have a good home

318
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,470
Weiwei has grown up too

319
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,470
what do you have

320
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,560
Just tell her

321
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,310
She won't blame you

322
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,800
Dad still hope you can

323
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,560
Go on blind date

324
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,350
Tang Weiwei

325
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,560
Just tell Uncle Tang

326
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,040
Didn't he keep urging you to get married?

327
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,880
After he knows it

328
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,920
Will be very pleasantly surprised

329
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,590
You don't have to go on a blind date anymore

330
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,110
And me

331
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,760
I can stand by your side

332
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,430
Are you sure it's a surprise, not a fright

333
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,760
My dad has a bad heart

334
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,350
Still find a right time

335
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,310
Talk to him again

336
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,560
Lin Ran

337
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,760
can not hear

338
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,430
Row

339
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,310
I take time off to accompany you today

340
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,470
You can go anywhere

341
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,280
To compensate you

342
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,280
Hello

343
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,710
wristband

344
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,280
thanks

345
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,920
Which is yours

346
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,560
this

347
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,520
Let's change clothes

348
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,430
thanks

349
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,830
Tang Weiwei

350
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,110
You and Lin Ran

351
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,760
Don't be unclear anymore

352
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,710
Leave quickly

353
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,640
Still against us

354
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,110
Row

355
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,400
Let you see

356
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,400
Official announcement

357
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,070
Please take care

358
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,880
no

359
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,760
I am no longer the me I was before

360
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,000
I shouldn't do such naive things anymore

361
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,190
Lin Ran, are you alright?

362
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,950
alright, alright

363
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,110
Soon

364
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,000
good

365
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,040
Forget it

366
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,880
Maybe this is God's will

367
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,710
What's the situation

368
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,230
Weiwei is married

369
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,400
get married

370
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,430
Who is this

371
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,590
my God

372
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,350
uncle

373
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,070
Something big happened

374
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,590
What's up

375
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,430
No big deal with your uncle and me

376
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,230
Do you understand

377
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,070
look by youself

378
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,950
what

379
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,950
look by youself

380
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,560
Who got married you say

381
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,760
Tang Weiwei

382
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,160
Tang Weiwei

383
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,000
Tang Weiwei

384
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,950
Why didn't you say it earlier

385
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,920
I told you you didn't listen

386
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,040
This is the big deal

387
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,400
slight

388
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,880
Do you know the story of mermaid

389
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,800
The mermaid found the princess

390
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,190
Need artificial respiration in order to save people

391
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,560
Shut up

392
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,160
Lin Ran

393
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,350
Forget it before

394
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,280
My sister is married now

395
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:42,830
You still got involved

396
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,070
Do you want to ruin her happiness

397
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,560
Weiwei when are you

398
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,190
learn

399
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,680
Cut first and play later

400
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,230
You seem impatient

401
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,230
Do you think

402
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,950
Dad can't care about you anymore

403
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,760
If you really have heart disease

404
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,800
Then you really can't care about me

405
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:02,920
you

406
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,830
Uncle Dad

407
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,400
You used to force me to go on a blind date

408
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,040
Ok now i am married

409
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,190
You are not satisfied yet

410
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,760
I really don't understand what you want

411
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,590
I want you to have a stable life

412
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,560
I want you to have a good time

413
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,350
But can you live like this now

414
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,760
You don't cobo

415
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
You go to open a dessert shop

416
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,520
Forget it

417
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,800
You and Lin Ran

418
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,680
Nonsense

419
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,640
We are all used to you

420
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,950
Now let you come on a blind date

421
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,470
You get another marriage certificate

422
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,160
I think you are less and less like your mother

423
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,760
My mother and I are originally different

424
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,310
From small to large

425
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,310
You always say what mom wants me

426
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,230
How do i look like mother

427
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,160
I know you miss her

428
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,400
I miss her too

429
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,110
But there are many ways to miss

430
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,110
I don't want to reproduce my mother's life

431
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,110
Just now

432
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,880
Talking to dad is too strong

433
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,760
anger

434
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,920
Sure enough, the most destructive emotion

435
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,710
elder brother

436
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,880
What i will say later

437
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,160
May be more impactful

438
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,560
Dare to invite me here

439
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,160
It's your kid who gets the shock

440
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,190
First thing

441
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,470
It's me and Tang Weiwei

442
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,310
already married

443
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,070
Bastard

444
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,160
pardon

445
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,190
elder brother

446
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,710
dad

447
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,920
Tang Weiwei and I

448
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,350
already married

449
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,760
Brat

450
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
Didn't you break up?

451
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,110
Didn't you go abroad?

452
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,160
Dare you lie to my sister

453
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,680
I didn't lie

454
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,430
I and Wei Wei

455
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,560
It's in love

456
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,800
You still said

457
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,400
Let him talk

458
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,950
Uncle Tang

459
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,590
I have grown up

460
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,640
Weiwei followed me later

461
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,590
No one can bully her

462
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,880
Watching you guys fight all morning

463
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,230
Didn't eat lunch

464
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,800
What does Uncle Tang want to eat

465
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,310
I treat

466
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,110
It doesn't matter what you eat

467
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,350
The important thing is who you eat with

468
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,400
Why are you still standing?

469
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,110
Take a bath

470
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,830
go

471
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
Let's go, brother

472
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,310
Take a bath

473
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,590
Let's go

474
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,800
welcome

475
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,520
Good business

476
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,430
Okay

477
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,640
Sit for a while

478
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,430
good

479
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,760
Do you want something to drink

480
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,310
Casual

481
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,230
good

482
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,680
That

483
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,230
Just lemonade

484
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,070
Okay thank you

485
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,190
slight

486
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,040
Last time

487
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,680
thank you

488
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,110
nothing

489
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,070
You don't have to buy such an expensive one

490
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,040
Is it expensive?

491
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
But I never bought it at the wholesale market

492
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,950
And i didn't have a counter offer

493
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,190
thanks

494
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,640
slight

495
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,560
You say between us

496
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,590
I am married

497
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,830
Last time I saw you and your brother, you two

498
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,680
It's me and Lin Ran

499
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,560
alright

500
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,230
You're busy

501
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:05,760
I go first

502
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,640
You wait wait

503
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,000
Wait a moment

504
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,230
I

505
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,760
Just made dessert today

506
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,880
Take it home and eat with Auntie

507
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,710
My mother can't eat it

508
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,590
She has diabetes

509
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,950
But thank you

510
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,830
I can eat this

511
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,110
My mother can only eat some now

512
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,760
Something with sugar substitute sweeteners

513
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,160
Sugar substitute sweetener

514
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,190
good

515
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,000
fine

516
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,560
you eat

517
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,350
thank you

518
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:34,880
good

519
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,470
Take care

520
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:35,920
Bye-Bye

521
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,400
Bye-Bye

522
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,710
Sugar substitute sweetener

523
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,710
slight

524
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,280
What do you want me to do today

525
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:47,920
Senior

526
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,710
I heard

527
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,230
Your company has been developing

528
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,950
Sugar substitute sweetener

529
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,590
right

530
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,230
Some have already been put into use

531
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,560
You need

532
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,400
I recently opened a dessert shop

533
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,920
Then I want to make a series of sugar-free cakes

534
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,880
For patients who can't eat sugar

535
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,000
So I want to ask your company

536
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,590
Do you want to

537
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,640
Sweeteners have always been my project

538
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,400
If you have a need

539
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
We can work together anytime

540
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,830
Miss your express

541
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,350
thanks

542
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:27,920
You are welcome

543
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,280
How sweet our family is

544
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,710
Wei Weijie

545
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,040
Lin Ran

546
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,760
Thank you for looking at the store today

547
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,310
I didn't tell you before

548
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,590
I have a package

549
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:56,950
Is it this one

550
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,160
let me see

551
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,880
what

552
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,430
Give me

553
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,430
no

554
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,110
You have

555
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,160
Go away

556
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,070
Wash hands together

557
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,920
I'll get you apron

558
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,430
wait for me

559
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,520
Stretch out your hand

560
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,830
Turn over

561
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,640
Sister is so good

562
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,520
How old are you

563
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,110
I am seven years old

564
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,520
You are five years old

565
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,000
Come on, brother to wash hands for sister

566
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,400
childish

567
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,400
Only for you

568
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,520
You go to the boxing gym today

569
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,880
Is it related to my brother?

570
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
It's okay

571
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,470
Communication between men

572
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:02,950
You do not understand

573
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,230
Anyway, that level at your house

574
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,190
I have done it

575
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,760
Man thing

576
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,710
I do not understand

577
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,310
communicate

578
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,880
I knew I would get two more punches

579
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,070
Make you feel bad

580
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,040
You are blindly confident

581
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,160
Need psychological counseling

582
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,470
This thing is really sweet

583
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,710
no

584
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,920
Poison you

585
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,000
sure

586
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,400
You take a bite

587
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,310
I have a bite

588
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,280
Let's Huangquan Road

589
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,350
Still good friends

590
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,400
Wei Wei, I'm bothering you

591
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,160
Sorry

592
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,830
Sorry

593
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,920
It's ok

594
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,120
Give this to your sister

595
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,560
I'm useless anyway

596
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,710
Youth Entrepreneurship Conference

597
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,190
Then give it to yourself

598
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,760
Isn't she in the kitchen right now?

599
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,520
Do not talk nonsense

600
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,320
You show it to her

601
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,910
Anyway she opened a shop

602
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,430
I still don't support her

603
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,360
dad

604
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:14,910
cousin

605
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,630
time to eat

606
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,320
coming

607
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,600
Slightly hard

608
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,430
So virtuous

609
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,390
Of course

610
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:25,950
Taste

611
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,360
Taste

612
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,840
This rib

613
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,320
What a thick oil red sauce

614
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,080
Brother taste

615
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,520
this

616
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,520
A little fuzzy

617
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,800
It's not sweet and sour

618
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,870
delicious

619
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,150
And pumpkins

620
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:47,630
good

621
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,150
This is particularly healthy for the body

622
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,190
I like

623
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,870
I originally wanted to make pumpkin stew

624
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,040
But forgot to buy meat

625
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,360
fine

626
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,710
Just eat pumpkin

627
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,470
I like

628
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,600
Uncle, what are you doing?

629
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,670
You eat too

630
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,390
My phone rang

631
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,120
I take a call

632
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,760
right away

633
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,320
elder brother

634
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,080
Not as good as you

635
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,870
Have some more dessert

636
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,910
I made dessert

637
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,120
Don't don't

638
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,280
Stop busy sister

639
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,800
There is something you look at

640
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,670
Actually I recently

641
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,910
The dessert shop's business is pretty good

642
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,120
Really don't need

643
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,470
Your dad gave you

644
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,230
Take a good look

645
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,560
The life of Comrade Tang Jianguo

646
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
Really full of wisdom

647
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,670
It didn't say anything in the invitation letter

648
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,670
Can bring two people

649
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,910
But it said you can bring your family

650
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,320
It's two or three days once you go

651
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,950
It just so happens that these two days are weekends

652
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,080
Let's go to the dormitory to pack up

653
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,800
I go with you

654
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,430
Adult love needs to create a sense of distance

655
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,320
That's a coincidence

656
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,600
I am a minor

657
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,430
I want to stick to sister

658
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,000
You are only limited to

659
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,120
Dependent personality disorder

660
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,320
Then I'm the little obstacle for my sister

661
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:22,710
Go

662
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,150
Wei Weijie

663
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,120
Hello

664
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,430
Good sister-in-law

665
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,560
Hello hello

666
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,630
You guys busy

667
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,230
Which bed is yours

668
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:43,800
this

669
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,080
Wei Wei

670
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,040
You really plan to take that kid

671
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,000
Has been busy since he came back

672
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,320
This time just weekend

673
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
Just make up for him

674
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,320
alright

675
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,320
I guess he can die with joy

676
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
I haven't told him

677
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,080
good

678
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,430
As expected of my sister

679
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,320
Train your husband

680
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,560
I won't be able to score anymore, right?

681
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,150
I said you guys

682
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,150
Don't play games in the dormitory all day long

683
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,760
I'm reading

684
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,430
What book are you reading

685
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,870
Are you reading

686
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,840
I tell you

687
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,320
Go out more when you have time

688
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,600
Go for a walk more

689
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,080
Maybe a girlfriend can come out

690
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,710
right

691
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,560
Finish this round

692
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Go out and play a ball

693
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,630
I'll go out after this round

694
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,800
I will bring a girlfriend back this year

695
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,190
do not

696
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:44,950
rest assured

697
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,630
This is really nothing good

698
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,120
look at this

699
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,190
This sketchbook

700
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,670
I drew you on this

701
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,080
It's done

702
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,040
Serious

703
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,560
Take a look

704
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,230
Open it and take a look

705
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:54,470
slight

706
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,280
That schedule is really a misunderstanding

707
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,280
And am I in a hurry?

708
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,360
Take the initiative

709
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,360
Otherwise, I really won't have a chance

710
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,040
I want to follow in your footsteps

711
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,870
Want to stand with you

712
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,470
want to

713
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,150
Marry you home

714
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,560
Burning brother

715
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,190
Hundred Thousand Hurry

716
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,280
Something happened to Ji Han
