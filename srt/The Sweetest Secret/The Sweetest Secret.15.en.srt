Uncle,

12
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,360
I went to the early childhood
education class just now

13
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,510
and found out what happened.

14
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,000
I am exhausted.

15

Why didn't you two
come back together?

18
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,240
She went to the bank

19
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,550
so she told me
to come home on my own.

20
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,110
She told you that,

21
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,960
and you did?

22
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,240
You left her alone out there?

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,800
She is pregnant.

25

Lin Ran,

27
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,880
is it because life is too
peaceful for you recently

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,630
so you do as you want

29

No, brother.

31
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,520
The bank is right outside
our community.

32

36
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,670
That?

37
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,270
I think it is with the doctor.

38
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,110
I forgot to bring it back.

39
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,910
Nonsense.

40

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,110
you two quit the classes long ago.

42
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,190
You still lied,

43
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,390
saying due to incorrect
posture during practice,

44
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,720
it resulted in stomachache.

45
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,670
Did you...

46
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,880

Don't, don't.

49
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,320
last time, after what
you said in the hospital,

50
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,520
I did not even touch
Wei Wei's hands since,

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,880

52
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,360
Uncle,
don't listen to his nonsense.

53
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Here, I will hold him down.
Go ahead and hit him.

Tell me.

83
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,270
I already told you

84

Don't do it.

Did you listen to my advice?

87
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,440
Still, you cannot
terminate my card.

88
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,600

Isn't that star shining so bright?

109
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,670
The galaxy is vast.

110
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,270
It really is not easy

111
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,550
to stand out
from the rest of the stars.

112
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,040
It cannot be the brightest,

113
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,350
but it is trying
its hardest to shine.

114
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,480
But this star is not very clever.

115
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,830
The way it found to emit light

116
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,320
is different from others.

117
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,550
So, to other stars,

118
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,110
it is wrong,

119
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,040
because

120
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,040
it is different from the rest.

121
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,440
As long as it can shine,

122
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,510
it is a good star.

123
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,600
Never mind how it shines.

124
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,390
I decide how I am going to shine.

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,230
[Please wait a moment.]

175
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,350
How did it go?

176
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,590
So, patent nowadays
are worth so little.

177
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,880
I thought selling it
would fetch a fortune.

178
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,590
In the end,

179
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,440
it could not even
pay a year's rent.

180
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,440
The first step in starting a
business is always difficult.

181
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,960
I bought many handbags recently.

182
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,280
Should I sell some
to help the situation?

183
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,840
Forget it.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,030
Selling bags right after
the opening ceremony.

185
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,550
Does that mean we have to sell
our houses during its operation?

186
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,400
I...

187
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,550
The property manager
will be here soon.

188
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,280
Let's see

189
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,400
if there are others which
better suit our needs.

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,470
Sure, no problem.

191
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,910
After I settle matters
with this client,

192
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,840
I will solve your problems.

193
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,550
It is you.

194
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,520
It is you.

195
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,440
We meet again.

196
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,790
Wei Wei,

197
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,640
why don't we

198
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,640
find another place to rent?

199
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,230
This is it.

200
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,110
The University Town is nearby.

201
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,520
Besides,

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,350
and there is a lot of traffic.

203
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,280
Recently, they are also planning
an internet celebrity street.

204
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,150
There is no place
better than here.

205
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,640
How is it suitable?

206
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,400
Look, this place

207
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,230
is small

208
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,880
and secluded.

209
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,710
Look at this space.

210
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,320
It can only accommodate
so few tables.

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,350
How much money you have

212
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,110
governs the choices you get.

213
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,080
The rent is cheap,

214
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,760
so of course the
shopfront is not as good.

215
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,000
The ones in the front are good,

216
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,790
but can you afford the rent?

217
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,030
Dong Zhe,

218
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,960
haven't you been
showing up a lot recently?

219
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,230
What are you up to?

220
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,470
How much money do you need?

221
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,200
Seems like you cannot do much

222
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,230
with a master's degree.

223
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,880
You could not find a job,

224
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,520
and end up with no
choice but to open a shop.

225
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,880
What's worse, you could
not even afford the rent.

226
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,910
Right, brother?

227
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,350
By the way,

228
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,350
the shopfront Sun Chao
brought you to see yesterday,

229
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,110
my friend signed the lease.

230
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,710
I even got him discount.

231
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,840
Wei Wei,

232
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,670
if you chose me back then,

233
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,000
this would not happen.

234
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,670
Brother Wang.

235
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,150
OK, sure.

236
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,550
Very well.

237
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,150
Don't go anywhere.

238
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,150
I will go over right now.

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,670
No.

240
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,320
We have to think of other ways.

241
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,560
[Jin Zi Chuan]

242
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,590
Wei Wei,

243
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
why don't we

244
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,400
try angel investment financing?

245
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,320
Forget it.

246
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,200
I had better redeem

247
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,230
my investment products.

248
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,590
Anything counts at this point.

249
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,000
I need to make a call.

250
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,760
You all go ahead and look.

251
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,840
Come, fellow students.
Take a look at this.

252
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,470
In fact, Lin Ran's "Problems"

253
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,440
is one of the best

254
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,840
among the competition entries.

255
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,030
It was selected by Calligraphy and
Painting Association's Vice President

256
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,640
as a hyperrealistic painting.

257
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,670
Look,

258
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,230
the painting has a
great sense of depth,

259
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,000
with clear composition
and well-defined lines.

260
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,350
Next, let's look at the colours.

261
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,910
Areas of light and shade
are clearly distinguished.

262
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,910
If you stand right here,

263
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,110
doesn't it give you

264
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,520
the feeling as if you
are part of the painting?

265
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,030
Where is the director?

266
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,030
He has a meeting this afternoon.

267
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,710
And he told me to cross
check your manuscript here.

268
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,710
Manuscript?

269
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,880
We will talk about that next time.

270
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,550
Come with me.

271
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,640
Fellow students,

272
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,910
next, look right here.

273
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,350
Actually, you can
take a look around.

274
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,030
What is it?

275
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Do you have some money to spare?

276
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,280
Lend me some.

277
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,150
How much do you want?

278
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,400
I have about RMB 300 on me.

279
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,670
Aren't you a rich man's kid?

280
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,910
Why only RMB 300?
Aren't you ashamed?

281
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,470
Wait,

282
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,400
did you forget

283
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,550
how I lost my card?

284
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,470
I don't want to know
how you lost your money.

285
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,550
I just want to know
how you get them.

286
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,320
They were given by my brother.

287
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,710
I don't know how to earn money.

288
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,910
Wait,

289
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,400
why do you need so much money?

290
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,080
Remember I told you
about the start-up?

291
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,400
A capital is required.

292
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,350
But I don't know where
to get the financing.

293
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,520
That is simple.

294
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,790
Just find an investment
company like my brother's.

295
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,640
Restaurants,

296
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,000
hotel chains,

297
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,910
internet.

298
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,910
He does all kinds of investments.

299
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,470
I am not worthy to be
your brother's investment.

300
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,400
Stop joking.

301
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,080
Lin Ran,

302
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,000
actually, I have some.

303
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,520
How can I take money
from my little sister?

304
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,710
Are you kidding me?

305
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,470
Keep it.

306
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,840
You went to Gu Zhen.

307
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,150
I can also help.

308
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,550
We are bros. Take it.

309
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,520
No, no.

310
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,150
Wait,

311
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,080
you two.

312
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,910
One of you does not
want to take the money,

313
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,960
and the other insists to give it.

314
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,230
Why don't I help you
spend the money?

315
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,110
Give it back!

316
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,230
Give it back!

317
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:05,760
Give it back!

318
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,110
Wait!

319
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,030
Wait! Time out!

320
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,790
Give it here!

321
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,550
Lin Ran,

322
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,760
I don't mean to nag.

323
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,320
You are financially deprived

324
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,840
yet you don't want
your junior to help.

325
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,350
Are you going
to sell the yard instead?

326
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,150
Sell the yard?

327
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,640
Makes sense.

328
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,320
Gu Zhen,

329
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,320
your brother's

330
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,000
scope of investment
is quite wide, correct?

331
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,280
Yes, he is.

332
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,400
Mr. Jin, sorry

333
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,960
for asking you to meet
on such a short notice.

334
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,840
Actually, I am thinking of
opening a dessert shop.

335
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,320
I want to ask if your company

336
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,000
would be interested to
invest in the business.

337
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,670
Is it own brand

338
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,320
or a chain franchise?

339
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,520
It is an independent brand.

340
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,320
Do you want to take
a look at the proposal?

341
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,790
In fact, the size of the
dessert market nowadays

342
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,710
is quite large.

343
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,280
Moreover,

344
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,840
it is also a rigid demand
among young consumers now.

345
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,080
The size of
Huanuo's average investment

346
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,000
is to invest in same industry's

347
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,670
top 10 companies in
terms of market share.

348
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,200
For start-ups,

349
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,400
so far, we only consider
high technology

350
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,590
and new energy projects.

351
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,760
Therefore,

352
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,640
I am sorry.

353
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,280
It is OK.

Look,

357
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,030
she even pretended not to see me.

358
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,520
How heartless.

359
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,840
How could she?

360
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
Drives me mad.

361
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,710
Uncle, don't be mad.

362
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,550
Perhaps Wei Wei
really did not see you.

363
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,670
Piss off!

Mr. Jin!

Where are you going?
Do you have a meeting?

375
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,400
I need to talk to you.

376
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,030
Let me finish
what I have to say first.

377
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,880
What is with that look?

378
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,230
I haven't complained.

379
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,080
You poisoned me
for seven whole days.

380
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,000
Poisoned?

381
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,110
Why would I poison you?

382
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,440
Lily. Poison lily.

383
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,670
I am allergic towards lily.

384
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,910
You placed poison lilies
on my desk in the past week.

385
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,550
Look at me.

386
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,150
I am about to have
a nervous breakdown.

387

Oh, right.

388

you will reimburse those.

390
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,400
Is RMB 50,000 enough?

391
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:11,880
Wait.

392
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,670
I am not done yet.

393
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,030

In short, it is very expensive.

398

You can't afford to pay for it.

399

Since we are friends,

402

They want to break the contract.

415

We might have to
look for a backup.

416
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,200
Understood.

Yeah, I have worked
with her before.

how could she do that to you?

425
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,589
You ask her for endorsements

426
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,400

427
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640

428
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,760

at the accounts.

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,680
Not bad.

515
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,280
One, two, three,...

516
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,040
RMB 150,000.

517
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
The profit is not bad.

518
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,310
Take a closer look.

519
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,710
It is a RMB 150,000 loss.

520
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,280
I suggest you

521
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,920
to watch your attitude
when you speak to me,

522
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,430
as well as the look you give me.

523
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,230
Now, I am

524
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,710
different from before.

525
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,400
I am the main
person-in-charge of this project.

526
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,880
Do you know what it means?

527
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,830
With my signature,

528
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,520
finance department
will pay immediately.

529
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,470
You.

530
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,310
Here, Mr. Gu,

531
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,070
drink this quickly.

532
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,640
Lin Ran,

533
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,430
you finally come to your senses.

534
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,760
Actually,

535
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,760
I don't have any particularly
excessive demands.

536
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,470
Just that recently,

537
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,880
I feel my shoulders
get a little sore.

538
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,590
It is uncomfortable.

539
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,430
Your shoulders are sore?

540
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,950
Fine.

541
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,400
That's it.

542
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,230
Tell you what,

543
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
my head

544
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,680
feels uncomfortable too.

545
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,800
Here, touch it.

546
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,560
Isn't it really round?

547
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,070
Perfect for a motorcycle helmet.

548
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,470
I still don't get it.

549
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,830
Which one is the clutch exactly?

550
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:15,950
Mr. Gu,

551
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,430
what about this?

552
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,590
Let's switch to other sports.

553
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,190
I think motorcycle

554
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,710
may not be suitable for you.

555
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,520
I don't care.

556
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,760
I'm going to learn
to ride a motorcycle.

557
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,590
Just now, you mentioned about

558
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,800
the accelerator. Which one is it?

559
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,160
What about this?

560
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,000
I will get our Cola to teach you.

561
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,680
Cola!

562
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,520
Coming!

563
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,710
I knew you think that
I am useless.

564
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,880
I cannot do anything right.

565
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,560
Isn't that right?

566
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,800
That is not what I meant.

567
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,070
So,

568
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,520
motorcycles

569
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,470
take time to practice.

570
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,470
That is why you need our

571
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,560
model coach.

572
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,680
It took him three days

573
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,760
to learn to ride a motorcycle.

574
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,680
And you

575
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,040
have only been learning
since afternoon.

576
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,350
It is considered not bad.

577
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,110
Is that so?

578
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,760
You really think so, Le Le?

579
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,760
Look,

580
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,110
do I have talent in this?

581
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,760
What can I say?

582
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,310
You are born to be a motorcyclist.

583
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,000
That is right.

584
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,400
Someone as talented as you

585
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,560
is very rare.

586
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,040
As long as you practice,

587
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,070
you might even become
a professional.

588
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,160
Really?

589
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,590
All the best.

590
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,190
Good luck.

591
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,710
Come.

592
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:20,760
I will teach you.

593
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,950
This is the accelerator.

594
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,400
And this is the clutch.

595
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,470
Uncle, your postures
are incorrect.

596
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,310
I told you not to eat so
much but you won't listen.

597
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,640
What is the use of doing this now?

598
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,430
I have been exercising
for a minute

599
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,350
and you grumbled throughout.

600
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,040
Believe it or not,
I am going to hit you.

601
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,040
I am going to beat you up.

602
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,040
I believe you, I believe you.

603
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,000
The phone.

604
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,470
Your phone is ringing.

605
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,310
This isn't over.

606
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,190
Whose phone is this?

607
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,470
Hello.

608
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,110
Im... Impossible.

609
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,070
Last time my daughter did
a check-up in the hospital,

610
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,560
the doctor said she was fine.

611
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,830
OK, OK.

612
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,520
I will come over right now.

613
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,520
OK, OK.

614
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,560
Thank you.

615
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,590
Uncle, what happened?

616
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,760
Wei Wei's urine test

617
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,950
has some problems.

618
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,760
Now the doctor said

619
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,680
we can't keep the baby.

620
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,230
How can it be?

621
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,430
I already told her

622
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,880
to get married and
give birth earlier,

623
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,830
but she would not believe me.

624
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,430
Now what am I going
to say to her mother?

625
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,110
Uncle,

626
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:32,760
don't panic.

627
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,800
Let's calm down first.
Listen to me.

628
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,830
Medical care nowadays
is advanced.

629
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,560
I don't think
it is a serious issue.

630
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,160
Let's look for Wei Wei first, OK?

631
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,950
You should have said so earlier.

632
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,400
Let's go.

633
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,310
OK, OK.

634
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:40,950
Let me find a pair of shoes.

635
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,520
Don't bother.

636
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,350
Come on, hurry.

637
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,400
Hello.

638
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,160
Mr. Sun,

639
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,230
I have decided. I would
like to book No. 103.

640
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,560
Hello.

641
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,710
[Wei Wei,]

642
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,280
[Mr. Jin agreed to invest
in the dessert shop.]

643
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,310
Really?

644
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:13,920
Of course.

645
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,520
Since when did I

646
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,400
fail to get a deal negotiated?

647
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,070
Oh my god, I love you.

648
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,590
I have good news for you.

649
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,000
What is it?

650
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,110
I have money now.

651
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,830
So?

652
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,560
I will pay for the
dessert shop's rent.

653
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,520
Think of it as investment.

654
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,920
Where did you get
the money from?

655
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,110
I earned it, of course.

656
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,160
You did?

657
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,920
You skipped classes again?

658
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,000
Don't worry.

659
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,710
I did not do anything illegal

660
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,830
or skipped classes.

661
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,040
Anyway,

662
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,070
I have money now.

663
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,590
Tomorrow,

664
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,230
we will go and
get the contract signed.

665
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,110
Lin Ran,

666
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,430
I cannot take your money.

667
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,280
Why not?

668
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,880
First of all,

669
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,640
you are a student with no income.

670
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,070
Secondly,

671
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,070
Jin Zi Chuan has decided

672
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,430
to invest in my dessert shop.

673
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,800
Uncle.

674
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,000
Wei Wei!

675
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,280
Wei Wei!

676
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,710
Wei Wei!

677
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Wei Wei!

678
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,800
Wei Wei!

679
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,430
Uncle Tang!

680
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,800
Move aside!

681
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,190
Wei Wei!

682
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:18,760
Father.

683
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,710
Let's go, hurry.

684
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,350
We are going to the hospital

685
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,110
so you could do a check-up.

686
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,680
Is someone ill?

687
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,160
Nobody is ill.

688
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,230
Come on.

689
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:26,760
Take Wei Wei with you.

690
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,430
Let's go.

691
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,640
You rascal.

692
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:29,800
Father.

693
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,400
Lin Ran,

694
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,070
I will talk to you later.

695
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,920
What is happening?

696
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,070
Just come with me.

697
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,350
Where are we going?

698
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,160
Come, we are going
to the hospital.

699
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,070
Come, let's go.

700
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,560
Brother, let go!

701
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,950
Father, what is going on?

702
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,110
Wei Wei, listen.

703
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,400
Don't be upset.

704
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,310
Your urine test result is out.

705
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,160
The doctor said to
terminate the pregnancy.

706
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,830
Terminate the pregnancy?

707
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,230
I knew you cannot bear to do it,

708
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,920
but something is unusual
with this baby.

709
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,070
We cannot keep it.

710
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,710
Let's go and get an abortion.

711
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,000
I am not going.

712
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
Tang Wei Wei,
stop acting childish.

713
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,880
Your life is on the line.

714
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,640
It is not up to you.

715
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:27,880
Wei Wei,

716
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,190
you can always get
another child in the future.

717
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,830
Be good.

718
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,190
I will bring you to the
hospital. Come on.

719
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,040
It isn't real.

720
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,310
What isn't real?

721
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,190
The pregnancy is fake.

722
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,520
I was not pregnant to start with.

723
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,160
You aren't pregnant?

724
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,070
You...

725
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,230
What are you doing exactly?

726
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,110
This kid, you get on my nerves.

727
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,400
Uncle, don't be angry.

728
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,110
Choose how you want to kneel.

729
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,040
Uncle Tang.

730
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,880
Don't call me that just yet.

731
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,760
I am going to call you Uncle.

732
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,310
When you and Wei Wei
lied about the pregnancy,

733
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,190
you did not think of me, did you?

734
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,190
We thought of you

735
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,800
that is why
we faked the pregnancy.

736
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,640
What did you say?

737
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,920
Uncle,

738
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,710
I brought Wei Wei's stuff back.

739
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,110
You are not independent.

740
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,470
You were just spoiled.

741
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,280
Maybe you should choose
one to kneel with him

742
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,070
so you will remember.

743
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,230
Uncle.

744
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
What is going on here?

745
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,680
Uncle.

746
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,760
Think about it this way.

747
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,160
Wei Wei did not get pregnant
before marriage, right?

748
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,760
So, she is still our good Wei Wei.

749
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,160
Now that things have come to this,

750
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,070
Wei Wei has nothing to
do with this rascal anymore.

751
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,560
You should be happy,

752
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,560
right?

753
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:47,920
I am really glad

754
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,070
it was fake.

755
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,430
Nothing to do with Lin Ran.

756
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,560
I wanted to get my
graduation certificate back,

757
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,710
so I asked for his help.

758
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,470
I will kneel if anyone has to.

759
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,520
Wei Wei.

760
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,640
I will kneel.

761
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,470
Let go. Let him kneel.

762
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:12,800
Uncle Tang,

763
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,400
the pregnancy might be fake

764
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,190
but my feelings are real.

765
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,110
I have been in love with her
since as far as I could remember.

766
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,230
Lin Ran, stop right there.

767
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,560
Look at you.

768
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,430
You are drenched all over.

769
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,430
What if you catch a cold?

770
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,160
Still laughing?

771
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,280
This disobedient kid.

772
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,520
Did I keep you waiting?

773
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,190
You got in another fight?

774
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,560
Come on.

775
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,710
Let's get your wound bandaged.

776
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,640
Stop!

777
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,230
We are in school.

778
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,230
Since when were you in
love with Tang Wei Wei?

779
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,920
Probably

780
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,040
when I realized

781
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,040
all the gentle memories

782
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,230
has to do with her.

783
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,560
[This rascal.]

784
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,950
[He seems]

785
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,560
[like a decent person.]

786
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
[His parents are researchers]

787
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,400
[so conflicts with
mother-in-law does not exist.]

788
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,190
[He grew up in this family,]

789
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,430
[so there is
no messy love history.]

790
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,190
Uncle,

791
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,280
in fact, I think Lin Ran

792
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,590
is not bad.

793
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,190
No, look here.

794
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,520
I have to re-educate if someone
else is the brother-in-law.

795
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,350
But he does not need it.

796
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,190
He already got that.

797
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:04,950
I am your uncle.

798
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,280
Do I need you to teach me?
Come on.

799
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,520
Good luck.

800
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,000
Come on, get up.

801
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,400
Does it hurt?

802
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,710
Wei Wei.

803
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,950
I have something to tell you.

804
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,950
Uncle Tang won't
agree to us dating, right?

805
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,430
I am thinking

806
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,160
you are unwilling either.

807
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,160
Now, the dessert shop

808
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,520
has Jin Zi Chuan's investment,

809
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,190
and Uncle Tang knows
we are not dating.

810
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,680
Wei Wei,

811
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,560
I have the feeling that

812
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,590
we are drifting apart.

813
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,000
Lin Ran.

814
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,830
I really want to be
your boyfriend.

815
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,430
I want

816
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,880
us to be together.

817
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,680
But I feel,

818
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,920
I don't think

819
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,230
I can do it.

820
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,070
Don't be mad.

821
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,230
I am not.

822
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,070
I am just scared.

823
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,230
Scared?

824
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,470
That I cannot be with you.

825
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,590
That we can only be neighbours.

826
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,920
That we are just
sister and brother,

827
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,680
and our names
cannot be placed together.

828
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:57,950
I am scared,

829
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,040
Tang Wei Wei will
just be Tang Wei Wei,

830
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,470
and Lin Ran is just Lin Ran.

831
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,670
Give me your hand.

832
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,360
Is this for me?

833
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,000
Didn't someone say,

834
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,840
if you fake something
for your entire life,

835
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,080
it will become real?

836
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,280
Since they already know,

837
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,430
then there is nothing
to worry about.

838
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,520
Lin Ran,

839
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,000
let's start all over again.

840
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,560
And this time

841
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,320
will be real

842
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,470
without any lies.

843
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,560
I really want to be
your boyfriend.

844
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,320
I want

845
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,950
to be by your side.

846
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,470
You were following me
around the entire day.

847
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,230
You can go to Wei Wei
if you have so much time.

848
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,040
I don't really know her.

849
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,120
Inspection at her dessert shop.

850
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,360
Why, aren't you being obvious?

851
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,360
In the past,

852
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,560
I used to be your brother.

853
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,000
And now,

854
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,360
I am your boyfriend.
