I'm serious this time.

176
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,080
Why?

177
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,110
Father.

178
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,110
Actually, Lin Ran and I...

179
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,320
Father!

180
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,790
I mean,

181
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:50,910
uncle.

182
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,790
It was a slip of the tongue.

183
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,350
You asked me to buy
some rice noodle rolls.

184
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,470
Here you go.

185
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,110
Today is a happy day.

186
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,670
I think

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,030
we should eat
something else instead of this.

188
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,960
Shall I

189
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,030
cook us some meals?

190
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,080
Wait for me.

191
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,710
Father.

192
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Sometimes,

193
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,280
you must have been disappointed in me.

194
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,000
Silly girl.

195
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,030
I am always proud of you.

196
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,280
I will always support you.

197
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:36,910
Father.

198
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,280
Actually, Lin Ran and I...

199
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,910
Lin Ran.

200
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,910
Are you all right?

201
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm fine.

202
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,150
Just give me ten minutes,

203
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,080
then we can eat.

204
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,230
I'll go down for a walk

205
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,470
and get some fresh air.

206
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,960
[You are still young.]

207
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,880
[You need a goal in your life.]

208
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,710
[Only then]

209
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,030
[you will have no limits
to what you can achieve.]

210
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,200
[Goal?]

211
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,110
[What is my goal?]

212
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:40,840
Step aside!

213
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,590
You should cook

214
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,590
instead of burning down the kitchen.

215
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,640
Why?

216
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,030
Are you trying to take both of our lives?

217
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
I said I'm fine.

218
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,080
Don't worry.

219
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,200
Does it hurt?

220
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,350
What's the matter?

221
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,400
Why are you smiling?

222
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,080
Are you crazy?

223
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,320
Wei Wei.

224
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,670
We grew old together.

225
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,230
Stop what you're doing.

226
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,350
Let's go out and eat.

227
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,150
I'm so full today.

228
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,030
You haven't given me a response.

229
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,440
Will you

230
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,670
grow old with me?

231
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,200
Are you blushing?

232
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,590
Stop joking.

233
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,960
Pick it up.

234
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,280
That's not necessary.

235
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,960
Just take it as

236
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,400
a wishing coin.

237
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,110
Wishing coin?

238
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,320
What kind of wish?

239
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,670
Your wish.

240
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,840
I don't have a wish. You should do it.

241
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,030
All right then.

242
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,230
I wish

243
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,550
my goal

244
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,840
and my life

245
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,760
will be filled with you.

246
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,880
I shouldn't make this wish
in front of the fountain.

247
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,150
I should do it in front of you.

248
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,080
Tang Wei Wei.

249
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,200
We pretend to be a couple

250
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,440
because you want to take the exam.

251
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,320
Now,

252
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,470
since you want to give up on it,

253
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,520
does that mean you don't want me either?

254
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,710
I will leave you for real

255
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,790
if you don't keep up.

256
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,550
To be honest, I enjoy

257
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,470
our fake relationship.

258
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,960
Tang Wei Wei.

259
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,640
I made you blush

260
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,440
and your heart race,

261
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
didn't I?

262
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Still, we can't keep lying.

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,320
It's fake after all.

264
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,960
So what if one of us
willing to lie forever?

265
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Whatever our future may be,

266
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,880
I want to go through it with you.

267
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,320
Tang Wei Wei.

268
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,400
Ever since my first year of high school,

269
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,670
I had the same wish for my birthday.

270
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,760
I wished someday

271
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,670
I could become

272
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,400
the one who accompanies you
through thick and thin

273
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,670
and make you believe in love.

274
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,440
Please accept me.

275
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,349
[Eat up.]

276
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,310
[I just only know how to cook noodles.]

277
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,710
Why did I

278
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,110
move out of Tang Wei Wei's house?

279
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,470
Who is it?

280
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,560
I'm coming.

281
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,000
Lin Ran?

282
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,470
Uncle Tang.

283
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,160
Uncle Tang.

284
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,950
What do you want?

285
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,640
Is it raining?

286
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,560
You don't know.

287
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,040
The pipes in my house burst.

288
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,800
The living room was flooded.

289
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,040
The neighbours complained to me.

290
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,800
I'm homeless now.

291
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,880
I'll have to stay at
your house for the time being.

292
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,160
Well, it's fine.

293
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,070
Even though we...

294
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,350
We?

295
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,190
I respect you.

296
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,640
I can sleep on the couch.

297
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,590
Get up.

298
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,560
I'll clean up the room.

299
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,350
Maybe you can sleep in your old room.

300
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,640
Go back to your room.

301
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,000
I'll take care of this.

302
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,350
Go on.

303
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,560
Uncle Tang.

304
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,400
I...

305
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,070
The water pipes in my house burst.

306
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,350
Is that so?

307
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,880
Besides plumbing problem,

308
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,280
is there anything else
you need to fix in your house?

309
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,190
I can fix them for you.

310
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:15,920
Uncle.

311
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,560
Let's not

312
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,350
mind about all that.

313
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,110
[How should I sum up his good points?]

314
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,310
[I should put it this way.]

315
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,040
[He is childish]

316
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,640
[and likes to fool around,]

317
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,760
[but,]

318
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
[he is responsible]

319
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,070
[and makes me feel secure.]

320
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,090
[Li Xiang]

321
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,430
Hello.

322
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,760
[Hello, sweetheart.]

323
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,560
[What are you doing?]

324
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,430
I finally managed to escape

325
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,400
from that devil Ms. Yang.

326
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
How are you and Lin Ran?

327
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,160
Is everything settled?

328
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,310
Yes.

329
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,590
Don't worry.

330
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,830
You sound cheerful.

331
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:21,950
Don't tell me

332
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,470
you pushed Lin Ran on the bed?

333
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
What are you talking about?

334
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,280
Actually, we...

335
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,680
I'm doing shopping now.

336
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,400
I want to buy some gifts for you two.

337
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,470
Why don't you come and find me?

338
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,190
I have something to do

339
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,520
in the afternoon.

340
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,590
It's okay.

341
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,830
I understand.

342
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,470
[Remember, Lin Ran is a young man.]

343
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,710
You should control yourself.

344
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,800
What are you talking about?

345
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,230
[I didn't expect]

346
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,760
that in my lifetime,

347
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,680
I would have the chance to
see you date Mr. McDreamy.

348
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,520
Not to mention he is a fine young boy.

349
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,680
Don't be ridiculous.

350
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,520
Okay, fine.

351
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,190
I won't make fun of you two anymore.

352
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,000
Okay.

353
00:20:59,310 --> 00:20:59,830
Bye.

354
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:00,590
[Bye.]

355
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,150
[Lin Ran is not my younger brother,
he is my boyfriend!]

356
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,230
I think this is perfect for you.

357
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,400
What do you think about this?

358
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,040
Mr. Jin.

359
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,470
Do you like this?

360
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,010
[Lukfook Jewellery]

361
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,520
Excuse me.

362
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,190
I want this...

363
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,950
Xiang Xiang.

364
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,160
Sir.

365
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,000
Is there anything I can help you with?

366
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,520
It's you.

367
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,470
Long time no see.

368
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,040
Are you Zhou Qi?

369
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,640
I'm sorry.

370
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,760
I have the memory of a fish.

371
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,280
Normally,

372
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,590
I would forget unimportant person

373
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,680
in just an overnight.

374
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,110
Who is she?

375
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,160
She is my girlfriend.

376
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,710
Are you here alone?

377
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:32,920
To look for

378
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:33,680
ring?

379
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,310
Don't be ridiculous.

380
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,310
I am in high demand.

381
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,830
This is my boyfriend.

382
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,920
He is young and good-looking.

383
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,560
I told him not to buy this,

384
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,800
but he insisted.

385
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,400
We have eight drawers
of jewellery in our house.

386
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,800
So, let's forget about this.

387
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,680
Can you stop fooling around?

388
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,680
Xiang Xiang.

389
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,110
Have you ever regretted

390
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,160
breaking up with me?

391
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Have you always been alone?

392
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,800
Sort of.

393
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,950
I'm eating a candy.

394
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,590
Didn't you keep telling me about
the desensitisation treatment?

395
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,280
Let me try it.

396
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,950
Help me.
