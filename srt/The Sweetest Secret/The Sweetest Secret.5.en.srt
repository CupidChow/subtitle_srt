a day off to accompany you.

There is no obstetrician appointment.

boss has hired someone else.

Yes.

216

The models and style are
incompatible with our values.

217

Mr. Lu has just returned from overseas.

He is looking for some doctoral students.

With your expertise,

it should be no problem to pass his test.

It's not for you

348
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,880
to attract attention.

349
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,280
What do you mean?

350
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,350
Literally.

351
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,310
It's the literal meaning.

352
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,520
As the deputy editor-in-chief,

353
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,000
not only you have a bad work manner,

354
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,110
but you also bring
your messy love relationship

355
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,640
to the company

356
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,950
and influence other colleagues.

357
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,110
The company is a place for you to work.

358
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,950
If you want a date,

359
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,680
please do it outside the company,

360
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,350
understand?

361
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,350
Drink.

362
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,230
Continue.

363
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,520
I have a gossip.

364
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,800
Ms. Yang

365
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,280
worked excellently in
her previous company.

366
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,230
Boss spent a lot of effort to
poach her from the previous company.

367
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,190
Still, she has gone too far.

368
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,470
No one bothered us when we had

369
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,880
a tea break in the company.

370
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,640
Lower your voice.

371
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,520
Do you want to be called
to the superior's office?

372
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,560
Ms. Yang must have

373
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,710
a strong background.

374
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,160
Focus on your work.

375
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,590
Stop eating.

376
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,160
Xiang.

377
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,350
It's still early.

378
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,830
Shall we go for a meal?

379
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,830
Hold on.

380
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,200
[Li Xiang]

381
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:22,880
Excuse me.

382
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,760
I need to pick up this call.

383
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,160
Hello.

384
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,230
What are you doing?

385
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,350
Come and drink with me.

386
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,190
All right. I'm coming.

387
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,230
Mr. Jin.

388
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,830
I'm sorry.

389
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,520
My best friend seems to have an emergency.

390
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,760
I have to rush over.

391
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
It's fine.

392
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,920
We'll meet next time.

393
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,520
Sure, see you next time.

394
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,310
Bye.

395
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,040
Are you here?

396
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,110
I'll bring you in.

397
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,680
What happened?

398
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,000
You're here.

399
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,800
It's about Ms. Yang.

400
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,110
She just can't get along with me.

401
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,470
She has been giving me a hard time.

402
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,520
Cut the drink.

403
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,760
I'm going to the washroom.

404
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,880
Beauty, are you alone?

405
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,070
This is my treat.

406
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,640
I'm waiting for my friend.

407
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,040
Sorry, I don't drink.

408
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,470
You came to a pub.

409
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,430
I don't believe you can't drink.

410
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,350
Don't be shy.

411
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,520
Let's make friend.

412
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,230
I'm sorry.

413
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,430
I didn't mean it.

414
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,310
Wipe it clean.

415
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,070
It's okay.

416
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,070
You can clean it for me.

417
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,230
Clean it by yourself.

418
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,190
Help me.

419
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:40,830
Let me go.

420
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,830
Let go of her.

421
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,560
How dare you

422
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,040
lay your hands on Wei Wei?

423
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,000
What do you mean?

424
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,000
Everyone saw it.

425
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,560
I treated her a drink,

426
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,520
but she refused.

427
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,560
She even splashed it on my shirt.

428
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,350
Shouldn't she clean it for me?

429
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,310
She should have the basic courtesy.

430
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,920
I'm not blind.

431
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,400
You forced her to clean it for you.

432
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,190
Moreover,

433
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,400
hadn't you come over,

434
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
she wouldn't have splashed a drink on you.

435
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,710
What should we do about this then?

436
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,590
We'll pay you.

437
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:18,920
RMB 500.

438
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,110
It's enough for the laundry.

439
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,070
Let's go, Wei Wei.

440
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,000
Stop.

441
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,230
What do you mean?

442
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,070
You want to just leave
after stirring up trouble?

443
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,470
She hasn't drink yet.

444
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,920
You...

445
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,800
Mister.

446
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,040
We accept your kind offer.

447
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,040
I've paid for the laundry

448
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,760
and I've apologised.

449
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,920
Can we leave now?

450
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,950
No.

451
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,310
You splashed liquor on me, yelled at me

452
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,760
and insulted me with money.

453
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,430
You have to drink with me.

454
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,190
Drink until I'm happy.

455
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,070
You want to drink, right?

456
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,880
How?

457
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,400
I'll drink with you.

458
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,190
Li Xiang.

459
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,800
[We are at a pub.]

460
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,190
[Come here quickly.]

461
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,040
Don't move.

462
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
Your father is behind us.

463
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,470
We have to act properly.

464
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,830
Show him that we are lovey-dovey.

465
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,830
Then you do the dishes.

466
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,190
What's wrong?

467
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,040
I can do the dishes in the future.

468
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,280
Don't move.
