00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,040
[How long do I have to
wait for the paintings?]

180
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,800
[Come back to paint now.]

181
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,400
All right.

182
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,760
What's the matter?

183
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,280
I must go back to school.

184
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,760
My teacher is asking me
to go back to paint.

185
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,600
Go on.

186
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,120
Aren't you seeing me off?

187
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,480
I must accompany the dogs.

188
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,000
Why don't you

189
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,200
stay with me?

190
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,440
I'm leaving now.

191
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,080
Goodbye.

192
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,120
[I'm busy. I'll go back later. Kisses.]

193
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm coming.

194
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,040
Hello, this is your food delivery.

195
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,000
Thank you.

196
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,800
Remember to leave a good review.

197
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,400
All right.

198
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,560
What's the matter?

199
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,520
Why are you so late?

200
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,680
Do you sleep like this every day?

201
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,160
Get up.

202
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,400
No.

203
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,520
Didn't you say being aimless was boring?

204
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,520
We'll search for your goal
and see the world.

205
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,280
Get up.

206
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,200
I think sleeping like this is great.

207
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,480
Get up.

208
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,520
Let's go.

209
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,840
Get changed.

210
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,400
No.

211
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,560
It's a party.

212
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,200
[Is it nice?]

213
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,640
Hello.

214
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,840
Do you want a drink?

215
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,640
The people here are so courteous.

216
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,280
My facial muscles are about
to paralyse from smiling.

217
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,200
You'll get used to it.

218
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,880
One's image is important
at such a function.

219
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,240
Oh, right.

220
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,840
That guy runs a psychology clinic.

221
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,760
Do you want to add him on WeChat?

222
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,720
All right.

223
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,000
Ning Meng should be here.

224
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,119
I'll take a look.

225
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:14,920
Go on.

226
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,839
Have a good time.

227
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,160
Don't drink.

228
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,680
[You look good.]

229
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,320
[What are you doing?]

230
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,920
[What took you so long?]

231
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,600
[Li Xiang brought me to a party.
She has a photoshoot to do.]

232
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,440
[Are you having fun?]

233
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,760
[It's not fun.]

234
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,880
Wait for me.

235
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
I'll take you out for a good time.

236
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,400
What's wrong? Slow down.

237
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,040
I'm so angry.

238
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,240
Ning Meng's shoot

239
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,520
was a disaster.

240
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,040
Why?

241
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,920
Was she difficult to handle?

242
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,000
That wasn't the only problem.

243
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
Other A-list stars I've worked with

244
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,680
were very polite.

245
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,880
You know what?

246
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,800
She's a rising star,

247
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,320
but she's so rude.

248
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,840
I asked her to wear a necklace

249
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,600
and she was so sarcastic.

250
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,960
"Be careful with it. It's expensive."

251
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,440
What's her background?

252
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,520
Why is she so arrogant?

253
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
The saddest thing is

254
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,800
I took a look.

255
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,320
I wouldn't be able to afford it.

256
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,520
It's customised and it costs RMB 3 million.

257
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,280
My hands were shaking.

258
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,680
I quickly put it in the room.

259
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,520
You didn't bring it with you.

260
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,440
Aren't you afraid of losing it?

261
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,640
I think I'd probably lose it
by bringing it with me.

262
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,720
Also,

263
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,040
there are CCTVs everywhere.

264
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,680
It should be fine.

265
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,400
That'd better be the case.

266
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,320
Dear guests,

267
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,880
good evening.

268
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,600
Welcome to the Ji family's charity dinner.

269
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,240
We would like to thank our sponsors

270
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,400
for this dinner.

271
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,400
Thank you, everyone.

272
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,440
What did you say?

273
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,120
Repeat that.

274
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,560
My necklace is gone?

275
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,920
The necklace is gone?

276
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,080
What's wrong?

277
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,480
Everyone,

278
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,440
listen carefully.

279
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,960
Impossible.

280
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,000
I lost something

281
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,480
very precious to me here.

282
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,120
What's wrong?

283
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,240
I lost my necklace.

284
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,680
It's worth RMB 3 million.

285
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,440
What happened?

286
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,880
She told me it was in the room.

287
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,960
I searched the whole room,

288
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,120
but couldn't find it.

289
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,640
Impossible.

290
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,880
I put it under the blanket.

291
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,160
Nobody should have entered the room.

292
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,160
"Nobody should have entered"?

293
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,160
It's such an expensive item.

294
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,160
Why can't you

295
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,440
explain this?

296
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,800
Ms. Ning,

297
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,080
I will take responsibility.

298
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,000
This area has CCTVs.

299
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,400
I'll investigate it.

300
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,600
We will find it.

301
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,720
The CCTVs on the 15th floor
are under repair.

302
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,760
They are spoilt.

303
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,400
How can that be?

304
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,640
Let me take a look.

305
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,160
Wait.

306
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
RMB 3 million is not a small figure.

307
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,080
Did you steal my necklace?

308
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,720
Are you running away because
you cannot afford to pay me?

309
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,480
Was this an inside job?

310
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,640
Don't make a false accusation.

311
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,360
As the organiser,

312
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,560
if you lose something,

313
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,600
we will take responsibility.

314
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,440
I want to investigate it,

315
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,720
but you're stopping me.

316
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,000
Did you

317
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,560
stage this?

318
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,160
That was customised.

319
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,240
You kept it away and said we stole it

320
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,240
to make us compensate you.

321
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,680
Who are you accusing now?

322
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,680
Do you want to repeat that?

323
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,960
I'm saying you staged all this.

324
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,480
All right.

325
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,440
Security guards, please come here.

326
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,520
Ms. Li.

327
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,400
Please retrieve all the security footages.

328
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,200
All right.

329
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,560
I'm sorry, Ms. Ji.

330
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,480
Can you please comfort her?

331
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,520
My friend is the organiser.

332
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,120
It seems there's a misunderstanding.

333
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,640
We need some time to investigate it.

334
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,440
All right. No problem.

335
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,400
Thank you.

336
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
What's going on?

337
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,320
How could such a huge company

338
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,560
make such a mistake?

339
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Did you take it?

340
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,120
Why were you so careless?

341
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,240
What happened when you were leaving?

342
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,800
Someone asked me to inspect the props.

343
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,680
So, I did it.

344
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,200
Who asked you to do so?

345
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,640
A normal staff.

346
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,280
I thought something went wrong.

347
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,360
So, I put down what I was having

348
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,520
and hurried over.

349
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,640
Then someone must have slipped in

350
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,360
while you were away.

351
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,520
Don't panic.

352
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,200
Later...

353
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,520
Will this work?

354
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,960
Zhang, come here.

355
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,160
I want to question you one by one.

356
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,640
Wei Wei,

357
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,400
how are things?

358
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,400
I must make one last confirmation

359
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,200
but you can inform them

360
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,920
that we know where the necklace is.

361
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,760
Trust me.

362
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,600
Everyone,

363
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,880
we found the necklace.

364
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,240
Where is it?

365
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,000
It's with

366
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,040
the makeup artist.

367
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,920
Ms. Li must have been too busy

368
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,440
and forgotten

369
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
that when she did the handover,

370
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,720
she passed the necklace to Zhang.

371
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,360
Ms. Ning,

372
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,160
don't worry.

373
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,200
Xi Jia is a reputable magazine.

374
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,440
They may not be perfect,

375
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,080
but they have high accountability.

376
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,560
Dear makeup artist,

377
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,720
do you want to check your bag?

378
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,320
Ms. Ning,

379
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,760
the necklace is here.

380
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,160
Let's go.

381
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,360
You're wonderful.

382
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,120
Since that is over,

383
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,000
let's proceed with the dinner.

384
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,600
Thank you.

385
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,200
No problem.

386
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,760
At the beginning,

387
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,680
Lin Ran had to be hospitalised
whenever he ate sweets.

388
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,680
I thought to myself

389
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,120
that I must cure him.

390
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,680
I wanted to bring you to watch the stars,

391
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,920
but there weren't any tonight.

392
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,840
So, I made this instead.

393
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
When I was making this,

394
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,760
I kept thinking of you.

395
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
You are the star

396
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,920
in my heart

397
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,600
that I have

398
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,120
never given up on.
