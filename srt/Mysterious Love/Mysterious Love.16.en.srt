1
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,040
Do you know who owns this place?

2
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,710
Have you paid for sleeping here?

3
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,720
I don't have money.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,150
Don't have money?

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,880
Give me all you have.

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,080
You brat.

7
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,560
Hurry up!

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,910
Get back here!

9
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,470
How dare you run away?

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,040
Give me!

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,400
- Don't fool me around.
- Boss.

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,470
Take a look.

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,110
Didn't expect that

14
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,270
you are a painter.

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,630
Look at this chick.

16
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,040
So nasty.

17
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Yes.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,190
Look at her face.

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:05,870
I mean...

20
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,680
I want her to sleep with me for one night.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,040
Boss!

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,720
Boss!

23
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:05,540
=Mysterious Love=
(All the parting is for better meeting)

24
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,500
=Episode 16=

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,550
When we woke up,

26
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,960
Nianchu was gone.

27
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,910
What happened?

28
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,960
Aunt Qiao.

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,080
Don't cry.

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,750
Yesterday

31
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,240
daddy promised me

32
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,320
that when the mission was over

33
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,720
he would come and find us.

34
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,600
He would never

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,320
never

36
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,360
never

37
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,880
eat his words.

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,320
Li Teng,

39
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,110
take them to find Nianchu.

40
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,550
Xingxing and I will wait here.

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,960
Jiang Hao's life is uncertain now.

42
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,030
Nianchu,

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,360
Nianchu must not be hurt!

44
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,270
He Hu,

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
any findings?

46
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,110
Surveillance lines of the hospital were cut off.

47
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,110
I cannot connect to them.

48
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,440
Then where could they take Nianchu?

49
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,960
Go and find her!

50
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,600
Keep it a secret from Nianchu's mom and dad.

51
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,080
They cannot stand up with it.

52
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,360
Let's wait for a while.

53
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,800
The patient had a complication during the surgery.

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,000
Resuscitation fails.

55
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,470
Please accept my condolences.

56
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,320
Jiang Hao!

57
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,470
Jiang Hao!

58
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,160
Jiang Hao!

59
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,960
Jiang Hao, wake up! Jiang Hao.

60
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:11,230
Daddy, daddy!

61
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:18,670
You promised me
you'll cerebrate mommy's birthday with me.

62
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:25,790
Daddy.

63
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,200
Please calm down.

64
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,270
Don't break your promise!

65
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,040
Lying is bad! Lying is bad!

66
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,600
Jiang Hao, don't leave! Jiang Hao.

67
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,640
Lying is bad!

68
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,390
Who can take care of Xingxing
if you stay with him?

69
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,200
Daddy!

70
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,200
Daddy!

71
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,480
I will take care of his funeral.

72
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,760
And I will avenge him.

73
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,640
You must take care of
yourself and Xingxing first.

74
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,160
Lying is bad!

75
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,550
I believe...

76
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,830
It must be Jiang Hao's wish.

77
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:21,270
Daddy, daddy!

78
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,830
Daddy!

79
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,070
Don't cry, Xingxing.

80
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,640
Let's go home, okay?

81
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,550
Go home first.

82
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,760
Don't cry.

83
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,200
You three send Yufei and Xingxing home.

84
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,950
Upgrade the security system of Qiao's house.

85
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,350
And then gather around in my house.

86
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,600
We will think about the next step.

87
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,760
You are home now!

88
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,640
How was your day?

89
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,230
Wasn't it exciting?

90
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,480
You are supervising me?

91
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,760
Do you think it will be fine if you send

92
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,000
Yufei and Xingxing home?

93
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,110
I am the one who decides

94
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
whether your people are safe or not.

95
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,000
Don't touch them. Come at me!

96
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,160
That would be boring.

97
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
Let Nianchu answer the phone.

98
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,000
Lee,

99
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,270
after so many years,

100
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,480
why haven't you made any progress?

101
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,110
Don't forget that

102
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,510
I started the game.

103
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
You

104
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,070
must follow my orders.

105
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,830
What do you what?

106
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,830
One hour later,

107
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,510
bring your three buddies and come to see me.

108
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,070
If so, Ruan Nianchu will have her life intact.

109
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,670
Final warning,

110
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,920
no tricks will be tolerated.

111
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,720
Otherwise,

112
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,350
you will all die.

113
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,830
What should we do now?

114
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,000
Daen is insane.

115
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,200
Li,

116
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,600
we should not wait for death.

117
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,640
He asked you three to go there.

118
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,670
It means that this time

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,920
it will be a hard battle.

120
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,670
We must avenge Hao,

121
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,160
and rescue Nianchu!

122
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,950
Li,

123
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,640
we together will get everything settled!

124
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,790
Li,

125
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,790
don't waste time.

126
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,790
Let's go!

127
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,200
What inspiring words!

128
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,320
It makes me wonder what will you do
in the final moments.

129
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,760
Cut the crap. Give me your address.

130
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,350
Keep your phone on.

131
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,670
I...

132
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,110
I will lead your way.

133
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,880
Turn right at the second traffic light.

134
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,520
Turn left at the T-junction ahead.

135
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,150
Li Teng.

136
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,640
Li Teng.

137
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,470
Nianchu.

138
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,150
Nianchu is not here. What now?

139
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,520
Li Teng.

140
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,790
Li Teng.

141
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,110
Li Teng.

142
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,520
Li Teng.

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,640
Don't touch me!

144
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,400
Lee.

145
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,840
We meet again.

146
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,790
Look at the gown I chose for Nianchu.

147
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,880
How is it?

148
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,150
Isn't it a good match?

149
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,670
Lee,

150
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,640
ever since you saw Nianchu,

151
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,440
the timer began to tick away.

152
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,960
Since you are smart,

153
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,280
have a guess.

154
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,440
Where

155
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,520
is the bomb?

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,710
Is it here?

157
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,110
Or there?

158
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,910
It's here.

159
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,520
Tuoli!

160
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Calm down.

161
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,710
I just want you to make a choice.

162
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,440
What is that?

163
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,000
Take it easy.

164
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,080
I set a 30-minute timer.

165
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,350
There are 28 minutes left.

166
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,030
I believe it won't take long
for you to make the choice.

167
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,470
Listen.

168
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,080
You should make a choice

169
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,110
between Nianchu

170
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,150
and your brothers.

171
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,760
Who will you choose?

172
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,550
What do you mean?

173
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,150
If you want to save Nianchu,

174
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,910
kill your three brothers.

175
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,030
If you cannot, Nianchu will...

176
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,670
Boom!

177
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,150
Tuoli,

178
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,670
I know your target is me.

179
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,320
Let them go. I will go to your place.

180
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,350
Lee.

181
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,110
Don't mistake what I said.

182
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,840
There isn't a third choice.

183
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,550
I know the last five years have been hard for you.

184
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,880
Actually I have a backup of the chip.

185
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,710
Release them.

186
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,760
I will give the chip.

187
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,910
You can continue your business in the Tai City.

188
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,440
Cut the crap!

189
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,840
I know bargaining more than you do.

190
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,910
Don't fool me.

191
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,400
Otherwise,

192
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,590
you know what will happen.

193
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,880
Nianchu and I

194
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,110
are prepared

195
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,760
to leave this place together.

196
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,550
Dying together like this

197
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,440
is a fitting finale

198
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,710
for a loving couple like us.

199
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,110
Right? Nianchu.

200
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,640
I will make the choice.

201
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,440
Did you see the red cloth behind you?

202
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,910
Yes.

203
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,110
All you need to do is to pull the trigger,

204
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,840
and then your beloved woman will be saved.

205
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,790
Nianchu.

206
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,110
The day of reckoning

207
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,320
is finally arriving.

208
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,960
What are you waiting for?

209
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,910
Aren't you a person of this sort?

210
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,320
Have you not killed enough people in the Tai City?

211
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,670
Do it!

212
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,350
He Hu!

213
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,080
Why it is us who will die
at the moment of life and death?

214
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,150
Without Li,

215
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,640
I will never

216
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
live until today.

217
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,110
My life is at the hand of him.

218
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,280
I will not betray him.

219
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,030
Nor will I allow others to hurt him.

220
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,320
She is not our woman.

221
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,550
Why should we do it?

222
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,400
Shitou,

223
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
you are directly responsible for
Nianchu's kidnapping.

224
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,320
Don't forget that

225
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,080
a bodyguard's duty

226
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,520
is to protect his client
even at the cost of his own life.

227
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,550
Li won't be so cruel to kill brothers
who went through dangers with him.

228
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,150
Sorry Li.

229
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,910
Don't you move! Nianchu.

230
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,590
There is a sensor under your chair.

231
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,590
It will detonate if your move.

232
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,470
Stay still.

233
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,400
There's a sensor here.

234
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,320
I got you.

235
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,080
I got you.

236
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,110
Nianchu,

237
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,590
don't look at me like this.

238
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,550
You know how cruel it is for me?

239
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,110
At my 10th birthday,

240
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,080
I, as the son of the boss,

241
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,400
his heir,

242
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,470
was thrown in other gangs

243
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,520
as a family tradition

244
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,470
to run my own affairs.

245
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,400
And it has a fancy name,

246
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,470
trial.

247
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,640
Six years after that,

248
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,760
I was prohibited from stepping in my home,

249
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,840
from seeing my family members,

250
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,230
and from telling others who I am.

251
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,280
I was like an orphan

252
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,280
who had no parents

253
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,790
and was bullied and humiliated by everybody.

254
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,960
It was not until I met you

255
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,280
that I saw a trace of hope.

256
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,760
Thus I glimpsed a faint light

257
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,150
in the endless darkness.

258
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:53,000
In fact, I have no desires over money or power.

259
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,880
I hate their businesses very much.

260
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,560
I wanted to be with you.

261
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,520
But later I find out,

262
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,760
if I want to be with you,

263
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,280
I must become strong.

264
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,350
Nianchu,

265
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,880
you are my support

266
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,160
in the dark five years.

267
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,160
However,

268
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,470
Li Teng ruined me five years ago,

269
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,280
and now he wants to ruin me again.

270
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,040
All my businesses are under police's watch.

271
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,920
I will let him know

272
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,640
the abyssal pain

273
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,470
of betrayal by everyone around him.

274
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,430
Nianchu.

275
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,400
Do you agree? Nianchu.

276
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,830
Do you agree?

277
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,950
He is hesitating.

278
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,000
He is hesitating. He doesn't love you at all.

279
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,590
He doesn't love you.

280
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,000
Look at me, Nianchu.

281
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,830
Take a look at me.

282
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,400
How can you be here?

283
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,110
Daen knows too well about our plan in the hotel.

284
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,680
So he might monitor us.

285
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,520
Go and check my home thoroughly.

286
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,400
Remember,

287
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,880
do it in a secret way.

288
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,230
There are some other places

289
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,520
that need to be checked.

290
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,040
There is an audio-monitor on the kitten.

291
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,470
Take it with you.

292
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,070
We will coordinate with you in the dark

293
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,470
to ensure the safety of the hostage.

294
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,190
I will go back and deploy first.

295
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,880
- Jiang Hao.
- Li.

296
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,920
Are you okay?

297
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,230
I'm okay.

298
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,520
It is just a slight injury.

299
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,350
There is one more thing you need to do.

300
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,400
Nianchu was kidnapped by Tuoli.

301
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,830
Now I need you to fake your death.

302
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,000
Let's play the dark chess.

303
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,920
And defeat him by a surprise action.

304
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,880
I have noticed the attending physician
through the police.

305
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:56,800
Didn't you promise to celebrate mommy's birthday?

306
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,160
Daddy!

307
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,230
Jiang Hao.

308
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,760
- Please calm down.
- Jiang Hao.

309
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,430
Daddy!

310
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,040
Wham!

311
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,310
Jiang Hao didn't die.

312
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,160
You lied to me!

313
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,070
We're gonna be safe.

314
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,920
Watch out!

315
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,760
Li Teng.

316
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,190
Li Teng.

317
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,280
Stop it!

318
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,040
Stop!

319
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,110
Stop!

320
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,470
Li Teng, Li Teng.

321
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,110
You can't save Nianchu.

322
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,830
Only I can protect her.

323
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,040
Only I am qualified to love her.

324
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,560
Your love means putting a time bomber on her?

325
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,110
You pushed me to do it!

326
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,350
I have given you a chance.

327
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,040
But you hesitated.

328
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,350
I can give up everything for her.

329
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,190
Stop it!

330
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,680
Stop!

331
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,280
Indeed,

332
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,160
I can't do something for Nianchu.

333
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,760
I can't drag her into darkness in the name pf love.

334
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,640
You do not really love her,

335
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,520
your love is out of selfishness.

336
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,680
I will kill you!

337
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,110
Li Teng.

338
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,070
Li Teng, Li Teng.

339
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,350
Li Teng.

340
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,760
Li Teng.

341
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,230
Sister.

342
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,190
Li Teng, leave me alone.

343
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,520
I can't leave even if you unfastened the rope.

344
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,520
This is a GBU-29 bomb.

345
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,830
Don't worry. It's black powder.

346
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,800
There are around 100 of them in each steel tube.

347
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,950
He placed a gravitational sensor under it.

348
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,040
It will detonate at the moment I get up.

349
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,640
Gravitational sensor.

350
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,830
AT3 type.

351
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,640
There should be a resistance
connected to the sensor.

352
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,430
The time left is not enough for replacement.

353
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,760
Once Nianchu stands up,

354
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,110
the resistance will be triggered immediately,

355
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,070
detonating the bomb.

356
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,680
I told you before...

357
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,560
Five years ago,

358
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,880
I should have died

359
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,640
several times

360
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,280
if I hadn't met you.

361
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,310
You saved my life multiple times.

362
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,230
The reunion of you and I

363
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,070
and our love

364
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,560
are consummate.

365
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,110
But you...

366
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,110
Ever since we first met,

367
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,350
you, Ruan Nianchu, are mine.

368
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,590
I will sacrifice my life for a smile of you.

369
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,590
Stop joking at such a moment.

370
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,760
Next,

371
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,880
I will fight a way out for both of us.

372
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,310
The only thing you need to do is

373
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,230
to trust me.

374
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,310
Then I will unpick the last conductor wire.

375
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,280
Trust me.

376
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,000
Li!

377
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:12,920
Li!

378
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,950
Fortunately, the bomb is fake.

379
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,000
Li, well done!

380
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,760
Well done!

381
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,800
You have provided us with clear and proper
information about the bomb type.

382
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,040
You have given me very accurate instruction
on the demolition, Yang Sir.

383
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,280
Actually,

384
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,310
I kept contacting with Yang Sir.

385
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,000
It is him who told you my position?

386
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,000
Explain it.

387
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,230
Raise your left hand.

388
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,280
You placed something

389
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,400
in the ring.

390
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,560
I asked Yang Sir to do me a favor.

391
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,520
Inside it is a GPS.

392
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,400
I was wondering

393
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,520
I might have been kept from this secret forever

394
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,760
if I did not ask.

395
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,000
There is really a possibility.

396
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,640
Now I know what is shrewdness

397
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,880
and maneuver.

398
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,680
How could I marry you

399
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,350
if I am not this capable?

400
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,710
You are horrifying.

401
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,230
If one day you sell me,

402
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,470
should I count the money for you?

403
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,710
I'm not willing to do so.

404
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,310

405
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,950

Yang Sir said

423
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,230
Tuoli tried to commit suicide after waking up.

424
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,430
But he was stopped on time.

425
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,590
So there is nothing bad.

426
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,310
He will go under thorough investigation.

427
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,160
Yes.

428
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,760
Washa and Duan Kun were charged with
attempted murder.

429
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,280
They are gonna serve in the prison for a long time.

430
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,160
We got the Jealous Li back.

431
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,110
Poor thing.

432
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,280
It was stabbed for no reasons.

433
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,710
Things are finally over for now.

434
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,680

435

Aren't we supposed to pick up Nianchu?

436
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,070

Don't leave.

It's crowded outside the troupe.

It's hot outside.

Xingxing,

486
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,710
today is the wedding day for your Li.

487
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,280
Forgive daddy, will you?

488
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,760
Why we should forgive you

489
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,950
on the wedding day of Li and Nianchu?

490
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,350
Bad daddy!

491
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,000
Liar!

492
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,520
Your nose will grow like Pinocchio!

493

Xingxing.

494
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,110
Daddy promises you that

495
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,190
I will never lie to you,

496
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,520
no matter what happens in the future, okay?

497
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,040
I will never lie to you again.

498
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,760
Don't eat your words again.

499
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,160
Don't ever lie to us
no matter what happens in the future.

Don't be fooled by him, Aunt Qiao!

You need to pinkie promise.

502
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,160
- Pinkie...
- Promise...

503
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,590
Keep the promise forever.

504
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,160
What's going on?

505
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,470
The wedding party will begin soon.

506
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,880
But there is not a trace of the bride and groom.

507
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,310
There are 365 days in one year.

508
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,310
Why did they pick July 14th?

509
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,710
Why did they choose such a busy day to get married?

510
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,760
Stop complaining.

511
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,680
Look at other fathers
whose daughters get married.

512
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,190
Aren't they full of blessings

513
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,520
to the couple?

514
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,760
Don't say nonsense.

515
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,710
Stay assured, uncle and aunt.

516
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,310
For a qualified drama player,

517
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,830
there is not a thing like missing the show.

518
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,590
Yes, uncle and aunt.

519
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,920
Li will definitely pick up Nianchu
and arrive on time.

520
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,760
Rest assured.

521
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,280
They are coming.

522
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,040
Here they come.

523
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,560
Let's go.

524
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,360
- Li!
- Wait!

525
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,150
Good!

526
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,040
Look how beautiful you are.

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,840
Gorgeous.

528
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,950
- Let's go.
- Wait.

529
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,670
I know what is the third wish.

530
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,670
You have to make a promise before marrying me.

531
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,630
Nianchu.

532
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,520
No.

533
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,470
My girl.

534
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,630
Could we save the shows

535
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,800
after the wedding?

536
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,150
Okay, I promise you.

537
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,520
Stop playing with her.

538
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,040
Don't joke at this moment.

539
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,910
I will deliver my promise.

540
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,190
The third wish is

541
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,910
I want three more wishes.

542
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,910
