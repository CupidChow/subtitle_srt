1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,200
Let me help you.

2
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,230
In fact,

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,600
this chip is real
a matchmaker for both of you.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,070
If it wasn't for the chip signal that

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,710
suddenly came out of
the Morninglight Troupe,

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,230
would you plan to

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,840
never reunite with her?

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,790
I won't reunite with her
this time either.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,880
I'm Li Teng,

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,200
not Lee.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,950
It's hard to believe,

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,910
that you've been thinking about her
for five years.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,950
Can you control yourself this time?

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,200
After I get the chip, I will leave,

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,110
and not disturb her anymore.

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,840
Has she come?

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,560
Buddy,

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,510
nobody shows up an hour early
for a blind date.

19
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,590
With this time,

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,230
it's better to sleep more at home.

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,910
The target appears.

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,590
Nianchu's dressed up today, it seems that

23
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,400
she is serious about this blind date.

24
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,720
Wait, Li Teng!

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,590
She doesn't know whom she is
going to date,

26
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,830
yet she still cares so much.

27
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,950
Shut up.

28
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,120
Hi, I'm Ruan Nianchu.

29
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,820
=Mysterious Love=
(All the parting is for better meeting)

30
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,340
=Episode 3=

31
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,030
Is this

32
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,080
your daughter?

33
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,670
She is Jiang Hao's daughter.

34
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,880
Her name is Jiang Xingxing.

35
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,520
Jiang Hao is not free today,

36
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,390
so I'll take care of his daughter.

37
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,830
Jiang Hao is so young,

38
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,440
but has already had daughter like her.

39
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,030
Hello,

40
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,750
I'm Ruan Nianchu,

41
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,240
you can call me Nianchu.

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Hello, aunt Ruan,

43
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,600
just call me Xingxing.

44
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,880
Dear Li Teng.

45
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,910
Do we have to go to the
amusement park

46
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,110
with her today?

47
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,190
Yes, we'll go together.

48
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,270
She could just take photos for you.

49
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,440
Fine.

50
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,320
You sit next to me.

51
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,390
Dear Li Teng,

52
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,360
why can she sit next to you?

53
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,670
Because she is my girlfriend.

54
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,470
I am a princess,

55
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,910
and you are my prince,

56
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,960
how can you have a girlfriend
as my prince?

57
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,720
Little Xingxing,

58
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,000
when you grow up,

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,640
your prince will appear.

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,040
At that time,

61
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,670
you will think that
your dear Li Teng is old and fat.

62
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,230
By then, you will not like him anymore.

63
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,160
No,

64
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,350
I want Li Teng to be my prince.

65
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,270
Hum!

66
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,040
Dear Li Teng，

67
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,600
I want to take photos
with the filter of kitten's ears.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,390
Kitten's ears?

69
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,760
Yes.

70
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,830
OK, perfect.

71
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,950
Dear Li Teng，

72
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,230
am I lovely?

73
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,110
Ah ha. Does that mean I'm lovely or not?

74
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,200
Yes, you're lovely.

75
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,880
What a cunning little girl.

76
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,320
Li Teng,

77
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,880
how about taking a picture for me?

78
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,480
No.

79
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,110
Your pose is out of fashion.

80
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,790
Xingxing, let me take a few more pictures
for you, OK?

81
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,270
Sure!

82
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,670
Seven shoots at a time.

83
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,940
OK.

84
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,460
(Yili--an ice cream brand)

85
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,510
Does the sticker look good?

86
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,040
Or does he have any

87
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,230
obvious marks on his body?

88
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,720
Such as scars or something?

89
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,510
Hey,

90
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,440
do you have some tattoo?

91
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,320
I think some tough guy like you

92
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,550
may be into the tattoo thing.

93
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,880
No.

94
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,070
Ah.

95
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,110
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,390
Let me help you clean.

97
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,270
I'm really sorry.

98
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,270
I'll take you somewhere.

99
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,550
Where to?

100
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,950
A hotel.

101
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,070
For what?

102
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,350
To get a room.

103
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,550
You're kidding, aren't you?

104
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,440
Don't you want to see my body?

105
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,200
Take your time when we get a room.

106
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,670
Well... No, thank you.

107
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,000
It's fine, I don't mind.

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,320
But I do.

109
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,510
You don't want to see it?

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
No.

111
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,670
Hi there.

112
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,950
What kind of a princess are you?

113
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,200
I'm an Ice Princess.

114
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,040
No, you're not. I'm the Ice Princess.

115
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,480
You are an Ice Princess,

116
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,230
and I'm an Ice Princess, too.

117
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,070
There can't be

118
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,790
two Ice Princesses in the world.

119
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,790
What's going on here?

120
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,670
Xingxing,

121
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,030
what happened?

122
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,710
Are you OK?

123
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,030
Please don't cry, Xingxing.

124
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,840
It's okay.

125
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,320
Nianchu?

126
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,320
Feifei, and Dai Jie?

127
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,200
What are you doing here?

128
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,670
You're

129
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,230
a family of three?

130
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,150
This is Qiao Yufei, my bestie.

131
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,590
That is Dai Jie.

132
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,710
A blind date with Miss Ruan.

133
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,590
Nice to meet you.

134
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,280
Previous blind date.

135
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Dai Jie is my private photographer.

136
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,900
And my bromeo.

137
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,220
Bromeo?

138
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,670
After you introduced him to me,

139
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,910
we hitted it off,

140
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,230
and became best friends.

141
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,550
Today, we're here

142
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,760
to take photos for my next collection.

143
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,110
What about you?

144
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,230
Dating.

145
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,030
To strike pose like this. Good.

146
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,280
Look at you! Yufei.

147
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,150
You had a crush on that prince charming
in the parking lot yesterday,

148
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,320
now you have a bromeo.

149
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,960
I can't work you out.

150
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,550
Who says one can't
both have male friends

151
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,350
and lover?

152
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,640
Besides,

153
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,840
Dai Jie's photo-taking skills are amazing.

154
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,150
A place for everything
and everything in its place.

155
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,200
He has a thing for you,

156
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,520
but you just take him as bromeo.

157
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,520
Just have your ice cream.

158
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,670
By the way,

159
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,440
Li Teng is young and handsome,

160
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,840
how come he has a daughter's at this age.

161
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,670
You know being a stepmother is
a thankless task.

162
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,080
You should think it over.

163
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,960
And,

164
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,030
his daughter

165
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,590
(The Red Rope of the State of Yue)
is a real piece of work.

166
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,000
You might be in hot water.

167
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,000
Come on,

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,110
don't be a drama queen.

169
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,320
It's his colleague's daughter.

170
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,440
What a shrewd and inscrutable guy

171
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,320
Li Teng is.

172
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,710
Why do you say so?

173
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,470
He brought a little girl
in your first dating.

174
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,440
So what?

175
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,280
To test whether you can
take care of children?

176
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,200
You are overthinking.

177
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,150
In that case,

178
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,150
have you confirmed yet?

179
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,030
Is he the hero who saved you of the year?

180
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Almost，

181
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,840
but...

182
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,540
(Reward for gifts
if shoot ten rounds.）

183
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,880
Have you got it?

184
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,760
Why should I get this?

185
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,590
Come over here.

186
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,590
Aim the target, make sure the three points
are in line.

187
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,710
Pull.

188
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,710
Sorry,

189
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,280
I forgot your wound.

190
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,320
Have a try.

191
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,910
I'll make him admit it himself.

192
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,150
This one,

193
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,080
dear Li Teng，I want this one.

194
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,000
Sweetie,

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,030
don't touch it.

196
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,470
Let your mom and dad help you.

197
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,200
It takes ten rounds to win this doll.

198
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,230
Xingxing,

199
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,440
I remember that

200
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,910
you have a same one at home.

201
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,790
They are not the same.

202
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,550
And this snow doll, too.

203
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,150
Dai Jie,

204
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,670
you shoot for me.

205
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,280
As the real ice princess,

206
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
the snow doll belongs to me.

207
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,440
No.

208
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,590
The snow doll is mine.

209
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,230
No one can take it away.

210
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,350
It's mine!

211
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,230
- Mine!
- Mine!

212
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,230
Xingxing,

213
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,000
how about this?

214
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,670
Let's team up in three,

215
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,350
then,

216
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,150
aunt Qiao and uncle Dai are in a team,

217
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,150
whoever makes ten shots first

218
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,590
will get the snow doll. Is that OK?

219
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,640
- Deal.
- OK.

220
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,670
You called me aunt?

221
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,470
Call me big sister.

222
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,320
Auntie.

223
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,080
Big sister.

224
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,910
Auntie.

225
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,350
Big sister.

226
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,670
You're going to team up with me?

227
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,590
Yes.

228
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,230
Do you know how to shoot?

229
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,790
Come on,

230
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,000
I've already paid the bill.

231
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,550
Come on, Mr. Li.

232
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,590
Come on!

233
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,350
Come on dear Li Teng!

234
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,550
Come on. Come on.

235
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,550
Three points are in line,
and aim at the position ahead.

236
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,470
Aim the target.

237
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,030
You first.

238
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,080
You first.

239
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,470
In this case,

240
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,110
the choice is

241
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,790
only left by it.

242
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,440
Do you always have coins with you?

243
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,320
Yes.

244
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
I have a lot of this kind of
game coins at home.

245
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,150
Head or tail?

246
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,440
Head.

247
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,230
So be it.

248
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,440
How's that?

249
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,790
Go away.

250
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,080
I want my prince to shoot it for me.

251
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,840
Dear Li Teng, you shoot.

252
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,880
I'm tired today and can't shoot straight.

253
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,910
I can teach you.

254
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,400
Come on. Come on.

255
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,320
Lower down, lower down.

256
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,840
Lower your center of gravity.

257
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,960
Hold it

258
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,710
in your left hand,

259
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,320
and put your right hand here.

260
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,350
Then aim it with one eye.

261
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,230
Can you see the bull's eye in the center?

262
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,710
Just aim at it.

263
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,180
♪I want to look at you all the time♪

264
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,420
♪How about you♪

265
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,420
♪Is this a dream♪

266
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,780
♪The world is quiet,
except for the heartbeat♪

267
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,000
Straight the gun out from the view
of the center point.

268
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,110
Hold your breath.

269
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,520
Pull the trigger.

270
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,910
Got it?

271
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,670
Can I practice by myself?

272
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,590
I'll give you a little more practice.

273
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,710
Go on.

274
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,590
That was a good aim.

275
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,080
Are you complimenting yourself?

276
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,110
One shot left.

277
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,910
Let's try

278
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,110
what that Lee taught you.

279
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,280
Yeah, yeah, I got the bear doll.

280
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,230
I got the bear doll.

281
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,760
Thank you, dear Li Teng.

282
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,000
Thank you, too, Aunt Ruan.

283
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,230
Call me Nianchu.

284
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,150
Thank you, Nianchu.

285
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,200
Good girl.

286
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,470
Here.

287
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,960
Nianchu,

288
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,840
Li Teng,

289
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
please come in.

290
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,320
The dinner is ready,

291
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,280
how about taking some meal?

292
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,520
No, thanks.

293
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,350
Xingxing is tired,

294
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,910
go and make her rest.

295
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,590
OK.

296
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,680
Then I'll leave you two alone.

297
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,160
This weekend I will bring Nianchu
to teach Xingxing to play the keyboard.

298
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,070
We'll come again then.

299
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,070
OK.

300
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,710
Gotta go.

301
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,880
See you.

302
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,160
How do you know I can play the keyboard?

303
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,560
When did I say I was going to
teach Xingxing to play the keyboard?

304
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,880
So you don't want to do that?

305
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,070
OK,

306
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,400
I'll have to tell Xingxing that

307
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,040
aunt Ruan doesn't want to teach you.

308
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,800
I don't mean that.

309
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,110
I just feel that

310
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,680
you're always playing tricks on me.

311
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,760
Why are you still single?

312
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,190
Are you still missing that Li?

313
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,470
Why do you never admit that you are Li?

314
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,640
This doesn't seem to be the way to my home.

315
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,470
Where are you taking me?

316
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,760
You'll know when we get there.

317
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,470
Don't touch me.

318
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,710
Why are you binding me?

319
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,470
Can you let me go?

320
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,520
I'm going to find Xia Fei.

321
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,070
Please.

322
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,230
Xia Fei.

323
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,110
Please let me go.

324
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,920
I'm going to find Xia Fei.

325
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,880
I beg you.

326
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,680
Why are you binding me?

327
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,040
Please,

328
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,590
please let me go.

329
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,160
Please.

330
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,880
I'm going to find Xia Fei.

331
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,590
Li Teng，

332
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,680
please let me go,

333
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,800
I'm going to find Xia Fei.

334
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,560
Could you please take me to find him?

335
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,430
Let me go,

336
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,710
please.

337
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,470
Mrs. Xia,

338
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,000
Xia Fei is busy.

339
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,040
He will come as soon as he is finished.

340
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,830
He is busy?

341
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,880
He's been busy

342
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,070
all these years.

343
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,280
You lie to me!

344
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
- He's not busy at all.
- Don't get excited.

345
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,520
I saw it with my own eyes that

346
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,070
someone wanted to kill him.

347
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,920
They kidnapped me and threatened him.

348
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,950
Is he dead?

349
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,880
Yes or not?

350
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,230
Give her a sedative shot.

351
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,190
OK.

352
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,000
Xia Fei.

353
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,160
She is in an unstable condition recently,

354
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,310
but you don't have to worry too much.

355
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,640
Release me.

356
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,040
Are you ok?

357
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:31,950
I'm fine.

358
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,430
Did you bring me here

359
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,560
with something to say?

360
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,400
In fact, Xingxing is not Jiang Hao's daughter.

361
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,950
Her biological father's name is
Xia Fei,

362
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,280
who had sacrificed in the war.

363
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,040
And the woman in the hospital,

364
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,000
whose name is He Lihua,

365
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,760
is Xingxing's biological mother,

366
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,590
and Xia Fei's wife.

367
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,640
Because she couldn't accept

368
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,520
the sad news of Xia Fei's death,

369
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,350
she went insane and

370
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,830
doesn't remember she has given birth
to Xingxing at all.

371
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,470
Does Xingxing remember that
He Lihua is her mother?

372
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,070
Once we took her to the hospital,

373
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,470
telling her that we have a friend in sick.

374
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,710
As a result, He Lihua suddenly became very quiet

375
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,520
when she saw Xingxing.

376
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,110
Then she took Xingxing's hand

377
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,760
and smiled at her.

378
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,470
She hummed a song

379
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,470
that Xia Fei

380
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,040
had sung to her.

381
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,000
After we went out of the hospital
that day,

382
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,160
Xingxing told me that
she wanted to learn how to play the keyboard.

383
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
She said that
she wanted to learn the tune,

384
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,000
and

385
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,800
she could play it for the aunt some day.

386
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,000
So is that the reason why

387
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,520
you want me to teach her?

388
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,880
I will try my best to teach her

389
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,830
and keep this secret.

390
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,950
I want to know,

391
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,920
that you refused to admit that
you are Li,

392
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,680
is it because it is related to
Xia Fei's mission?

393
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,280
I don't want another He Lihua.

394
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,880
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning

395
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,110
and take you to buy a keyboard.

396
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,880
There's a spare one in the troupe,

397
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,920
just use that one.

398
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,430
Thank you for telling me so much today.

399
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,430
And thank you for being in my life again.

400
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,830
I'm leaving.

401
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
Nianchu,

402
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
good night.

403
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Good night.

404
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,310
Li Teng,

405
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,400
do we have to go to the troupe
to look for coins tomorrow?

406
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,310
Yes, not only in Morninglight Troupe,

407
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,880
but also at Ruan Nianchu's home.

408
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,920
Li...

409
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,280
- Li Teng.
- Li Teng.

410
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,350
Yes, I remember that.

411
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,590
Can I call you Li from now on?

412
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,350
As you wish.

413
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,000
Li.

414
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,800
Yes.

415
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,590
Since

416
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,560
it's your first visit to be our home,

417
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,070
do you mind

418
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,000
if I ask you a few questions?

419
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,470
I don't mind, aunt.

420
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,880
Feel free to ask.

421
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,350
Through these years, it's the
first time that

422
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,800
our daughter has a boyfriend visiting,

423
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,920
don't scare him away.

424
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,430
What are you talking about?
I know what I'm doing.

425
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,800
You're so...

426
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,350
Your uncle is really full of nonsense.

427
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,230
Please have some water.

428
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,430
Thanks.

429
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,710
Let me introduce myself.

430
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,760
Well.

431
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,040
I was born on October 27, 1990,

432
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,920
in Zhangbei.

433
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,710
Born in 1990.

434
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,880
So you are...

435
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,640
I'm running a security company
in Yun City.

436
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,800
The company

437
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,760
is in good condition.

438
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,430
That's nice.

439
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,830
A promising young man.

440
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,830
What do your parents do?

441
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,800
My parents passed away a long time ago.

442
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,590
And I'm an only child.

443
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,830
The family relationship is relatively simple.

444
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,040
Oh,

445
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,070
I'm sorry to hear about your parents...

446
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,400
It doesn't matter.

447
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,230
What's the matter with Nianchu today?

448
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,110
She looks so happy.

449
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,830
Nianchu,

450
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,280
Nianchu, hurry up

451
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,160
or you'll be late for work.

452
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,230
I can't hear what you said.

453
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,520
Wait till I come out.

454
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,800
Auntie, don't rush her.

455
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,590
This is normal for a girl.

456
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,040
I'll wait for her.

457
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,400
That's good.

458
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,070
Well,

459
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,000
I'll make some fruit for you.

460
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,520
Take your time.

461
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,800
Be careful.

462
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,760
Give me a hand.

463
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,560
OK.

464
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,110
- Have a seat, please.
- Thank you.

465
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,160
Someone must have brought the coins

466
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,070
back from the Tai City
five years ago.

467
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,920
Who else can do this
in Morninglight Troupe but her?

468
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,110
I have a lot of this kind of
game coins at home.

469
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,430
Which side do you choose?

470
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,160
Perfect.

471
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,760
Mom, where did you put my curling iron？

472
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,830
What are you doing here?

473
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,280
I just told you yesterday

474
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,830
that I would pick you up today.
