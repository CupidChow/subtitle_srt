1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,000
And you?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Forget everything here after you leave.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,440
Lee...

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,790
Lee...

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,680
(Three years ago)

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,840
(Three years ago)
Still the same dream, right?

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,200
It's been over three years...

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,720
You always dream of the same place.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,270
Yes.

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,910
More than three years...

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,360
I can't imagine whether he's alive or not.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,240
Nianchu,

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,880
I've never been through things like that,

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,080
but I understand how you feel right now.

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,470
That dreaming of the past,

16
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,000
and feeling sad continuously.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,310
These are all quite normal.

18
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,430
They are typical symptoms of post-traumatic
stress disorder.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,360
Well,

20
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,680
is there any way to get over it?

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:11,860
(Entrance of the clinic)

22
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,190
How was it? What did the therapist say?

23
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,120
She asked me

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,480
to visit the places of the past.

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,720
No problem.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,830
When would you like to go back to Tai City?

27
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,680
I'll book the tickets for us. I'm going with you.

28
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,800
Nianchu,

29
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,360
are you okay?

30
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,310
Nianchu...

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,760
- What's wrong with you?
- Sorry, my bad.

32
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,160
Lee.

33
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,960
Sorry, she took you for someone else.

34
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,900
=Mysterious Love=
(All the parting is for better meeting)

35
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,780
=Episode 9=

36
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,470
Xia!

37
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,520
Xia!

38
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,380
(Xia Fei, 1982.6.27-2014.6.14)

39
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,040
Li.

40
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,320
You're back.

41
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,040
Yeah.

42
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,880
Where's Xia Fei?

43
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,790
Mrs. Xia,

44
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,830
he's carrying out a mission.

45
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,160
He'll be back soon.

46
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,000
Have some water.

47
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,640
Mrs. Xia,

48
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,200
Xia Fei is always on duty and doesn't have much
time to be with you.

49
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,440
Are you mad with him?

50
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,440
Of course.

51
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,200
We fought a lot

52
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,600
over this matter.

53
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,600
It nearly stopped us from getting married.

54
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,390
However,

55
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,200
everyone has got their own fate.

56
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,070
And it is the fate

57
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,110
that brought Xia to me.

58
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,070
You're coming for that girl, are you?

59
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,950
That girl

60
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,480
is your own fate.

61
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,350
Li,

62
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,270
you can't run away with it.

63
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,880
When my child grows up,

64
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,790
Xia will be back.

65
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,920
Meeting him

66
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,350
is the best thing that happened in my life.

67
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,070
If you could start it all over again,

68
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,200
would you still choose him?

69
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,670
Yes.

70
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,040
What are you doing here?

71
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,510
I'm giving you a lift to work.

72
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,880
I've already called a cab.

73
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
This is for you.

74
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,390
For what?

75
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
I want you to be my girlfriend.

76
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,510
What's the matter with you?

77
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,480
I'm asking you seriously to become my girlfriend.

78
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, next time before you make decision,

79
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,640
will you go ask my opinion first?

80
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,200
Take my opinion into consideration,

81
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,830
will you?

82
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,790
Like what?

83
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,040
Like...

84
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,110
Should I ask you before I kiss you?

85
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,390
You are impossible!

86
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,510
My car has arrived. Don't follow me.

87
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,760
So,

88
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,640
you love me!

89
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,840
Yes!

90
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,200
I love you too!

91
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,080
I can't go on like this.

92
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,000
Everyone!

93
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,440
I know the play,
"Return under the Moon Over the Hill",

94
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,790
is hitting a bottle neck?

95
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,520
But I want to tell you,

96
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,320
today,

97
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,110
I've got us a helper!

98
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,880
Guozhi?

99
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,960
Nianchu, why are you here?

100
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,590
- Why are you...
- Let me introduce him formally.

101
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,710
This is the famous art director,

102
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,150
Chen Guozhi!

103
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,030
Let's give him a warm welcome!

104
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,030
Welcome to Morninglight Troupe!

105
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,520
Nice to meet you. You can call me Guozhi.

106
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,150
I'm now the art director.

107
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,280
Have you ever heard of "Bian City Drama Festival?"

108
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,440
This time, Mr. Zhao and I

109
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,910
are going to lead the troupe,

110
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,200
and win the champion in the festival!

111
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,080
How wonderful!

112
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,590
Well, but we only have three days.

113
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,880
Have we got enough time?

114
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,840
We do.

115
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,640
We'll head for Bian City tomorrow,

116
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,280
and start the rehearsal as soon as possible.

117
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,550
I believe in our troupe,

118
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,880
Mr. Zhao and I will lead us forward.

119
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,520
And we will get the first place, okay?

120
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,080
We'll try our best.

121
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,760
Guys,

122
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,640
to show our welcome to Mr. Chen,

123
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,550
let's eat out at the Yuncui Hotel tonight.

124
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,710
It's on me.

125
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,400
Let's clock off now!

126
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,320
And Mr. Li,

127
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,670
are you going with us today?

128
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,400
My pleasure.

129
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,840
Okay.

130
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Why the man I love the most

131
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,790
is the father of the girl I hate?

132
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,110
Love is a matter between the two of you.

133
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,030
Age is not a problem. Nothing stops true love.

134
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,150
I don't care for age.

135
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,550
That's good.

136
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,590
Love is something

137
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,640
that will reap what you sow.

138
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,960
If you have already figured this out,

139
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,200
stop caring about his age,

140
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,350
or the trouble of his daughter.

141
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,110
A lot of May-December Romance ends up well.

142
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,150
Whatever.

143
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,710
You don't understand.

144
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,140
Love needs mutual understanding,
tolerance and acceptance.

145
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,220
If you love him,

146
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,110
you accept him as a whole.

147
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,910
What did you say?

148
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,640
You have to accept your lover as a whole.

149
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,710
His age, his appearance, and his daughter.

150
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,910
They're all parts of him.

151
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,080
You're right.

152
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,670
Why are you still leaving?

153
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,790
To deal with his daughter.

154
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,320
Mr. Chen, please...

155
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,030
Help yourself.

156
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,960
Thank you.

157
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,000
You're being generous, Mr. Zhao.

158
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,400
It's the best dinner I've ever had since I
joined our group.

159
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,030
This is way better than how he treated Mr. Li.

160
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,710
Way better.

161
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,320
Mr. Chen.

162
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,110
It looks like a piece of plain salmon,

163
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,590
but it's the specialty of this place.

164
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,790
Really?

165
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,000
Let me try.

166
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,280
It's so good.

167
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,670
Let's propose a toast.

168
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,150
Wish us success,

169
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,760
under the leadership of Mr. Zhao and I,

170
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,110
shall we?

171
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,080
Thank you.

172
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,200
The first time I came here,

173
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,030
they welcomed me like this.

174
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,760
And then you came.

175
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,320
Now,

176
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,550
here comes some art director or what.

177
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,590
Nianchu,

178
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,000
how long have you been here?

179
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,150
Four years.

180
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,670
I saw your public performance several days ago,
and it was fantastic.

181
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,150
- It's called...
- Li Ke Chu Lian.

182
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,030
Li Ke Chu Lian.

183
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,640
And who is this?

184
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,110
He is the famous Li Teng,

185
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,320
founder of the Yuntai Group.

186
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,080
Mr. Li.

187
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,000
He has offered a lot of help

188
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
to our troupe.

189
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,590
Really?

190
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,960
Thank you for taking care of us.

191
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,710
No problem.

192
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,200
It's my pleasure to take care of Nianchu's troupe.

193
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,230
Well...

194
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,400
It's what I should do.

195
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,520
Are they alright?

196
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,350
They don't look like they get along.

197
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,590
What is this noise?

198
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,080
I'm in the bathroom.

199
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,840
Disgusting. I'm gonna hang up now.

200
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,030
Don't, please.

201
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,590
This is out of control.

202
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,320
What happened? Tell me.

203
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,200
Li Teng.

204
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,080
He's following me everywhere.

205
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,200
He's giving me flowers, and he doesn't allow me to
talk to Chen Guozhi.

206
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,880
I can only hide in the bathroom to talk to you.

207
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,470
Chen Guozhi?

208
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,840
Chen Guozhi!

209
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,400
The one we went to college with.

210
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,670
He is now the art director of our troupe.

211
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,670
He's coming at the right time!

212
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,550
Aren't you going to test Li Teng?

213
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,440
You use him.

214
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,400
Do you know why you failed in your last relationship?

215
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,080
You're carried away by Li Teng!

216
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,030
This time,

217
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,440
you'll have to hold yourself up.

218
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,640
You gotta know,

219
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,110
people never cherish things that are easily being got.

220
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,080
Let's cut it out. My arm is getting tired.

221
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,030
We're going to Bian City to attend a show.

222
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,960
Are you coming?

223
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,400
Bian City?

224
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,320
Sounds far.

225
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,440
You can write your novel anywhere!

226
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,440
I am waiting at Jiang Hao's door step now.

227
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,840
I'm aiming at Jiang Xingxing.

228
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,110
Good job, Qiao Yufei,

229
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,280
men before friends.

230
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,280
Wish you good luck

231
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,790
with Jiang Xingxing!

232
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,230
You don't have to come with me. Goodbye.

233
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,790
I'm going with you.

234
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,710
Mr. Li,

235
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,200
please stop following me.

236
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,150
I want to focus on my work now.

237
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,840
I don't have time for you.

238
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,910
I support you and your career.

239
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,840
I got it! I got it!

240
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,200
Here, come.

241
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,110
My good girl.

242
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,640
(Li Teng)

243
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,760
Li.

244
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,710
I'm going to Bian City for the next days,

245
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,910
and you take care of Xingxing and the company.

246
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,150
But Xingxing wants to go with you.

247
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,670
Xingxing,

248
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,110
there might be a lot of trouble this time.

249
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,440
So stay at home and be good. Your daddy will be with you!

250
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,670
Li, what's wrong?

251
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Nothing.

252
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,000
Let's have a talk tonight.

253
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Sure.

254
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,280
I can't be daddy's burden.

255
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,910
Daddy has work to do.

256
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,150
And I shouldn't bother you.

257
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,910
I've already packed up my things.

258
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,520
Just take me to Ms. Huang now.

259
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,960
I'll be good.

260
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,640
Li,

261
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,640
how about we have our bros to check the place first?

262
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,200
So we can be at ease.

263
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,520
Xingxing, you can come with us.

264
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,110
- I'm going with daddy!
- I'm going with Xingxing!

265
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,670
Who is that?

266
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,320
Come on.

267
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,710
Miss Qiao.

268
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,350
Hello, Xingxing.

269
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,320
What's this...

270
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,230
I bought Xingxing some presents.

271
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,350
These are toys and snacks.

272
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,710
Check this! This is from Enchanted!

273
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,070
Save it. You can't buy me over.

274
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,470
This is a little token of me!

275
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,310
I'm not buying you over!

276
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,880
I'm going to Bian City with my daddy.

277
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
You don't have to waste your time here!

278
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,800
Xingxing,

279
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,160
it's not polite for you to speak like that.

280
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,040
Sorry, Miss Qiao.

281
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,230
Well,

282
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,800
can I ask several days leave from the work?

283
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,430
I have a kid.

284
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,830
It's okay. We can go together.

285
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,190
Morning,

286
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,680
Nianchu.

287
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,560
Morning, Guozhi.

288
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,830
Here's your breakfast.

289
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,190
- No, thanks.
- Take it.

290
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,040
Everyone has got their share.

291
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Well, thank you.

292
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,680
Leave it to me.

293
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,710
Thanks.

294
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,590
You get on first.

295
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,350
Morning, Mr. Zhao.

296
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,470
This is so good! Try this.

297
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,640
You, too.

298
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,920
I thought you're not coming.

299
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,070
I gave it a second thought,

300
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,040
and how can you be without me in this important moment!

301
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,310
Toxic friends, are they?

302
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,430
Xingxing!

303
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,000
I want to be friend with you too!

304
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,110
Have you read the new play script?

305
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,800
I did.

306
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,470
There's a line that makes me laugh!

307
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,830
Guozhi.

308
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,230
Nianchu,

309
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,310
what's your relationship with Li Teng?

310
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,760
We don't have any relationship.

311
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm her boyfriend.

312
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,040
Mr. Li.

313
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,920
The show has started.

314
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,230
Ex-boyfriend. We don't have relationship now.

315
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,680
Everyone, this is Mr. Li of the Yuntai Cooperation.

316
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,470
He offered us this car.

317
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,830
Let's thank him for this.

318
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,800
Thank you, Mr. Li.

319
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
Guozhi, you have water with you?

320
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,110
Yeah, I'll go fetch it.

321
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,470
Thanks.

322
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,070
Excuse me.

323
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,760
Don't sit here.

324
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,520
You've been preparing to come with me, right?

325
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,430
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

326
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,800
You got to be kidding me?

327
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,760
Bingo.

328
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,830
What on earth do you want?

329
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,070
Ruan Nianchu,

330
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,760
you had me missing you for all these years.

331
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,350
What do you think I want?

332
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,560
How fun it is to watch drama.

333
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,160
You want to sit here?

334
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,710
Don't peek!

335
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,230
Go away.

336
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,470
Don't peek !

337
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,470
Why can't I?

338
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,160
I tell you she's going to feel embarrassed!

339
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,430
Li, we have already checked the mansion in Bian City.

340
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,350
All clear.

341
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,760
There you go, Nianchu.

342
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,230
- Here's your water.
- Thank you, Guozhi.

343
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,640
I'll sit next to you.

344
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,350
Let me help.

345
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,230
- Thanks.
- There.

346
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,880
Listen carefully!

347
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,920
I want to drink it.

348
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,190
Fight! Fight!

349
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:54,920
Nianchu,

350
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,640
do you want to listen to a song?

351
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,830
Sure.

352
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,400
I want to listen!

353
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,280
- Guozhi, I'll tell you a joke.
- Yes, please.

354
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,070
There is a white cat who fell into a pond.

355
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,430
And a black cat happened to walk by and saved her.

356
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,470
Guess what did the white cat say to the black one?

357
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,830
What?

358
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,430
Just guess.

359
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,400
I have no idea.

360
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,400
She said "Meow!"

361
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,830
- I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

362
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,590
Thank you.

363
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,310
Never mind.

364
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,560
Well...

365
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,760
My hair!

366
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,350
Who do you think Nianchu likes?

367
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,950
What do you think?

368
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,160
No idea.

369
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,160
Look!

370
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,520
The mansion is amazing!

371
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,430
Mr. Zhao, you're so generous!

372
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:04,980
Daddy!

373
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,880
Did Mr. Zhao pay for this place?

374
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,400
You're making fun of me.

375
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,880
I don't have half of the money.

376
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,920
Everyone,

377
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,830
Mr. Chen has paid for this

378
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,160
with his own money!

379
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,710
Let's thank him!

380
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,590
- Thank you Mr. Chen!
- No biggie.

381
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,680
Mr. Li paid for the car.

382
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,760
And Mr. Chen paid for the mansion.

383
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,880
They're really on this now.

384
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,000
No rules for love and war!

385
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,430
The triangle love show is on!

386
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,310
What will happen to our dear Nianchu!

387
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,430
Let's decide our rooms.

388
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,280
How exciting!

389
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,800
The two rooms in the back are double rooms.

390
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,000
These two rooms are for three people.

391
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,230
Decide the room for yourself.

392
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,560
Very well.

393
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,230
We four girls can share the double rooms.

394
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,110
Nianchu, you can stay with Shiqi.

395
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,310
It will be easier for you to rehearse.

396
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,280
I'll take care of Xingxing.

397
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,640
You decide the rest.

398
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,680
Xingxing needs bed time stories before sleep.

399
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,880
Can you take care of her?

400
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,070
Daddy, I can stay with auntie Qiao.

401
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,230
You're so sweet. Auntie Qiao will take good care of you.

402
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,830
We'll have to share rooms like this.

403
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,830
You can't mix girls with boys.

404
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,230
Here, Nianchu.

405
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,040
Thank you.

406
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,950
You decide the rest for yourselves.

407
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,920
Let's go, Xingxing.

408
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,110
Come on.

409
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,040
Alright, I'm heading for my room.

410
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,430
Mr. Zhao snores like thunder.

411
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,110
Only Gao Bo and I can stand it.

412
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,470
- Here's your key.
- Have I been snoring?

413
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,280
Jiang Hao...

414
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,920
Have you ever heard me snoring?

415
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,400
Please take care of Li Teng.

416
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,760
It's only for a few days.

417
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,430
Don't let him make any fuss.

418
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,310
Well, why don't you tell him yourself.

419
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,950
Me?

420
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,070
Who am I to say this to him?

421
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,950
Why do I bother...

422
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,190
Whatever.

423
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,710
It's none of my business.

424
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,520
Give it to me.

425
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,710
Thanks.

426
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,710
Mr. Li and Mr. Chen are both paying a lot of
attentions to you.

427
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,560
They are fighting for your love!

428
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,070
Gosh, isn't this dramatic?

429
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,800
It's a living soap opera!

430
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,800
Nianchu,

431
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,800
this is the hot tea from Mr. Chen.

432
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,070
And this is the icy water from Mr. Li!

433
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,920
Which one would you like to choose?

434
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,110
What are you talking about?

435
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,350
Mr. Li is nice,

436
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,680
but he makes me feel cold! You should not get
too close to him.

437
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,800
But Mr. Chen is different!

438
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,190
He's warm, gentle and considerate!

439
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,310
He suits you better.

440
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,430
Are you...

441
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,640
Are you spilling tea behind me again?

442
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,110
How could we?

443
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,110
Here.

444
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,000
Why are you drinking hot tea in this weather?

445
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,110
Concentrate on our rehearsal.

446
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,830
We've only got three days ahead.

447
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,800
Got it.

448
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,110
I need some fresh air.

449
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,470
What do you mean, Mr. Li.

450
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,230
Don't you even think about leaving this room tonight.

451
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,190
Who do you think you are?

452
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,560
Nianchu is my girl.

453
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,760
Well,

454
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,590
I'm more interested

455
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,400
in Nianchu.

456
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,880
