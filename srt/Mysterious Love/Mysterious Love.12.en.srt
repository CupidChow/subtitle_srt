(Seven years ago)

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,430
Mrs. Xia,

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,390
is this embroidered by you?

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,230
Yes.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,310
So cool!

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,390
Put it down.

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,550
What if it's broken?

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,630
I just touched it and wouldn't break it.

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,310
Unbelievable!

10
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,440
Come on, dinner is ready.

11
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,120
- Hurry up!
- Cut it out!

12
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:24,950
This is the last dish.

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,310
Thank you!

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,470
Let's have a change in diet.

15
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,000
Try your master's cooking.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,430
- Give me first.
- Master did it?

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,590
Serve my wife some juice first.

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,200
Pass me your cup.

19
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,590
Thank you,master.

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,080
Thank you, Fei.

21
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,400
Let me try it first to see if it's edible?

22
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,470
There must be no problem,
because it's cooked by my master!

23
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,720
Very good!

24
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,150
Let's make a toast

25
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,430
that Jiang Hao could graduate successfully.

26
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,360
We also congratulate master on becoming a dad
in his autumn year. Bottom up!

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,230
Look at what you said.

28
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,720
Master, he always bullies me.

29
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,830
I think you should do something about it.

30
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,800
I think he did a right thing.

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,910
Well, let's dig in!

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,270
Fei,

33
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,720
what name do you want to give to your child?

34
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,120
Call her Xingxing.

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,550
Lihua likes to see the star in summer,

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,830
so we will call her Xia Xingxing.
[*Star pronounces xingxing in Chinese]

37
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,080
No wonder

38
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,910
Mrs. Xia embroidered stars on that handkerchief.

39
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,550
So you want my master to miss you
when he sees that.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,720
Nonsense!

41
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,480
I just embroidered that for Xingxing.

42
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,000
Lihua said

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,080
when I'm out on a mission

44
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,510
and miss our child,

45
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,080
just look up at the stars in the sky.

46
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,870
The stars are like my daughter.

47
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,630
We are expecting the baby next month,

48
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,550
and I will try to come back soon
to accompany you.

49
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,040
We greet Xingxing's coming together.

50
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,190
- Ok?
- Yes.

51
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,950
- Let's eat!
- Ok.

52
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,550
I wish your mission a complete success.

53
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,670
So that you can come back early to
accompany Mrs. Xia.

54
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,470
Thank you.

55
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,160
Cheer up!

56
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,060
=Mysterious Love=
(All the parting is for better meeting)

57
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,980
=Episode 12=

58
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,910
She is temporarily out of danger.

59
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,960
But as parents,

60
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,160
why don't you know that
your child is allergic to mango?

61
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,080
Sorry.

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,600
That's my fault.

63
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,440
I'm not a qualified dad.

64
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,520
As a mother,

65
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,360
you should pay more attention to your child.

66
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,390
The child was allergic to mango,

67
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,750
and you didn't even notice it.

68
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,440
It spread to the whole body
when she was sent here.

69
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,470
She fainted because she actually couldn't
support herself.

70
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,830
Doctor,

71
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,030
it's me let Aunt Qiao

72
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,320
buy the mango for me.

73
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,880
Why would you say so?

74
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,470
You should scold me at this time.

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,630
Aunt Qiao,

76
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,720
you are so ugly when you cry.

77
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,630
Sorry.

78
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,670
I got it wrong.

79
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,720
You are not her mother.

80
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,390
It's ok. I will be her mother sooner or later.

81
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Ok, I'll go to work first.

82
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,830
You can find me in my office at any time
if you have any problem.

83
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,760
Thank you, doctor.

84
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,160
Are you ok?

85
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,950
You hurt so badly!

86
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,510
Why did you say that it was a minor injury?

87
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,760
It's ok.

88
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,600
Hold on!

89
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,480
I'm fine.

90
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,160
Can you move?

91
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
Hold on, please!

92
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,200
Hello.

93
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,950
Hello.

94
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,320
Hey, Jiang Hao.

95
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,760
- Li Teng and I got into some trouble.
- What's wrong with you?

96
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,640
Where are you now?

97
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
We are in...

98
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,160
We are in...

99
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,920
Hello?

100
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,320
Hello?

101
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,480
Hello?

102
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,350
Hello?

103
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
What happened, Hao?

104
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,040
Li and Nianchu got into trouble.

105
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,830
You call the police right now.

106
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,270
Hello.

107
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,200
- I need to report something.
- Hao.

108
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,320
Yes, I am in urgent need now.

109
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,880
You stay here to accompany Xingxing.

110
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,550
Let Shitou and me find Li.

111
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,510
Yes, Hao.

112
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,550
We go find them.

113
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,160
You just stay here to take care of Xingxing.

114
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,230
And the police will help us.

115
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,670
Dad,

116
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,350
you also go to rescue Li.

117
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,350
Aunt Qiao will stay with me.

118
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,550
That's right.

119
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,000
I can look after Xingxing.

120
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,480
Don't worry.

121
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,040
Xingxing, be a good girl.

122
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,270
Dad will just leave for a while.

123
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,040
I'll be come back soon.

124
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,550
I know.

125
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,720
Xiaowei,

126
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,600
you stay here

127
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,270
and watch out suspicious people.

128
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,320
Shitou, you come with me.

129
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,830
Ok.

130
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,640
Don't worry, Hao.

131
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,390
Why the phone battery is dead at this time!

132
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,950
Hold on.

133
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,600
Li Teng!

134
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,510
Look!

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,880
This should be the house of the mountain guard.

136
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,790
Let's stay here for one night.

137
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,510
Are you ok?

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,720
Ruan Nianchu,

139
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,110
Daen is not a man to be trifled with.

140
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,000
They are acting under cover
while you are in the open.

141
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,720
You should have a peaceful life.

142
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,760
You shouldn't be involved into this.

143
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,350
Five years ago,

144
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,160
I thought I'd never see you again.

145
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,640
But

146
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,480
timing was fatally flawed.

147
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,390
So Ruan Nianchu,

148
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,920
you should take good care of yourself.

149
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
I don't want you to get hurt for me anymore.

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,200
Are you still angry?

151
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,950
You explained everything to me clearly
in the flower fields.

152
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,040
And I haven't really been mad at you.

153
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,110
It's just...

154
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,390
Just what?

155
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,670
I hope whatever happens in the future,

156
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,880
we can face it together.

157
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,640
In the future,

158
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,600
I, Li Teng,

159
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,350
promise to not keep secrets from you!

160
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,030
Ruan Nianchu,

161
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,910
I could protect you five years ago.

162
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,640
I can do it now.

163
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,640
Just sleep for a while.

164
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,640
The sun will rise soon.

165
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:50,140
♪again and again.
Just let me suppress it alone♪

166
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,260

168
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,520
Hao,

169
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,320
Nianchu didn't make it clear on the phone.

170
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,670
How do you know where Li is?

171
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,670
When Li left, he was reading
a travel guide of the Bian City.

172
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,400
And he had been reading the Forget-me-Not page.

173
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,670
Here we are.

174
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,840
They didn't drive the car,

175
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,520
and it's still raining.
I'm sure they won't be far.

176
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,910
Let me search here.

177
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,960
- You go there.
- Ok.

178
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,230
Li Teng.

179
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,110
I'm so cold.

180
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,470
Why are you awake?

181
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,710
Are you feeling better?

182
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,400
You stayed with me all night like this,

183
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,880
and I would be healed from any injury.

184
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,200
There should be a clinic in the village.

185
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,520
I'll go and find it.

186
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,000
Don't go.

187
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,320
Isn't there a show this afternoon?

188
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,150
Let's go back.

189
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,350
Don't be late for that.

190
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,840
But your injury.

191
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,440
I'm afraid you won't last that long.

192
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,590
Let me check.

193
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,150
Do you remember
what I said to you in the Yun City?

194
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,960
I said I supported you and your career.

195
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,590
Let's go now.

196
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,440
If we don't leave,

197
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,320
your fans will complain about me.

198
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,000
Be careful.

199
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,350
Hao,

200
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,000
the police are here now.

201
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,710
We looked all over the area

202
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,520
and couldn't find them.

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,760
Hello.

204
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,110
Hello, Jiang Hao.

205
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,350
Li, where are you now?

206
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,790
We've found the shed where you stayed

207
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,640
and your car.

208
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,470
Where are you?

209
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,790
Nianchu and I have got on a transporter.

210
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,550
We have to hurry to the show.

211
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,470
Both our phones are out of battery.

212
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,280
As long as you two are okay.

213
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,710
I've already contacted the tow company.

214
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,910
They'll tow our car away later.

215
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,670
Ok.

216
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,550
Then I'll leave with Shitou
when things are done.

217
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,230
Ok.

218
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,760
Thank you.

219
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,280
You're welcome. We are on my way.

220
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,910
Are you ok?

221
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,760
We go to the hospital
as soon as we get to the Bian City.

222
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,550
No.

223
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,200
We go to the show first.

224
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,080
I will just change my clothes

225
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,790
and treat the wound simply.

226
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,590
Can we get to the Bian City at three o'clock?

227
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,790
Yes, we can.

228
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,200
We still need two more hours.

229
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,760
Based on your wife's accent,

230
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,030
she's not a local.

231
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,550
She is the one I kidnapped in the Yun City.

232
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,280
If you can kidnap such a beautiful wife,

233
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,110
it means you are really capable.

234
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,540
(Return under the Moon Over The Hill
Wang Zishuai Mr. Ding)

235
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,140
(Wang Dandan plays the role of Eyuan
Return under the Moon Over The Hill)

236
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,840
Come on.

237
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,030
Mr. Li, are you feeling alright?

238
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,640
Don't worry, Mr. Zhao.

239
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,000
- You can make it, right?
- Yes.

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,590
Fine.

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,840
Sorry.

242
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,590
I'm late because I just finished
the discharge procedure.

243
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,550
Are you feeling better, Xingxing?

244
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,520
Still uncomfortable?

245
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,200
I'm fine.

246
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
And you?

247
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,030
I heard you were ill, too.

248
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,840
I'm fine, too.

249
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,280
Look!

250
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,470
Sit down.

251
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,150
You are so silly

252
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,670
that you don't grasp the chance to make money.

253
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,550
If you think I'm silly,

254
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,790
I admit it.

255
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,590
Actually I am.

256
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,000
I have no fame,

257
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,760
and have no money.

258
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,790
But the master had told us that

259
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,550
if there is one thing
you can do well in your life,

260
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,960
it is perfection.

261
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,660
(Return under the Moon Over The Hill)
Good!

262
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,200
That's perfect!

263
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,080
We are still late.

264
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,080
Good show!

265
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,440
Good!

266
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,190
Well done!

267
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,710
Bravo!

268
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,640
I really appreciate your efforts today.

269
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,400
We did work well together.

270
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,400
We're gold partners.

271
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,680
Nianchu.

272
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,590
Who is this?

273
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,680
It's me.

274
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,040
Thank you, my sweet.

275
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,470
I heard that you are allergic to mango.

276
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,230
I'll be angry at one who mentions mango.

277
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,400
Ok, let's forget about it.

278
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,520
Congratulations!

279
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,590
Xingxing.

280
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,800
A good show.

281
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,920
Thank you Mr. Li.

282
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,560
Li Teng!

283
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
- Li!
- Mr. Li!

284
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,280
- What's wrong?
- Li Teng!

285
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,310
Doctor, how is he?

286
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,040
He just had an abdominal injury.

287
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,640
Fortunately, it didn't hurt the internal organs.

288
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,710
And his own physical quality is good.

289
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,470
Don't worry.

290
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,680
It's not life-threatening.

291
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,560
Thank you!

292
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
- Thank you doctor.
- Ok. Find us if you need.

293
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,830
In order to let me perform at ease,

294
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,830
from the Stone-house to the show,

295
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,800
he's been putting up with it.

296
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,110
It's not only just three hours.

297
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,520
Li

298
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,950
has been waiting for you for five years.

299
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,560
Doctor, how is he?

300
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,920
Pretty good.

301
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,920
This is a miracle of medicine!

302
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,710
But

303
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,640
please stay here for more days.

304
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,880
Take a good look.

305
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,560
I know.

306
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,520
From explosion in the Tai City,

307
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,950
since the day Li stayed at the hospital,

308
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,040
he was in a vegetative coma.

309
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,920
He had slept for three years.

310
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,040
The first thing he said when he woke up is

311
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,520
where is Ruan Nianchu.

312
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,160
I didn't know who you were at that time.

313
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,190
Later, he often read your weibo

314
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,560
and saw your photos.

315
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
In his heart,

316
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,230
you're really important!

317
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,070
Nianchu,

318
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,280
actually, what Li had done is

319
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,830
just to be with you.

320
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,070
He gave more than you can imagine.

321
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,350
Today,

322
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,190
I watched 'See you now',

323
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,160
and I was sad.

324
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,000
Li.

325
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You wake up!

326
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,760
Nianchu, I'll get the doctor.

327
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,760
Ok.

328
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
You wake up.

329
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:48,000
Who made my Nianchu cry like this?

330
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,920
Is your wound still hurt?

331
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,470
Yes.

332
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,430
That's where you got the injury five years ago.

333
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,710
Now there's a new cut.

334
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,560
The previous wound is on the right,

335
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,040
and now the new one is on the left.

336
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,680
Just like

337
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,710
two artificial fishing lines.

338
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,350
So I don't have to do exercise later.

339
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:46,700
(A few days later)

340
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,520
Just a moment and I'll open the door for you.

341
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,590
Thank you, He Hu.

342
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,230
It's been hard for you these days.

343
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,560
You're welcome. Nianchu.

344
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,280
Li told me

345
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,190
to drive you back.

346
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,640
How is your wound?

347
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,160
I brought you soup from home.

348
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,880
Not good.

349
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,070
Without you,

350
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,830
my wound will not recover.

351
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,350
Once you come here, I almost recover.

352
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
Let me see.

353
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,280
Let me see your wound.

354
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,800
What are you doing?

355
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,710
You want to take off my clothes
as soon as you enter the door.

356
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,430
Stop that.

357
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,000
Are you ok?

358
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,760
Sit down.

359
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,230
The wound...

360
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,920
Are you sure you don't need a bandage?

361
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,590
It takes half a month
for other's wounds to heal.

362
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,110
Is it really ok?

363
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,590
Ruan Nianchu,

364
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,280
am I off the probationary period?

365
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,430
Of course not.

366
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,640
No?

367
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,800
I'm not?

368
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,760
It's time to change the password.

369
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,190
Am I interrupting you guys?

370
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,470
Just say it!

371
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,230
Chen Guozhi's tracking signal
has returned to the Yun City,

372
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,070
but it suddenly disappeared.

373
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,520
Maybe he found the tracker and destroyed it.

374
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,560
The person who has been hunting you down
is called Duan Kun.

375
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,160
He was dispatched by Daen.

376
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,800
That's all.

377
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,590
They're not going to stop there.

378
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,350
Be sure to crack the chip quickly.

379
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,830
I know.

380
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,920
- Can you give me a ride?
- We're not on the same way.

381
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,350
Where are you going?

382
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,680
I...

383
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,430
We have something to do.

384
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
We still have much time.

385
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,760
I have to go back and change my clothes.

386
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,000
Just change there.

387
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,520
No door there.

388
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,800
Do we need a door?

389
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,280
A great responsibility will descend upon us.

390
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,800
It's time to see whether you are a gentleman.

391
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,470
No peeking!

392
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,430
How did you know I use Adolf?

393
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,350
I know

394
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,590
everything about you.

395
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,880
Li Teng,

396
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,280
where's your hairdryer?

397
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,350
Let me help you.

398
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,110
I told you once that

399
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,000
I like the smell of your hair.

400
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,880
It makes me feel like
you are always there for me.
