I have no girlfriend.

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,600

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,770
- But at the banquet that day...
- Miss Ruan,

44
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,130
we're dating now.

45
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,440
Then have you ever heard of

46
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,170
a man named Lee?

47
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,010
Ruan Nianchu.

48
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,610
It's me who you are dating now.

49
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,800
Li Teng.

50
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,410
Don't mention any other man in front of me.

51
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,290
Your WeChat name is 0714.

52
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,800
Does it have any special meaning?

53
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,410
Nothing special.

54
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,080
Coincidentally,

55
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,130
July 14 is also the day when I met Li.

56
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,890
Miss Ruan,

57
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,450
I'm not a substitute for anyone.

58
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,690
If you can't get over with
the last relationship

59
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,040
and want to find that person in me,

60
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,200
then I advise you not to go on a blind date.

61
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,170
Get in.

62
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,360
Come and sit here.

63
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,890
No, thanks.

64
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,010
I want to sit in the back and have a rest.

65
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,320
What are you doing?

66
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,080
What?

67
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,690
What are you up to?

68
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,640
You...

69
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,890
What are you going to do?

70
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,040
You...

71
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,170
Put...

72
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,290
Put me down!

73
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,570
Put me down!

74
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,480
I'm not used to
communicating with my blind date

75
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,450
through the rear-view mirror.

76
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,170
I think Mr. Li looks handsome.

77
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,080
There should be a lot of girls chasing you.

78
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,480
How come you go on a blind date?

79
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,130
Aren't you also here for a blind date?

80
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,760
I did this to fool my mother.

81
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,920
Did you know before you came that

82
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,240
I was the girl
who sabotaged the banquet that day?

83
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,320
You choose your words quite well.

84
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,640
Yes, I knew that.

85
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,570
Then why are you still willing to come?

86
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,480
Could you tell me

87
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,130
anything about the relation

88
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,010
between these two things?

89
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,480
How about this?

90
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,170
Are you free tomorrow?

91
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,170
I'd like to buy you a meal in return.

92
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,690
It seems that

93
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,200
Miss Ruan is already looking forward

94
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,730
to the next meeting.

95
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,080
You're right.

96
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,320
Just tell me if you have time.

97
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,080
No.

98
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,760
Tomorrow we need to do the
security for an art exhibition.

99
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,570
Here we are.

100
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,200
Thanks for driving me home.

101
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,640
You...

102
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,810
Do you have anything else to say?

103
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,200
At such moment shouldn't you guys say

104
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,760
I'll leave after seeing you upstairs.

105
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,290
Bummer.

106
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,000
Did you see that?

107
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,000
Did you get it?

108
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,250
It was the first time that

109
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,680
she was sent home

110
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,170
after a blind date.

111
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,290
It has never happened before.

112
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,290
Sure.

113
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,370
Maybe there is hope of success this time.

114
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,820
Oh dear!

115
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,250
I'm home, mom and dad.

116
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,290
Both of you are so engrossed in
watching an advertisement.

117
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,680
Your acting skills are getting
better and better.

118
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,520
Of course.

119
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,200
How else would the two of us

120
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,370
have had such a good actress as you,

121
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,120
right?

122
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,520
Absolutely.

123
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,170
How was the blind date?

124
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,050
Just so so.

125
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,340
(WeChat Just now  0714  Picture)

126
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,760
You two didn't have a nice date.

127
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,200
Then why would
he was still willing to take you home

128
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,440
and you were still willing to
sit in the passenger seat?

129
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,370
I can't afford a taxi
by the end of the month.

130
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,880
Your dad and I also can't afford
to take a taxi.

131
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,760
Why no one has ever sent us home?

132
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,700
I'm telling you.
There must be hope of success this time.

133
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,730
Is that what you left behind?

134
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,410
The Qiao Yufei 24 Ways for
Attracting a Man really works.

135
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,050
He actually asked me.

136
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,290
I'd like to buy you a meal in return

137
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,050
when you are free.

138
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,120
No need.

139
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,760
What does that mean?

140
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,930
'Marriot Hotel'
Be here

141
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,320
(Marriot Hotel)
at 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

142
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,640
Yes.

143
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,760
It should be here.

144
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,050
Ruan Nianchu?

145
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,850
Is that Li Xiaoyan?

146
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,520
It kinda looks like her.

147
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,080
How strange you are.

148
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,490
You're worried I'm not going to rehearse,

149
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,810
so you followed me here.

150
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,490
You think too much, Miss Li.

151
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,610
I know you are different from those celebs

152
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,410
who pretend to be devoted.

153
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,680
I'm not worried about you
not going to rehearse.

154
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,610
That is to say,

155
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,250
you're here for the art exhibition, too.

156
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,120
It's grueling to queue up here.

157
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
It's too stuffy here.

158
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,930
Someone is picking me up, and I'll go first.

159
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,080
Hello, Miss Li.

160
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,680
Is there something wrong with your eyes,
Mr. Jiang?

161
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,880
What a coincidence to meet you here.

162
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,970
Miss Ruan,

163
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,520
Mr. Li asked me to take you in.

164
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,970
Who are you?

165
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,440
Don't you remember me?

166
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,410
The swift shark.

167
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,050
You forget that?

168
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,250
You saved me the other day.

169
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,290
Thanks a lot.

170
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,880
Never mind, that is what I should do.

171
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,170
This way, please.

172
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,640
Is that Ruan Nianchu?

173
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,560
I think so.

174
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,290
There she is.

175
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,000
You are The Bodyguard Trio?

176
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,080
Let me have a look.

177
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,050
Miss Ruan,

178
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,730
let me introduce you to

179
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,120
the backbones of our company.

180
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,730
This is Liu Xiaowei.

181
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,610
His character is as serious as his face.

182
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,490
This is Shitou.

183
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,490
For what can be solved with violence,

184
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,680
he will never solve with words.

185
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,440
Hi.

186
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,170
This is He Hu.

187
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,760
I entertained an angel unawares that day.

188
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,810
Please forgive me for being impolite,
Mrs. Li.

189
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,760
He is extremely fun,

190
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,050
but a bit over enthusiastic in character.

191
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,610
One, two, three.

192
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,610
Nice to see you, Mrs. Li.

193
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,440
I... I'm not your Mrs. Li.

194
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,370
We had better call that in our minds.

195
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,250
Mrs. Li is rather shy.

196
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,050
This way, please.

197
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,610
Take care, Mrs. Li.

198
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,730
Hush!

199
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,410
Would you please just stop calling me that?

200
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

201
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,170
this is our artist Fang Xu.

202
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,880
As you can see,

203
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,880
his works are unique in style

204
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,850
and invaluable.

205
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,000
Yuntai will send the most elite team

206
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,250
to cooperate with the organizers,

207
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,000
and then build the tightest security system.

208
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,080
Please wait here for a moment, Mrs. Li.

209
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,080
Mr. Li will come to see you soon
after his speech.

210
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,680
I have to get back to work.

211
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,560
We have made multiple emergency plans.

212
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,640
Small teams will also be arranged on site

213
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,050
for joint patrol

214
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,610
to ensure safety.

215
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,050
I appreciate your help. Thanks a lot.

216
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,170
Welcome to my art exhibition.

217
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,610
Please enjoy your visit.

218
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,290
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

219
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,120
Let's go and take a look around.

220
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,080
- Let's go.
- Okay.

221
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,120
- Thanks.
- Let's go and have a look.

222
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,730
He has numerous brilliant ideas.

223
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,930
Look, like this kind of...

224
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,610
Yes,

225
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,520
it looks very artistic.

226
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,290
Mr. Li,

227
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,170
what a coincidence.

228
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,120
Now it's a good time to pick up the face powder

229
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,880
I left in your car last time.

230
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,080
It turns out that the 24 Ways for
Attracting a Man has been used widely.

231
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,320
Why do you have to let me
be so explicit, Mr. Li?

232
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,640
Actually,

233
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,440
I just want to see you.

234
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,410
It was my duty to protect you before.

235
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,290
Before next work,

236
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,610
I think

237
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,050
there's no need for us to meet again.

238
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,810
Well...

239
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,680
Ruan Nianchu,

240
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,000
why are you so careless?

241
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,440
Thank you.

242
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,200
I have figured it all out.

243
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,680
The last time

244
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,080
you pretended to mistake him
for someone else

245
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
through calling his name.

246
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,640
You are full of tricks.

247
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,680
In order to seduce the rich,

248
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,810
the literary girl
will also use this kind of trick.

249
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,680
You have made a mistake.

250
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,320
It's me chasing Ruan Nianchu.

251
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,970
Do you still want to stay here？

252
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,560
Thank you for helping me out
in front of Li Xiaoyan.

253
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,250
How are you going to thank me?

254
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,560
Is there anything you can do

255
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,370
besides saying thanks?

256
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,250
I have nothing to do with Li Xiaoyan
except work.

257
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,320
I don't care about whatever
she says or does,

258
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,610
cause I can handle it.

259
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,610
Since you are so capable,

260
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,970
how about you take a taxi
back home later on your own?

261
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,520
Li Teng,

262
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,800

there is a rapport between us,

267
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,320
so we should get along better
than the others.

Ruan Nianchu,

284
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,280
I found a parking space.

285
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,010
I'll be able to stand in front of you
in a minute.

286
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,370
Why does he call in such a place?

287
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,160
Hello.

288
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,490
Hi.

289
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,920
I have work to do tomorrow.

290
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,370
- I can't accompany you to the park.
- Hello, are you going to leave?

291
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,440
Could you please move the car...

292
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,730
How could he ignore me completely?

293
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,800
Could you please move the car away?

294
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,800
Why don't you move the car?

295
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,320
Get off the car.

296
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,160
What are you up to?

297
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,200
I'm telling you.

298
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,610
I am not afraid of you in the broad daylight.

299
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,530
Moreover...

300
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,610
- This...
- Get off the car.

301
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,680
Let me help you park the car.

302
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,730
Eh?

303
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,320
I'll help you park.

304
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,560
Well, thanks a lot.

305
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,130
Sorry,

306
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,400
I just received an important call,

307
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,080
which wasted your time.

308
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,250
Forget about it.

309
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,490
I'm not in a hurry at all.

310
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,320
Excuse me, I have other fish to fry.

311
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,040
See you.

312
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,490
Cute guy!

313
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,680
Why don't you leave your phone call
before leaving?

314
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,970
A young man with noble temperament

315
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,040
came to me gently.

316
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,530
He had a mild and handsome face.

317
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,560
Under the dashing eyebrows

318
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,850
is a pair of intense blue eyes,

319
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,010
which makes me feel

320
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,250
captivated unconsciously.

321
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,800
Oh my God,

322
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,800
you have been talking about

323
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,650
your Prince Charming
since you entered the door.

324
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,490
Then why don't you let me see the photo?

325
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,490
I'd like to show you,

326
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,920
but my mind went totally blank
when I saw him.

327
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,800
I didn't even get a phone number,

328
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,920
not to mention a picture.

329
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,320
Then I can only wish

330
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,530
you and your Prince Charming
can meet again soon.

331
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,970
Well, I missed something important
when I entered the door.

332
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,280
What did you just tell me?

333
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,280
Nothing.

334
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,320
Anyway, I see right through you.

335
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,440
Our sisterhood

336
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,400
is nothing compared with your true love.

337
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,130
You're in love!

338
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,440
Hush!

339
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,440
You established your relationship
the first time you met with Li Teng

340
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,130
and you took the initiative.

341
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,770
Ruan Nianchu,

342
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,200
you have really surprised me.

343
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,200
Looks like I have to take a fresh look at you.

344
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,770
You've been totally indifferent

345
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,890
to love for five years.

346
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,730
But now, you choose to
establish a relationship

347
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,490
at the first meeting.

348
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,160
Well,

349
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,160
I just want to find out
if he is the Li or not.

350
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,970
Is there another reason?

351
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,680
Cut the crap.

352
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,610
You'd first help me
figure out a solution.

353
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,440
As a woman,
I've read tons of online novels

354
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,970
on Ganjiang Forum,

355
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,160
I am good at

356
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,250
debunking false amnesia.

357
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,010
First of all,

358
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,400
you can purposely mention
something about the past

359
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
to see his reaction.

360
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,010
I tried that.

361
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:01,970
He told me

362
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,680
to not mention any other men in front of him.

363
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,010
This Li Teng

364
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,770
seems to be really good at it.

365
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,370
Or try another way,

366
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,440
pluck his hairs.

367
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,850
Steal his toothbrush or water cup,
to get his genes

368
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,920
and then compare them with that Li.

369
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,770
I can't try this method.

370
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,130
Where can I find Li's genes five years ago?

371
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,440
You're right...

372
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,440
What should we do?

373
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,370
It seems that

374
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,970
you have to use the last means.

375
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,010
What kind of means?

376
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,320
The instinctive reaction of
human body cannot be disguised.

377
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,440
If you really want to know the truth,

378
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,010
you can

379
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,800
sleep with him.

380
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,040
What are you talking about?

381
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,730
Don't act bashful before me.

382
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,200
Didn't you two do push-ups together?

383
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,650
Or you can think about
whether he has any obvious marks,

384
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,890
like scars or something.

385
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,040
Scars...

386
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,920
Who is it?

387
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,970
What's up with you?

388
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:22,730
Li,

389
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,370
I'll go find the doctor.

390
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:24,970
Come here.

391
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,890
Do you think there will be a doctor
in this kind of place?

392
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,680
But what about your wound...

393
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,650
There are gauze and medicine in the drawer.

394
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,130
You...

395
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,080
Don't move.

396
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:14,920
You...

397
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,080
You're hurt.

398
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,040
You'd better sleep in bed today.

399
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,680
If I sleep in bed,

400
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,370
are you going to sleep with me?

401
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,280
That was originally your bed.

402
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,440
Don't worry about me.

403
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,850
Don't move.

404
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,250
Don't try to be brave when you are hurt.

405
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,130
Mr. Li,

406
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,730
I got an important piece of information.

407
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:27,920
Sit and tell me.

408
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,920
I found out
the real boss of that organization.

409
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,970
His name is Daen,

410
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,730
the son of the boss
who died in the explosion five years ago.

411
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,610
Have they done anything recently?

412
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,280
Don't worry about that.

413
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,800
The activity scope of that organization
is still in the Tai City.

414
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,530
Moreover,

415
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,560
there was little time
for the coin to emit signal,

416
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,800
so they probably
didn't receive any signals.

417
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,540
(Morninglight Troupe)

418
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,130
This signal
has never been transmitted again

419
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,160
after so many days.

420
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,850
This chip itself
has a locator trigger mechanism.

421
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,130
After the chip is inserted into
the mobile phone,

422
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,400
the locating signal will be enabled.

423
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,010
Once the chip is removed,
the signal will be disabled.

424
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,970
In that case,

425
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,130
the signal transmission at the time

426
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,130
was triggered by accident.

427
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,280
But even though

428
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,370
the signal was sent from

429
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,970
the Morninglight Troupe,

430
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,250
it does not necessarily mean that

431
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,080
the coin must be in Miss Ruan's hands.

432
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,970
The coin must have been brought back

433
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,400
from the Tai City five years ago,

434
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,920
and no one in the Morninglight Troupe
has this ability except her.

435
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,730
Everyone believes that

436
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,400
the coin was blown up five years ago,

437
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,130
including me.

438
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:42,490
We didn't expect that Nianchu brought
it back to the Yun City by accident.

439
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,730
What is this?

440
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,130
This is called fate.

441
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,160
I must get the coin as soon as possible

442
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,970
before Daen notices it.

443
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,440
She took so long to put on makeup.

444
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,490
She must be going on a date.

445
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,920
Yeah,

446
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,770
she does behave a bit strangely today.

447
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,490
Wait and see.

448
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,800
Maybe

449
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,730
there is hope of success this time.

450
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,800
Nianchu,

451
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,250
your phone keeps ringing.

452
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,970
Who is it?

453
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,320
Hello?

454
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,560
What time do you make it?

455
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,740
(9:30)
'Half past nine'

456
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,530
Ah, I just didn't look at the time
when I was putting on makeup.

457
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,130
How do you know my mobile number?

458
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,400
I'll give you ten minutes to go downstairs.

459
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,080
Well, ten minutes is not enough for me to...

460
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,040
You don't need to put on makeup

461
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,970
for I won't look at you anyway.

462
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,850
Well,

463
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,800
even if you don't look at me,

464
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,250
I'll meet others.

465
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,160
How can I meet others
without putting on makeup?

466
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,320
Ah, look at your clothes.

467
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,770
- This is how you wear clothes...
- I'm running late, mom and dad.

468
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,200
Who is waiting for you downstairs?

469
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,560
Is that the guy who drove you home

470
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,320
in the black jeep?

471
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,320
I have no time, and I have to go.

472
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,130
You...

473
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,130
This... this girl...

474
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,650
All right.

475
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,560
Where did he go?

476
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,200
Is this a new trick?

477
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,370
Let me see the photos you took.

478
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,280
It's beautiful!

479
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,680
That's because Xingxing is very cute.

480
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,890
Is this

481
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,080
your daughter?
