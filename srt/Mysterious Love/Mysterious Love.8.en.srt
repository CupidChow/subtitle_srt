Nianchu.

Nianchu.

00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,160
Things have changed in Tai City,

00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,680
but you can't give up.

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,480
Let's keep looking, shall we?

9
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,950
Ruan Nianchu,

10
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,230
I tell you...

11
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,270
Lee didn't save you to let you die

12
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,120
but to let you live well.

13
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,760
I don't want to die.

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,950
I just want to see him.

15
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,800
I want to see him.

16
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,510
I just want to tell him I never forget,

17
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,000
I never forget.

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,680
It's okay. It's okay.

19
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,120
It's okay.

22
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,670
I'll take full charge of your safety from now on.

23
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,390
Excuse me?

24
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,800
I'm hired by Miss Qiao

25
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,440
to protect you.

26
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,240
Hey Feifei, what's going on here?

27
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,320
You hired me a bodyguard?

28
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,360
Yes, of course.

29
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,550
It's a matter of life, after all.

30
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,270
But why it's Li Teng?

31
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,470
Hello? Nianchu, what did you just say?

32
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,520
The signal is bad here.

33
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,320
Mr. Jiang,

34
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,830
which one did you recommend just now?

35
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,360
Let's continue.

36
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,880
Okay.

37
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:49,340
(Adolph)

38
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,750
How do you know I use this one?

39
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,600
I'm familiar with your smell.

40
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,880
There's nothing about you

41
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,110
that I don't know.

42
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,480
I've been using other shampoos.

43
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,830
Hello, sir.

44
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,350
These are the latest products of Adolph.

45
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,390

which can solve your girlfriend's scalp
and hair problems

50
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,640
in all directions.

51
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,440
No...

52
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,760
Which one does she fit in?

53
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,830
It's better to use them together.

54
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,720
Different products bring different effects.

55
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,320
Oil-control and fluffy hair for cold care,

56
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,440
and roots strengthening for hot care.

57
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,600
You'll say goodbye to all your scalp problems

58
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,550
if you have them all.

59
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,550
I'm sure your girlfriend will be satisfied.

60
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,760
Who said I'm his girlfriend?

61
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,040
Well...

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,950
I'll take them all.

63
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,480
Yeah, no problem.

64
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,550
How am I gonna use up all of these?

65
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,000
Take your time, then.

66
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,550
Give me them. I'm fine going back alone.

67
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,830
You... you sure you're going back alone?

68
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,040
I'm one hundred percent sure.

69
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,390
Give them to me.

70
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,340
(Adolph)

71
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,320
Hello?

72
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,230
(Morninglight Troupe)
Hello, Nianchu,

73
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,670
(Morninglight Troupe)
I saw Mr. Li pick you up today.

74
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,200
How are things going between you guys?

75
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,230
Hey Shiqi,

76
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,720
you mentioned that

77
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,830
you wanted to arrange a blind date for me,
didn't you?

78
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,670
I want to see the guy.

79
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,600
Sure, leave it to me.

80
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,640
How about I schedule you three blind dates?

81
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,600
One of them will work out.

82
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,040
Great, thanks.

83
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,270
You move on so fast.

84
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,270
Go for a blind date right after a breakup.

85
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,270
I have to.

86
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,880
My Mom sets me a goal that

87
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,000
I must get married before I'm 30.

88
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,640
I'm leaving.

89
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,640
Haven't you learned  your lesson after the injury?

90
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,720
I'll drive you back.

91
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,230
Mr. Li.

92
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,790
We've broken up.

93
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,390
I don't want my Mom to get us wrong.

94
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,510
Take this with you.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,160
A bodyguard gives a lipstick as a gift.

96
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,040
You're bribing.

97
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,880
It's for your life saving, Miss Ruan.

98
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,390
It's an electric lipstick for self-defense.

99
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,640
It can discharge electricity.

100
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,070
Wow, Jiang Hao.

101
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,070
You're amazing.

102
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,950
Miss Qiao.

103
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,640
Actually we've got many weapons

104
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,270
for self-defense

105
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,550
which are easy to carry for girls.

106
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,950
You can take a look

107
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,950
if you're interested.

108
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,510
Now you get it.

109
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,160
Thanks.

110
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,720
Take this watch, for example.

111
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,510
It seems to be a mechanical watch

112
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,720
but there's GPS inside.

113
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,600
So you can share your location

114
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,480
with your friends anytime.

115
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,600
And this ring

116
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
can release 10,000 volts of voltage,

117
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,720
but...

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,160
As you can see, Miss Qiao,

119
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,110
the ring is beautiful

120
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,550
and a good match for you.

121
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,350
If...

122
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,880
Sorry.

123
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,200
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

124
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
I thought it's only a sample.

125
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,350
Are you all right?

126
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm fine.

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,320
Do what you did just now.

128
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,790
If there's a bad guy,

129
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,920
he'll have the same reaction like me.

130
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,920
So you see, Miss Qiao.

131
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,390
The weapons we've got here are really useful.

132
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,350
You...

133
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,200
You can directly ask me,

134
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,160
if there's something you don't know.

135
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,230
I think

136
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,230
these weapons are very impressive,

137
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,350
but...

138
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,790
But...

139
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,280
it's far from enough just having weapons.

140
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,440
Imagine that

141
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,000
if I'm controlled by someone

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,520
like this

143
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,840
and I couldn't move.

144
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,230
What am I supposed to do?

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,110
Miss Qiao.

146
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,230
Here's the thing.

147
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,520
When you're clasped like this

148
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,590
without techniques.

149
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,080
Clasped like this?

150
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,670
I need to know the feeling.

151
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,000
No.

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,110
No, no, no.

153
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,520
No.

154
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,230
Okay.

155
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,400
You play the bad guy.

156
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,550
You clasp me.

157
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,080
Like this

158
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,550
or like this?

159
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,470
No, no.

160
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,350
No.

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,840
Neither.

162
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,910
It's like this.

163
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,000
At this time,

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,640
bend your hands like a bowl

165
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,550
and then...

166
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,640
Bend like a bowl

167
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,710
and punch his ears

168
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,110
to cause tinnitus or eardrum perforation.

169
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,030
And then...

170
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,910
Go, go, go.

171
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,230
What's wrong? Go on.

172
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,590
Miss Qiao.

173
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,200
Let's call it a day.

174
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,400
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

175
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,320
I had a very nice lesson today.

176
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,200
Let's continue tomorrow.

177
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,960
Tomorrow... I need to be with my daughter.

178
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,840
It's okay.

179
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
The day after tomorrow then.

180
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,440
Come on.

181
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,960
You're really something, bro!

182
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,320
You scared me.

183
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,230
Someone can help you
take care of Xingxing soon.

184
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,640
You got a big mouth.

185
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,320
Have you sent Washa's latest location to Mr. Li?

186
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,880
Sir,

187
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,640
mission accomplished.

188
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,710
She's still at the Ferry Bar.

189
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,350
Hello.

190
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,640
Get ready for action.

191
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,350
Okay.

192
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,910
Where's Washa?

193
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,550
Washa?

194
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,200
Who's Washa?

195
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,320
Oh, it's her.

196
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,230
She just left.

197
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,350
The police was also here looking for her,

198
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,280
but

199
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,880
they seemed failed.

200
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,590
She's targeted by the police now.

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,150
She must have hidden.

202
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,350
You send someone to find her.

203
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:00,880
Yes, sir.

204
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,400
I've heard you are looking for me.

205
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,840
Mr. Daen.

206
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,030
We finally get in touch.

207
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,150
Go ahead.

208
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,030
Why are you looking for me?

209
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,640
Do you still remember

210
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,080
the lost coin in that trade

211
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,000
five years ago?

212
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,640
As the inheritor of the boss

213
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,280
don't you want to get it?

214
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,710
This file can

215
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,030
quickly help you get back on your feet.

216
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,520
What do you want?

217
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,150
One condition.

218
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,840
Kill the person who has the coin.

219
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,440
Yun City,

220
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,350
Morninglight Troupe,

221
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,840
Ruan Nianchu.

222
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,080
It's...

223
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,520
It's my first time having a date of three person.

224
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,520
I'm a little nervous.

225
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,710
Don't be.

226
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,280
Just pretend he doesn't exist.

227
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,000
So he is?

228
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,350
- Bodyguard.
- Boyfriend.

229
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,150
Bodyguard for now.

230
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,200
Boyfriend for the past.

231
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,590
What a special relationship!

232
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,110
I'd better leave you to it.

233
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,670
Before I come, I strongly believe

234
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,320
the lady and me may have similar interests,

235
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,880
but you take a man to a blind date.

236
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,960
What you've done is so unique.

237
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,350
You are also so unique.

238
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,030
Take a dog to a blind date.

239
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,350
It's my Si'gen.

240
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,760
My brother.

241
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,080
The girlfriend I choose

242
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,000
needs to be the taste of my Si'gen.

243
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,710
Come here.

244
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,030
Shake hands with the lady.

245
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,150
Hi, Si'gen.

246
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,550
Si'gen.

247
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,350
Si'gen, wait for me.

248
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,150
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

249
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,400
Dai Jie.

250
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,350
Nianchu.

251
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,280
Nice to see you again.

252
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,550
What brings you here?

253
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,470
Obviously, I haven't found a girlfriend.

254
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,790
Nice to see you again.

255
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,640
Yeah.

256
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Mr. Li.

257
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,710
Well...

258
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,760
I just remember

259
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,440
I've got an emergency to deal with.

260
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,520
I gotta go.

261
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,910
Keep in...

262
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,590
touch.

263
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,910
Dai Jie...

264
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,230
This date was meant to piss him off.

265
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,960
How come I am the loser?

266
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,150
Did  you do that on purpose?

267
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Why didn't you get out of my way?

268
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,590
Why were you sitting there folding your arms?

269
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
The dog was angry and ran away,

270
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,110
not to mention the people.

271
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,160
You tell me why.

272
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,680
How do I know what your problem is?

273
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,000
Girl.

274
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,000
It's my problem.

275
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,000
Why are you blushing?

276
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,680
Li.

277
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,310
Aunt Nianchu.

278
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,160
Xingxing.

279
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,230
Aunt Nianchu.

280
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,430
When are you coming to teach me
to play the piano?

281
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,640
I...

282
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,070
Miss Ruan.

283
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:27,920
We meet again.

284
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,400
What a coincidence.

285
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,560
That's right.

286
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,880
Focus on the shape of your hand.

287
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,400
Forefinger.

288
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,470
Am I doing it right, auntie?

289
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,830
You're doing a great job with the right hand.

290
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,040
Now let's use the left hand together.

291
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,950
Here we go.

292
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
No rush.

293
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,680
That's right.

294
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,760
We're ready to go

295
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,230
(Five years ago, abroad)
as soon as the signal detonator is transmitted.

296
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,920
(Five years ago, abroad)
This time

297
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,680
it's hard to predict whether we'll be alive or not.

298
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,310
As usual,

299
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,230
everyone makes a wish.

300
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,070
I go first.

301
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,470
I wish my 60 years old Mom

302
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,710
a long life

303
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,110
and a good health.

304
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,070
I...

305
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,590
I wish

306
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,190
I will be get married by the time I come home.

307
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,640
I wish

308
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,070
I can get tickets to my idol's concert

309
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,280
when the mission is accomplished.

310
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,880
I wish

311
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,110
the girl downstairs

312
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,470
will accept my love.

313
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,880
According to the due date,

314
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,590
my wife is going to give birth next week.

315
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,400
I wish the baby will be born safely

316
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,040
and Lihua can suffer less.

317
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,950
I'll fly back to you immediately

318
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,800
when the mission is accomplished.

319
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,190
We come together.

320
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,400
We fight together.

321
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,760
We live together.

322
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,000
We return together.

323
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,520
Our original aspiration is as hard as rocks.

324
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,040
Our mission is on our shoulders.

325
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,190
We shall successfully accomplish our mission,

326
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,190
crack down the evil forces,

327
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,760
and root out the troubles for our people.

328
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,880
Fight until

329
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,470
we've won complete victory.

330
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,800
Ready to attack.

331
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,920
Li,

332
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,950
wake up.

333
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,160
Aunt Nianchu is leaving.

334
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,800
The lesson finished so fast?

335
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
My Mom called me to have dinner at home.

336
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,070
Nianchu,

337
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,430
stay and have dinner with us.

338
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,920
Miss... Miss Ruan.

339
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,190
Who's that?

340
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,560
Jiang Hao.

341
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,280
Jiang Hao, Jiang Hao, Jiang Hao.

342
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,350
Jiang Hao.

343
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,000
Nianchu, here you are.

344
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,560
Don't you dare to ask me?

345
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,800
You throw yourself at us now.

346
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,880
I'm trying to save

347
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,760
the love between you and Mr. Li.

348
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,680
I tell you what.

349
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,710
The security charge of Yuntai is extremely high.

350
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,430
I didn't give it a second thought
when paying the bill

351
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,590
to save your love.

352
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,710
Am I right, Mr. Li?

353
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,190
Fine.

354
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,110
Thank you.

355
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,110
I gotta go.

356
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,040
Dad,

357
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,070
why does this aunt always come to our home?

358
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,590
Because your dad is my

359
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,190
bodyguard now.

360
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,710
No way.

361
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,230
Your dad will have to pay me a lot of money,

362
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,310
if he breaks the contract.

363
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,560
- Miss Qiao.
- How much do we need to pay?

364
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,070
Are these enough?

365
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,350
And these.

366
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,470
This is my favorite toy.

367
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,520
You can sell it for a lot of money.

368
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,280
Xingxing, come here.

369
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,760
Dad.

370
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,710
Miss Qiao.

371
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,760
Look,

372
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,590
I'll get back to you when I'm done here.

373
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,470
Okay?

374
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,920
Am I being kicked out?

375
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,710
Can't you just help me carry the food?

376
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,280
Can't you just show some sympathy?

377
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,710
I am holding you.

378
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,590
I am fanning you.

379
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,830
I am showing my sympathy.

380
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,000
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

381
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,110
Thanks.

382
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,520
Come on.

383
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,760
Thank you.

384
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,400
Let's go.

385
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,070
I'm home.

386
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,350
You can go.

387
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,800
What a coincidence!

388
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,160
You are here already.

389
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,000
Come up and have a seat.

390
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,950
Yeah, come up and have a seat.

391
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,560
Look,

392
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,110
we've bought so much food today.

393
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,160
Let your uncle...

394
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,560
Let me show off my cooking skills.

395
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,160
Show off my cooking skills.

396
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,190
Dad andMom,

397
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,190
Li Teng is gonna work late tonight.

398
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,350
He's not coming up.

399
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,040
He has to eat something before working.

400
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,310
He'll be in time for work

401
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,350
after joining us for dinner.

402
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,280
That's right.

403
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Come on.

404
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,000
Let me help you, uncle.

405
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,680
No, No.

406
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,830
Don't bother.

407
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,040
I'm coming up, then.

408
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,590
Help yourself.

409
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,350
Okay.

410
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,710
Niannian.

411
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,190
Niannian.

412
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,950
I told you to serve more food to Li.

413
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,110
He's had a long day but still driven you home.

414
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,190
You should show your hospitality.

415
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,800
Aunt, I'm not tired at all.

416
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,110
It's my responsibility.

417
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,680
You see.

418
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,880
How humble Li is!

419
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,040
He's so sweet.

420
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,710
Li,

421
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,680
there's a lot Niannian may trouble you

422
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,040
in the future.

423
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,310
Here.

424
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,470
You too, aunt.

425
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,830
Have some more.

426
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,110
The food uncle has cooked is really good.

427
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,760
Better than that in the restaurant.

428
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,920
I'm flattered.

429
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,110
It's far from that good.

430
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,560
I'll take you to dinner outside next time,

431
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
otherwise uncle is so tired cooking all the time.

432
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,920
No, I'm not tired at all.

433
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,430
That's great.

434
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,520
You take us there

435
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,880
when you're off work.

436
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,040
Next week.

437
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,950
I'm free next week.

438
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,230
Okay, it's a deal.

439
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,560
Here.

440
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,470
Listen,

441
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,350
our show has successfully

442
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,070
(Morninglight Troupe Group)
attracted attention from the industry.

443
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,560
Our troupe has received the invitation
of Bian City Drama Festival.

444
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,230
Tomorrow,

445
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,040
there's a big surprise waiting for you.

446
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,800
What surprise? Come on, Mr. Zhao!

447
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,160
- Is it bonus?
- Li.

448
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,040
- You wish.
- Let Niannian help you later.

449
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,070
Aunt, it's okay.

450
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,430
I'm almost done here.

451
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,710
Don't wash the pan. I'll wash it later.

452
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,350
It's okay. I'm washing it together.

453
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,830
Stop looking at your phone.

454
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,350
Hey you.

455
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,400
Go to help Li wash the dishes.

456
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,160
By the way,

457
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,680
you need to apologize to him.

458
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,000
Apologize?

459
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,710
Why would I apologize?

460
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,110
I didn't do anything wrong.

461
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,350
No.

462
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,590
I can see there're some problems
between you guys.

463
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,190
Mom's telling you.

464
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,760
Take a step back, and everything is brighter.

465
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,280
Just go.

466
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,470
Go, look at you.

467
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,950
Go, Go, Go.

468
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,880
Mom.

469
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,230
Go, Go.

470
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,710
I'm almost done here.

471
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,160
You can just rest.

472
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
How long are you gonna follow me?

473
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,560
Forget about the bodyguard contract.

474
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,590
You could have say No to Qiao Yufei's trick.

475
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,680
Until you're not angry anymore.

476
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,950
I'm not angry.

477
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,470
You don't need to pick me up from tomorrow.

478
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,710
I hope after we broke up,

479
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,560
you can let it go.

480
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,430
Can you protect yourself?

481
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,800
Mr. Li,

482
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
you think too highly of yourself.

483
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,800
Do you think

484
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,190
I can't live without you?

485
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,560
Nianchu, be a good girl.

486
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,800
I don't want you

487
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,520
to get any hurt.

488
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,640
But you are hurting me.

489
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,190
I...

490
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Okay.

491
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Let me ask you.

492
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,230
Will you appear in my life again

493
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,040
if the coin thing never happened?

494
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,430
Let go of me.

495
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,070
It seems you've practiced a lot.

496
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,950
So are you gonna still follow me?

497
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,880
Yes.

498
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,680
Li Teng.

499
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,280
Do you know what you really want?

500
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,830
Sometimes I really want to figure out

501
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,040
what's in your mind exactly?

502
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,070
I don't understand all your weird tricks

503
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,190
and self-righteous ways of protection.

504
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,760
I don't need them, either.

505
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,710
You're fired.
