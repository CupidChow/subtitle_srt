1
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,760
Why are you still awake?

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,070
I want to go home.

3
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,760
Not very long.

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,590
You are lying to me.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,430
No, I mean it.

6
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,590
After you leave here,

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,240
forget everything in here.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,240
Your life

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,470
shouldn't be left with shadows.

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,360
What do you mean by "not very long"?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,430
Close your eyes.

12
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,870
I can't sleep.

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,550
I want to go home.

14
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,800
I should have finished the film

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,310
at this time.

16
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,510
Sitting on the bamboo chair on my balcony,

17
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,830
eating watermelon,

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,120
looking at the stars,

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,400
and relaxing with my mom.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,760
My mom likes planting flowers.

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,360
There are flowers all over my house.

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,800
At this time the forget-me-not

23
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,590
should bloom,

24
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,910
delivering flower scent.

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,760
I would play the piano,

26
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,360
and my mom would sing.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,800
The least thing I want to do is lying in this bed.

28
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,190
Good night.

29
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,460
=Mysterious Love=
(All the parting is for better meeting)

30
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,380
=Episode 11=

31
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,720
Open the door, let me explain.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,190
Nianchu, let's talk face to face.

33
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Stay back.

34
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,550
Let her go.

35
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,190
Nice try.

36
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,960
Don't get any further, or I'll kill her.

37
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,830
Calm down.

38
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,390
Calm down.

39
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,350
Li, are you ok?

40
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,390
Are you hurt?

41
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,790
- Boss, I've paid.
- OK.

42
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,230
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

43
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:33,830
Thank you.

44
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,950
Xingxing, do you want to eat this?

45
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,110
I'll buy them all for you.

46
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,160
Kids can't stand too much cold,

47
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,230
it's bad for their stomach.

48
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,160
Hello.

49
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,670
Xingxing.

50
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,670
- Do you want to eat this?
- Which one?

51
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,320
I'll help you choose.

52
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,670
Ok, I'll be there right away.

53
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,390
Daddy,

54
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,390
go take care of your stuff.

55
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,760
I will have fun with Miss Qiao.

56
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,350
OK.

57
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,920
Please take good care of Xingxing,

58
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,070
and go back to the villa before dark.

59
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,880
I'll wait for you there.

60
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,550
Xingxing,

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,880
be good with Miss Qiao.

62
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
Don't be naughty.

63
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,480
Bye.

64
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,640
Xingxing, do you want to eat this?

65
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,040
Well, am I better than those strange women?

66
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,830
Yes, more than a little!

67
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,790
And... Am I prettier than all of them?

68
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,830
Which flavor do you want?

69
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,510
(Delicious smoothies Mango smoothie)
I want mango flavor.

70
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,020
(Delicious smoothies Mango smoothie)

71
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,510
Let's go get it.

72
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,760
Hello,

73
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,510
I'd like a mango flavor.

74
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,000
and this one.

75
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,270
Li,

76
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,550
are you ok?

77
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,950
Shitou and Xiaowei

78
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,230
couldn't catch that killer.

79
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,000
I failed my job this time.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,760
- I didn't arrange everything well.
- First of all.

81
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,640
Move everyone to another hotel.

82
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,000
Shitou and Xiaowei will stay here guarding.

83
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,230
Second,

84
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,950
keep an eye on Chen Guozhi.

85
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,320
Don't worry,

86
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,670
I've already placed a locator on him.

87
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,830
We can track him down,

88
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,950
and find the power behind the throne.

89
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,350
Third,

90
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,920
rent a car for me.

91
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,350
Where are you going?

92
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,760
How is the chip deciphering going?

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,440
He Hu has reported to me this morning that

94
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,920
only one firewall is left to overcome.

95
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,040
Li,

96
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,720
are you really going back to Tai City?

97
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,270
What should you do with Nianchu?

98
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,070
Nianchu.

99
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,270
Can you tell me now?

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,830
What the hell is going on here?

101
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,920
I'll take you to a place,

102
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,600
and I'll explain everything to you
when we get there.

103
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,150
Thank you for saving me.

104
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,520
It's a pity I couldn't kill that woman.

105
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,440
Still the same as before.

106
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,670
You want to get rid of any woman
walking around Lee.

107
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,760
You are my cup of tea.

108
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,080
I didn't think you knew me so well.

109
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,280
Of course, I do.

110
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,640
Boss invited you many times, but
you refused to go.

111
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,150
You insisted to stay with your uncle Tuva.

112
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,520
Wasn't it for Lee?

113
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,960
But that asshole doesn't cherish you.

114
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,200
Will you...

115
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,640
change your mind to me?

116
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,230
You have asked me many times.

117
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,110
Maybe you will change your mind one day.

118
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,110
We have known each other for ten years.

119
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,200
No one knows you better than I do.

120
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,320
OK.

121
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,520
I'll stop.

122
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,790
Didn't Daen send Chen Guozhi here?

123
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,640
Why did he send you?

124
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,230
You told Daen

125
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,110
that the coin was with that girl.

126
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,840
So Daen sent Chen Guozhi, who had a close
relationship with her.

127
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,640
But Chen Guozhi is just a smoke grenade.

128
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,230
He is a sh*t.

129
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,670
At critical moment,

130
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,670
it's still me who has to take care of it.

131
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,640
What are you planning

132
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,400
to do next?

133
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,030
I put a locator on Ruan Nianchu's backpack.

134
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,790
She can't get away from me.

135
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Don't hurt Lee.

136
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,150
Thank you for saving me.

137
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,030
It's my duty.

138
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,440
It's not totally your duty,

139
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,550
since I fired you a long time ago.

140
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,030
The word 'duty' in my dictionary

141
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,960
means being your boyfriend.

142
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,760
Don't forget,

143
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,350
we broke up long time ago.

144
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,200
Who agreed to that?

145
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,320
What are you doing?

146
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,400
Don't mess around.

147
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,280
If you mess around again, I'll scream.

148
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,590
Go ahead.

149
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,150
No one will come to this place anyway.

150
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,670
Relax.

151
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,520
Don't move.

152
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,710
Pay attention.

153
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,640
How did you find this place?

154
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,400
This is for you.

155
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,030
You racked your brain to take me here.

156
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,080
Is there anything you want to tell me?

157
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,000
My name is Li Teng,

158
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,110
male.

159
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I was born on October 27, 1990.

160
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,110
I am from Zhangbei, Suzhou.

161
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,840
I've got exceptional intelligence when I was young.

162
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,760
I skipped two grades from elementary
school to high school.

163
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,030
Now I am running a company.

164
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,350
My parents passed away long ago.

165
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,470
I'm the only child.

166
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Seven years ago,

167
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,400
my friends and I were sent on a mission.

168
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,760
Xia and Gao had died.

169
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,790
Five years ago,

170
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,880
I infiltrated into the Tuva Group alone,

171
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,030
and successfully cracked down its
illegal organization.

172
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Two years ago,

173
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,550
the first day I was discharged from the hospital.

174
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,640
I went looking for you.

175
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,280
At the same time, I learned that the illegal
organizations were bouncing back.

176
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,440
I had thought about one hundred times

177
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
what to tell you when we'd finally met,

178
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,280
but I turned away and left.

179
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,910
Why are you telling me all this?

180
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,350
Because I love you, Ruan Nianchu.

181
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,080
I want to be your man, and I am quite serious.

182
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,320
But why you blew hot and cold on me

183
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,470
when we were dating before?

184
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,640
A month ago, I approached you for the coin.

185
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,150
The chip in that coin,

186
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,520
was the transactions details of the Tuva Group.

187
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,960
I must get it.

188
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,790
I told myself I would leave after getting the coin.

189
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,470
To accomplish the things that I should have done
five years ago.

190
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,000
Ruan Nianchu,

191
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,350
I didn't want you to be the second He Lihua.

192
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,030
Since I went to Tai City alone,

193
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,030
there was only darkness in my life.

194
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,280
You were the only light of my life.

195
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,640
So, I didn't want you to be in any danger.

196
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,030
You should be happy,

197
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,030
and not be dragged into the darkness by me.

198
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,840
So, you pushed me away?

199
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,110
At that time, I thought

200
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,350
for the rest of my life,

201
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,790
I could just protect you from afar.

202
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,350
Actually, I bought you here today, not just
to talk about me.

203
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,280
There is another important thing

204
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,880
I want to ask you clearly.

205
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,950
Ruan Nianchu, do you have feelings for me?

206
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,640
If you say I mean nothing to you,

207
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,760
then from today, we will go our separate ways.

208
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,760
I won't think about you anymore.

209
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,000
I won't bother you anymore.

210
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,920
I want to know your answer.

211
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,560
Let's try again.

212
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,880
From now,

213
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,190
you are my girl.

214
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,760
From now on,

215
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,350
no matter what will happen,

216
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,830
let's face it together.

Do you like the surprise I prepared?

236
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,110
I love it.

237
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,640
Li Teng.

238
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,190
What you want is not here.

239
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,110
I want more than that coin.

240
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,830
I want you a dead body.

241
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,070
Dare to mess with me.

242
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,140
(No signal)

243
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,230
Come on.

244
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,880
This little gadget works well.

245
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,230
You learnt pretty well.

246
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,000
You taught me well.

247
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,800
Where did you go? Why didn't you
answer the phone?

248
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,160
We have to move to another hotel.

249
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,880
I had too many things to pick up the phone.

250
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Xingxing...

251
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,880
Soon we will...

252
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,590
What's wrong with you, Xingxing?

253
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,350
I don't feel very well.

254
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,190
What did she eat?

255
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:42,470
- I ate a mango smoothie.
- Mango.

256
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,920
Xingxing...

257
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,590
She is allergic to mango.

258
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,350
Xiaowei, drive fast!

259
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,950
Don't spray, don't spray!

260
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,040
Fine,

261
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,680
but tell me how did you find us?

262
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,800
There is a locator in your bag.

263
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,710
You're quite familiar with this situation.

264
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,590
That's my girl.

265
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,040
Do you want to get sprayed by me?

266
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,950
Let me see.

267
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,560
Take it easy,

268
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,590
you can take your time when we get home.

269
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,710
You're teasing me after all this happened.

270
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,110
We can't go back because the car is broken.

271
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,800
Call 911.

272
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,280
I tried but there is no signal.

273
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,070
What can we do?

274
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,590
Will they chase us again?

275
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,560
