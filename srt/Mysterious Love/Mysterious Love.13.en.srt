1
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,710
Miss Ruan.

2
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,630
Are you ready?

3
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,470
The helicopter is taking off soon.

4
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,720
We'll escort you back to  Yun City.

5
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,540
=Mysterious Love=
(All the parting is for better meeting)

6
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,580
=Episode 13=

7
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,040
I've been wanting to ask you a question.

8
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,870
What do you like about me?

9
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,870
What about you?

10
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,040
You're in good shape,

11
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,630
and handsome.

12
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,630
Your pectorals, abdominal muscles, and long legs

13
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,160
are enough for me to enjoy for ten years.

14
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,270
And how about you?

15
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,030
What do you like about me?

16
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't know.

17
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,720
What answer is that?

18
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,880
Then I can only prove it by actions.

19
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,190
Promise me three things.

20
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,110
What?

21
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,240
Do you agree or not?

22
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,670
What are they?

23
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,390
I haven't thought out it yet.

24
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,270
I'll let you know.

25
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,030
Here we are.

26
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,080
Thanks for driving me home.

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
What were you saying?

28
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,670
I said thank you.

29
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,720
Nianchu.

30
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,240
If you say thank you again,

31
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,440
I won't let you go home.

32
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,670
What's wrong with "thank you".

33
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,080
How can you be so unreasonable?

34
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,160
Twice.

35
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,320
Who's a bad boy? You are.

36
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,240
Who's thick-skinned?
You are thick-skinned.

37
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,830
Your phone is ringing.

38
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,260
(Jiang Hao SIM 1 Chip is successfully
decoded. Missed call Jiang Hao.)

39
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,720
I have to go back to the company now.

40
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,830
Is it about the coin?

41
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,000
Chip is successfully decoded.

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,550
Are you going to do the thing that you haven't done
five years ago?

43
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,750
Can you just give the chip to the police,

44
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,030
and let them do it?

45
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,960
You don't have to go back to  Tai City
in this way.

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,320
If I go to Tai City,

47
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,110
what would you do?

48
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,800
I'll wait for you.

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,470
I'll wait.

50
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,720
No matter how long.

51
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,110
And that's why, you must come back to me.

52
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,480
I won't go.

53
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,070
I'll take your advice.

54
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,160
Give the chip to the police.

55
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,110
When I saw you five years ago,

56
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,270
you were like a firefly in the dark.

57
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,720
I want to protect you.

58
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,480
I hope you will live in the warm light forever.

59
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,000
But that has changed now.

60
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,720
You have shown me that

61
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,950
I can own this light.

62
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,790
I hope we can walk hand in hand in the sunshine.

63
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,640
You have changed me.

64
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,320
I'm not going.

65
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,160
Why are you crying?

66
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,670
I've never heard you say these words before.

67
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,830
It surprised me.

68
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,640
If my life is long enough,

69
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,390
I'll love you to death.

70
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,440
But if my life is short,

71
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,230
I'll make it up for you next life.

72
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,160
Li.

73
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,110
What are you gonna do?

74
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
Hand it right away.

75
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,830
If Daen knows,

76
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,760
I'm afraid...

77
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,830
Then,

78
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,200
we deal with it.

79
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,880
Li

80
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,160
is afraid of nothing

81
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,320
as long as Nianchu is here with him.

82
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,670
Let's go!

83
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,160
OK!

84
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,900
(POLICE)

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,640
(POLICE)
Here they are.

86
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,880
Thank you.

87
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,070
You're welcome.

88
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,670
You must be tired.

89
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,880
It's finally over.

90
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Tell our bros.

91
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,670
We'll be off duty tonight.

92
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,480
We're going to celebrate, Li's treat.

93
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,720
Let's spot a fancy place.

94
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,670
Great!

95
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,160
Can we go to

96
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,350
the AT Club?

97
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,040
OK!

98
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,110
I've just heard about it ,
but I haven't been there.

99
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,920
I can pick up Xingxing in the evening.

100
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,160
Well, Hao.

101
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,950
It seems that the club has to make
an reservation half a month in advance.

102
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,920
Is it too late to make a reservation?

103
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
There's no place to say no to this card.

104
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,670
Thanks.

105
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,600
Have a nice day.

106
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,600
Are you not going?

107
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,480
I have more important things to do.

108
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,720
See ya!

109
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,950
Li takes care of you in every possible way.

110
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,920
He sent the strong guy Shitou to protect you.

111
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,760
Xingxing.

112
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,270
Is my face still oily?

113
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,760
Yep!

114
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,920
Just like a big pig head.

115
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,110
Dear princess.

116
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,640
You've been fixing makeup for
such a long time.

117
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,200
You're pretty enough, stop doing it.

118
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,230
Nope!

119
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,640
Jiang Hao is gonna pick up Xingxing in
a little while.

120
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,670
I can't let my prince see that I'm not perfect.

121
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,040
Yufei!

122
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,390
- Daddy!
- Xingxing !

123
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,830
Are you being good girl?

124
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,440
Yeah...

125
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,070
Really?

126
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,510
Thank you for taking care of her today.

127
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,480
No problem.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,230
Or give me a treat this evening,

129
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,760
to show your gratitude.

130
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,200
I thought you had just finished a meal.

131
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,760
Besides, our company has a dinner party tonight.

132
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,000
Daddy!

133
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,400
Let's go together with aunt Yufei!

134
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,400
OK!

135
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,520
As you wish.

136
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,840
But most of us are men.

137
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,110
I'm afraid you'll be bored.

138
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,670
Of course not!

139
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,910
As long as I'm with you,

140
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,960
how can I be bored?

141
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,960
Jiang Hao.

142
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,030
Where is Li Teng?

143
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,790
Li won't come.

144
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,470
He has something important to do.

145
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,520
Dad, and mom.

146
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,080
Nianchu!

147
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,550
Why don't you tell us

148
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,320
such a good thing?

149
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,640
How could you keep this from us?

150
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,550
Good thing?

151
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,880
What is it?

152
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,320
Look at this kid.

153
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,910
Don't play dumb.

154
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,790
Don't fool us around.

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,790
Li is here,

156
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,590
with so many things.

157
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,470
How thoughtful he is.

158
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,710
It's my pleasure.

159
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,080
My girl.

160
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,880
We are not old fogies.

161
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,790
If you two have decide to get married,

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,590
you can live together for a while.

163
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,440
Young people named it as

164
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,200
trial marriage.

165
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,590
We know it.

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,030
Yes, yes.

167
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,470
Well...

168
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Get married?

169
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,080
Dad, mom,

170
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,150
wait a minute.

171
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,000
Come here.

172
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,000
Did you see it?

173
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,960
Our daughter has met a good man.

174
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,000
I can go public square dancing at ease.

175
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,710
Yes.

176
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,910
There are many old women there.

177
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,280
What are you trying to do?

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,550
Daen won't give up.

179
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,470
I can protect you better if we live together.

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,350
And I have some selfish motives.

181
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,080
Well...

182
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,030
Nianchu.

183
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,000
You have already slept with me.

184
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,030
Didn't you ever

185
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,790
think about marrying me?

186
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,840
Excuse me?

187
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,710
I was forced by you, OK?

188
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,470
Respect the truth, please.

189
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,960
Love without a marriage

190
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,000
is Eros.

191
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,440
But we were just reunited.

192
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,150
And marriage is a major event of life,

193
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,440
which should be considered carefully.

194
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,150
I didn't force you to marry me tomorrow.

195
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,840
- But...
- Nianchu.

196
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,880
You know how I treat you.

197
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,280
You know what I think.

198
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,590
I'll give you time to think about it.

199
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,150
But one thing

200
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,230
you should know

201
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,640
is that I only sleep

202
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,840
with the girl I love.

203
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,520
I won't let you leave me

204
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,550
unless I die.

205
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,280
Got it?

206
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,150
Come on. Don't get so emotional.

207
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm afraid you'll dump me.

208
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,110
Oh! Thank you, President Li.

209
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,640
Can you be a little more confident?

210
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,280
You are hot, and so nice.

211
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,640
And a pillar of society.

212
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,520
No woman will dump you.

213
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,550
Unless she's stupid.

214
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,520
I just heard you said

215
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,880
thank you.

216
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,030
Did I say that?

217
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,350
Three times.

218
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,280
Fruits

219
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,230
for you.

220
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,640
I'll cut it into small chunks.

221
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,760
Cheers!

222
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,470
- Is that it?
- Yes.

223
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,840
I'm gonna play that game.

224
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,150
Is this song good?

225
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,840
Press it.

226
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,080
In this way. It works!

227
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,840
Got it!

228
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,150
Hao.

229
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,840
You have great insight
in choosing a girlfriend.

230
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,710
Jiang Hao.

231
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,710
I'm here playing with my friends.

232
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,640
What a coincidence to meet you.

233
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,840
It must be fate.

234
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,000
Who is this?

235
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,350
- She...
- Auntie Qian.

236
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,550
This is my father's girlfriend.

237
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,640
Yufei.

238
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,880
You hear?

239
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,320
Auntie Qian.

240
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,280
I just saw you play it well.

241
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,110
How about

242
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,880
having a race with me.

243
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,760
Go!

244
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,520
Come on, sister!

245
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,550
Ready!

246
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,840
Go!

247
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,110
Interesting!

248
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,840
Jiang Hao,

249
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,320
have a drink with me.

250
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,590
A cup of wine, please!

251
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,150
OK!

252
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,150
Bye Jiang Hao!

253
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,960
Bye!

254
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,470
Let's go!

255
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,880
No, I don't wanna go yet.

256
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,590
Jiang Hao.

257
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,110
I know.

258
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,280
I'm expressing my love

259
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,000
in this bold way.

260
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,670
It is bad.

261
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,910
You see,

262
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,400
I read a lot of internet novels.

263
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,350
I know all the tricks.

264
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,200
And I've had many relationships.

265
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,470
I know how to

266
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,350
play hard-to-get.

267
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,470
I know how to

268
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,960
lure you in deep.

269
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,910
I know everything.

270
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,760
But I don't know

271
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,320
why I forget everything

272
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,910
when I see you.

273
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,280
Why?

274
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,350
I, Qiao Yufei, should be invincible.

275
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,520
Why do I like you so much?

276
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,350
What should I do to let you
fall in love with me?

277
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,190
You just

278
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,830
kissed me?

279
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,590
You really don't have to do anything.

280
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,800
I like you.

281
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,000
I am sorry

282
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,350
to keep you waiting so long.

283
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,760
Stop, stop it!

284
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,710
What a disgusting love!

285
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,430
Here you are!

286
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,800
Get out!

287
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,920
Who let you strike Lee?

288
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,760
You are pretty nuts about him.

289
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,190
He can die for that woman.

290
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,760
Don't push me to beat you.

291
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,830
If I were you,

292
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,230
I'd kill Lee with it.

293
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,800
Washa.

294
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,350
You haven't figured it out.

295
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,110
I didn't want to kill Lee.

296
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,760
It's Daen.

297
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,430
I can get the coin for Daen,

298
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,040
and kill that woman,

299
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,000
as long as he let Lee off.

300
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,710
It's too late.

301
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,280
Lee has given the chip to the police.

302
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,430
Daen was angry.

303
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,110
He will come to Yun City in person.

304
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,070
I wanna talk to Daen face to face.

305
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,590
You know well that,

306
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,160
Daen killed all his rivals in Tai City.

307
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,000
And only took five years to start from scratch.

308
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,520
You'd better not go against him.

309
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,920
I want a face to face meeting.

310
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,230
You can't find him.

311
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,400
He only shows up,

312
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
when he wants to see you.

313
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,310
(Five Years Ago  Abroad)
Sorry.

314
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,230
(Five Years Ago  Abroad)
Too lucky today.

315
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,880
Kun.

316
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,190
You will be in charge of

317
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,830
boss's business.

318
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,680
You should often come here to
play cards with us.

319
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,800
Who is it?

320
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,280
Washa, you scared me!

321
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,350
I didn't think it was you.

322
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,920
Disgraceful!

323
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,830
Get out!

324
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,230
Let's go!

325
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,470
I have heard about you for a long time.

326
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,070
And I finally see you today.

327
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,430
Boss is just good at lip service,

328
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,880
but a looser in bet.

329
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,800
Let's make a bet!

330
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,520
What's the bet?

331
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,230
Your heart.

332
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,920
If you lose,

333
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,950
you cut your heart out.

334
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,800
You lose.

335
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:08,640
OK!

336
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,230
I'll cut my heart out.

337
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,400
Don't go that far.

338
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,070
I like you.

339
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,350
You are not qualified!

340
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,560
So who is qualified?

341
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,000
I don't like loser!

342
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,590
Next time I'll win!

343
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,400
Oh! Stop looking!

344
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,000
Why don't you go for a little stroll?

345
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,800
Well.

346
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,680
I'm not used to living without Nianchu.

347
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,640
Of course.

348
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,880
She's been

349
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,470
living with us,

350
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,920
and walking around us.

351
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,110
I was kind of tired of

352
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,310
taking care of her.

353
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,230
Now she has

354
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,710
moved out.

355
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,830
I'm not used to it, either.

356
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm gonna call her.

357
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,560
No...No...No...

358
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,230
You have to give kids plenty of space.

359
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,560
She just left one day!

360
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,000
Let her be.

361
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,830
I just wanna

362
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,190
ask her,

363
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,590
if she is used to it or not,
what is she short of,

364
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,070
what can I do for them.

365
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,070
It's nothing to do with you.

366
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,430
There's a guy caring for her.

367
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,230
Just do your own things.

368
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,230
What should I do?

369
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:09,760
Ah.

370
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,310
I know what I should do.

371
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,110
Come on!

372
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,040
Oh no!

373
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,830
Do what you should do.

374
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,800
This is my business, try it!

375
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,230
- I'll give you a massage, come on.
- Leave me alone.

376
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,400
Get up!

377
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,400
Nianchu, get up!

378
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,000
Nianchu, I'll give you two choices now.

379
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,110
One is getting up and dining with me.

380
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,110
Or I'll sleep with you right now.

381
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,190
How could you be such a bad boy?

382
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,680
Yes, I am just that kind.

383
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,070
I finally owned you.

384
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,040
When you told my parents

385
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,520
that you wanted to live with me.

386
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,400
How were you feeling?

387
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,830
Happy!

388
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,830
Weren't you nervous?

389
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,280
No!

390
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,950
What if my parents don't like you?

391
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,830
Do you like me?

392
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
That's enough!

393
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,640
Li.

394
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,950
The hospital called.

395
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,000
Mrs. Xia had a relapse.

396
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,310
I'll be right there.

397
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,430
He Lihua.

398
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,040
Calm down.

399
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,110
Stay away from me.

400
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm going to see Xia.

401
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,470
Mrs. Xia!

402
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,680
Li!

403
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,280
You're back!

404
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,400
Where's Xia?

405
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,430
He's back!

406
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,400
Xia Fei's back!

407
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,190
You're kidding me!

408
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,760
You're kidding me!

409
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,400
Everyone cheats me!

410
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,190
No, he's not.

411
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,710
You are cheating me!

412
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,680
You are cheating me!

413
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,280
I'll take you to Xia.

414
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,400
Everyone cheats me!

415
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,110
Everyone cheats me!
