Li,

00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,320
we just received a message.

4
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,160
Daen and his organization have known
you are still alive.

5
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,370
But we haven't got ready yet.

6
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,920
If you get close to Miss Ruan now,

7
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,600
I'm afraid she'll be in danger.

=Episode 4=

21
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,450
Mom, where did you put my hair curler?

22
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,250
Didn't I tell you that

23
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,680
I would pick you up today,

24
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,120
and we'll go get the keyboard in your troupe?

25
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
You didn't say you'd come to my home.

26
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,090
Mom, why did you let a stranger in?

27
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,640
What do you mean by that?

28
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,890
Li has been waiting for you
in a while.

29
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,170
Besides,

30
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,610
he is not a stranger.

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,010
Fine, wait me a second.

32
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,760
Well...

33
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,330
take a seat.

34
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,090
Nooooooooo.

35
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,120
What am I supposed to do...

36
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,120
It's embarrassing.

37
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,970
Look at the bags under my eyes.

38
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,680
Let's see what I can do now.

39
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,120
Get started.

40
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,610
I don't feel I'm your girlfriend.

41
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,210
Then what?

42
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,050
A hitchhiker.

43
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,050
So, please remember to clear the car fare

44
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,890
by the end of the month.

45
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,890
Li Teng,

46
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,770
why are you parking here?

47
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,680
It's too late.

48
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,730
Isn't it the car that Li Xiaoyan rode in?

49
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,010
It's cool.

50
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,890
Where is it?

51
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,930
Well, wait for me.

52
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,490
I'll take the keyboard.

53
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,280
He is that bossy president.

54
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,330
I remember him.

55
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,960
Li Xiaoyan was in this car

56
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,360
when she was signing a contract last time.

57
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,680
A love triangle involving a bossy president

58
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,610
is about to play.

59
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,330
This bossy president is hot.

60
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,520
Will Ruan Nianchu

61
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,210
play opposite Li Xiaoyan today?

62
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,560
I'm ready to spill the tea.

63
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,120
Handsome, am I?

64
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,330
Get out of here.

65
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,730
Nianchu and the bossy president make
a cute couple.

66
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,560
Sweet love.

67
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,930
When will it be my turn?

68
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,210
Yamaha keyboard... where are you?

69
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,660
(Time Wedding)

70
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,680
I finally meet him.

71
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,540
(Rehearsal Room)

72
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,010
- Go, go, go.
- Go, go, go.

73
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:44,610
Where is he?

74
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,560
Quiet! Quiet!

75
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,450
Here it is.

76
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,770
Do you often contact those superstars?

77
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,680
Occasionally.

78
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,930
Speaking of those superstars,

79
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,680
Er...

80
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,170
What should I do if Li Xiaoyan
doesn't come to rehearse?

81
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:23,890
Mr. Li,

82
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,490
you need to help me.

83
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,450
Don't worry, Mr. Zhao.

84
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,160
I can make her come.

85
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,330
I...

86
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,770
Thank you so much.

87
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:34,920
Well...

88
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,330
I really appreciate your great help

89
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,160
since we met for the first time.

90
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,330
Nianchu,

91
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,600
just order a hot pot takeway.

92
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,720
I will invite Mr. Li

93
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,480
to have a hot pot with us at noon.

94
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,530
Me...

95
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,120
Mr. Li, help yourself.

96
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,090
Get me some beer.

97
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,770
Mr. Li, have a drink.

98
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,330
Oh, thanks.

99
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,240
Mr. Li, enjoy yourself.

100
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,210
How did you and Nianchu know each other?

101
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,290
We...

102
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,650
We knew each other by an accident.

103
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,330
An accident!

104
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,920
A sweet love story

105
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,360
often starts with something unexpected.

106
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,480
On the day we met,

107
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,530
I was deeply touched by your pure eyes.

108
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,850
Then what?

109
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,850
Shiqi,

110
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,650
shut up and eat.

111
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,330
Nianchu,

112
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,560
when you fall in love,
you must take it seriously.

113
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,210
That’s helpful for you

114
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,480
to develop a character in a love show.

115
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:41,920
Right?

116
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,600
I wonder why her potted forget-me-not

117
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,160
has come to life again.

118
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,040
It turned out to be the magic of love.

119
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,600
Plus, my tenderly care .

120
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,290
Look!

121
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,970
How strong are they?

122
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,210
I...

123
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,090
just gave these flowers a full checkup.

124
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,920
You know what...

125
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,680
I even update my Weibo in real time.

126
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,480
You have no idea how much

127
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,240
of the fans care about their growth.

128
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,920
What a coincidence that

129
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,240
when the flowers are thriving,

130
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,160
the happy fate has come naturally.

131
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,330
Mr. Zhao, you should take the credit.

132
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,530
It seems that you can't get over me.

133
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,450
You still keep the flowers I gave you
five years ago.

134
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,330
Did you send those flowers?

135
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,480
It's Lady Axin.

136
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,330
Lady Axin?

137
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,600
Yeah, the old lady who lives next door,

138
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,160
and always comes to clean up.

139
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,770
Really?

140
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,160
Thank...

141
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,210
You.

142
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,360
It was from Lady Axin.

143
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,600
Don't flatter yourself.

144
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,560
Oh, yeah? But I remember

145
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,010
someone said thank you to me.

146
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,680
Let me keep the flowers for a few days.

147
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,210
Mr. Li, I never know you like flowers.

148
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,680
I have many kinds of flowers,

149
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,480
like orchid, plum blossom

150
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,290
and chrysanthemum.

151
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,530
You name it, and I'll grow them for you.

152
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,600
No, thank you, Mr. Zhao.

153
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,040
I just like this pot.

154
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,800
What a surprise,

155
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,890
there are so many sweet stories between

156
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,480
you and Nianchu.

157
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,720
Ah, it occurred to me that,

158
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,450
the script Li Ke Chu Lian

159
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,720
would remind Nianchu of you when

160
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,890
it comes to this play.

161
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,240
What a romantic story.

162
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,410
Mr. Zhao,

163
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,240
can you show me the script?

164
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,240
Ok.

165
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,450
You can keep these flowers.

166
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,890
I have to go.

167
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,890
She feels shy

168
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,450
and embarrassed.

169
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,010
Li,

170
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,240
are you sure the chip is

171
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,290
still in the flowers?

172
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,360
The signal was transmitted
from the troupe.

173
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,920
I gave Nianchu these flowers five years ago.

174
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,650
And she brought them back from Tai City.

175
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,010
It’s likely that the chip
is hidden inside.

176
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,720
Well,

177
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,450
if Nianchu knows that

178
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,330
we take the flowers for this...

179
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,330
Shut up! Find it quickly.

180
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,090
Li,

181
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,970
since you approached Nianchu to
find the chip,

182
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,330
what are you going to do,

183
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,360
when we find it?

184
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,560
Make it back.

185
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,720
I'm not talking about flowers.

186
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,480
I'm talking about you and Nianchu.

187
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,010
Back to square one.

188
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,290
You mean

189
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,770
after you find the chip, you will

190
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,480
break up with Nianchu.

191
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,410
Stop talking nonsense, just look for it.

192
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,650
It shouldn't be, Li.

193
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,770
In my view,

194
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,890
your relationship is over too soon.

195
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,680
Just think about it.

196
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,240
You just figured out what had happened
in the past,

197
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
and now you're going to break up with her

198
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
before a new life gets started.

199
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,720
You are like a scum to me.

200
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,480
Are you going to

201
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,040
think about it?

202
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,240
I can't afford anything that
happened to Xia Xingxing and He Lihua.

203
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,480
When we find the chip,
everything's over, isn't it?

204
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,920
Don't bother on that.

205
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,560
Li,

206
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,290
are you

207
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,010
going to Tai City again?

208
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,040
If I have a plan, I'll let you know.

209
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,090
Now,

210
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,240
the best way to protect her

211
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,090
is to leave her.

212
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,920
I guess so.

213
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,770
At least you can be together for a few days.

214
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,210
I...

215
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,090
gave flowers a full checkup,

216
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,850
including fertilization, watering,
and basking in the sunshine.

217
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,770
I made a mistake.

218
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,450
Tomorrow is Qiao Yufei's birthday.

219
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,850
Are you coming?

220
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,480
Have you sent a message to Li Teng yet?

221
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,900
(0714 Yes.)

222
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,600
(0714)
Is he coming or not?

223
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,480
Tell me...

224
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,290
See, you'll never know if you don't try.

225
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,450
So,

226
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,970
he admitted that he was Lee

227
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,800
after the day we were going
to the amusement park?

228
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,010
It's not about rebirth, time travel
or memory loss.

229
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,920
Why do you look so disappointed?

230
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,090
I thought your love would be thrilling,

231
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,850
but it turned out to be so boring.

232
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,720
I kind of enjoy.

233
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,290
I just hope that we could date

234
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,530
like others.

235
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,650
What you said is a TV drama,

236
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,330
not the love in real life.

237
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,120
All right.

238
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,450
You can come here tomorrow.

239
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,090
And I'll be a birthday queen
at the party.

240
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,480
What a pity!

241
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,850
What?

242
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,560
It would be perfect if my
Prince Charming

243
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,120
could come tomorrow.

244
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:22,920
Oops!

245
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,090
What's the matter?

246
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,600
My crown was broken
at the amusement park.

247
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,290
I have to buy a new one tomorrow.

248
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,410
I'll leave you to it.

249
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,970
Good night, honey.

250
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,290
Night, my princess.

251
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,090
Xingxing, you must wait for a long time.

252
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,650
Let's go home at once.

253
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,680
Li, I have to go.

254
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,850
She can't stay up all night.

255
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,120
Big brother,

256
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,440
have you bought me a new crown?

257
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,480
Xingxing,

258
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,570
it's not proper to call him like that.

259
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,530
Li Teng,

260
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,530
how about this?

261
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,410
From now on,

262
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,320
I call you brother
and you call me uncle.

263
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,360
How is it?

264
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,480
Dad.

265
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,200
You are a grown-up.

266
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,890
Don't be so thoughtless.

267
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,360
I'm talking to big brother.

268
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,600
I know that.

269
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,530
Your crown is broken and
you are worried about it.

270
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,320
Xingxing, you didn't tell me
your crown is broken.

271
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,930
Tell daddy,

272
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,290
who broke your crown?

273
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,770
It's the bad aunt in the amusement park.

274
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,570
- Oh.
- She's a fake princess.

275
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,960
She stole the dress of the Icy Princess,

276
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,200
and broke my crown.

277
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,240
It doesn't matter, Xingxing.

278
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,810
I promise you that she'll pay for that.

279
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,530
Come to my arms.

280
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,960
I'll buy you a new one.

281
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,960
I'll buy you

282
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,360
whatever you want.

283
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,650
Dad, can I have some ice cream?

284
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,720
No.

285
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,810
Just one bite.

286
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,770
Still nah.

287
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,930
Just one bite.

288
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,650
Hello.

289
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,810
Is there no custom crown
of the Icy Princess?

290
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,650
The last one was bought by that lady.

291
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,080
Thank you.

292
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,050
Never mind.

293
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,600
Hello.

294
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,890
- The parking Prince Charming.
- It's you.

295
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,960
What a coincidence!

296
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,320
Are you going shopping alone?

297
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,290
No... I...

298
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,200
Or

299
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,530
you come to me?

300
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,010
Be careful.

301
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,200
Can you give me this crown?

302
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,410
This...

303
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,720
It's okay to give it to you.

304
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,690
But...

305
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,010
Oh, sure.

306
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,050
Collection/Payment Code?

307
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,240
You said

308
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,890
this crown is very important to you,
isn't it?

309
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,010
Then explain how.

310
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,290
I'll see if I can give it to you.

311
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,570
The thing is,

312
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,600
because I've promised my da...

313
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,720
You have a girlfriend!

314
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,170
The crown also means a lot to me.

315
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,960
No, no, I don't have a girlfriend.

316
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,930
No.

317
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,770
If you don't have a girlfriend...

318
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,290
I tell you that the clerk just told me

319
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,080
this crown was the last one in the city.

320
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,890
So...

321
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,410
Just name your price.

322
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,600
I don't want money.

323
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,480
No money?

324
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,720
Thank you.

325
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,890
I don't want money, but I have a catch.

326
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,010
Oh, what's it?

327
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,050
Meet me at the KTV in B1,

328
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,290
room 109, 11 o'clock.

329
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,600
This is...

330
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,840
This is...

331
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,650
An appointment.

332
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,010
What do you think?

333
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,440
Dare to come?

334
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,290
OK.

335
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,360
But I'll be a little late.

336
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,290
It doesn't matter.

337
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,720
You can give me your WeChat ID first.

338
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,650
Then I can contact you.

339
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,080
Excuse me.

340
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,410
Hello.

341
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,720
What's the matter?

342
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,570
What?

343
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,690
Okay, I got it.

344
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,530
Sorry, I have something urgent.

345
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,650
I have to go.

346
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,010
Leave your WeChat ID

347
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,200
before you go.

348
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,290
Nianchu, I have some good news.

349
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,320
What's the matter?

350
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,360
(Heartthrob)
Guess who I've seen today?

351
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,530
Who?

352
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,170
The parking Prince Charming.

353
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,600
Really?

354
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,240
Did you get his WeChat ID this time?

355
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,930
That was a close.

356
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,120
But he is coming tonight.

357
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,570
Really?

358
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,410
I can get him today.

359
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,360
Come on.

360
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,290
It's your turn.

361
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,770
Don't stay with Nianchu to avoid drinking.

362
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,480
Yes.

363
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,960
Who says I avoid drinking?

364
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,320
I never avoid drinking.

365
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:43,960
Take this bottle of wine.

366
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,200
Come on...

367
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,120
Come on, cheers.

368
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,290
That's how you usually enjoy yourselves.

369
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,170
Yeah. What's the matter?

370
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,050
Men and women get together,

371
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,570
drinking, dancing and making merry.

372
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,170
Come on...

373
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,720
Let's play Truth or Dare.

374
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,930
Whoever loses will have three
bottles of drink,

375
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,440
or kiss an opposite sex.

376
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,290
It's so exciting.

377
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,770
Nianchu,

378
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,530
get on the board. Come on.

379
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:12,720
Come on.

380
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,360
Just roll the dice.

381
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,200
Er... Ok.

382
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,320
Come here.

383
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,720
Cool.

384
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,770
It's your turn.

385
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,770
Open it...

386
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,440
Nianchu, you get the smallest.

387
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,650
You lose. Choose Truth or Dare.

388
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,440
Come on...

389
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,410
It's over. You're in trouble.

390
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,480
Which one will she choose?

391
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,720
Choose quickly.

392
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
I choose to drink three bottles.

393
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,200
You can't hold your drink,
so why do you choose to drink?

394
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,530
Your boyfriend is here, isn't he?

395
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,170
Oh yes.

396
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:49,810
Li Teng,

397
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,960
your girlfriend loses the game
and wants to kiss you.

398
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,770
Yeah.

399
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,480
Don't talk nonsense.

400
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,690
He has been your boyfriend. Just a kiss.
Any problem?

401
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,720
Li Teng...

402
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,050
I'd better finish my drink.

403
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,410
She blushed.

404
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,290
That's a really good idea.

405
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,650
Of course.

406
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,080
Alcohol is bad for your health.

407
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:40,840
Kiss, kiss, kiss...

408
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,320
We don't want to see you drink.

409
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,080
We want to see a kiss, right?

410
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,050
Yes.

411
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,200
Hasn't she drunk?

412
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,770
Don't break the rules of the game.

413
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,200
Let's move on. Who's next?

414
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,840
Come on, roll a dice...

415
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,200
- Dad.
- What's the matter?

416
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,480
I'm here.

417
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,570
Dad is not going anywhere.

418
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,440
I'll stay with you here.

419
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,440
So will mom?

420
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,410
- Feifei, we're going. Bye-bye.
- We're leaving, Feifei.

421
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,530
Bye-bye.

422
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,320
All of them are too weak.

423
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,810
Don't go. Why do they leave?

424
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,770
Feifei.

425
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,080
It's time for us to go home.

426
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,930
I'll take you home.

427
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,080
No.

428
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,770
It's still early.

429
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:32,690
The parking prince hasn't come yet.

430
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,720
Those people can't hold their drink.

431
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:43,010
I breathe secretly.

432
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Wait slowly.

433
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,810
Turn around.

434
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,770
Unconsciously,

435
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:55,690
I find out that you are no longer there.

436
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,120
I can't avoid it, but I can't find you back.

437
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,440
(Happy birthday to Miss Qiao Yufei from LINKAFO KTV)
Slow down, and be careful.

438
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,320
I can't believe he stood me up.

439
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,050
I can't believe I was stood up.

440
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,360
I'm Qiao Yufei.

441
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,650
Maybe he didn't come
because of something urgent.

442
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,360
Don't think too much.

443
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,170
This...

444
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:38,890
I specially bought it
to match this skirt.

445
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,810
I didn't even wear it.

446
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:47,170
I've done so much for him.

447
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,480
That's true.

448
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,960
I tell you

449
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,170
you can't

450
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,050
take love too seriously.

451
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,320
And you can't get stuck.

452
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,930
Don't be so sad like me.

453
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,320
Men...

454
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,530
it'll be fine to date them.

455
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,530
But don't take them seriously.

456
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,650
The car is ready.

457
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,840
Let's go.

458
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,320
I'll take you home.

459
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,600
I didn't drink too much.

460
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,240
Well, what day is it tomorrow?

461
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,440
Tomorrow I'll

462
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,240
get even with that jerk.

463
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,410
Tomorrow

464
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,690
is the premiere of Li Ke Chu Lian.

465
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,720
Yes.

466
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,050
I remember that.

467
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,650
I won't be late tomorrow.

468
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,440
Really?

469
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,440
Good, let's go.

470
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,120
I'm fine.

471
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,120
I’m Qiao Yufei, I can go home by myself.

472
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,480
Really?

473
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,170
Here it is.

474
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,770
Thank you.

475
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,960
Be careful.

476
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,200
Bye-bye.

477
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,010
It's close to my home.

478
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,290
Let's walk home.

479
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:31,200
OK.

480
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,010
Do you think so?

481
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,810
What?

482
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,480
The one who first takes love
seriously would lose.

483
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,080
I don't believe that.

484
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,360
If you don't take it seriously,

485
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,050
why do you fall in love?

486
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,810
What about you?

487
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,050
Why have you never got married?

488
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,650
I haven't met the right one.

489
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,170
What kind of girl are you looking for?

490
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,050
The one I love.

491
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,120
So

492
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,530
