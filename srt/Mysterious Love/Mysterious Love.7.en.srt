1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,070
Someone jumped into water.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,280
Is she alright?

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,710
Is everything okay here?

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,600
Who fell into the water?

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,200
No idea...

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,390
Get down to save her! Who is she?

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,040
Can't see her face clearly.

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,790
Is it the girl just now?

9
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,760
A guy went over to save her.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,200
I can't believe it happened.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,520
It's so dangerous.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,150
How could this happen,

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,590
in such a nice day?

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,470
Unbelievable.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,750
It's alright.

16
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,400
I just made a little joke with her.

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,400
I didn't expect she actually took it.

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,400
All right,

19
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,080
let's go.

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,360
It's alright. Everything's okay now.

21
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,100
=Mysterious Love=
(All the parting is for better meeting)

22
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,180
=Episode 7=

23
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,140
(Morninglight Troupe)

24
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,000
Nianchu,

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,470
did you have a quarrel with Mr. Li?

26
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,980
(Unknown call from Yun City)

27
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,080
Ruan Nianchu.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,080
Is this Washa?

29
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,270
Yes,

30
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,390
it's me.

31
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,750
Why do you call me?

32
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,360
Don't you wanna know,

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,240
what did Lee and I

34
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
talk about alone yesterday?

35
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,910
Come to me,

36
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,240
and I'll tell you.

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,390
I...

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,240
Nianchu, what happened?

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,000
Shiqi,

40
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,960
ask a leave from Mr. Zhao for me, please.

41
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,260
Where are you going, Nianchu?

42
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,260
(No.9, Binhai North Road, Longwan District)

43
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,340
(It's Nianchu)

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,670
(It's Nianchu)
Come to this location now,

45
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,240
I need to ask you something.

46
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,460
(No.9, Binhai North Road)

47
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,520
It seems like,

48
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,440
you still fear of water.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,480
Anyway,

50
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,040
you can't make a crab walk straight, can you?

51
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,110
You called me here,

52
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,440
just for saying this?

53
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,040
Do you know what this is?

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,760
This

55
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,110
is the goal

56
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,720
of Lee re-approaching you after five years.

57
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,760
This is between me and him.

58
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,550
Well, then do you remember

59
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,270
when did Lee

60
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,950
approach you?

61
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,580
(Mother: I found you a blind date guy,
go add him.)

62
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,390
It was

63
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,550
the last week of March.

64
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,350
Am I right?

65
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,600
The positioning mechanism of this chip

66
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,880
was triggered at that time.

67
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,880
So what?

68
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,600
He will explain to me clearly in person.

69
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,110
I trust him.

70
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,950
Are you sure?

71
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,720
So...

72
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,160
Does he trust you?

73
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,230
Do you know

74
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,160
what is this?

75
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,110
Or...

76
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,640
Do you know what he's going to do with this?

77
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,920
You don't know him at all.

78
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,720
Ruan Nianchu,

79
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,670
you are nothing

80
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,720
but a burden to him.

81
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,670
A burden?

82
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,040
You are a burden with extreme
possessiveness.

83
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,320
The old Lee 5 years ago is long dead.

84
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,390
He is now Li Teng.

85
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,600
As for whether he loves me or not,

86
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,720
I think he will tell me himself.

87
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,790
Love you?

88
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,640
Would he still love you,

89
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,070
if you were a dead person?

90
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,320
Come here.

91
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,160
What's this?

92
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,320
Washa told me that

93
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,880
you approached me because of this.

94
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,440
Tell me,

95
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,880
should I believe in her?

96
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,320
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,480
You're involved after all.

98
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,480
What are you going to do with it

99
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,830
after you get it?

100
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,950
Since what you actually want is this,

101
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,550
then how about

102
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,000
we break up

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,160
after I give it back to you.

104
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,440
Let's look for it later when we go back.

Nianchu,

134
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,760
why are we so unlucky?

135
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,960
One is the father of the woman I hate the most,

136
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,230
the other is

137
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,470
the man you've been missing for five years.

138
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,790
He met you again,

139
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,670
but with bad intentions.

140
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,000
Cheers!

141
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,840
Forget about the men!

142
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,350
But,

143
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,000
did you really break up like that

144
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,440
over a coin and that woman?

145
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,590
Do you want to ask for an explanation?

146
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,590
There are some things

147
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,960
that you can't get an answer.

148
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,000
He needs to figure them out himself.

149
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,230
Figure out what?

150
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,910
We've been together for so many days,

151
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,960
but he's never told me about his plans,

152
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,710
or his future.

153
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,790
Li Teng has never really trusted me.

154
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,200
Feifei,

155
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,640
what do you think

156
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,910
this relationship

157
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,320
means to him?

158
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,320
I, Ruan Nianchu, have waited for him
for five years.

159
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,710
And this is not how I want to be together.

160
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,790
No matter how you would make decision,

161
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,320
I'll forever support you.

162
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,910

Here,

164
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,200
knows what he wants.

165
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,030
He's the one who wants to break up.

166
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,960

Li,

180
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,470
is this really how

181
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,760
you and Nianchu are going to be?

182
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,200
Sometimes I think I act like a clown.

183
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,520
Since we got the coin now,

184
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,110
then for the next step...

185
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,470
I'll make out just fine.

186
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,880
Li,

187
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,840
I know maybe I shouldn't say this.

188
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,840
But...

189
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,440
What's past is past.

190
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,030
And the brothers who walked together with us

191
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,790
don't want to see you like this.

192
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,320
Give the chip to He Hu.

193
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,550
I want the transaction details inside.

194
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Li.

195
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,790
Go out.

196
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,790
Li.

197
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,030
Go!

198
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,200
Fine.

199
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,440
Doctor,

200
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,350
it's been three years,

201
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,960
when will he wake up?

202
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,030
It's hard for me to estimate,

203
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,030
for his neurological coma as well.

204
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,440
Even he wakes up,

205
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,790
the situation of his muscle atrophy

206
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,230
is not optimistic.

207
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,150
Thank you for taking care of him.

208
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,710
Li,

209
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,350
are you awake, Li?

210
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,320
Wake up, Li!

211
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,590
Li... Li...

212
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,200
Let me check it, please.

213
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Li...

214
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,110
How is he, doctor?

215
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,110
It's not bad.

216
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,710
I have spotted something promising!

217
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,790
But he will have to stay for a few more days

218
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,840
upon closer inspection.

219
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,520
Good, that's good!

220
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,030
Li,

221
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,470
Li?

222
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,760
Li!

223
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
Go ahead.

224
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,880
Well...

225
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,840
I have something to tell you.

226
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,280
But don't blame me for being nosy

227
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,550
after you hear what I say.

228
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,820
(Qiao Yufei: Goodbye No big deal;
the next one will be better.)

229
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,110
Li,

230
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,190
no need for me to go.

231
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,470
Why?

232
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,590
You don't want to meet Qiao Yufei?

233
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,560
No, that's not the case.

234
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,590
The problem is that she won't get along
well with Xingxing once they meet.

235
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,070
Xingxing doesn't like all the women
who approach you.

236
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,310
Are you planning to be single for a lifetime?

237
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,040
Go drive.

238
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,470
Why are you here?

239
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,190
Come on, I'll take you home.

240
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,560
No.

241
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
We have broken up.

242
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,310
- I'll go back by myself.
- It's too late now.

243
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,230
Qiao Yufei, Qiao Yufei.

244
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,230
Li asked me to take you home.

245
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,350
Oh no.

246
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,350
Please don't!

247
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,470
Oh stop!

248
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,230
Please take Miss Qiao back home.

249
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,070
Me?

250
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,160
Seriously?

251
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,920
Where shall I take her? Li!

252
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,800
Thank you for taking me home.

253
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,800
Hope I didn't cause too much trouble
for being such drunk.

254
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Anything you want to say still?

255
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,920
Good, you don't have.

256
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,310
Great.

257
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,310
But I have!

258
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,680
I,

259
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,470
Ruan Nianchu,

260
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,400
inform you officially,

261
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,920
that I dumped you!

262
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,830
Let go of me!

263
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,520
I just don't understand.

264
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,710
Did you get kicked in the head?

265
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,680
Do you even know what you're doing?

266
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,040
I don't know.

267
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,040
Where shall I take you on earth?

268
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,310
Why am I at Jiang Hao's house again?

269
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,640
I'll make him feel like I'm a stalker.

270
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,950
I can't be like this.

271
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,520
I need to creep away.

272
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,950
Auntie.

273
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,230
You don't have to do this.

274
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,680
We can see you, all of us.

275
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,350
Miss Qiao,

276
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,880
come to eat something together.

277
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,760
Auntie.

278
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,680
Eat some vegetables.

279
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,880
My dad told me it's healthy to
eat more vegetables.

280
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,950
That's so sweet of you.

281
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:11,640
Here...

282
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,880
Do you want another bowl of porridge?

283
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,310
- Yes!
- Yes!

284
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,800
Auntie,

285
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,830
my dad is an innocent guy.

286
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,070
Please don't live in my house this way
in the future.

287
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,920
What's wrong?

288
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
Nothing.

289
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,880
Just choked.

290
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,680
Daddy,

291
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Auntie said that Dad's cooking is delicious.

292
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,520
Really?

293
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,430
Here you go.

294
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,660
(Rehearsal starts on Monday and
reminds you after 10 minutes)

295
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,880
New day,

296
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,190
new start!

297
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,520
Fancy a ride, beauty?

298
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,800
It's rush hour now.

299
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,950
It's hard to get yourself a taxi
if you don't get mine.

300
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,680
I just sent someone over.

301
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,000
I'll take another order if you don't get in.

302
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,760
Fine.

303
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:27,900
(Return Under the Moon Over the Hill)

304
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,160
This doesn't seem to be my way to the troupe.

305
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
Sir,

306
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,880
please drop me off here.

307
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,470
But we haven't reached the destination.

308
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,230
That's fine.

309
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,830
My boyfriend changed address just now,

310
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,430
and he will pick me up at here.

311
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,000
Let me get you home.

312
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,430
No need for sure.

313
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,680
What are you going to do?

314
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,160
Don't come over!

315
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,560
My boyfriend is near!

316
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,920
Don't you mess around!

317
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,350
I hear that excuse too much.

318
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,470
You can yell as loud as you want.

319
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,640
Don't touch me!

320
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,110
Get off!

321
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,110
Do you dare to hit me?!

322
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,710
Get off!

323
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,070
You let go of me!

324
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,400
Put your two palms down,

325
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,160
and make your muscles do the work.

326
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,310
Push back your waist and abdomen.

327
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,000
You can get out

328
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,190
if you're fast enough.

329
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,560
Nianchu,

330
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,560
you gonna be safe, Nianchu!

331
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,040
I'm here.

332
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,230
Don't shout.

333
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,760
Are you okay? Do you feel hurt?

334
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,710
It's okay, just small scratches.

335
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,640
Only small scratches?

336
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,190
What?

337
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,640
You seem disappointed?

338
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,400
I...

339
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,800
There's no harm on this.

340
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,230
But I got a call saying that
someone was seriously injured.

341
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,800
You did it?

342
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,520
Fair enough, girls who are broken
in love are not easy to mess with.

343
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,430
You didn't change your clothes.

344
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,040
You didn't live in Jiang Hao's house
again, did you?

345
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,160
I didn't want to.

346
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,640
But it just happened. I can't help it.

347
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,400
I was going to give up on him.

348
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,000
But as long as I see Jiang Xingxing,

349
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,350
I am not convinced.

350
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,680
So I decided,

351
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,310
I will make Jiang Hao mine.

352
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,070
Hello, Miss Ruan.

353
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,640
Is there anything unusual happening
around you recently?

354
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,110
Did you get feud with anyone?

355
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,830
No.

356
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,310
The driver is a habitual offender,

357
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,590
who specially receives money to do business.

358
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,760
Receive money to do business?

359
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,590
Someone is trying to hurt you deliberately?

360
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,230
This is our new script this month.

361
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,590
I think it looks all good.

362
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,590
Okay.

363
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,190
Then I'll prepare according to this first.

364
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,830
Good.

365
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,430
- Mr. Zhao.
- Mr. Zhao.

366
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,190
During working hours,

367
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,470
don't always small talk.

368
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,760
You hear me? No lazy!

369
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Mr. Zhao,

370
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,190
bad news!

371
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,800
Don't be so dramatic!

372
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,160
There's a pervert who wants to do
something bad to Nianchu!

373
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,430
What do you mean "something bad"?

374
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,880
No wonder why my eyelids keep
twitching these days.

375
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,230
Something big will happen!

376
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,350
Wait, what do you mean
by "something bad"?

377
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,520
Yeah, what is it?

378
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,640
It's raping!

379
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,190
So horrible!

380
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,430
Is it true?!

381
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,950
It's 100% true!

382
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,760
I heard it from a nurse friend of mine.

383
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,680
That pervert pretended to be a driver,

384
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,680
and took Nianchu to a hidden corner.

385
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,520
I also heard

386
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,070
that the pervert did not come in an impulse,

387
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,830
but was instructed by someone.

388
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,920
Instructed by someone?!

389
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,190
So who is behind the scenes?

390
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,430
Li Xiaoyan!

391
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,800
I can't think of a second person.

392
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,400
Our sweetheart Yanyan will never do this.

393
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,350
Don't talk nonsense!

394
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,640
We need to clarify with Nianchu first.

395
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,920
Where is she?

396
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,230
Seems like,

397
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,280
her neck was broken.

398
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,680
Her neck?!

399
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,950
It's still bandaged.

400
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,160
So where is she?

401
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,800
Hospital maybe.

402
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,590
You should have said that earlier!

403
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,400
You need to go to the hospital to see her now.

404
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,310
Well, all of you get ready and go together then.

405
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:13,880
Okay.

406
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,280
Wait,

407
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,680
going to the hospital empty-handed
to visit patients

408
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,710
is not socially acceptable, right?

409
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,230
Yes, you're right.

410
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,680
Yes, let's buy a big fruit basket

411
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,520
near the hospital.

412
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,040
Okay.

413
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,640
No need to buy it.

414
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,280
We have a fruit basket left
from the last show, right?

415
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,190
Just take that one with you.

416
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,800
- Mr. Zhao.
- Mr. Zhao.

417
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,560
The fruits in that basket are almost spoiled.

418
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
So we need to use it quickly!

419
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,160
No, thank you.

420
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Nianchu?

421
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,470
You...

422
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,680
Are you okay?

423
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,520
I am okay.

424
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,400
I just suffered minor bruising.

425
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,760
Thank you for your concern.

426
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,560
That's startling.

427
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,470
Good to know that you're alright.

428
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,640
Come on everyone, get back to work.

429
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,000
Are you sure you're alright?

430
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,430
Yes.

431
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,400
Good.

432
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,950
Have more rest.

433
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,710
Okay.

434
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,560
Nianchu.

435
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,710
Is Nianchu okay?

436
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,520
What's wrong?

437
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,040
How are things between you and Mr. Li?

438
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,640
I broke up with him.

439
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,680
No way!

440
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,760
Nianchu,

441
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,190
do you want me to set you up with someone?

442
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,920
It's gonna be good.

443
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,830
Have a try.

444
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,880
No,

445
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,350
thank you for this.

446
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,350
It must be that Washa was not reconciled,

447
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,950
after escaping yesterday.

448
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,070
So she came back to seek revenge
against Nianchu.

449
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,160
How is Ruan Nianchu?

450
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,950
She suffered only minor injuries,

451
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,230
and has returned to the troupe.

452
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,920
Send me Washa's location by tonight.

453
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,760
Okay.

454
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,590
How long will it take to decipher the chip?

455
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,350
I'm on it.

456
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,070
It may take two or three days,

457
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,760
or even longer.

458
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,520
I will clear up all threats from the Yun City

459
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,160
before I leave.

460
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
Where are you going?

461
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,470
To the troupe.

462
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,800
But Nianchu seems to be still angry with you.

463
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,280
I'm gonna hire a bodyguard for Nianchu.

464
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,190
Miss Qiao,

465
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,640
this is He Hu,

466
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,230
the brain trust of our company.

467
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,160
He can analyze any situation accurately,

468
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,710
and give a solution accordingly.

469
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,350
Well, this is Liu Xiaowei,

470
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,710
the butler of our company.

471
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,920
He can get things into the detail,

472
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,070
and can help you arrange everything properly.

473
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,190
It will make you feel at home no matter
where you go.

474
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,560
Safe and comfortable.

475
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,920
Miss Qiao,

476
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,190
haven't you thought about

477
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,230
hiring yourself a personal bodyguard?

478
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,640
Look at our Captain Jiang,

479
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,920
who is capable and handsome.

480
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,520
He especially suits you.

481
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,560
Li!

482
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,760
You're right.

483
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,110
Why didn't I think of it?

484
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,560
But generally speaking,

485
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,230
our company

486
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,710
does not approve Captain Jiang

487
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,400
to perform as a private bodyguard.

488
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,230
But one exception could be

489
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,070
that you asked me to be Nianchu's bodyguard.

490
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,360
Ruan Nianchu.

491
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,320
Excuse me sir,

492
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,800
please make way for me.

493
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,950
You're injured.

494
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,040
Let me check.

495
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,320
Please do not touch me.

496
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,000
I will take full responsibility
for your safety from now on.

497
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,470
Are you kidding me?

498
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,560
I was invited by Miss Qiao

499
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,280
to protect you.

500
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,600
Hello Feifei,

501
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,230
what's going on here?

502
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,910
Did you hire a bodyguard for me?

503
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,910
Of course I did.

504
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:53,120
After all, it's a matter of your life.

505
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,840
But why it has to be Li Teng?

506
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,190
Hello? I didn't catch you Nianchu.

507
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,230
My signal is bad here.

508
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,630
I'd like to get a refund on this.

509
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,430
Well, Miss Qiao has already paid

510
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,390
and signed the contract.

511
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,430
In that case,

512
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,950
I'll ask for some else to be my bodyguard.

513
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,320
I'm sorry, Miss Ruan.

514
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,840
Other staff in the company

515
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,470
have all been fully booked half month ago.

516
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,430
Besides, Ms. Qiao placed the order
in the last minute.

517
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,800
Only me is available now.

518
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,470
Surprisingly, the boss of Yuntai
takes orders personally.

519
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,630
All members of the company

520
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,520
are responsible for
catering the needs of customers.

521
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,600
If it's in this case,

522
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,120
then I'll have to cancel the contract.

523
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,520
As a customer, you are the party A.

524
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,800
If you propose to cancel the contract
for no reason,

525
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,840
you will have to pay three times
higher as the penalty.

526
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,670
By the way, what Miss Qiao chose for you

527
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,230
is a premium security package.

528
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,190
So if you unilaterally terminate
the contract,

529
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,360
you will have to pay 1.5 million
for the penalty.

530
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,520
You...

531
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,000
You're robbing the money!

532
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,670
I'm sorry, Miss Ruan.

533
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,000
I am acting in accordance with
the terms of the contract.

534
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,870
In this case,

535
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,190
do what you like.
