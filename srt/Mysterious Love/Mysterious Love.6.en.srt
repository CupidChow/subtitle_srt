1
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,290
I asked someone to bring her here

2
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,000
just to see what she looks like.

3
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,450
It seems that the woman
Mr. Lee is fond of

4
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,960
looks just so normal.

5
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,890
I thought she would be beautiful.

6
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,770
Washa.

7
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,680
We must not be blinded

8
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,720
by her weak appearance.

9
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,680
Since she came to our base,

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,040
every transaction has gone wrong.

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,770
Don't you all look for the mole?

12
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,720
She is.

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,530
You still want to cover her up.

14
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,890
No, Washa.

15
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,250
You just came back.
I'm afraid you're tired.

16
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,210
My woman

17
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,400
can be only taught by myself.

18
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,450
I'm interested in this woman today.

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,130
I'll take her away

20
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,400
and ask her to have fun with me.

21
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,890
Uncle, you will agree with this, right?

22
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,570
Well, well.

23
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,810
Washa.

24
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,680
This is your fault.

25
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,090
Don't get angry with an outsider
as soon as you come back.

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,920
Let's have a meal.

27
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:21,340
=Mysterious Love=
(All the parting is for better meeting)

28
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,220
=Episode 6=

29
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,330
I thought it was a high-end locator.

30
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,560
So I worked for it for several days.

31
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,720
It turned out to be nothing.

32
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,970
Don't talk so much.

33
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,920
Decipher it quickly.

34
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,970
I feel something is wrong today.

35
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,050
I used to be very lucky in love,
and you were alone.

36
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,720
Now the situation is totally changed
upside down.

37
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,440
Haven't you found your prince charming?

38
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,130
Don't mention him.

39
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,200
What about you and Li Teng?

40
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,880
I could get more "bad news" from you.

41
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,600
Nothing special.

42
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,730
Come on.

43
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,970
I just taught you to kiss him.

44
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,970
But you slept together?

45
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,880
What are you talking about?

46
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,440
We,

47
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,290
we did nothing.

48
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,880
But last night he taught me some
self-defense skills.

49
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,320
You guys had a good time.

50
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,690
Self-defense skills.

51
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,090
Stop playing around.

52
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,130
When my prince charming

53
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,090
could teach me self-defense skills?

54
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,810
Li,

55
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,600
did you break up with Nianchu
last night?

56
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,810
How's she?

57
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,970
Did she mess with you?

58
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
Li Teng,

59
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,360
I have thought about

60
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,600
the matter of Tai City.

61
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,130
When the coin is deciphered,

62
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,410
I'll go there.

63
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,600
Xingxing,

64
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,640
I'll leave her to you.

65
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,160
What you will do is

66
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,250
to chase Nianchu back,

67
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,600
and explain to her.

68
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,320
I believe she will understand you.

69
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,730
Don't worry.

70
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,850
I'll bring the transaction details

71
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,290
and find out about Daen's affairs

72
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,760
clearly.

73
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,850
You can't get in.

74
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,530
Lee, don't underestimate me.

75
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,730
Why could you get in

76
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,010
but I can't?

77
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,040
The Daen base in Tai City is under
heavy security.

78
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,250
Only the dead can get in there.

79
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,600
The dead with new identities.

80
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,530
Lee died five year ago.

81
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,360
It means only I can do it.

82
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,250
But

83
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,920
what about Miss Ruan?

84
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,360
Five years.

85
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,200
You have waited her for five years.

86
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,250
If you break up, that's...

87
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,040
We didn't break up.

88
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,200
You didn't break up.

89
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Really?

90
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,090
Then I'm relieved.

91
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,440
So, you will get along well with
Nianchu, right?

92
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,250
I don't know.

93
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,760
The chip is fake.

94
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,250
Who did that? So arrogant.

95
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,730
An old friend.

96
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,640
What took you so long, Lee.

97
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,440
I've waited you for a long time.

98
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,250
What do you want to do?

99
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,690
Me?

100
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,970
I want to see you, of course.

101
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Where are you? I'll see you.

102
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,600
You are so anxious to see me.

103
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,290
I should show up earlier.

104
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,200
I'll send you the time and address.

105
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,320
See you later.

106
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,130
OK.

107
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:02,970
Let's go.

108
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,440
Hello?

109
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,250
Hello.

110
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,290
Are you Ruan Nianchu?

111
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,200
Yes, I am.

112
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,360
I'm an entertainment reporter
for Huawen News.

113
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
My name is Li Wen.

114
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,880
A reporter.

115
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,690
Here is the thing.

116
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,570
I got your contact information

117
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,970
through the head of Morninglight Troupe.

118
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,040
Hello, nice to talk to you.

119
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
I want to make an appointment with you
for an interview.

120
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,440
After all, your performance on the stage

121
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
is really

122
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,930
excellent.

123
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,640
OK, no problem.

124
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,290
Well,

125
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,610
I think today is a good day.

126
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,530
What about this afternoon?

127
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,170
Today?

128
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,880
I'm OK.

129
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,640
Great.

130
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,680
I'll send the time and address

131
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,290
to your phone.

132
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,170
See you later.

133
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,800
OK, thank you.

134
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,730
Oh my God. You'll be interviewed.

135
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,200
Nianchu, you'll become a hit.

136
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,860
(Wyndham Hotel Room 902.
See you at 4 in the afternoon!)

137
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,930
Hotel.

138
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,050
He asked you to go to a hotel.

139
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,050
Isn't this wrong?

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,320
It's alright,

141
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,050
sometimes, my dad is interviewed

142
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,440
in the hotel sometime.

143
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,240
How about this?

144
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,490
I'll go there with you.

145
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,730
I'll bring two bottles of pepper spray
by the way.

146
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,170
We don't have to be so cautious.

147
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,530
Ok, let's go then.

148
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,170
We are here more than half an hour early.

149
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,490
We could have gone to the mall next door.

150
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,370
Just wait patiently with me.

151
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,640
I want to make a good impression

152
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,560
in my first interview.

153
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,490
All right.

154
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,370
Why are you becoming so depressed
all of a sudden?

155
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,290
Li Teng hasn't sent me a message
for half a day.

156
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,800
I don't know what he is doing.

157
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,490
It's only half a day. It's no big deal.

158
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,560
I tell you.

159
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,490
Boys may not take the initiative in love.

160
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,090
You can also take the initiative.

161
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,970
If you miss him, you can just send him
a message

162
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,320
and ask what he is doing.

163
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,320
What are you doing?

164
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,120
I'm busy with works.

165
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,490
I'll find you later.

166
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,000
Look at you.
Your IQ decreases after falling in love.

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,440
I tell you.

168
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,090
You can't go around your boyfriend
in a relationship.

169
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,290
He will get tired of you.

170
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,090
If he is busy, you can also focus on your
own thing.

171
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,320
What's wrong?

172
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,000
I seem to have discovered adultery.

173
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,970
Maybe we shouldn't think too much
about this.

174
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,930
Maybe he is here to meet a client.

175
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,170
Your IQ is really low.

176
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,760
Meeting a client in the hotel?

177
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,610
Or let's take a gamble.

178
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,680
OK, deal.

179
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,680
Let's go.

180
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,760
Surprise!

181
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,440
LEE.

182
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,560
Long time no see.

183
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,850
We haven't seen for so long.

184
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,170
Did you ever miss me?

185
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,760
Why are you in Yun City?

186
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,090
You're the same as before.

187
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,760
Handsome and cool.

188
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,800
Where is the coin?

189
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,880
Lee,

190
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,610
you're so direct.

191
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,240
That's boring.

192
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,290
Isn't the trap you deliberately set up
in the troupe

193
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,050
for me?

194
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,930
Here.

195
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,530
I've come.

196
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,610
Don't beat around the bush.

197
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,370
Lee, as I expected,

198
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,490
no matter what I become,

199
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,440
you can recognize me at first sight.

200
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,000
Who have you been working for
for the past five years?

201
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,240
I'm not interested in

202
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,640
fighting and killing.

203
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,170
Then, why did you steal the coin?

204
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,000
Because

205
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,050
I'm interested in you.

206
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,490
Tell me.

207
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,640
How did you know that the coin is
in the troupe?

208
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,970
The coin disappeared

209
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,490
from the transaction five years ago.

210
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,290
Uncle,

211
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,090
I probably know where the chip is.

212
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,090
Today I bring the woman here.

213
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,000
Because I personally saw her

214
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,560
hide in your study.

215
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,800
The coin must be stolen by you.

216
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,410
I stole the coin

217
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,440
and put it in Nianchu's flowerpot.

218
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,850
Why should I believe you?

219
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,290
Believe it or not.

220
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,290
The coin is in my hand.

221
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,090
Since

222
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,680
I can make a fake coin exactly the same,

223
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,970
you know how much I know.

224
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,880
Or,

225
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,090
I think Daen will be more interested

226
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,410
in what I have.

227
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
So you stole the coin

228
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,880
just in order to

229
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,730
frame Nianchu.

230
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,120
To be honest,

231
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,730
I don't care about the transaction

232
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,440
or the coin.

233
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,370
In my mind,

234
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,930
I only care about you.

235
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,370
You approached Nianchu

236
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,320
just for the coin,

237
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,050
didn't you?

238
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:11,970
Nianchu.

239
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:12,850
Li Teng.

240
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,090
I didn't expect you to be such a person.

241
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,240
I will not spare you today.

242
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,680
Yufei.

243
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,970
Let me say.

244
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,640
It's you.

245
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,800
Reporter Li Wen.

246
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,200
You asked someone to pretend to be
a reporter and invited me here.

247
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,680
Then, you calculated the time for me
to see the scene.

248
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,200
Miss Washa,

249
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,880
I'm honored that you have been
very tactful to frame me.

250
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,760
But please don't

251
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,120
bother with me any more.

252
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,490
I...

253
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,530
we won't fall to your tricks.

254
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,240
Let's go.

255
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,530
You wait and see.

256
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,050
Miss Qiao.

257
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,120
Your bag.

258
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,290
Li Teng, I tell you.

259
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,290
Although it is a misunderstanding,

260
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,680
if you have any betrayal

261
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,800
to Nianchu,

262
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,440
I can't spare you.

263
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,200
Yufei.

264
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,640
What happened today is really a trap.

265
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,170
How did you know that?

266
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,970
Since I got the call in the afternoon,

267
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,880
I felt a bit weird.

268
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,730
The reporter asked me to meet
in room 902

269
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,920
and Li Teng also arrived
at the 9th floor

270
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,890
at the same time.

271
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,520
So I guess

272
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,970
there probably be a trap.

273
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,200
Let's go.

274
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,850
When I opened the door and saw Washa,

275
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,560
I figure it out.

276
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,770
You approached Nianchu

277
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,730
just for the coin,

278
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,650
didn't you?

279
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,370
Nianchu,

280
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,320
thank you for trusting me.

281
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,040
Well,

282
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,490
I have something to do. I'll go.

283
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,440
Take your time.

284
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,770
Feifei.

285
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,520
Are you hiding something from me?

286
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,200
I...

287
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,730
What is the coin she's talking about?

288
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,740
(Morninglight Troupe)

289
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,800
From heaven fallen an angle sister,

290
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,730
- Like a...
- Mr. Zhao.

291
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,440
Nianchu, what's the matter?

292
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,040
You scared me.

293
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,440
What did you give Li Teng

294
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,800
the other day?

295
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,850
Which day?

296
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,130
What is it?

297
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,920
On the day of Li Ke Chu Lian's premiere.

298
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,090
What did you give him in the audience?

299
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,250
I see.

300
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,650
I promised Mr. Li not to tell you.

301
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,490
Mr. Li treats our troupe well.

302
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,440
He often gives us food and drink.

303
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,490
The key is that

304
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,680
I am a principled person.

305
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
I tell you, then.

306
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,490
So

307
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,800
I think it's a pity if I throw it away.

308
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,320
It can be used after repairing.

309
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,440
In other words,

310
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,130
it can be returned to you.

311
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,280
Who knows that it's Mr. Li's stuff?

312
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,970
It also attracted a thief.

313
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,650
Thief.

314
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,280
Thunderbolt chip.

315
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Coin.

316
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,610
Right, how can a thief dare to
enter my office?

317
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,850
I...

318
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,250
Please ask Mr. Li to visit our
troupe now and then

319
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,130
when he's available.

320
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,400
Reasoning does not distinguish
between winners and losers,

321
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,560
nor between the good and the bad.

322
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,370
Because there is only one

323
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,610
truth.

324
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,770
Known props.

325
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,040
A coin.

326
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,400
Known persons.

327
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,680
Li Teng

328
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,920
and a mysterious woman.

329
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,010
Li Teng wants the coin.

330
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,560
So he's entangled with her.

331
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,770
It turns out that you three knew
one another five years ago.

332
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:15,920
Nianchu.

333
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,730
Tell me what you know.

334
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,400
Forget it.

335
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,010
I'll ask Jiang Hao.

336
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,560
Who is Jiang Hao?

337
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,370
Li Teng's bro.

338
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,370
Drawing the target's bro into our camp?

339
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,130
I'm good at it.

340
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,680
After two glasses of wine,

341
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,680
no one won't tell me what I wanna know.

342
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,650
Is the guy you invited reliable?

343
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,850
Is he afraid to come for the sake of
Li Teng ?

344
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,920
Don't worry.

345
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,200
He promised me.

346
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
Wait for a moment.

347
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,130
Miss Ruan.

348
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,770
- It's you.
- It's you.

349
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,400
You guys know each other?

350
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,770
He is the prince charming I told you.

351
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,370
Prince charming.

352
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,250
What?

353
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,130
Prince charming in the parking lot!

354
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,010
Jiang Hao,

355
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,280
what do you want to drink?

356
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,520
I'll order.

357
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,010
Waiter.

358
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,130
I want

359
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,970
twenty bottles of beer and ten glasses
of whiskey.

360
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,250
And

361
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,010
this one, this one,

362
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,730
this one, this one and this one.

363
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,560
Thank you.

364
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,800
OK. Wait a moment.

365
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,250
I need wine. Don't play tricks and
try to avoid drinking!

366
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,680
Playing tricks and avoiding drinking?

367
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,010
I tell you.

368
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,650
No.

369
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,800
I ask you.

370
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,680
I waited for you until 2 in the morning.

371
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Why didn't you come?

372
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,770
I tell you.

373
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,040
That day, my girl...

374
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,520
she was sick.

375
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,650
You said you didn't have a girlfriend.

376
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,970
No.

377
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,250
Not my girlfriend.

378
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,520
No.

379
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,970
Great.

380
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,200
Let me run through the facts.

381
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,610
Full name.

382
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,440
Jiang Hao.

383
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,130
Twenty-nine years old.

384
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,770
From Zhangzhou.

385
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,160
Single.

386
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,250
The current second-in-command of
Hyntai Security company.

387
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,610
Oh, right.

388
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,920
Fond of playing Royal Crown.

389
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,200
Good at parking.

390
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,560
How is it, Nianchu?

391
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,400
Am I very good?

392
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,850
I asked him everything.

393
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,730
Are these what I asked you to ask?

394
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,160
Let's go, Feifei.

395
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,890
Go.

396
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,010
Stand up.

397
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,400
Go, mind your step.

398
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,520
Slowly.

399
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,850
You go.

400
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,490
No, it's too late.

401
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,280
You go first.

402
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,370
Really?

403
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,520
Jiang Hao.

404
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,200
I have something to do. I'll go first.

405
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,610
Please send Feifei back.

406
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,520
I...

407
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,090
Be careful.

408
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,920
No.

409
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,890
Where shall I send her?

410
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,970
Where do you live?

411
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,610
Since that woman exposed you
on the spot,

412
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,440
and then the scene we played together

413
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,850
is not interesting.

414
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,370
I want to plant

415
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,920
a seed of estrangement

416
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,560
in their minds.

417
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,220
Nianchu didn't ask anything.
Don't worry.

418
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,730
I still have work to do.

419
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,130
You have a rest.

420
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,730
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

421
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,250
Are you hiding something from me?

422
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,280
I...

423
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,560
What exactly is the coin she said?

424
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,890
You woke up.

425
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,730
Jiang Hao.

426
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,680
Who is this kid?

427
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,440
Dad,

428
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,680
who is this aunt?

429
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,200
Who is your aunt?

430
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,320
Dad?

431
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,280
You

432
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,650
know each other?

433
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:49,490
She is the vicious aunt I told you.

434
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,250
What did you call me?

435
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,650
Miss Qiao,

436
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,890
come over for breakfast.

437
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,610
Xingxing, come here.

438
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,920
You're sober.

439
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,520
I was sober.

440
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,280
But now I want to be drunk again.

441
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,610
An old aunt

442
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,250
doesn't have an understanding of herself.

443
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,520
She thought she could chase my dad

444
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,250
with old tricks like a hangover.

445
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,440
Xingxing,

446
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,770
watch your manner?

447
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,040
She is the friend of Li Teng's
girlfriend.

448
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,370
Aunt Qiao Yufei.

449
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,160
She said she would give you her crown.

450
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,130
Do you know that?

451
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,680
No.

452
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,250
I like something unique.

453
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,130
I don't want something

454
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,520
other people like.

455
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,730
Dad, I don't want that crown now.

456
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,320
Really?

457
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,040
I like your dad.

458
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
If you don't want,

459
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,890
give him to me.

460
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,650
What's wrong, Xingxing?

461
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,560
What's wrong?

462
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,680
It doesn't matter. Don't cry, Xingxing.

463
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,970
Don't cry, Xingxing. It's alright.

464
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,010
It's okay, all right?

465
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,560
Alright, Xingxing.

466
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,370
I didn't expect that

467
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,730
vice president of Li Teng's company

468
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,090
is you.

469
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,370
We are pretty destined, right?

470
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,010
Well,

471
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,200
Xingxing

472
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,730
is too young to be sensible.

473
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,890
So don't take what she just said
too much to your heart.

474
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,090
It doesn't matter.

475
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,200
I can bring the crown to her another day.

476
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,520
No need, Miss Qiao.

477
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,160
Miss Qiao.

478
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,010
You are kind and good-looking.

479
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,610
You can find someone more suitable
for you.

480
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,130
So,

481
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,160
don't waste time on me.

482
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,010
I asked someone to drive your car
yesterday.

483
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,730
Take care.

484
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,280
Am I dumped?

485
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,610
Jiang Hao told me that

486
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,010
you went to him.

487
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:05,970
Yes.

488
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,890
What do you want to ask?

489
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Will you tell me if I ask you?

490
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,890
For example, what does the coin have
to do with what happened that year?

491
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,130
For example, why do you want the coin
so desperately?

492
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,040
Or...

493
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,090
I don't want you to continue to
investigate it, Nianchu.

494
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,440
Remember.

495
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,130
The coin has nothing to do with you.
