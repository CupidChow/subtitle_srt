00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,150
(Tuva Washa BOSS Daen)
Sorry, Li, I'm late.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,350
(Tuva Washa BOSS Daen)
Miss Qiao is at my home with Xingxing.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,800
What happened?

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:14,840
He is...

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,120
Chen Guozhi, a senior schoolmate of Ruan Nianchu.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,040
He came at a coincidental time,

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,600
and came directly to Nianchu,

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,680
with a quite clear purpose.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,280
After Tuva died in an explosion five years ago,

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,840
Washa has been very quiet,

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,310
and has no intention of avenging her uncle's death.

12
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,560
She shows up now because of Nianchu.

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,470
It's clear that

14
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,790
she came for Nianchu.

15
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,630
Since the last time
Washa disappeared from the Trestle,

16
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,430
suddenly Chen Guozhi appeared.

17
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,000
Does it mean that

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,470
he is sent by Washa?

19
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,840
Washa doesn't have such a calculation,

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,910
but someone else does.

21
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,680
It's about to show up.

22
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,910
Boss

23
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,080
also died in the explosion five years ago.

24
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,590
Daen, the son of the boss,

25
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,440
has disappeared for five years.

26
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,950
If Chen Guozhi is sent by Daen
to approach Nianchu,

27
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,760
does it mean that they have known that the coin

28
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,400
is in Nianchu's hand?

29
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,140
=Mysterious Love=
(All the parting is for better meeting)

30
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,100
=Episode 10=

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,800
What are you doing here?

32
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,910
Nothing.

33
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm talking with

34
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,320
Mr. Li.

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,390
Why are you coming?

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,360
I...

37
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,880
I come to get the script and prepare for the show.

38
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,800
Here you are.

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,630
- Thanks, Guozhi.
- Let's talk outside.

40
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,470
OK.

41
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,190
Excuse me.

42
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,080
Xingxing,

43
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,030
come here.

44
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,390
Let me tell you a story, okay?

45
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,000
No.

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,780
(The Little Prince)

47
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,160
I live with you

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,670
because I want to tell you

49
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,880
that this is useless.

50
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,110
How do you know it won't work if not try?

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,960
I did it already.

52
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,000
You are not the only one.

53
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,720
What do you mean?

54
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,960
Aunt Zhao, Aunt Qian, Aunt Sun, and Aunt Li

55
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,720
all want to get my dad in this way.

56
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,190
Zhao, Qian, Sun and Li?

57
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,080
They are the four most common surnames in China.

58
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,520
What happened to them later?

59
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,160
I drove them all away.

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,910
So,

61
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,520
I should thank you

62
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,240
for clearing the obstacles for me.

63
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,880
Your daddy is not snatched away by others.

64
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,190
I love you.

65
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,470
Let me tell you bedtime stories.

66
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,240
No.

67
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,160
I promise,

68
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,600
you are definitely the first child

69
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,470
to hear this story in the world.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,200
Because I write this story specifically for you.

71
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,720
The heroine of the story

72
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,830
is the stepmother of Snow White.

73
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,230
Xingxing.

74
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,760
Xingxing.

75
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
Xingxing!

76
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,350
Daddy.

77
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,760
What happened, Xingxing?

78
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,000
The vicious stepmother
was going to feed Snow White an apple.

79
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,070
She frightened me with the story of the bad queen.

80
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,160
I didn't. I haven't started the story yet.

81
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,160
Xingxing,

82
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,270
don't be afraid. It's just a fairy tale.

83
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,640
Snow White came back to live

84
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,920
after meeting her prince.

85
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,720
Come here,

86
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,070
Xingxing,

87
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,600
play here by yourself now.

88
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,270
Daddy has something to deal with.

89
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,950
When I come back, I'll tell you stories.

90
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,640
All right?

91
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,670
Good girl.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,950
Miss Qiao,

93
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,390
please come out.

94
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,230
Jiang Hao, I really didn't say that.

95
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,070
Miss Qiao,

96
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,350
I need to take care of both Xingxing and Li Teng.

97
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,110
It's really up to my neck.

98
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,200
I'm not in the mood for another relationship.

99
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,720
Don't waste your time.

100
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,480
That's easy.

101
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,320
Nianchu can take care of Li Teng,

102
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,000
and I can take care of Xingxing.

103
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,600
You're in charge of falling in love with me.

104
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,720
I don't believe that

105
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,230
you don't have any feelings toward me.

106
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,000
It would be easy if you do.

107
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,440
Easy?

108
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,440
In my opinion,

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,920
you didn't seem to manage anything well.

110
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,880
I don't care.

111
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,200
Anyway, you can only date me.

112
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,200
Qiao Yufei,

113
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,550
you can only do it just by saying it, right?

114
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,920
Let me ask you.

115
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,640
Ask questions

116
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,320
with your mouth,

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,830
not your hand.

118
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,040
What do you think of my personality?

119
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,040
It can be fairly said that it's not very good.

120
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,440
That's right.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,040
You see,

122
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,510
I've been the center of my family since childhood.

123
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,390
So, I become what I am now.

124
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,550
You spoil Xingxing so much.

125
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,000
Maybe she will become the next me.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,070
Now, I can help you.

127
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,790
I am the only choice for her stepmother.

128
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,920
What's more,

129
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,160
you like me,

130
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,510
and Xingxing can't leave me.

131
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,040
Both of you need me.

132
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,440
But you can't even get along well
with Xingxing right now.

133
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,350
Three days.

134
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,640
- I'll show you a harmonious relationship.
- Miss Qiao,

135
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,270
you're such a catch.

136
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,920
You can choose any kind of man you want.

137
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,320
I have chosen one.

138
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,480
I have chosen you.

139
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,270
How do I make myself clear to you?

140
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,230
I understand you,

141
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,160
but do you understand me?

142
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,880
Okay, to be honest,

143
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,790
actually, here is the thing.

144
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,070
I...

145
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,830
I have a delivery to pick up.

146
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,390
I'll be there right away.

147
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,550
Thanks.

148
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,920
There are things like mosquito-repellent
incense for children.

149
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,000
You still have deliveries at this late hour.

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,400
Don't change the subject.

151
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,640
Give me three days,

152
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,320
and you won't lose anything in any situation.

153
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,550
If I can't manage it in three days,

154
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,320
I will quit.

155
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,320
You've got to give me a chance,

156
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,960
or you'll be satisfied

157
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,520
if I tell you I quit right now.

158
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,710
Hey, Jiang Hao! You are so ruthless!

159
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,200
Three days.

160
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,110
If you insist that I'm stupid,

161
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,110
I'll admit it.

162
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,880
I'm stupid.
I can't make money and can't be famous.

163
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,470
But Master has taught us

164
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,550
it is perfect if one can

165
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,400
do one thing well in one's life.

166
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,400
Here,

167
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,320
Nianchu,

168
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,350
have a cup of tea for refreshment.

169
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,440
Thank you.

170
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,760
The character you played...

171
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,030
Are there any problems?

172
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,280
The character setting doesn't seem to be right.

173
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,470
Could it be that

174
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,400
I don't reach the state

175
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,790
of this character?

176
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,080
- No, no, no.
- I can't get her deep feelings.

177
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,710
No, no, not that. Not the state issue.

178
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,790
That is...

179
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,080
Well,

180
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,760
you are a girl who grew up in a big city, right?

181
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,960
You're very qualified,

182
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,590
and you can pursue your dreams without scruples.

183
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,000
But this character in the play is not.

184
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,440
This character is a person

185
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,030
who suffered a lot

186
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,350
and came out of the countryside.

187
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,110
Washa doesn't have such a calculation.

188
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,760
But someone else

189
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,080
is about to show up.

190
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,150
Toughness.

191
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Got it?

192
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,280
Well,

193
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,670
I'll show you around the old town tomorrow morning.

194
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,790
Let's experience the life of the heroine

195
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,280
in this play.

196
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,230
It will be helpful for you.

197
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:49,840
Okay.

198
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,150
All right.

199
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,590
- Thank you, Guozhi.
- Not at all.

200
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,640
Fresh fried fish.

201
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,550
Fish fresh fried.

202
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,550
Fried fish fresh, fish fried fresh I tried.

203
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,030
Why do I have to stay with Nianchu
in the same room?

204
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,710
One night, left and right.

205
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,640
Endless snores falling and rising.

206
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,760
Like a stereo.

207
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,550
It's really annoying.

208
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,150
Li, Li,

209
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,640
take a break.

210
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,320
Do you still want to do this job?

211
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,350
Physical strength decreases so fast.

212
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,670
Another ten laps.

213
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,910
Ten?

214
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,880
Fifteen.

215
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,230
Mirror mirror on the wall,

216
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,280
who is the fairest stepmother

217
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,840
of all?

218
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,080
Nobody but you, Miss Qiao Yufei.

219
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,640
Mr. Chen, you're so good.

220
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,550
You cooked so many dishes by yourself.

221
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,550
I didn't expect that Mr. Chen has such amazing skill.

222
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,470
Even the eggs are fried differently.

223
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,470
Mr. Chen,

224
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,470
tell me about the recipe later.

225
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,880
It's so tasty.

226
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,790
OK.

227
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,440
As long as everyone likes it.

228
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,840
Please have more.

229
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,200
Only when you're full can you
have the strength to

230
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,400
do the rehearsal.

231
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,230
Why does it smell like flowers and fruits in here?

232
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,790
It's aunt Nianchu's hair.

233
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,110
Nianchu, what kind of shampoo do you use?

234
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,880
It's Adolphe.

235
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,710
After using it, the hair smells good,
and the quality of the hair also gets better.

236
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,200
You use Adolphe, too?

237
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,470
Do you like it, Xingxing?

238
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,550
If you do, I'll buy it for you.

239
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,280
Slience means you like it.

240
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,440
I will place an order for you now.

241
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
(Good hair starts with scalp care)
Save it.

242
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,000
(Shampoo + conditioner + hair care three-piece set)
I can do it.

243
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,230
Come on, I'll be starving when you get to learn.

244
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,960
Let's eat together.

245
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,280
I cooked a lot.

246
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,320
I have eaten.

247
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Have more, please.

248
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,440
So tasty, try this.

249
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,280
I have eaten,

250
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,470
thank you.

251
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,380
Xingxing.

252
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,590
Have more, please.

253
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,840
Okay.

254
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,550
Xingxing,

255
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,280
I've made a travel tip to the Bian City last night.

256
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,790
Today I'll take you out to have fun, okay?

257
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,640
I'm sure you eat well, drink well and have fun.

258
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,760
I don't want to play with you.

259
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,110
But your father said yes.

260
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,760
Everyone,

261
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,200
let me arrange the work in the morning.

262
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,640
Gao Bo, Shiqi and I go to check the performance venue,

263
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,000
and the composition and installation conditions.

264
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,110
Zishuai.

265
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,550
The honorable hero is certainly to stay in the villa,

266
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,400
getting to know the lines first.

267
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,030
Come on,

268
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,550
your lines are very easy.

269
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,520
This afternoon,

270
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,030
I'm sure I'm going to rehearse your part.

271
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,080
As for Nianchu...

272
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,470
Well,

273
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,590
I'll show her around the old town this afternoon

274
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,320
to shape the character.

275
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,030
Actually, I think the character of Nianchu

276
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,030
must be deeper than those of other troupes,

277
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,080
and be more impressive.

278
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,110
Only in this way can our troupe win a reward.

279
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,640
Mr. Chen is right.

280
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,640
Well,

281
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,640
you two make your own arrangements this afternoon.

282
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,320
OK.

283
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,110
Nianchu,

284
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,790
we go to the old town not for fun today.

285
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,440
I hope that

286
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,110
when you are shaping this character,

287
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,840
you must be concentrate, and have no distractions.

288
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,080
Do not be disturbed by other things.

289
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,000
- Okay?
- Yeah, I got it, Guozhi.

290
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,960
Here, have some more.

291
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,030
Thanks.

292
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,280
Try this.

293
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,350
Thanks.

294
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,590
Li,

295
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,960
he seems to want to date Nianchu
in the name of work.

296
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,910
I heard that.

297
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,150
Here.

298
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,550
Thanks.

299
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,110
Li,

300
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,670
He Hu found something strange.

301
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,550
Chen Guozhi owed a lot of money
when gambled overseas a year ago.

302
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,960
He never paid it back,

303
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,960
leading him to a very miserable life.

304
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,790
Later, he claimed that

305
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,110
he lost money on his investment in movies.

306
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,550
However,

307
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,080
he paid it all in one breath recently.

308
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,520
When things go wrong, there must be omens.

309
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,550
So it means that

310
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,150
he's really connected to the Daen.

311
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,230
What should we do next?

312
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,760
The craftiest fox

313
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,670
can't escape the skilled hunter.

314
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:31,300
(Return under the Moon Over The Hill)

315
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,340
(Sister Fat's Glue Pudding)

316
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,110
If you want to integrate into the character,

317
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,440
you have to experience the character's life.

318
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,230
You can't play a potter without opening
the clay and pulling the embryo.

319
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,280
How is it?

320
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,080
Do you feel any differences now?

321
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,400
I seem to be able to experience her persistence.

322
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,760
Right?

323
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,640
I remember

324
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,520
once I played an ancient coin collector.

325
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,880
I involved more and more into the character,

326
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,590
and was really hooked on collecting ancient coins.

327
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,040
I almost spent all my remuneration in collecting them.

328
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,760
Ancient coins?

329
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,230
What? Did you like it as well?

330
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,710
No.

331
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,560
No wonder that you have high artistic attainments.

332
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,520
You have the persistence

333
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,110
and obsession to art.

334
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,110
I'm not that good.

335
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,470
There are pros and cons.

336
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,070
Anyway, Nianchu,

337
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,830
if you see any special ancient coins,

338
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,880
remember to keep an eye on it for me.

339
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,560
I will offer a high price for that.

340
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,470
I am not interested in coins.

341
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,470
But my dad likes it.

342
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,680
He buys commemorative coins of
Monkey and Horse every year.

343
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,590
If I go abroad and find the right coins,

344
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,680
I'll buy them.

345
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,160
Really?

346
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,310
Do you have them with you now?

347
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,830
I...

348
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,000
Art requires not only devotion,

349
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,190
but concentration. Don't you think so, Mr. Chen?

350
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,400
Yes, you're right.

351
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,830
Mr. Li is so good at this.

352
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,280
It seems you got a lot of experience in this.

353
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,640
You're the first one.

354
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,680
Let's take a look.

355
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,590
What do you think of them?

356
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,560
Aunt Qiao, you're so capable.

357
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,950
Am I?

358
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,760
All the photos were not taken well.

359
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,190
The model used to be me,

360
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,160
and now you dare to pick up my service.

361
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,160
Sorry, it's my fault.

362
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,590
I'll take a good picture for you, okay?

363
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,040
I will make you satisfied with my service.

364
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,680
Say, Cheese!

365
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,000
Come on.

366
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,560
Give it to me.

367
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,880
Xingxing,

368
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
isn't this a good one? You see.

369
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Aunt Qiao's picture production rate is so low.

370
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,800
I'll hire you eight photographers this afternoon.

371
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,070
Li.

372
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,190
Here comes your Li.

373
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,400
Li!

374
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,470
Nianchu,

375
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,350
try my favorite food of the Bian City.

376
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Thanks.

377
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,920
Such a good appetite, Mr. Li.

378
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,800
It's tasty. Have a try.

379
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,470
This one is better than that one.

380
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,830
Let me serve you.

381
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,800
It's all broken.

382
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,040
Where are you going?

383
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,950
You guess.

384
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,070
Daddy, I want to go to the restroom, too.

385
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,710
Okay, I take you there. Let's go.

386
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,400
No, I'll go by myself.

387
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,920
You have no right to complain.

388
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,590
I'm not the stepmother,

389
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,280
but totally a babysitter.

390
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,430
I have never been such a lickspittle in my life.

391
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,310
How nice you are.

392
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,710
Two bodyguards

393
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,520
treat you like a queen.

394
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,430
Xingxing, are you in a horror movie?

395
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,040
When did you go in?
How come there was no sound at all?

396
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,230
I don't want to interrupt you.

397
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,070
What I said is nonsense,

398
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,800
and you can interrupt me at any time.

399
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,110
Aunt Qiao,

400
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,400
I just learned a Chinese idiom.

401
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,760
It goes like

402
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,040
Beat a retreat in the face of difficulties.

403
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,590
Very good.

404
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,920
Then I'd like to teach you another
word of chicken soup for the soul.

405
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,920
That is it's easy to give up,

406
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,950
but it must be cool to stick to it.

407
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,110
I beat a retreat in the face of difficulties

408
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,430
to set a good example for you.

409
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,920
Xingxing is too young to understand.

410
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,640
Here.

411
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,880
Thanks.

412
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,430
In my opinion, you are not beating a retreat,

413
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,280
but a masochistic physique.

414
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,880
You are the masochistic physique.

415
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,110
Our Miss Qiao used to be chased
by so many boys,

416
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,310
and you didn't care about them at all.

417
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,040
Why are you

418
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,310
obsessed with this father and daughter?

419
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,640
Don't laugh at me.

420
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,190
You are not much better than me.

421
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,800
It's not enough to have Li Teng
chasing you for thousand miles.

422
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,230
You also annoy him with Chen Guozhi.

423
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,470
What? You're trying to see if he's a masochist?

424
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,230
I know in my heart that I like Li Teng.

425
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,000
But he came into contact with me with a purpose.

426
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,710
And now he's hiding the coin.

427
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,560
I just want to take this opportunity
to teach him a lesson,

428
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,000
and force him to tell the truth.

429
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,760
I just can't stand this kind of concealment

430
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,350
and lack of trust.

431
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,640
Are you being unfair to Chen Guozhi?

432
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,400
As you mention it,

433
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,880
I feel more and more that he is not that simple.

434
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,160
Daddy, I just want a mango smoothie.

435
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,520
Be good, Xingxing.

436
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Daddy, I haven't eaten it for a long time.

437
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,400
I just want to eat mango.

438
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,230
Xingxing listens to daddy's words.

439
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,590
Let's take Xingxing to the
Electronic Game Town later.

440
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,560
Nianchu, you come together.

441
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,590
You're too nervous.

442
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,800
It's time to relax.

443
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,470
Electronic Game Town, Daddy,
I'm going, too.

444
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,070
Okay.

445
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,880
Okay.

446
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,350
Can you give me these two boxes of coins?

447
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,520
- Yes.
- Thanks.

448
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,070
Are these enough?

449
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,280
Enough, definitely enough.

450
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,000
Thanks.

451
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:55,950
Nianchu,

452
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,280
here, this for you.

453
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,310
Thanks.

454
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,310
This

455
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,470
is for you.

456
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,230
Thanks.

457
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,310
Thank you, uncle.

458
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,710
What should we play?

459
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,160
Nianchu, how about that gunfight game?

460
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,280
All right.

461
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:09,800
Let's go.

462
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,000
Xingxing, which one do you prefer?

463
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,040
The claw game.

464
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,830
Nianchu, have you played this before?

465
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,880
Only once.

466
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,400
Oh.

467
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,430
You can play, too?

468
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,800
That's what my family used to do.

469
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,470
One more round.

470
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,070
- Why can't I always get it in?
- Once again.

471
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,230
Two of us can't beat him.

472
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,830
Hurry up.

473
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,590
- I think so.
- Hurry up.

474
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,560
Take it less seriously and
don't always bully us.

475
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,110
You have two persons, hurry up.

476
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,040
Xingxing, we go to catch something else, okay?

477
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,160
No, I only want this little rabbit.

478
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,350
Hey, kid.

479
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,310
What?

480
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,470
How much longer do you have to play?

481
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,310
None of your business.

482
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,950
How about this? We make a bet.

483
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,800
Bet what?

484
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,350
Let's see who catches the doll first.

485
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,830
If you win,

486
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,070
these game coins are all yours.

487
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,710
If you lose,

488
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,950
let us use the machine.

489
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,400
Fine, I agree.

490
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,280
You go first.

491
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,920
Come on.

492
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,350
Got it! Got it! Got it!

493
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,350
- Do you want to play again?
- Yeah!

494
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,760
Come here.

495
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,880
Let's catch another one.

496
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,800
Put a coin into the machine.

497
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,280
Which one do you want?

498
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,110
This one.

499
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:14,160
- This?
- I want this blue piggy.

500
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,680
You're so good.

501
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,110
Of course.

502
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,070
- Which one?
- A little left, this one.

503
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,950
The left one, right.

504
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,920
Yeah.

505
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,070
Hurry up.

506
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,520
I'll kill you if you can't get the coin.

507
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,190
Nianchu,

508
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,430
do you remember the ancient coin

509
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,160
you brought back from the Tai City?

510
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,680
Do you have it with you?

511
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,950
Do you?

512
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:42,830
Do you?

513
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,040
The coin you mentioned

514
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,070
is this one?

515
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,350
Are you crazy?

516
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,230
Let's go.

517
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,000
Sir, what are you doing?

518
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,400
I... I... I have something dropped in.

519
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,470
I have something dropped in.

520
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,310
You take it out for me.

521
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,880
Sorry, Sir.

522
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,880
If everyone...

523
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,800
- If everyone acts like you...
- Don't waste time.

524
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,040
The coin you just put into the machine is fake, right?

525
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,000
Yes.

526
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,070
You figured out his purpose long ago, did you?

527
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,640
Yes.

528
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,950
So, you came to the Bian City with me,

529
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,310
and let everyone misunderstand
both he and you are chasing me.

530
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,760
I'm just a pawn,

531
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,310
and a decoy.

532
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,560
Am I a fool in your eyes?

533
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,760
Nianchu, it's not what you think.

534
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,160
Ruan Nianchu.

535
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,950
Don't bother me.

536
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,110
Nianchu, open the door first.

537
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,310
You're keeping many secrets from me.

538
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,680
I can't read you anymore,

539
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,880
and I don't want to read you anymore.

540
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,710
I'll explain to you if you open the door.

541
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,280
Nianchu, I have something that
I want to say to you face to face.
