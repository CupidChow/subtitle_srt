1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:06,180
(One year ago)

2
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,150
Who is she?

3
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,000
Why is she

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,040
at the hospital?

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,840
Aunt He is a good friend of dad and Li.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,720
She is sick.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,200
We're here to see her.

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,040
Xingxing,

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,750
give these flowers to aunt He,

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,040
and wish her to recover soon.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,880
OK?

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,790
My kindergarten teacher said

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,950
saliva is not a good disinfectant.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,830
Thank you.

15
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,440
It's done!

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,510
You're welcome.

17
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,160
What's your name?

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,590
I'm Jiang Xingxing.

19
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,830
Your name is Jiang Xingxing?

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,680
Auntie is having a baby...

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,190
Her name is also Xingxing.

22
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,720
Oh, here...

23
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,630
Look,

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,680
this is a pattern that
auntie embroidered on her dress.

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,800
Do you like it?

26
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,270
When Xia comes back,

27
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,000
Xingxing will be born.

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,000
At that time,

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,950
she will be as pretty as you are.

30
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,190
My baby...

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,760
Where is my baby?

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,400
Xingxing, where's my baby!!

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,190
Xingxing, come here.

34
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,120
Where is my baby!

35
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,830
- Mrs. Xia.
- Let me go!

36
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,600
- Mrs. Xia, please calm down.
- Where is my baby?

37
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,110
Please calm down.

38
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,550
Are you playing hide-and-seek with mommy?

39
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,720
- My baby!
- Mrs. Xia.

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,270
- Calm down.
- Let me go!

41
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,440
He Lihua, calm down.

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,190
Calm down, calm down...

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,030
- Daddy, daddy.
- Xingxing, don't be scared.

44
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,670
- Don't be scared.
- It's okay. It's okay.

45
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,000
Let me go!

46
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,550
Were you scared today?

47
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,270
What's wrong with

48
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,830
aunt He?

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,320
Aunt He

50
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,390
has superpower.

51
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,520
She can live in the past.

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,110
But this superpower has some side effects.

53
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,800
She cannot tell the past and the reality.

54
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,360
Well,

55
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,360
where did the baby in her belly go?

56
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,030
The baby in her belly

57
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,360
became a star.

58
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,000
The star now protects her in the sky.

59
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,320
Like my mom?

60
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,440
Yes, like your mom.

61
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,670
She became a star and protects you in the sky.

62
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,910
Sleep now.

63
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,340
=Mysterious Love=
(All the parting is for better meeting)

64
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,420
=Episode 15=

65
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,830
Xingxing doesn't even know about this.

66
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,600
Xingxing's surname name is Xia.

67
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,440
She is the daughter of my master Xia.

68
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,320
When Xingxing was not even a month old,

69
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,270
my master had an accident.

70
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,760
His wife couldn't bear the shock,

71
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,320
and got some mental issues.

72
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,880
She was admitted to a mental hospital.

73
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,200
But Xingxing couldn't be left alone.

74
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,320
So...

75
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,320
I married Mrs. Xia.

76
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,600
I think...

77
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,830
to be liked by you

78
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,920
is the happiest thing in the world.

79
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,070
After marrying me,

80
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,480
you will be happier.

81
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,880
Who said I will marry you?

82
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,760
Jealous Li,

83
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,510
look at what you mom is saying.

84
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,000
What do you say we should do?

85
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,110
He said

86
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,830
that I must punish you.

87
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,820
(Call from abroad)

88
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
What number is so mysterious?

89
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,720
Hello, Li Teng, it's me.

90
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,830
Why don't you hide now?

91
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,670
I'm calling to tell you that

92
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,950
Daen has reached Yun City.

93
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,760
His aim is Ruan Nianchu.

94
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,230
What are you trying to say?

95
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,920
Daen wants to give you
a taste of owning nothing in the world.

96
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,070
He wants to pick off the people around you.

97
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,760
He wants you to see the people
who are important to you

98
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,510
die because of you.

99
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,880
He wants to make your life a living hell.

100
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,040
Where are you now?

101
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,880
I... I am...

102
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,950
I...

103
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,550
Mr. Daen,

104
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,510
I've already done what you told to me.

105
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,070
Now can you let me go as agreed?

106
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,950
Thank you.

107
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,320
Mr. Daen, don't worry.

108
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,880
I won't utter a word after I'm out.

109
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,760
That...

110
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,160
Only dead people can't speak.

111
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,320
Drag him out.

112
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,070
Dinner is ready.

113
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,710
Li Teng.

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Sit down.

115
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,550
I was thinking...

116
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,230
Since Chen Guozhi said

117
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,910
Daen came to look for me.

118
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,550
Why don't we take this opportunity to lead him out?

119
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,840
I'll be the bait.

120
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,550
Let's spread the news of our breakup tomorrow.

121
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,590
I will move to a hotel and wait for Daen to find me.

122
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,840
No way.

123
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,640
Why?

124
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,590
I told you that

125
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,470
I won't put my woman in any danger.

126
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,880
I'll deal with that.

127
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,590
Li Teng.

128
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,200
I don't want to put you in danger anymore.

129
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't want you to disappear suddenly again.

130
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,000
And I don't want to wait for another five years.

131
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,550
Fine. I promise you.

132
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,000
Really?

133
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,470
But this time,

134
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,640
we will do what I say.

135
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,470
OK.

136
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,760
But this time, we will do what I say.

137
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,280
When you reach the hotel tomorrow morning,

138
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,760
I will work with the police
to cast an escape proof net.

139
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,640
Once Daen appears,

140
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,840
he won't get away.

141
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,200
Mr. Daen.

142
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,710
I have arranged everything.

143
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,110
What's the next step?

144
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,640
Now that they have set up the stage.

145
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,910
I will help them finish the play.

146
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,960
Is this also part of the plan?

147
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,150
Nianchu.

148
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,590
Wait and you'll know.

149
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,760
Li Teng.

150
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,470
I get nervous all of a sudden.

151
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
It's Li to propose, not you.

152
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,320
Why are you nervous?

153
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,790
It's quite moving.

154
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,670
This evening

155
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,550
may not be the perfect moment.

156
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,440
But I can't wait any longer.

157
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,760
They are all my brothers who have been
tested through fire and water with me.

158
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,320
I asked them to be our witnesses.

159
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,400
Ruan Nianchu.

160
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,230
What I want to say next...

161
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,200
I will say it

162
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,440
just once in my life.

163
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,080
You have to listen clearly.

164
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,080
You are the most beautiful girl I have ever met.

165
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,760
You are the one, and I will never change.

Bravo.

176
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,400
We'll arrange wedding ceremony after tomorrow.

177
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,960
And then we'll travel in honeymoon.

178
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,550
I've already selected the place.

179
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
Li Teng,

180
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,030
I don't care about the wedding.

181
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,280
I don't care about the honeymoon trip.

182
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,320
I just want you to be safe,

183
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,280
and we can be together forever.

184
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,080
This is my second wish.

185
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,440
Okay.

186
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,200

I'm so touched, Shitou.

195
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,440
It's pity Hao is not here.

196
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,590
Hao.

197
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,230
What?

198
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,200
Li.

199
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,550
Hao said Xingxing is missing.

200
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,150
Xingxing! Xingxing!

201
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,150
- Jiang Hao.
- Xingxing.

202
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,640
Why is Xingxing missing?

203
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,880
Nianchu.

204
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,520
What happened?

205
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
It's all my fault.

206
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,230
When I told Feifei about Xingxing's life yesterday.

207
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,790
I guess she overheard.

208
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,000
Therefore, after dinner...

209
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,000
- She is just missing, she is missing.
- Nianchu, what should do?

210
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,790
What if some bad guy took her?

211
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,910
Don't worry too much.

212
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,440
She is way smarter than other kids.

213
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,710
She will be fine.

214
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,520
Hi, sweetie.

215
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,030
Why are you here all alone?

216
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,880
I came

217
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,080
to look for mommy.

218
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,550
Is she here?

219
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,400
My mommy

220
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,520
is sick.

221
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,230
Do you remember

222
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,880
you mom's room number?

223
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,350
Let's go.

224
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,110
I'll take you find her.

225
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,200
Xingxing walked away from the south gate.

226
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,760
He Hu, Shitou, and Xiaowei,

227
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,350
you look for her
along the south side of the community.

228
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,280
Pay attention on stationery stores, toy stores,

229
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,000
and cake shops, where children like to go.

230
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,400
- Ok.
- Got it.  - Copy that.

231
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,150
Feifei and I will look for her at the mall.

232
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,710
Let's go.

233
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,710
I'll come with you.

234
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,080
Then we will go to the amusement park.

235
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,200
We didn't find her.

236
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,150
- Did you find her?
- No.

237
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,350
Hello.

238
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,590
- Hello.
- Have you ever seen...

239
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,200
Have you ever seen...

240
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,230
This...

241
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,910
- Girl?
- About this high.

242
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,400
Yes.

243
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,470
Sorry, I didn't.

244
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,760
Nope.

245
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,430
I go this way.

246
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,340
(The Bear Park)

247
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:17,020
(Tuoli)

248
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,830
The stars shining

249
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,160
are to make everyone

250
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,400
find his own star one day.

251
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,830
I can live on one of the stars

252
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,830
and smile on a certain star.

253
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,590
It will be like seeing all the stars

254
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,310
smiling.

255
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,430
Tuoli.

256
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,590
Thank you.

257
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,560
If it wasn't your call,

258
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,880
we don't have any clue.

259
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,470
Don't say that, Nianchu.

260
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,950
As long as you ask,

261
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,000
I can do anything for you.

262
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,800
No need.

263
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,230
You won't have this chance.

264
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,590
Xingxing,

265
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,880
it's all my fault.

266
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,310
If there is something that I make you unhappy later,

267
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,350
just tell me.

268
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,430
Don't run away from home, OK?

269
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,190
Grownups don't know anything.

270
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,520
It is always the children that explain to them.

271
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,830
It makes me tired.

272
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,230
This is a line from The Little Prince.

273
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,950
I didn't run away from home.

274
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,920
I went to look for my mommy.

275
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,880
Since the first time I came here,

276
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,470
I knew that

277
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,470
the patient at the hospital

278
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,230
was my mommy.

279
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,760
And that Xia she was talking about

280
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,400
was my

281
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,000
Daddy.

282
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,280
How did you figure it out?

283
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,400
The star pattern she embroidered

284
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,830
and the handkerchief my mother left for me

285
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,230
are the same.

286
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,110
Even if

287
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,830
you are not my biological daughter,

288
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,520
I will love you forever.

289
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,400
I promise.

290
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,950
Then daddy,

291
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,760
can you promise me a condition?

292
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,230
One is not enough...

293
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,470
Sky is the limit.

294
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,590
Daddy promises you.

295
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,590
I have learned Farewell.

296
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,830
Tomorrow is mommy's birthday.

297
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,430
I was thinking

298
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,350
to play this song to celebrate her birthday.

299
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,190
Daddy,

300
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,950
can you come with me?

301
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,310
Tomorrow...

302
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,830
Tomorrow Li and I

303
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,560
have some important stuff to do.

304
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,920
Xingxing, let me go with you.

305
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,160
No. I don't.

306
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,710
Xingxing.

307
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,160
When your dad finishes his task tomorrow,

308
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,800
he will come right away to help you
with the celebration.

309
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,920
Not only him,

310
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,590
but all of us will come, OK?

311
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,000
Really?

312
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,310
Yes.

313
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,070
Then let's do pinky finger, daddy.

314
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,920
Okay.

315
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,560
Let's...

316
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,830
make a

317
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,830
pinky swear.

318
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,830
Unchangeable.

319
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,830
Liar,

320
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,880
liar,

321
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,680
pants on fire.

322
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,760
- Deal.
-Deal.

323
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,310
Mr. Daen.

324
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,040
Ruan Nianchu has checked in at the Wenhao hotel.

325
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,070
The security of the Yunteng company
is lurking around.

326
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,590
Li Teng thought he had a deliberate plan...

327
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,280
He didn't expect it was all part of your plan.

328
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,430
Very well.

329
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,470
Keep monitoring the situation.

330
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,920
I also saw a few plainclothes cops.

331
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,000
It seems like Li Teng

332
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,590
has joined forces with the police.

333
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,430
Well...

334
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,040
I want to see

335
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,800
the look on their face in the end.

336
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,920
Tuoli.

337
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,350
Can you help me hang this balloons?

338
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,430
Balloons?

339
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,400
Sure.

340
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,310
What are you doing?

341
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,000
Do you think I didn't hang them up well?

342
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,520
She is afraid of making Miss Qiao tired.

343
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,040
Really?

344
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,590
Is that true?

345
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,310
You are afraid of making me tired?

346
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,590
Yes, yes.

347
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,310
I really do.

348
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,520
Let's have fun together!

349
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,400
- One, two, three, I'll pick you up, okay?
- Yes!

350
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,590
I'm arrived at the hotel room.

351
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,880
(0714)
It's all clear.

352
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,190
What about your side there?

353
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,470
(It's Nianchu, it's not 15)
Your man has promised you to keep your wish,

354
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,590
and never breaks it.

355
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,520
He Hu, watch the lobby.

356
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,920
Copy.

357
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,590
Xiaowei, guard the stairwell.

358
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,350
Copy that.

359
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,160
Shitou.

360
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,110
Hold the back door.

361
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,520
Roger that.

362
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,190
Xiang, how are your men over there?

363
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,400
Everything's ready.

364
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,590
Others don't move.

365
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:26,800
Follow my instructions.

366
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,590
Okay.

367
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:02,880
He Hu.

368
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,430
The target is coming towards you.

369
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,520
Everybody pays attention!

370
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
Spot the target!

371
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,800
Either you stop resisting,

372
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,350
or you become a dead body.

373
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,800
This...

374
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,310
You arranged all this?

375
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:23,880
Yes!

376
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,710
Thank you.

377
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,400
Thank you!

378
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,280
My pleasure.

379
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,310
I am not late, right?

380
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,190
You came so fast!

381
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,280
Where are Jiang Hao and Li Teng?

382
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,400
They will come over when they are done.

383
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,560
You mean...

384
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,920
Let Jiang Hao dress up as me?

385
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,230
It's too dangerous.

386
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,920
Ruan Nianchu, you promised me

387
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,560
that you would proceed according to my plan.

388
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,800
I can't let Jiang Hao take this risk.

389
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,070
- In case...
- Not gonna happen.

390
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,430
We have prepared so much for this.

391
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,040
If Daen doesn't fall for it,

392
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,000
everything we did was for nothing.

393
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,760
Daen is not a patient man.

394
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,590
He stayed on hold for so long.

395
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,880
It's his limit.

396
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,000
He surely won't miss

397
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,160
such a good chance.

398
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,760
Wait in your room.

399
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,920
Jiang Hao will pick you up.

400
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,800
Change your clothes,

401
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,280
and leave the hotel from the backdoor
in five minutes.

402
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,430
Shitou will wait for you there.

403
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,430
If Li is busy with his business,

404
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,680
he doesn't have to rush over.

405
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Celebrating your birthday is his business.

406
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,680
Nianchu, chat with Mrs. Xia.

407
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,950
- Xingxing and I will go help Tuoli with the cake.
- Okay.

408
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,880
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

409
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,110
- Let's go.
- Mrs. Xia.

410
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,470
Don't be afraid.

411
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,560
Li will come back.

412
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,230
Mrs. Xia.

413
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,400
When Mr. Xia was on the mission,

414
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,280
were you worried?

415
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,430
Yes.

416
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,590
I was worried sick.

417
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,880
But what's the use?

418
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,430
In fact, they knew that it was dangerous.

419
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,640
But they still would go.

420
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,400
Did you blame him?

421
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,920
Never.

422
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,590
He went to do what he had to do.

423
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,560
In fact, every time before leaving for a mission,

424
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,710
I would ask him:

425
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,800
Honey,

426
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,520
are you scared?

427
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,950
Guess what he answered?

428
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,520
He said,

429
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,310
I am scared.

430
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,430
I am scared that one day

431
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,920
I will have to break my words.

432
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,760
In that case,

433
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,950
you are going to have to live alone

434
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,710
for the rest of your life.

435
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,400
I told him,

436
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,640
don't worry, honey.

437
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,800
I am already lonely.

438
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,520
On that mission,

439
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,350
Gao

440
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,800
and Xia

441
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,190
were both dead.

442
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,590
Mrs. Xia.

443
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,680
Seems that you have known Xia had already...

444
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,710
Do you heal up?

445
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,680
Am I sick?

446
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,230
Do you know where we are?

447
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,400
We are celebrating a birthday.

448
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,040
Yes.

449
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,680
We are celebrating a birthday.

450
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,920
Whose birthday is it today?

451
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,230
Mrs. Xia.

452
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,880
Today is your birthday!

453
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:32,430
Happy birthday to you!

454
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,590
Make a wish.

455
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,880
Which wish would you want to make?

456
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,520
Wish you happy every day.

457
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,520
No. I don't want it.

458
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,640
Don't you want some more?

459
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,710
This is for you, Shitou.

460
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,160
Have some.

461
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,920
Xiaowei, how is it going?

462
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,040
Don't worry about me.

463
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,430
Go help Hao.

Xiaowei is wounded.

No!

475
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,800
Why wasn't Nianchu here?

Washa.

477
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,920
Hear me out.

When Mr.Daen plan is over,

479
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,760
I will help you kill that girl.

480
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,230
- Now come with me.
- No.

481
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,430
I want to kill her myself.

482
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,680
Fine.

483
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,350
I will let you kill her yourself,

484
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,070
and then what?

485
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,070
Will this make Lee fall in love with you?

486
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,280
Look at me.

487
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,160
The reason why you are in such a pain

488
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,190
is because you've been making mistakes.

489
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680

Okay, slowly.

506
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,070
Come, let's lift it together.

507
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,040
Okay, be careful.

508
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,520
Okay.

Lee.

510
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,320
Do you still remember that day?

511
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,320
The weather

512
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,910
was as beautiful as today.

513
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,150
That day you took an arrow for me.

514
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,910
And I brought you back to the stockade.

515
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,560
I stayed by your side day and night.

516
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,800
But I didn't expect...

517
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,000
You were just using me

518
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,190
to enter the stockade.

519
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,040
But I do not blame you.

520
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,150
I am happy.

521
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,120
Because I am useful to you.

522
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,560
What are you trying to say?

523
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,080
Lee.

524
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,360
I love you.

525
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,800
I have been in love with you for seven years.

526
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,840
I have been waiting for you for seven years.

527
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,870
But this mistake

528
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,630
should be over now.

529
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,040
Let's go.

530
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,950
You think it's over that you catch me?

531
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
What do you mean?

532
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,080
This is only the beginning.

533
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,800
Let's go.

534
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,870
Li.

535
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,120
We worked well together this time.

536
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,560
But it's a pity

537
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,600
that we couldn't find Daen.

538
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,760
Daen won't give up so easily.

539
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Let's keep in touch.

540
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:35,660
(Li Teng)

541
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,430
Nianchu, where are you?

542
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,080
I put some sleeping pills

543
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,470
inside her cake.

544
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,120
She is sleeping now.

545
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,390
It's you.

546
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,710
Now you guessed.

547
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,040
Lee.

548
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,560
I am a little disappointed

549
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,760
in you.

550
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,760
What's going on, Li?

551
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,040
I really didn't expect to see you again.

552
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,470
After that blast,

553
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,000
I have just left.

554
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,360
I went to medical school.

555
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,040
No one wanted to be my friend.

556
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,280
Nianchu.

557
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,670
You were my first friend.
