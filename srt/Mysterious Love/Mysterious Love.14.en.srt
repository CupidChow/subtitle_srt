1
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,520
We'll definitely get caught,

2
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,630
if we escape following that route.

3
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,550
I've tried.

4
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,200
Who are you?

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,520
I'm Tuoli.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,470
I was kidnapped here,

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,910
like you were.

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,720
Lee is on mission today.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,720
He told me to protect you,

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,560
and give you these.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,720
These fruits

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,000
were bought a moment ago.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
Little boy,

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,240
your job is buying fruits?

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,950
No "little".

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,150
I'm 13.

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,110
Boy,

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,110
did you buy these fruits?

19
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,110
No, I didn't.

20
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,440
There are trucks used for buying them.

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,400
Lee told me to pick the freshest ones for you.

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,550
Where are the trucks?

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,360
No one can escape from here.

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,910
Sis, I suggest you just stay here.

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,910
Pal, do me a favor.

26
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm busy.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,910
Come on, please.

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,800
Okay, okay.

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,510
Thanks.

30
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,440
We'll do an overall inspection today.

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,760
Open the door. Check the trucks.

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
- Come on, open it.
- Hurry up.

33
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,230
Open the door.

34
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's do the check.

35
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,470
You are quite relaxed, uh?

36
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,960
- Open your eyes.
- Get off.

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,320
Okay,okay,okay.

38
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Hurry up.

39
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,550
Hurry up.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,550
It's open. It's open.

41
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,110
Check the next immediately.

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,080
Yes, sir.

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,910
I told you it's not gonna work.

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,880
Come out, now.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,190
You two, hurry up.

46
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,270
Hurry up.

47
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, okay, okay.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,720
They check every truck passing by.

49
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,830
Check over there.

50
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
Hurry up.

51
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,670
Coming, coming.

52
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,830
Stop dawdling, hurry up.

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,000
Sis,

54
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,160
your... your hand...

55
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,630
Don't move.

56
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,720
A worm.

57
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,620
=Mysterious Love=
(All the parting is for better meeting)

58
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,300
=Episode 14=

59
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,600
He did not lie to you.

60
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,790
I'm back.

61
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,920
I'm back.

62
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,790
Xia Fei.

63
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,670
Xia Fei, you're back.

64
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,040
Xia.

65
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,160
Look,

66
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,270
I brought you your favorite Baby's Breath.

67
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,760
Xia.

68
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,230
Xia, you're back.

69
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,200
Hurry up, hurry up.

70
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,440
- Xia, you're back.
- Give me the sedative.

71
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,670
Come on, come on.

72
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,110
Put her down.

73
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,230
Okay.

74
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,110
Put her down.

75
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Take her away.

76
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,790
Hurry up, hurry up.

77
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,480
Be careful.

78
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,200
It seemed He Lihua got some mental stimulation,

79
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,640
or remembered something all of a sudden.

80
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,070
She's fine now.

81
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,160
We'll reinforce ward management.

82
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,640
We won't let her run out anymore.

83
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,760
Doctor,

84
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,830
do you know the boy

85
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,920
who saved her upstairs?

86
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,110
He's probably

87
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,230
the new nursing assistant.

88
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,440
What's his name?

89
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,160
I don't remember. He barely talks to us.

90
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,640
Thank you.

91
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,670
I'll show myself out, then.

92
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,230
Thank you.

93
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,830
Do you think

94
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,160
the boy upstairs looks familiar?

95
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,160
I knew him,

96
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
so did you.

97
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,670
Nianchu.

98
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,040
It's really you guys.

99
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,790
Tuoli?

100
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,760
I never thought I would see you again.

101
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,790
Why did you come to the Yun City?

102
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,670
I left there

103
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,830
after the explosion.

104
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
I went to medical school.

105
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,510
Now I get a chance to come here for my internship.

106
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,270
Nianchu

107
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,950
used to talk about

108
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,270
how beautiful here is,

109
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,040
so I want to take a look.

110
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,790
Are you 18 now?

111
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,320
I'll be 19 next month.

112
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,720
Still 18, then.

113
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,950
Still a little boy.

114
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,000
According to Chinese tradition,

115
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,390
I'm already 19 by solar calendar.

116
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,920
Time flies.

117
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,390
I remember at that time,

118
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,670
I called you little boy and you
were very upset.

119
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,440
Now you've grown up.

120
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,830
I was shorter than boys at my age.

121
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,110
No one in the village

122
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,510
wanted to be my friend.

123
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,070
Nianchu,

124
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,520
you're my first friend.

125
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,760
Your first friend

126
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,470
is Li Teng.

127
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,880
Yes.

128
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,110
Lee,

129
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,400
why are you in the Yun City?

130
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,960
To be with her.

131
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,470
Here you are.

132
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,590
You sure you don't need a lift?

133
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,590
No, I'm good.

134
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,150
I'll walk back to the hospital.

135
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,640
Okay.

136
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,080
We have to go, then.

137
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,640
Bye, Nianchu.

138
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,080
Bye, Lee.

139
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,110
What's wrong?

140
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,760
You're weird today.

141
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,030
Am I?

142
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,110
Why did you show off our love to Tuoli?

143
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,000
I've always been doing that.

144
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,320
No, you haven't.

145
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,440
It's not what you usually do.

146
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,670
He has a crush on you.

147
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,280
Don't you remember?

148
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,320
You were bitten by the worm.

149
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,470
You mustn't scratch, okay?

150
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,910
In case other parts of your skin are infected.

151
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,280
Be good!

152
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,470
Put up with it for a few days
and you'll be fine.

153
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,030
Tuoli,

154
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,400
thanks for today.

155
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,520
But

156
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,960
I got you in trouble.

157
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,590
So... are you gonna run again?

158
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,710
Why?

159
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,080
You don't want me to leave

160
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,790
because Lee asks you to keep an eye on me?

161
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,080
Why is that, then?

162
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,400
Because I want to marry you.

163
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,520
You little naughty boy.

164
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,670
I mean it.

165
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,760
You are too young to marry me.

166
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,550
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

167
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,440
How?

168
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,280
Use this.

169
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,440
I'm not a little boy.

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,670
You still remember that?

171
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,760
Come on.

172
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,350
That was just a joke from a little kid.

173
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,200
You've taken it seriously?

174
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,000
Ruan Nianchu,

175
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,400
he's not a kid anymore.

176
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,110
Anyway,

177
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,760
he was and will always be

178
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,470
a little boy to us.

179
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,520
I don't care about anything else.

180
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,110
But Ruan Nianchu,

181
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,320
I'm telling you,

182
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,760
stay away from him.

183
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,910
You're a grown man.

184
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,590
You watch Tuoli grow up.

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,670
I can't believe you're jealous of him.

186
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,320
No.

187
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,440
Five years.

188
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,470
Too much can be changed in five years.

189
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,350
You know what?

190
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,520
What you're doing now

191
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,200
- is childish.
- Yes.

192
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,150
I am childish.

193
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,200
Is it so coincident?

194
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,590
The assistant who saved Mrs. Xia is Tuoli?

195
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,030
Li,

196
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,280
you're really in a complicated relationship.

197
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,710
I've heard you're seeing Miss Qiao.

198
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,080
Yes.

199
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,520
This is your first time falling in love

200
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,880
for so many years.

201
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,840
Take your chance.

202
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,320
Li,

203
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,760
I just...

204
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,440
I don't know how to tell her about Xingxing.

205
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,670
In a relationship

206
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,200
you can never keep a secret,

207
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,550
nor sacrifice oneself.

208
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,110
You have to tell her all about it,

209
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,710
if you want to be with her.

210
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,840
Did Nianchu

211
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,080
teach you these?

212
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,000
Did you hand in your report?

213
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,760
Right away.

214
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,030
Right away.

215
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,700
(Class of Life Aesthetics)

216
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,470
(Class of Life Aesthetics)
Nianchu.

217
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,320
Shitou,

218
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,710
he's my friend.

219
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,350
What are you doing here?

220
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,640
Nianchu.

221
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,840
I come here to ask you for a favor.

222
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,910
Don't be rude. Call me sister.

223
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,440
How can I help?

224
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,280
It's a straycat I saved

225
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,200
outside the hospital.

226
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,320
It was hit by a car.

227
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,790
I took it to a pet clinic.

228
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,350
And the vet sewed up its wound.

229
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,320
It's out of danger now.

230
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,550
And?

231
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,150
It has been discharged from hospital,

232
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,230
but you know,

233
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,760
I live in the nursing assistant apartment,

234
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,320
so I can't adopt it.

235
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,350
So you are saying

236
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,790
you want me to help you adopt it.

237
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,710
I've bought everything it may need.

238
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,710
Here they are.

239
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,960
Okay.

240
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,790
Sweety.

241
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,440
Nowadays,

242
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,000
it's not only hard for people to survive,

243
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,320
but also for cats.

244
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
It's unbelievable such a cute cat is homeless.

245
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,400
Don't worry.

246
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,520
I'll treat you well.

247
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,200
You'll not be homeless anymore.

248
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,030
Okay?

249
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,110
Nianchu, where do you live?

250
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,880
Let me call you a cab.

251
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,760
Li Teng's gonna pick me up after work.

252
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,760
How about we having dinner together?

253
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,030
Lee will be upset

254
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,400
seeing me.

255
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,590
Actually I've always wanted to ask you.

256
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,080
What's going on between you guys?

257
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,670
I have no idea.

258
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,230
No idea?

259
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,000
Maybe,

260
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,550
Lee has a misunderstanding of me,

261
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,880
or I have a misunderstanding of him.

262
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,350
What do you mean?

263
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,110
What misunderstanding do you have of him?

264
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,230
I mean,

265
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,230
maybe Tuoli,

266
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,150
is never important to him.

267
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,640
At that time,

268
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,030
boss,

269
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,320
Tuva,

270
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,640
Washa,

271
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,790
and I,

272
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,030
were only chessmen in his action plan.

273
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,520
God knows what I am to him?

274
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,840
Tuoli,

275
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,880
you're over thinking.

276
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,230
Li Teng

277
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,590
has always been taking you like
his own brother.

278
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,320
The man who has always been
taking me like his own brother

279
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,880
is Lee.

280
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,150
Pathetically, however,

281
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,350
Lee doesn't exist anymore.

282
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,840
Lee is Li Teng.

283
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,470
Maybe.

284
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,110
Nianchu, Li's here.

285
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,550
I'll leave, then.

286
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,790
Kitty.

287
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,440
How did you get this cat?

288
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,150
What?

289
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,080
President Li Teng's afraid of a cat?

290
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,710
No, Ruan Nianchu,

291
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,280
don't you think you should tell me first

292
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,150
before keeping a cat?

293
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,830
I can't tell you first.

294
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,640
Tuoli found it near the hospital.

295
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,110
He can't keep it in the apartment,

296
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,310
so he asked me to keep it.

297
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,110
Ruan Nianchu,

298
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,160
I'm okay with you keeping a cat or a dog,

299
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,560
and I can give you

300
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,280
anything you want.

301
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,000
But this cat...

302
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,070
No.

303
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,470
Why not?

304
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,190
Why not? Don't you have any idea?

305
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,760
It's just a straycat.

306
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,590
Be sympathetic, please!

307
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,430
I'm not sympathetic but he is?

308
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,920
I'm cruel but he's kind?

309
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,040
What the hell?
What's going on between you and Tuoli?

310
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,430
What makes you dislike him so much?

311
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,710
I'm gonna take the cat back to the hospital,

312
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,400
and let the one who has mercy to keep it.

313
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,070
What if I say

314
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,160
this is the first thing I'm asking you to say yes?

315
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,430
My promise will only be kept to you.

316
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,710
Show me another pose.

317
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,230
Okay.

318
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,520
That's good.

319
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,640
Wow, my shooting skills are getting better, see?

320
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,520
Xingxing's gonna love this one.

321
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,160
Yufei,

322
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,280
I've got something to tell you.

323
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,640
What's wrong?

324
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,800
You're not going to break up
with me so fast, are you?

325
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,280
Actually...

326
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,830
Aunt Yufei.

327
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,880
- Come on, play with me.
- Coming.

328
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,160
You go up there first,

329
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,520
and I'll take photos for you.

330
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,680
Be careful. Be careful.

331
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,920
Stand in front of the hole.

332
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,350
Okay.

333
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,000
Another pose.

334
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,190
Where are you gonna settle it in?

335
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,430
In the living room, I think.

336
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,710
The bed and the bowl...

337
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,230
Put them here.

338
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,470
Put the cat litters over there.

339
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,800
You sure?

340
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,520
Kitty,

341
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,230
here is your home from now on.

342
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,680
We're gonna take very good care of you.

343
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,590
Don't count me in.

344
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,430
Kitty,

345
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,920
let me introduce him to you.

346
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,280
This

347
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,680
is Li Teng.

348
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,230
You see he's very tall,

349
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,160
but he's very narrow minded.

350
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,800
What did you say?

351
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,920
I was introducing you,

352
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,160
saying you're handsome.

353
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,400
But

354
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,110
we can't just call it kitty.

355
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,040
Let me see.

356
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,230
Jealous Li.

357
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Jealous Li. Jealous...

358
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,880
No, change it.

359
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,760
Why not?

360
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,280
No, it's a bad name.

361
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,640
Are you still angry?

362
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,160
No, I dare not.

363
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,680
You dare not?

364
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,040
You think there's something
between Tuoli and me

365
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,950
just because of a cat.

366
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,280
How many times I've told you?

367
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,160
I just take him as my brother.

368
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,430
Would you please stop being so suspicious?

369
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,760
Would you please stop being so naive?

370
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,310
Why am I being naive?

371
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,760
You take him as your brother,

372
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,640
but he doesn't take you as his sister.

373
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,350
If he doesn't take me as his sister,
then what does he treat me?

374
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,280
What did you draw?

375
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,760
Nothing.

376
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,680
You like Ruan Nianchu, don't you?

377
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,350
I'm here to remind you that

378
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,760
she'll leave one day.

379
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,520
I can go to find her,

380
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,040
if she leaves.

381
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,070
What happened here

382
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,680
is just a dream to her.

383
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:12,950
A dream

384
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,070
will not last.

385
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,040
I never thought

386
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,000
Tuoli would have this strange feeling for me.

387
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,110
I'll talk to him.

388
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,520
Is it necessary?

389
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,310
If some one has to do it, it should be me.

390
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,350
But what are you gonna talk to him?

391
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,400
Talking is unnecessary,

392
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,710
if a fist is useful.

393
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,560
I think I should go.

394
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,800
I'll tell him

395
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,560
to take me just as a sister.

396
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,280
Can you take me as your brother,

397
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,310
if I ask you so?

398
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,310
Such an old brother

399
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,760
should be my uncle.

400
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,230
How dare you?

401
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,230
Say that again.

402
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,070
I'm sorry.

403
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,280
- Say that again. Say it.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

404
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,680
What are you doing?

405
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,310
Go to bed.

406
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,470
I haven't eaten anything yet.

407
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,560
Eat after sleep.

408
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,590
I'm starving.

409
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,880
I'll take her inside.

410
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,830
Thank you for today.

411
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,070
Why have you been so weird today?

412
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,760
Is there something you want to tell me?

413
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,230
Do you want to

414
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,470
tell me about your ex-wife?

415
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
I've been hiding from you before,

416
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,430
- because...
- I know.

417
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,070
It's because of Xingxing.

418
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,680
But look, everything's good now.

419
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,640
Xingxing has accepted me,

420
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,230
and I think she's very adorable.

421
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,920
So I'm happy to be her step-mother.

422
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,800
Xingxing is not my biological daughter.

423
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,070
She doesn't even know about that.

424
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,560
Her original name is Xia Xingxing.

425
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,950
She's my master Xia's daughter.

426
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,430
Before she was one month old,

427
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,640
something happened to my master.

428
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,680
Mrs. Xia couldn't take it,

429
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,590
so she got mental problems,

430
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,590
and was sent to mental hospital.

431
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,000
But some one has to take care of Xingxing.

432
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,110
So

433
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,040
I got married with Mrs. Xia.

434
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,640
It's the only way I can...

435
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,880
I can raise Xingxing up

436
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,070
in a legal way.

437
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,920
Mrs. Xia's condition has been
unstable these years.

438
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,280
The doctor said it would be a long way to go.

439
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,000
So,

440
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,680
things will be like this

441
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,830
before Xingxing is 18.

442
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,640
You and I...

443
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,280
Before everything's too late,
if you think...

444
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,070
you can't accept it... I...

445
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,680
- or...
- I can accept it.

446
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,880
I can wait until Xingxing is 18.

447
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,400
Marriage is only a piece of paper,

448
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,430
anyway.

449
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,800
All I want is you're here with me.

450
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,350
I love you.

451
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,000
I love you, too.
