1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,740
Everything gets a crack

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,700
where the light comes in.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,060
And he

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,730
is the light that belongs to me.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,020
In those days,

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,810
there was a man

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,020
stepping through all the troubles

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,220
and dangers.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,220
I had nowhere to hide.

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,050
What should we do now?

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:31,850
Run.

12
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,100
How about you?

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,250
Forget all that happened here when
you get out.

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,340
Those fragments are like a film
played back frame by frame,

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,820
dazzling my eyes,

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,410
recurring to my mind

17
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,210
throughout the rest of my life.

18
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,660
I know I can't catch him

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,210
just like the unpredictable light

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,010
that appears splendid in a flash

21
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,330
and disappears like a bubble

22
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,820
without any trace.

23
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:06,900
Lee.

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,220
Lee.

25
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,580
At the age of 20,

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,260
I had a crush which stranded my entire life.

27
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,730
At the moment when you disappeared,

28
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,540
I was gone, too.

29
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,460
Could the story that's changed by fate

30
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,140
be brought back to the beginning?

31
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,370
Since then, her heart got lost

32
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,540
and she can only bury him in the deepest memory.

33
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,140
Nianchu,

34
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,690
if you act like this, I can't go on.

35
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,540
Doesn't the script say that

36
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,970
the lead actress knows the lead man

37
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,180
is playing dead this time?

38
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,820
Why do you cry so hard?

39
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,370
The lead man loves you so much.

40
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,780
Should I rise from the dead?

41
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,100
Can you just follow the script?

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,570
It is you who didn't follow the script.

43
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,820
How can you say it's my fault?

44
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,010
Did you mean my acting is not so good?

45
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,100
I graduated from
Theatrical Department of Yun University

46
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,060
getting the scholarship in three
consecutive years.

47
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,540
And I was the most handsome Romeo

48
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,290
selected by the student union.

49
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,370
You...

50
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,100
How could you say my acting skill is
not good?

51
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,460
Let's call it a day.

52
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,290
Let's go.

53
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,460
Okay, fine. It's over for today's rehearsal.

54
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,980
Let's go.

55
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,620
The work is over.

56
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,980
Come on, let's go to eat hotpot tonight.

57
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,010
Okay, fine.

58
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,700
Then I would have to go with you guys.

59
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,490
Now

60
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,290
I perform another's sadness and happiness.

61
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,930
Whatever the story is,

62
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,290
it always has

63
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,900
a happy ending.

64
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,260
So I always think

65
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,340
if the end is not good,

66
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,900
it means

67
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,010
the end has not come yet.

68
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,010
Ruan Nianchu.

73
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,010
You are...

74
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,420
I'm Dai Jie.

75
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,330
My work is in finance.

76
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,580
My hobbies are photographing
and playing golf.

77
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,260
In my spare time, I also like to climb
mountains and take pictures with friends.

78
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,330
What kind of girl do you like?

79
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,420
I can't tell it clearly.

80
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,140
I think the most important is the chemistry.

81
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,650
I know you've been single for these years.

82
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,020
I have been single, too.

83
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,370
Single again.

Almighty Friends Moments,

85
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,300
please give me a handsome, considerable

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,930
boyfriend who is good at taking pictures.

87
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,050
When I saw your photo for the
first time,

88
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,450
I thought this girl...

89
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,540
I think you're good.

90
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,140
So do I.

91
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,140
I think you're perfect for my girlfriend

Miss Ruan.

93
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,020
Is this some kind of new type joking?

94
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,140
Oh, no.

95
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,370
I send her Wechat to you.

96
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,330
You can add her.

97
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,860

Isn't the expiration date
of your boyfriend

133

no more than three weeks?

134
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,860

135
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,420
Dai Jie can be your next one.

136

I'll be very tired if I do so.

137
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,740
I've been addicted to
creating recently.

138
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,700
I,

139
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,540
as a reader who has read so many
online novels,

140
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,610
have decided

141
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,820
to write novels online.

142
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,700
Then what are you going to do with
your billions of family property?

143
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,490
If there is nothing to show for the
novel, I can choose to inherit it.

144
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,300
Come on and show me.

145
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,420
Come here.

146
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,770
Let me have a look.

147
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,260
The heroine names Ruan Nianjiu.
What's the matter?

148
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,050
The story is about you.

149
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,420
The heroine went to Tai City
to film her graduate work

150
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,820
and was bullied by actress, Li Hongyan.

151
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,740
Then the heroine was looking for props
by the sea,

152
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,260
but she broke into the trading scene of
the gangsters by mistake.

153
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,300
And she was thrown into sea on the spot.

154
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,700
She sank instantaneously because
she couldn't swim.

155
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,210
At that time, the hero came, jumped
into the sea, rescued her

156
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,100
and showed off his chest minuscules
by the way.

157
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,020
Right.

158
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,420
Isn't it the thing happened to you
five years ago?

159
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,820
But did I say anything

160
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,420
about chest muscle？

161
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,580
Although you didn't say it clearly,

162
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,370
I got your point.

163
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,450
Well, I wish I could have such
an impressive love.

164
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,180
Let me go.

165
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,010
Come.

166
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,130
Ruan Nianchu,

167
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,620
you can live on only by following me.

168
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:52,980
It's just...

169
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,770
I don't figure out the ending yet.

170
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,570
You said that the hero died because of
saving the heroine.

171
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,010
What happened next?

172
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,890
And then

173
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,860
just write that the heroine

174
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,420
got a normal life,

175
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,770
working when she needs to work

176
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,690
getting married when she needs to
get married.

177
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,130
If she really gets married when she needs,

178
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,010
why do you always introduce your blind
date to me?

179
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,130
If she really works when she needs,

180
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,620
why do you always stare at a pot of flower?

181
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,300
I'm speaking of the heroine.

182
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,100
Do you know the flower language of it?

183
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,570
It's forget-me-not.

184
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,770
Don't you still miss that Lee?

185
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,540
Just go to write your novel.

186
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,330
Why is it always not in a
better condition?

187
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,740
Mr. Zhao.

188
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,690
Mr. Zhao.

189
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,250
Mr.Zhao.

190
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,010
Well, Nianchu, don't worry.

191
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,180
This forget-me-not.

192
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,740
I'll help you bring it back from death.

193
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,210
It's not dead yet.

194
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,250
Don't worry.

195
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,300
I'll help you solve it.

196
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,740
Oh, right. Nianchu.

197
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,860
Our play, Li Ke Chu Lian

198
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,620
needs to wait for a little while.

199
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,380
No way.

200
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,060
But Li Xiaoyan is too busy recently.

201
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,940
Although she signed contract with
our troupe,

202
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,130
she called me personally for it.

203
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,620
We're just a small troupe.

204
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,810
If it's not with Li Xiaoyan,

205
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,300
who would come to watch our play?

206
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,130
So

207
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,890
we can also wait for a while

208
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,980
and take a break.

209
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,130
Is that okay?

210
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,620
Mr. Zhao,

211
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,180
our poster has been made,

212
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,540
and half of the tickets have been sold.

213
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,330
Now if you change the time,

214
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,010
what about our troupe's reputation?

215
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,060
I'll go find her.

216
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,330
Stop.

217
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,620
Look,

218
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,130
she is renewing her ads contract today.

219
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,500
Don't go to make troubles for her.

220
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,940
How do you know that?

221
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,010
I'm the chairman of her fan club.

222
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,060
How can't I know it.

223
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,770
Since you like her so much,

224
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,300
as the big fan of her,

225
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,500
you must know where she is, right?

226
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Of course.

227
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,740
The Jiuzhang Villa on Binhai Road.

228
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,300
That's great.

229
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,860
Please.

230
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,420
Keep orders.

231
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,300
Wait for a moment.

232
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,770
Please come in.

233
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,860
Stop pushing, stop pushing.

234
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,330
Please show your invitation.

235
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,380
I'm Qiao Brand...

236
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,210
your sponsor's friend.

237
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,690
Okay.

238
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,250
(Always following and loving you, Xiaoyan)
They all said like this.

239
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,500
(Always following and loving you, Xiaoyan)
Don't push, don't push.

240
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,340
(make living with beauty Nianchu)

241
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,500
Hello, Nianchu.

242
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,620
Hi, Yufei,

243
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,890
help me get a initiation of your

244
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,250
brand's celebration party.

245
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,300
Don't you dislike this kind of occasion?

246
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,330
I'm coming to find Li Xiaoyan.

247
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,060
She is the Li Hongyan five years ago.

248
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,250
What?

249
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,100
Li Xiaoyan is Li Hongyan.

250
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,620
Do you forget it was her fault
making you fall into sea?

251
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,740
I don't like her, either.

252
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,860
But work is work which is
not related to personal matters.

253
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,500
I'll get you a innovation first

254
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,540
and get even with Qiao later.

255
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,010
Thank you.

256
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,250
Are you done?

257
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,770
Brilliant performance.

258
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,060
What is that saying,

259
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,740
real listening, watching and feeling.

260
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,740
Is that right?

261
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,060
I really should call my men to have a look.

262
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,690
- Let me in.
- You can't rush in.

263
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,860
Miss Ruan, sorry to keep you

264
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,940
waiting so long.

265
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,540
- Please come in this way.
- Thank you.

266
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,740
Sorry.

267
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,420
You...

268
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,330
Miss Li.

269
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,540
I'm Ruan Nianchu.

270
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,940
You acted in my play five years ago.

271
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,180
Do you still remember it?

272
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,450
No.

273
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,620
Now I'm a actress in Morninglight Troupe.

274
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,380
I'm glad that you can join our play.

275
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,130
So I...

276
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:54,770
Mr. Zhang.

277
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,690
- Long time no see.
- Miss Li.

278
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,130
What are you busy for recently?

279
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:58,650
Let's have a seat.

280
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,380
Please.

281
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,890
You, too.

282
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,180
You're so busy lately.

283
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,420
I thought you had forgotten me.

284
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,650
How is it possible.

285
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,500
Right.

286
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,010
I heard that your company was going to
release a new produce later this year.

287
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,570
I wonder that if you have any

288
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,180
idea of the representative.

289
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,330
In my mind,

290
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,210
Miss Li is the perfect one.

291
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,060
Don't worry,

292
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,100
tell your agent to wait for my call.

293
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,860
Thanks you so much.

294
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,330
Have a good time.

295
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,180
See you.

296
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,300
Miss Li .

297
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,180
Please have a look.

298
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,300
The poster has changed as your request.

299
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,540
How about your idea?

300
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,810
Who let you in?

301
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,650
That's not important.

302
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,420
And I also bring the contract

303
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,940
which was signed by you personally.

304
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,450
- Xiaoyan.
- Xiaoyan.

305
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,130
I haven't seen you for ages.

306
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,500
Have a seat.

307
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
It turned out you're here.

308
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,540
Well,

309
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,210
I have

310
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,300
seen you two earlier.

311
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,980
But you were talking and didn't see me.

312
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,210
How could it be?

313
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,420
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt you.

314
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,420
Half of the tickets for Li Ke Chu Lian
have been sold out.

315
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,740
If you don't come, our troupe will...

316
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,100
Who is this?

317
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,300
Don't you see we are talking?

318
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,300
How does she come in?

319
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,650
Please send her out.

320
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,690
Sorry, Miss Li.

321
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,010
She came in with VIP card.

322
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,420
I can't help you.

323
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,770
Then go to tell your boss

324
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,940
to send more men here.

325
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,330
Don't let some stranger bother me, OK?

326
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,210
Thank you.

327
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,500
Let me have a look.

328
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,380
Please do me a favor.

329
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,060
Please let the shot focus on me.

330
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,650
Okay.

331
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,540
You...

332
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,210
Let us congratulate Miss Li Xiaoyan again,

333
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,060
for she renews contract with Qiao Brand.

334
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,860
Miss Li Xiaoyan

335
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,690
is an artist with an excellent social
reputation.

336
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,300
Last year, the results brought by Miss Li's ads

337
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,940
have been witnessed by everyone.

338
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,890
And this year

339
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,500
Miss Li joined Morninglight Troupe's

340
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,330
short play Li Ke Chu Lian with a low pay

341
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,100
for supporting drama market.

342
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,650
Such a representative of conscience

343
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,210
deserves the support of all of us.

344
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,570
Support.

345
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,050
We must support.

346
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,380
Thanks, thank everyone.

347
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,740
Hope you guys can continue to enjoy
tonight's party.

348
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,660
You really have a thing.

349
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,620
Congratulate, Li Hongyan.

350
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,660
I just recorded it.

351
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,740
And I will notify you on Weibo,

352
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,450
so that my 50 thousand fans

353
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,170
can interact with your five million fans.

354
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,050
Sorry.

355
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,170
As for the contract,

356
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,570
maybe my agent knows about it.

357
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,780
But I haven't seen it yet,

358
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,740
so I don't know it.

359
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,260
Mr. Li,

360
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,050
please send me home.

361
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,930
Okay, Miss Li.

362
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,860
Let's go.

363
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,530
Lee.

364
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,900
It's you!

365
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,050
Mr. Li.

366
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,980
Do you know each other?

367
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,330
Miss.

368
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,330
Sorry, you've got the wrong person.

369
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,100
You don't remember me.

370
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,380
Miss.

371
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,900
Please don't drink too much next time.

372
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,570
I didn't drink.

373
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,570
You're Lee.

374
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,170
That's enough, Ruan Nianchu.

375
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,380
You are really different today.

376
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,450
This is Li Teng.

377
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,780
You can call him Mr. Li.

378
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,860
But don't call him Li.

379
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,260
I have brought the contract.

380
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,690
Please meet your engagements.

381
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,410
Have you learnt how to swim?

382
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,260
It's so pity.

383
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,620
It falls into pool.

384
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,690
Will you come to fulfill the contract,

385
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,450
if I jump in and pick it up.

386
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,050
We can discuss it after you pick it up.

387
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,260
Okay.

388
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,020
I'll do it.

Towel.

415
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,660
Go and record it.

416
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,050
This is news.

417
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,020
Be careful.

418
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,020
Record more.

419
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,210
I just made a small joke with her,

420
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,900
how could she really get it?

421
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,620
I have picked it up.

422
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,740
Please meet your engagements.

423
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,410
I was just making joke with you.

424
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,020
I didn't expect you really
jump in to pick them up.

425
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,860
Alright.

426
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,980
I promise you.

427
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,330
For what I promised,

428
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,330
I'll do it even without a contract.

429
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,620
Keep your word.

430
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,620
Hello, Nianchu.

431
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,570
Li Xiaoyan called me.

432
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,780
Everything is done.

433
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,660
Xiaoyan said,

434
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,810
you two had a good chat at the party

435
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,660
and you swam together.

436
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,500
But I do remember that
you were afraid of water.

437
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,780
However, you're so amazing, Nianchu.

438
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,780
There is nothing you can't handle.

439
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,980
The script of this play was bought by you.

440
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:39,140
(Five years ago Overseas)

441
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,980
How do you feel, chick?

442
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,690
I thought there was some
bad guy peeping.

443
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,860
I accidentally kicked you in the water.

444
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,860
I'll find clean clothes for you later.

445
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,100
Don't you think

446
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,660
she is pretty?

447
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,410
Her skin is pale and soft.

448
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,020
It's not easy to find girl like this.

449
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,210
I want her.

450
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,500
Please let me go.

451
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,500
I didn't see anything.

452
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
I didn't see anything.

453
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,050
I just came to pick props.

454
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,330
I won't say anything.

455
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,860
Please let me go.

456
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,860
How much do you want? I can give you.

457
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,530
If the crew found I disappeared,

458
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,170
they'll come to find me.

459
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,500
How much do you want? I can give you.

460
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,980
Please let me go.

461
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,260
Let me go.

462
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,810
I am begging you.

463
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,050
Don't touch me.

464
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,210
Don't.

465
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,660
Let me go.

466
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,530
Get off me.

467
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,330
Let Lee be the first.

468
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,740
After he is done, I will try.

469
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,780
Lee's girl.

470
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,530
Let's better not touch.

471
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,050
Let's go.

472
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,050
Hello.

473
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,410
Hello, Nianchu.

474
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,660
Hello.

475
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,140
Are you listening?

476
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,530
Ruan Nianchu.

477
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,980
It's your name, right?

478
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,570
What's up?

479
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,500
I have called your troupe's head.

480
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,810
I tell you,

481
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,260
this is the last time.

482
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,100
You work so hard for your troupe.

483
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,980
Doesn't Zhao Jianhua send a car to
pick you?

484
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,140
Don't need Miss Li to worry.

485
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,380
I'm cold.

486
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,860
Li Teng, let's go home.

487
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,500
(There are too many people waiting for car,
please be patient)

488
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,380
Your sight is so good

489
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,660
that you can recognize Nianchu

490
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,260
at that dark place.

491
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,980
But

492
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,530
it's the first time you two meet.

493
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,980
Why are you so impressed with her?

494
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,930
You don't like others sitting next to you.

495
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,780
Actually I can understand it,

496
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,100
because my ex-boyfriend also likes this.

497
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,380
But when we were together,

498
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,740
he never let me sit on other seat anymore.

499
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Then

500
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,140
will one day

501
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,140
you invite me to sit next to you?

502
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,930
No.

503
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,620
Why?

504
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,810
Because I don't talk about personal
matters when I work.

505
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,500
But if my company didn't arrange you

506
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,450
to charge the security of this party,

507
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,900
you would not talk to me, right?

508
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,570
Aren't you afraid that we'll change to
another security team?

509
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,140
Please do as you want.

510
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,820

511
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,180
(Theater Head's Office)

512
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,810
I'll be very careful.

513
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,500
Don't worry, and it won't be hurt.

514
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,660
Just to change another home.

515
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,210
And you can move back later.

516
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,690
What is it?

517
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,170
What kind of coin is it?

518
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,410
Interesting.

519
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,570
It's broken.

520
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,930
Get someone fix it.

521
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,930
It might be a good thing.

522
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Reborn.

523
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,810
It must be reborn.

524
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,620
You had seen that ship exploded.

525
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,930
How could he appear again?

526
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,140
According to the logic of online novel,

527
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,050
it must be reborn.

528
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,170
But he doesn't remember you.

529
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,810
Time travel.

530
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,660
The one you saw is not him.

531
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,450
It is another soul.

532
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,980
I know it.

533
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,530
Memory lost.

534
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,330
This memory lost might be late,

535
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,170
but never absent.

536
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:20,020
I don't care it is time travel, reborn
or memory lost.

537
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,500
I don't care.

538
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,260
You don't care.

539
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,690
After all those years,

540
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,570
you still can't let him go.

541
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,100
I,

542
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,100
Ruan Nianchu,

543
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,420
will begin a new life.

544
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,460
(YOU WIN)

545
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,500
That's right.

546
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,450
There are so many men in the world.

547
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,140
Why do you keep focusing on the only one?

548
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,930
This is the one introduced to have a
blind date with you.

549
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,020
Add him.

550
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,420
(0714 add to contacts)

551
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,810
Hello.

552
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,980
I've ordered Braque room.

553
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,900
Okay, this way, please.

554
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,530
Thank you.

555
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,980
Hello, I'm Ruan Nianchu.

556
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,740
