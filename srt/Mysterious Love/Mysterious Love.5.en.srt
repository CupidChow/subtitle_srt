1
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,850
It must be hurt...

2
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,530
You get lost...

3
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,400
What do you want to do?

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,330
Don't you come over.

5
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:28,880
Let me go.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,930
Don't be scared.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,970
I'm the woman of your gangleader.

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,400
Dare you to touch me.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,360
He just screwed you and you thought
you are the woman of the boss?

10
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,720
Who the hell does he think he is?

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,490
I am the boss.

12
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,400
You guys, get out.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,130
Yeah.

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:45,810
OK.

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,560
Don't be terrifying.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,240
You know what?

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,680
Lee is bullshit.

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,490
He's certainly not as nice to you as I am.

19
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,520
I'm stronger than him.

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,680
I'll do you good.

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:55,970
Lee.

22
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:56,560
Shut fuck up.

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,000
Don't play trick.

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,600
Get off me.

25
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,280
You have a fair complexion.

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,210
Who the hell is it?

27
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,680
Lee, it's you.

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,210
You're just in time.

29
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,360
She wanted to run away,

30
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,920
and I caught her back for you.

31
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,400
Don't try to get away.

32
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,960
Ouch, my knees.

33
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,250
It hurts.

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,770
Let me go.

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,890
Let me go.

36
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,210
- Which hand did you use just now?
- Let go of me.

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,450
Let go of me.

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,130
Lee.

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,850
You asshole,

40
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,680
let go of me. It's killing me.

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,170
We've been through fire and water for so many years,

42
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,530
and you stepped on my hand for this bitch.

43
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,400
It's almost broken.

44
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,810
Just you wait.

45
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm waiting for you.

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,960
Ruan Nianchu,

47
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,720
don't move.

48
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,530
Stay where you are.

49
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,840
No one's gonna save you if you
pick your feet up.

50
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,000
There are eight minefields all over the jungle.

51
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,090
Well...

52
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,640
What...

53
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,170
What should I do?

54
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,410
Just step on it with all your strength.

55
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,840
Hang in there!

56
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,120
Don't go away.

57
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,170
Were you telling me to step on it forever？

58
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,000
I knew you wouldn't turn your back on me.

59
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,690
Why are you sitting down？

60
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,760
I can't feel my feet.

61
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,410
Didn't you even find some stone

62
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,050
so that I could retreat my feet?

63
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,360
You know well about it.

64
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,250
Are you going to run away?

65
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,480
Run away?

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,840
Are you tricking me?

67
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,410
Try to lift your feet.

68
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,560
What?

69
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,280
Feel shy?

70
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,920
Who said she is my girl?

71
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,760
Don't move.

72
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,120
What do you want?

73
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,690
Someone is watching us.

74
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,560
Remember, stay with me, so you can live.

75
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,130
Put me down.

76
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,160
Let me go.

77
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,360
The whole land belongs to Tuva.

78
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,250
There're a lot of roadblocks.

79
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,200
Drones patrol the skies round the clock.

80
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,090
Do you think

81
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,760
you can get out alive by yourself?

85
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,880
Thanks.

86
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,480
Leaving is

87
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,480
the best way to protect her.

88
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,440
There can be no more Xia Xingxing and He Lihua.

89
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,410
Well...

90
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,090
You…

91
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,440
What time is your performance tomorrow?

92
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,810
At 7 p.m.

93

95
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,360
Wish Ruan Nianchu a great success.

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,690
You... are you all right?

97
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,290
Sure,

98
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,320
I, Qiao Yufei, can't be defeated so easily!

99
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,530
Listen,

100
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,130
wherever he is,

101
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,410
I'll

102
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,530
find him out.

103
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,530
Kind of persistent.

104
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,600
You are telling me.

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,160
You've never seen him before.

106
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,200
Let me tell you,

107
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,250
he fits all the descriptions

108
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,160
of a bossy CEO in web literature.

109
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,480
Solemn.

110
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,200
Capable.

111
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,250
Affectionate.

112
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,040
My dear Xingxing,

113
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,850
take the pill, okay?

114
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,730
No, I don't.

115
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,810
Sweetie,

116
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,440
you take the pill,

117
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,010
and you get recovery.

118
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,880
Daddy will buy you ice cream.

119
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:13,920
Trust me.

120
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,760
You're lying, daddy.

121
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,880
You promised to buy me a crown, but you didn't.

122
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,690
I won't believe you anymore.

123
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,850
Xingxing, I did go buying that day,

124
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,480
but I met…

125
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,600
You're looking for me?

126
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,810
You just forgot it.

127
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,010
He is bossy and forceful.

128
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,970
He is man of gravitas.

129
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,010
No one could bargain with him.

130
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,360
Xingxing,

131
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,850
I promise you.

132
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,730
I'll get you the crown,

133
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,600
OK?

134
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:54,290
OK, let's make a pinky swear.

135
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,250
You've got big dark circles.

136
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,200
What did you do after sending me home?

137
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,850
It looks fishy.

138
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,440
Did you ever try to...

139
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,250
stop...

140
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,040
when you were about to...

141
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,680
Who stopped? You?

142
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,610
No, not me. It's him.

143
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,970
He…

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,640
Is Li Teng gay?

145
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,680
No, it's impossible.

146
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,120
Why are you so sure?

147
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,240
Did you…

148
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,410
Shut up.

149
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,610
Then why are you long face?

150
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,200
I just feel that he is in a thoughtful mind

151
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,290
when he is with me.

152
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,880
More specific?

153
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,050
But I can't tell it specifically.

154
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,290
Well…

155
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,800
OK,

156
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,320
Iet me show you a thing or two.

157
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,640
If he is still not to be swayed.

158
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,090
Well,

159
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,730
either he's not into you,

160
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,730
or,

161
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,610
not into women.

162
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,560
Keep this in mind.

163
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,760
Next time, when you guys date,

164
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,170
you need to know how to be romantic.

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,800
And...

166
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,200
crack some physically contact inadvertently.

167
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,850
Then,

168
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,370
at this time,

169
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,560
you need to

170
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,410
stare at him

171
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,730
with tender affection.

172
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,560
And when it gets to climax,

173
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,320
close your eyes naturally.

174
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,000
If he still makes no actions,

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,290
he's definitely not interested in women.

176
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,140
(Jiang Hao)

177
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,730
Hello?

178
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,880
Hey, Li.

179
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,730
I can't go to Ruan Nianchu's show today.

180
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,560
Take good care of Xingxing at home.

181
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Don't worry about other things.

182
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll ask He Hu to send you some porridge.

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,800
What else?

184
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,410
Li,

185
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,200
you'll get the coin if you go to the theater, right?

186
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,000
And...

187
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,970
you will break up with her after that?

188
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
This is the best way to protect her.

189
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,290
Tell me

190
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,170
what do you want to do when you get home?

191
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,090
Have some tasty food.

192
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,640
I'll head to the snack street...

193
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,440
First, eat a bowl of stinky tofu.

194
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,760
Then I'll have the durian pie beside.

195
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,680
Then beef hot pot.

196
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,800
The beef there is really tender.

197
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,680
And I'll have a bowl of satay noodles as
my night snack.

198
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,610
You know, the taste of soup is rich.

199
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,490
It's slightly sweet in your first bite.

200
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,800
Gulp down at once, and it's super good.

201
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,200
(Moonlight Troupe)
Where is the necklace?

202
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,780
(Moonlight Troupe)

203
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,170
(Li Ke Chu Lian Li Xiaoyan)
The necklece is gone?

204
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,100
(Li Ke Chu Lian Li Xiaoyan)

205
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,370
You did it.

206
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,880
Don't pretend.

207
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,120
You are the thief.

208
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Did you see it

209
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,170
or hear it by yourself?

210
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Or just by your bias?

211
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,090
Or you just want to frame me.

212
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,090
Nianchu performed so well.

213
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,560
Impressive.

214
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
Just like a real thief.

215
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:29,620
(The office of Mr. Zhao)

216
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,490
Mr. Zhao, did you forget to give me something

217
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,320
in the forget-me-not pot?

218
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,320
How did you know?

219
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,290
Mr. Zhao,

220
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,800
please give that back to me.

221
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,930
Well...

222
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,170
I just found it by accident.

223
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,930
I think it's fun,

224
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,610
and it's a pity to throw it away.

225
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,000
I could have given it back to Nianchu, right?

226
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,410
I didn't expect

227
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,760
it to be buried in the dirt.

228
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,610
Genius...

229
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,490
I'll get it for you right away.

230
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,170
When I started running my theater,

231
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,880
I had no support.

232
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,560
But

233
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,290
I have a passion for art.

234
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,530
I have a dream.

235
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,490
So I told myself

236
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,760
that I will

237
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,760
revitalize modern drama.

238
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,640
Mr. Lu Xun's words always inspired me.

239
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,970
If there is no torch in the future,

240
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,930
I...

241
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,680
will be the only light.

242
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,680
If there is a torch and the sun comes out…

243
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
Thief.

244
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,440
Thief.

245
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,800
From heaven fallen an angle sister.

246
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,440
Like a…

247
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,930
Thief, thief.

248
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,410
Who is the thief?

249
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,200
I just borrowed it for fun.

250
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,200
Who taught you this?

251
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,090
Great.

252
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,610
Good job.

253
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,640
- Come on.
- Nice.

254
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Well done.

255
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,410
Thanks for watching our show today.

256
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,090
(Li Xiaoyan we always support you.)
Bravo.

257
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,320
- Li Xiaoyan.
- Good job, Li Xiaoyan.

258
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,000
Li Ke Chu Lian

259
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,880
came to a successful ending.

260
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,170
Thank you.

261
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,970
Thank you.

262
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,640
(Li Xiaoyan, we love you.)
Thank you.

263
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,320
Li Xiaoyan.

264
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,970
Nianchu, I love you.

265
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,850
Li Xiaoyan.

266
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,290
Mr. Li.

267
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,290
This one, right?

268
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,170
Thanks for inviting Ms. Li here.

269
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,760
I hope you can come to our theater frequently,

270
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,090
and support us in the future.

271
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,610
I will.

272
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:52,680
Li Xiaoyan.

273
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,130
You've done a wonderful job.

274
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,040
But

275
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,520
we don't have a second chance to work together.

276
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,090
I am happy to hear that.

277
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,280
May you be better

278
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,400
in the way of being an advertising actor.

279
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,850
You hit the spot.

280
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,560
Unlike those who have no commercials,

281
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,680
the advertisers

282
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,680
always beg me to work in commercials.

283
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,650
I'm afraid I don't have enough time.

284
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,250
You should tell Qiao about this yourself.

285
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,610
She is behind you.

286
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,250
This is Miss. Qiao.

287
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,890
She is the only heir of the Qiao's.

288
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,370
Nianchu,

289
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,850
you should have listened to me,

290
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,320
so that I could have my dad to replace
her with someone.

291
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,800
Oh honey,

292
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,920
business is business.

293
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
She's very dedicated on stage.

294
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,040
OK, as long as it's for the troupe's sake,

295
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,770
nothing matters, right?

296
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,520
The show went so well.

297
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,610
Let's have big meal to celebrate tonight.

298
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,090
Sure.

299
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,040
Congratulations on

300
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,090
good ending.

301
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,730
Nianchu, it occurred to me that something is
to be done,

302
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,920
so I have to leave.

303
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,730
Seriously? Are you really in a rush?

304
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,200
Didn't you want to take me to dine out?

305
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,730
I don't wanna be a third wheel.

306
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,970
I'd better go to my prince charming.

307
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,280
Go for it.

308
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,010
WeChat.

309
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,650
Thanks.

310
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,130
Let me take you somewhere.

311
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,890
What did Mr. Zhao ask you?

312
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,970
He thanked me

313
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,200
for inviting Li Xiaoyan for the show.

314
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Actually I feel grateful to her.

315
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,280
Though she broke her promise several times.

316
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,730
If it weren't her,

317
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,320
I wouldn't have met you.

318
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,850
Five years ago, I went to Tai City to
shoot my graduation project.

319
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,130
She gave me a hard time,

320
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,680
and ordered me to find props to the seaside.

321
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,040
Then

322
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,440
I met you.

323
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,610
Do you regret meeting me?

324
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,040
Never.

325
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,680
You got wet.

326
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:36,680
Never mind.

327
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,280
First,

328
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,370
to create a romantic atmosphere.

329
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,920
You can hold his arm casually,

330
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,010
or take his hand.

331
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,770
How do you know about this place?

332
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,440
Didn't you tell me?

333
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,200
You still remember the things...five years ago.

334
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,370
Is that snack vendor

335
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,320
you mentioned before?

336
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,730
What a good memory.

337
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,940
(Stinky tofu)

338
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,090
Keep it in your mind.

339
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,730
Good breath is the beginning for a kiss.

340
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,200
Enjoy yourself.

341
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,520
I...

342
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,280
I… I can't eat it today.

343
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,800
You can't eat it today.

344
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,090
Hi,

345
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,320
another one, non-spicy.

346
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,890
OK.

347
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,800
No.

348
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,320
You don't get it. I just can't today.

349
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,650
I can't eat it whether it's spicy or not.

350
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,250
Anyway, I just can't.

351
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:05,850
Let's leave here.

352
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,440
Let's go.

353
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,370
Isn't this the durian pie

354
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,490
you talked about before?

355
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,920
You can eat it even if you are in your period.

356
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,730
You want some?

357
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,320
I'll eat it with you if you want.

358
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,400
Hello,

359
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,560
two durian pies, please.

360
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,160
No durian.

361
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,700
(Specialty satay noodles)

362
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,160
Li,

363
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,650
are you sure you won't do anything for
Ruan Nianchu?

364
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,130
I was thinking that

365
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,730
you could date as you imagined.

366
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,970
I never thought that I'd picked the wrong day.

367
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,520
My bad.

368
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,090
No,

369
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,890
don't think that way.

370
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,610
It seems that

371
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,010
you are different today.

372
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,250
Really?

373
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,970
Make a physical contact inadvertently.

374
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,130
You…

375
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,130
Do you know some boxing

376
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,160
or defensive tactics?

377
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,610
Yes?

378
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,890
I want to learn.

379
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,010
I feel that

380
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,090
as a girl, I always rehearse until night

381
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,850
and go home alone.

382
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,730
It may help  if I learn some moves.

383
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,130
Are you afraid of going home?

384
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,920
No,

385
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,370
although you often come to pick me up.

386
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,610
- I think it's better to learn some.
- I'll teach you.

387
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:19,890
Listen,

388
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,850
I'm going out for a while,

389
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,680
call me if Xingixing wakes up.

390
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,130
Before I'm back,

391
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,160
use this to soothe her.

392
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,850
OK.

393
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,400
If she has a temperature again,

394
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,200
make sure you give her this.

395
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,400
OK, got it.

396
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,890
I've taken care of her so many times.

397
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:33,970
Don't worry.

398
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,850
You don't date that often.

399
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,040
Just enjoy your date.

400
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,160
What?

401
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,800
Who told you I was going on a date?

402
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,200
You sprayed your hair.

403
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,730
So?

404
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,090
OK...

405
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,130
Look,

406
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,970
I'm going to buy a crown for Xingxing.

407
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,920
Oh, buy a crown.

408
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,400
Hello,

409
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,280
excuse me,

410
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,160
the guests in room 109 yesterday

411
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,800
didn't come back, right?

412
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,610
OK, thank you.

413
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,320
Thanks.

414
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,280
You're welcome.

415
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,400
I can't drink so much even if
I'm waiting for someone.

416
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,200
Follow me.

417
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,370
Here.

418
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,320
This is where we usually practice.

419
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,770
Are you ready?

420
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,250
I…

421
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,490
I am not…

422
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,610
Are we beginning?

423
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,520
Watch and learn.

424
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,850
When it comes to this,

425
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,730
you have to calm down first.

426
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,850
Take a deep breath.

427
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,610
Two palms down.

428
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,650
Exert your force.

429
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,560
Force your midriff back.

430
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,200
If you move fast enough,

431
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,280
you can escape.

432
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,090
Have a try.

433
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,770
Hold me.

434
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,560
Just like I did to you.

435
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,010
I'll show you.

436
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,770
Although lips are the leading parts in a kiss,

437
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,800
hand position is also important.

438
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,160
Do not put your hands

439
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,730
beside your body.

440
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,440
Put your hands on his waist.

441
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,010
Where do you put your hands?

442
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,040
Did I just hold you like this?

443
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,370
Hold tightly.

444
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,920
So fast.

445
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,090
Come over, it's your turn.

446
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,770
Try again.

447
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,800
Do I learn…

448
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,770
Keep it in your mind.

449
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,610
Atmosphere, eyes, and posture

450
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,800
are all very important.

451
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,370
You have to

452
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,850
close your eyes naturally.
