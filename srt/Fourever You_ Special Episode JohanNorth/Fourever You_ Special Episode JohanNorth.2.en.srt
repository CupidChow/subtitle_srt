1
00:00:00,265 --> 00:00:02,828
I told you that I understand why you have to work hard.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,988
But please.

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:05,653
You have to take care yourself too.

4
00:00:05,687 --> 00:00:07,268
I just want to do it for you.

5
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:09,917
You have to promise that you will not overwork yourself.

6
00:00:09,992 --> 00:00:13,108
Also have a proper meal.
Then I won't stop mad at you.

7
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:14,595
I promise.

8
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,990
Nice. Nice.

9
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,320
Go in. Almost done.

10
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,990
This is the last fort.

11
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,900
Yeah. Like that.

12
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,790
Like that.

13
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,740
Done!

14
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,540
1 day before North's birthday.

15
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,740
What is he doing now?

16
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,380
Happy birthday, North.

17
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,110
Hello, P'Jo?

18
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,680
You just got off work?

19
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,030
Um...are you asleep?

20
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,020
Not yet.

21
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,030
Don't tell me you're waiting for me.

22
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,740
- Err--
- I told you to go straight to sleep.

23
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,920
Hey. I just want to talk to you.

24
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,210
Stubborn.

25
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,220
And...are you arrived at your room?

26
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,020
Not yet. I just left the office.

27
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,940
Woah. Just finished?

28
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,600
Um.

29
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,420
North.

30
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,170
Happy birthday.

31
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,150
Yes.

32
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,560
Thank you.

33
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,240
Am I the first one?

34
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,650
Actually....

35
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,740
there's Ter who called me earlier.

36
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,620
But he called before midnight.

37
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,050
So...that doesn't count.

38
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,450
But after midnight,

39
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,280
you're the first one, P'Jo.

40
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,980
Should I wish you something?

41
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,470
It's fine.

42
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,320
I bet you're not very good at wishing for people.

43
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,110
I'm sorry I couldn't be there with you today.

44
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,680
You're here now.

45
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,950
In a call like this?

46
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,140
Just hearing your voice...

47
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,750
I'm already happy with that.

48
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,910
P'Jo.

49
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,480
Hmm?

50
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,300
I miss you.

51
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,220
And don't drive so fast.

52
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,600
Even if it's already late at night and there're less cars,

53
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,110
but you still need to drive carefully.

54
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,850
Understood.

55
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,230
And can you talk on the phone while driving?

56
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,680
If I can't do it why would I call you?

57
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,000
And...how's your work today?

58
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,030
Well...

59
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,830
It was not good.

60
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,350
Are you okay?

61
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,170
Not really.

62
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,970
Do you mind telling me?

63
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,350
About what?

64
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,400
About your work today.

65
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,070
Oh it's nothing.

66
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,200
But I would love to hear it.

67
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,650
Please, P'Jo.

68
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,980
Please. Tell me.

69
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,170
Well...

70
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,110
there were some changes within the team.

71
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,710
And they didn't update each other.

72
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,670
So when there's a mistake,

73
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,380
they also didn't tell me.

74
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,590
But at the end,
sI'm the one who solves all the problems.

75
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,730
It's your birthday.

76
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,050
Why do you wanna hear about my work?

77
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,190
It's fine.

78
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,770
I would love to hear anything about you.

79
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,530
But everything is settled now, right?

80
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,140
Not yet.

81
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,320
Even I don't really know much about your work,

82
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,150
but I will always be by your side, P'Jo.

83
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,450
Let's hug to charge our battery.

84
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,660
Come on.

85
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,070
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you either.

86
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,880
That's fine.

87
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,630
Hearing your voice already makes me feel better.

88
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,700
Wow. You make me wanna squeeze through the phone and be with you there.

89
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,230
Clingy?

90
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,240
Yes, I wanna be clingy.
Clingy?

91
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,940
Yes, I wanna be clingy.

92
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,630
Can I see your clingy face?

93
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,110
Ugh. P'Jo.
You're such a cheator.

94
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,470
You're not gonna turn on your camera?

95
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,630
No.

96
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,630
Why not? Turn it on.
I wanna see your face.

97
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,970
Please.

98
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,230
Please turn it on.

99
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,910
Woah. You're wearing a suit?

100
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,160
Um. I had a meeting earlier this morning.

101
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,390
I actually have never seen you in a suit before.

102
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,120
It's to hot to wear it.

103
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,970
And you're still continue working?

104
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,110
Um...a little.

105
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,540
This reminds me of that time.

106
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,190
What are you talking about?

107
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,500
When we first talked.

108
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,550
When we called...

109
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,630
...and I just fell asleep
while I waited for you to work.

110
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,140
Oh.

111
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,910
And...

112
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,370
do I have to be quiet? Not to disturb you this time?

113
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,380
No need.

114
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,710
Hey then why did I have to do it back then?

115
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,490
Cause I was not used to your voice.

116
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,530
I can talk now then?

117
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,900
I'm not stopping you.

118
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,060
I have...

119
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,670
a question for you, P'Jo.

120
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,580
What is it?

121
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,080
When you met me for the first time...

122
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,430
can you tell me what it felt like for you?

123
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,370
The firs time we met?

124
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,830
At the bar?

125
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,430
Yes.

126
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,870
I'm so mad, of course.

127
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,700
I understand why.

128
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,990
- You didn't have to be so cruel to me though.
- But you deserved it, didn't you?

129
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,900
- I did.
- Um.

130
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,560
I could scold you with literally everything you did.

131
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,200
Got in a fight in a bar?

132
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,620
Working behind my back
and put yourself in danger?

133
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,670
You worried me everyday.

134
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,510
I shouldn't have asked
to get myself scolded at.

135
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,910
P'Jo.

136
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,760
My mom asked...

137
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,250
that you're not going to visit her during the break?

138
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,950
Oh sure...but...

139
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,090
when my work is done.

140
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,030
Okay. Just let me know when.

141
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,630
I will have everything prepared nicely.

142
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,840
Oh and how's your birthday?

143
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,560
Just like any other year. Nothing special.

144
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,060
I didn't have a party or anything.

145
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,270
But my mom bought me a gift.

146
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,460
What is it?

147
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,380
She got me a pair shoes.

148
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,820
And do you want anything else?
I haven't bought you anything.

149
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,150
Woah. You already gave me so many things.

150
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,620
Then...

151
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,970
can I ask you for something else?

152
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,930
What is it?

153
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,250
P'Jo...

154
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,710
can you tell me that you love me?

155
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,220
- That's it?
- Woah...it's not 'That's it'.

156
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,360
Please. Tell me that you love me.

157
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,090
I love you, North.

158
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,770
I love you too, P'Jo.

159
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,730
- If I was there, you're not gonna get away from me.
- Huh!? What do you mean?

160
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,190
Nothing. I just wanna tell you that please be less cute.

161
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,090
Go to sleep.

162
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,110
But I wanna talk to you.

163
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,800
Go to sleep. I will be here.

164
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,270
Okay.

165
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,180
I wanna be with you.

166
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,890
You're probably so tired recently.

167
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,670
You want me to leave work behind
and come see you?

168
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,520
No.

169
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,380
Then don't be so cute like this.

170
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,660
If not, then I might need to leave my work.

171
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,280
I'm sleepy now.

172
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,430
Go to sleep then. I will be here.

173
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,650
No. I will be the one who stays up.

174
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,790
You're still working.

175
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,630
- Go to sleep. I will be here with you.
- No, I can't.

176
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,890
I will be the one who stays up for you.

177
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,530
You're stubborn.

178
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,720
I got it from you.

179
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,710
You're really good at arguing lately.

180
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,890
Ter.

181
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,940
Enjoy your trip.

182
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,740
P'Hill.

183
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,460
Johan.

184
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,540
Hello?

185
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,570
You're still up?

186
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,670
Yes, why did you answer me so quickly?

187
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,690
You said you're sleepy.

188
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,610
I just wokee up.

189
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,340
Probably cause I miss you too much.

190
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,880
You're done working now?

191
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,150
- Yes.
- Really?

192
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,530
Why finished early?

193
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,550
You said you have so many things to do.

194
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,010
But it's done now.

195
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,570
You're so good.

196
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,170
You're the most talented person in the entire world.

197
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,890
Are you gonna go back to sleep?

198
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,580
Yeah I think I will.

199
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,110
Really?

200
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,450
Yes, I'm still on the bed. Didn't get up or anything.

201
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,710
If you're gonna go back to sleep,
and why the lights are still on?

202
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,210
How do you know?

203
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,540
Open your window.

204
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,570
A delivery for you sir.

205
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,710
Special delivery just for my boyfriend.

206
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,910
Sure. I'm coming down.

207
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,690
Be careful.

208
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,180
Happy birthday.

209
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,890
Thank you.

210
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,530
Thank you so much.

211
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,930
I thought you said 'it's fine.'

212
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,030
I really am. It's fine if you cannot be here.

213
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,310
But it's definitely better if you're here.

214
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,230
Better than from the phone?

215
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,820
Yes, so much better.

216
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,130
You're probably exhausted.

217
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,860
You worked so hard, and still come see me.

218
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,910
Exhaustion is all gone.

219
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,550
What's this?

220
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,300
It's--. Err...

221
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,170
It's...

222
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,780
It probably caught my hand when I packed my things.

223
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,580
I didn't mean to bring this with me when I packed.
I swear.

224
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,290
Really.

225
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,090
I remember it was in the closet, wasn't it?

226
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,150
Or I have bad memory?

227
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,930
Yes.

228
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,180
I took it with me.

229
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,270
Why?

230
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,170
Cause I cannot sleep.

231
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,130
Cannot sleep?

232
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,290
Cause I'm not used to this.

233
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,260
I normally go to bed hugging you everyday.

234
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,520
When you're not around, I couldn't sleep.

235
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,320
At least...

236
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,350
I still have your smell.

237
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,360
Please do not...

238
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,030
Do not tease me. I'm begging you.

239
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,250
Ok I won't.

240
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,380
Then...

241
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,450
you don't need this shirt anymore.

242
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,380
Stop it.

243
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,370
You need to rest.

244
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,610
Sweet dream.

245
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,470
Sweet dream, baby.

246
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,470
I love you so much.

247
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,290
Did you know that?

248
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,050
Where are you going?

249
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,950
I will go cook.

250
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,670
And prepare stuff for my birthday merit making.

251
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,920
Are you coming with me?

252
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,750
Sure.

253
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,870
Then...

254
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,050
you can continue your sleep.
I will go prep things.

255
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,200
Um.

256
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,230
North. I already prepared food for you and P'Jo.

257
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,630
Don't forget to go make some merits.
I have some errands to do today. Will be back later tonight.

258
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,610
Woah.

259
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,540
My mom...

260
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,770
sneaked out again?

261
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,920
P'Jo.

262
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,110
P'Johan.

263
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,040
Thank you.

264
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,780
P'Jo.

265
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,300
We'll go make birthday merits
and can I stop by to visit my dad a bit?

266
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,910
Of course.

267
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,280
I never asked you this...

268
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,080
...but are you a buddhist?

269
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,890
Can you go to the temple then?

270
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,750
I can. It's okay.

271
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,160
P'Jo.

272
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,390
This is my dad.

273
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,590
His name is Ko.

274
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,750
Dad.

275
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,660
This is P'Jo.

276
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,550
He's my precious boyfriend.

277
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,050
You might not look as hot as him...

278
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,840
but that's okay. You don't have to be jealous.

279
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,550
At least mom...

280
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,780
also doesn't think that you're hot.

281
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,360
Hello North's dad.

282
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,820
I'm here to visit you already.

283
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,590
I miss you so much.

284
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,700
You were close to him?

285
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,150
Yes, I was really close to him.

286
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:09,000
I still want him to be around until these days.

287
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,190
Cause it was fun when he was here with me.

288
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,260
Can you tell me more about him?

289
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,440
My dad?

290
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,770
He's the kind of father who hang his 3 years old underwear

291
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,230
to the ceiling fan.

292
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,190
And I just stood there, looking at it and cried
cause I didn't have anything to wear.

293
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,870
There's another one.
When he fell off his motorcycle,

294
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,990
instead of going to the hospital.

295
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,970
He rode the motorcycle back to me.

296
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,300
then smiled and showed me he lost 2 teeth.

297
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,120
When I saw blood all over his mouth,
I was shocked and started crying.

298
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,890
Then my mom hit him and I cried even more.

299
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,720
Something like that.

300
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,750
That's why I grew up and become like this.

301
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,270
Not surprising at all.

302
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,650
And...

303
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,110
what happened to him? Do you mind?

304
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,040
Not at all.

305
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,420
He...

306
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,290
passed due to an accident.

307
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,930
During that time,

308
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,580
my family was kinda lost too.

309
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,760
But my mom said...

310
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,570
don't feel bad for those who passed.

311
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,510
Feel bad for the one who lives.

312
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,940
So that's why we tried to be strong.

313
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,010
And...

314
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,240
tried not to be so sad.

315
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,550
Cause we believed that
dad also doesn't wanna see me and my mom sad too.

316
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,570
Both of you are so strong.

317
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,380
Yeah.

318
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,300
Shall we go?

319
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,190
Hey don't you wanna do something on your birthday?

320
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,250
Right.

321
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,630
I don't know where to go.

322
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,630
But...

323
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,570
I want you to rest more.

324
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,170
Cause you've been working very hard too.

325
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,000
Get very little sleep. Last night also.

326
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,950
Had to drive all the way here too.

327
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,060
So I will let you rest first.

328
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,220
Are you sure?

329
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,260
Yes, I am.

330
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,250
Well...

331
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,030
I will let you rest first.

332
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,400
And we can discuss later.

333
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,660
Sure.

334
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,220
Anything you said.

335
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,670
Yup. That's it.

336
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,850
Are you sure you can drive, P'Jo?

337
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:56,760
Yeah.

338
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,230
I already got some rest.

339
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,090
Woo!

340
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,000
What a nice weather.

341
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,040
Oh P'Johan.

342
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,950
Can you teach me how to drive?

343
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,780
Or take me to the driving school?

344
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,630
Why?

345
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:50,960
Well...

346
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,620
so I can drive for you sometimes
and you can rest.

347
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,020
Thank you so much P'Jo.

348
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,180
For bringing me here.

349
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,220
Even if I asked you last minute.

350
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,780
It's okay.

351
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,300
This is your day.

352
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,520
I'm so excited.

353
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,200
I haven't done camping before.

354
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,350
Have you?

355
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,530
Never.

356
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,940
Oh and..

357
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,000
are we gonna survive tonight?

358
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,500
If we do not survive,

359
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,970
we can find a hotel to stay.

360
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,030
Okay.

361
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,540
And why camping?

362
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,990
I just want you to try things that are not so comfortable.

363
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,520
I'm kidding.

364
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,940
I just wanna change scenery
and be with the nature. That's all.

365
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,060
And I just thought camping

366
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,710
sounds really nice.

367
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:50,770
What about resort and well-prepared camping? Like glamping?

368
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,000
We can't do that.

369
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,940
If we wanna do camping, we have to try putting up a tent
and start a fire ourselves.

370
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,940
Let's just give it a try first.

371
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,990
If it doesn't work for us,
we don't have to do it again.

372
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,480
Adventurous things like this remind me of P'Arthit.

373
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,060
Why do you suddenly think of him?

374
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,740
The thought just came to my mind.
The person who likes adventurous things.

375
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,460
- You like that kind of person?
- Huh!?

376
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:24,210
Cause I don't know how to put up a tent?
That's all?

377
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,090
Are you seriously jealous of me and P'Arthit?

378
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:32,000
You're close to him too latele.
He asked you to grill steak and made a sauce, you also did it for him.

379
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,660
I charged him THB500 for doing that.

380
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,750
What's so good about him?
Why did you do all those for him?

381
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,400
Oh...nothing.

382
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,170
You're the best, P'Jo.

383
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,320
I love you the most.

384
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,880
P'Arthit is just...

385
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,870
another dog to me.

386
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,600
You're being so cute.

387
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,980
You're jealous.

388
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,190
This way, P'Johan.

389
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,620
Here. Take a seat.

390
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,560
Please sit.

391
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,340
You must be exhausted from driving.

392
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,930
- I will take care of the rest.
- Are you sure you don't need my help?

393
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,440
Yeah. Sit first.

394
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,960
Please.

395
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,230
Trust me. I will handle it.

396
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,960
You drove so far. Trust me.

397
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,550
You've never done this before, haven't you?

398
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,080
I can just look at the manual.ß

399
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,300
Fine. Fine.
I will rest here for a bit.

400
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,750
Thought you know how to do it?

401
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,290
I was kidding.

402
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,740
Here. Poke here.
Everyone knows.

403
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:06,830
Right?

404
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,470
I need to loosen the soil first.

405
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,290
Poke through here, right?

406
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,550
Just kidding.

407
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,540
I know.
This one goes through here, right?

408
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,070
The weather is getting chilly.

409
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,020
P'Jo, do you agree that cold weather...

410
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,390
and...

411
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,620
snuggling in a blanket

412
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,370
and watch a movie like this...

413
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,140
is really heart warming, you know?

414
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,330
Do you wanna watch this one?
Reviews are really good.

415
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,070
Really?

416
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,910
Um sure.

417
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,650
Okay. I will put it on.

418
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,200
"Go!"

419
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,740
"I will handle it from here."

420
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,600
"Then..."

421
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,530
"pelase take care of my friend."

422
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,190
- "Please take care of my friend."
- He's very chill.

423
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,290
P'Jo.

424
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,470
Hmm?

425
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,850
"Hia."

426
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,830
Thank you so much, P'Jo...

427
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,070
...for coming into my life.

428
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,670
Why suddenly you wanna thank me?

429
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,270
Well...

430
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,280
I'm just so happy.

431
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,570
When I have you with me,

432
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,810
it makes my birthday even more special.

433
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,510
Thank you so much. Really.

434
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,400
Actually--

435
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,230
I...

436
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,030
...don't have anything.

437
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,840
And I'm still the same North.

438
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,550
But everything becomes special because...

439
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,290
you're here with me.

440
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,020
You always pay attention to me.

441
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,480
And that makes me realize that...

442
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,070
you really love me.

443
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,400
and you will never leave me.

444
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,030
Did you know?

445
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,710
That you make me feel like
the most special person in the world.

446
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,940
So...

447
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,070
can you be with me for the rest of your life?

448
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,670
Whether it's this life,

449
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,840
next life or any life...

450
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,770
I will follow to see you in every life.

451
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:40,460
Am I too selfish?

452
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,150
You can be selfish as much as you want.

453
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,700
Cause I am too.

454
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,710
I don't want you to meet anyone else.

455
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,050
Thank you too for taking such good care of me.

456
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,150
And like you said...

457
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,000
we will be together in every life.

458
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,230
No matter in hell or in heaven.

459
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,390
I will follow you down.

460
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,340
I love you, North.

461
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,850
I love you too, P'Jo.

462
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,250
North.

463
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,040
North.

464
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,960
Why are you up so early?

465
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,880
Well...

466
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,130
Since we're up here,
we need to see the sunrise.

467
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,190
That's right.

468
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,050
Fine. I'm up.

469
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,970
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

470
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,690
Watch out.

471
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,850
Wow. Such a nice weather.

472
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,900
Wow.

473
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,860
It's really beautiful, P'Jo.

474
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,550
Thank you...

475
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,630
for waking me up to see the sunrise.

476
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,460
Wow~

477
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,870
Really nice weather too.

478
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,470
North.

479
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,330
Yes?

480
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,230
This might seem to be too early...

481
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,240
but for me it feels so long already...

482
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,620
since the first day the I fell in love with you...

483
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,610
and waiting for you for many years.

484
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,300
I used to be such a disappointment.

485
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,290
Unreliable.

486
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,750
Unlike you.

487
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,430
I'm trying to be a better person,

488
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:59,070
so I can be someone you can rely on.

489
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,430
You are every reason...

490
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,750
that I don't need anything else.

491
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,790
Will you marry me?

492
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,020
Yes.

493
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,610
I will marry you.

494
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,830
Why are you such a crybaby?

495
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,640
It's because of you.

496
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,420
You know why.

497
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,250
If you're the one who asked, I only have one answer.

498
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,710
This is to engage you.

499
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,480
After graduation,

500
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,700
let's get married.

501
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,600
Sure, P'Jo.

502
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,940
I will hurry and graduate for you.

503
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,660
Let's get married.

504
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,420
That's very cute.

505
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,430
When are you getting married?

506
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,860
Not anytime soon.

507
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,390
We just wanna take pictures.

508
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,640
Congratulations in advance.

509
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,730
Thank you.

510
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,160
All done.

511
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,590
You're so handsome.

512
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,560
And whose husband-to-be though?

513
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,670
Mine.

514
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,130
Are you...

515
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,400
feeling hot?

516
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,340
A bit. But I'm still okay.

517
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,650
What about you? Are you hot?

518
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,630
I'm fine.

519
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,500
We will take separately first.

520
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,030
Who wanna go first?

521
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,390
I will go first.

522
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,700
This way please.

523
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,080
See. I think it was a great idea to take pictures first.

524
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,820
Look. They are so cute.

525
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,350
Do you wanna do it again?

526
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,400
I'm down with whatever.

527
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,890
And since we're here, don't you wanna go somewhere?

528
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,640
It's Christmas in LA.

529
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,330
There're probably a lot of people everywhere.

530
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,380
Shall we...

531
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,000
stay at home to celebrate?

532
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,950
Or...

533
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,630
do you wanna go out somewhere?

534
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,840
No, I'm up to you.

535
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:13,790
If it's up to me,
then can we stay in?

536
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,680
It's cold outside too.
Look. It's snowing.

537
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,120
It's too cold.

538
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,460
You're really acting.

539
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,530
Just a little.

540
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:30,690
Look. I was so rigid.

541
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:34,070
So embarrassing.
I never did things like that before.

542
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:38,320
Oh. I will check it for you.

543
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,550
It might be the delivery guy.

544
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,130
P'Jo.

545
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,770
They're delivering the Christmas tree.

546
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,600
Can you help me carry it?

547
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,830
You're really into Christmas huh?
Even bought a Christmas tree.

548
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,560
But I already ask for your permission.

549
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,780
I didn't say anything.

550
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,970
But isn't this too much work?

551
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,470
I think we should go out.

552
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,350
Or hire someone to do this for you.

553
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,260
No. I wanna do it myself.

554
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,030
Then let me help.

555
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,060
What do we have to do next?

556
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,050
Decorate the tree.

557
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,890
I have so many ornaments.

558
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,100
I bought so many.

559
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,100
Do you think my new earrings are pretty?

560
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,580
So dang cute.

561
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,390
You really complimented me.

562
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:09,600
I will put it here.

563
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:13,510
Where do you think I should put this?

564
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:18,030
It should be here,
cause we already have something big there.

565
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,300
Here?

566
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,790
No.

567
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,260
- Not so pretty.
- Too low?

568
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,790
- Here then.
- Here.

569
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,690
Where are you taking me?

570
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,770
I have a present for you.

571
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,140
What present?

572
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:58,870
Is it a new game?

573
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,110
But there's nothing coming out though.

574
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,440
Hey. Or is it gold?

575
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,050
I really love gold, P'Jo.

576
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,700
No, it's not.

577
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,040
- Hey.
- I'm about to open your eyes.

578
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,820
The claw machine?

579
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,290
Um.

580
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,850
Cause someone said 'he wants a gift'
when we were boyfriends.

581
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:32,520
So I got him a claw machine.

582
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:34,020
Cute, right?

583
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:38,500
I totally thought it was gold I'm getting.

584
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,530
P'Jo. I'm kidding.

585
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,500
This is cute.

586
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,730
But why...

587
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,540
there's only one turtle in there?

588
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,950
They probably forgot to take it out.
Let me complain them.

589
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,210
Hey. That's okay.

590
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,900
I think it's cute.

591
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,660
I will try to catch it tonight.

592
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,960
I'm gonna go for it.

593
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,120
Here we go.

594
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,710
Hey.

595
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,330
Hey. P'Jo.

596
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,830
I got it.

597
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:23,860
With your first attempt?

598
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,070
Hey.

599
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,350
P'Jo. It's so cute.

600
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,160
It even looks uglier than that one.

601
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,150
Hey.

602
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,260
How come?

603
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:35,820
He's such a cutie.

604
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,800
Come on, P'Jo.
You promised me that you're gonna do it.

605
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,310
Come on.

606
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,350
Let me tie it for you.

607
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,240
That'a not it.

608
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,990
You still need this.

609
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,910
Cute!

610
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:19,480
Why are you smiling?

611
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,890
Hey cause...

612
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:23,940
you're wearing an apron and looks so cute.

613
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,180
Let me see.

614
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:27,870
Let me see what you're filming.

615
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,450
Do not delete it.

616
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,590
You're pretty good at filming too.

617
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,040
Thank you.

618
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,210
Shall we start?

619
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,770
- Here.
- And...

620
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:45,050
where do I begin?

621
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,300
You mix the eggs first.

622
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,070
Crack the eggs and mix it all up.

623
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,850
Cookies are not that expensive, aren't they?

624
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,510
What did you just say?

625
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,090
Oh nothing.

626
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,100
- Mix the eggs right? Crack it first?
- Yes. Yes.

627
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,270
P'Jo. You should do it here.

628
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,390
The shell is in the bowl now.

629
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,990
P'Jo. You need to mix it like this.

630
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:17,500
Look how I do it. 1 2 3.
Swirl it like this.

631
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:21,150
Again.

632
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,300
Do it.

633
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,830
You're teasing me again.

634
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,880
Guys look. This guy is teasing me.

635
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,030
I'm not.

636
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:41,250
It was really yummy,
the cookies that made by you.

637
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,840
I didn't do anything.

638
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:44,630
I just mix everything together.

639
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,300
Really? It's really good.

640
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,650
Um.

641
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,400
Just a blink of an eye,

642
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,510
we've been together for a year already.

643
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:54,920
Let's do a quick recap...

644
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,730
of what...

645
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:57,060
we went through this year.

646
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:59,360
What about you?

647
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:00,700
How was yours?

648
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,150
You came to my life this year,
it's been the best year so far.

649
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,600
What about you?

650
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,920
Me too.

651
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:12,530
It was one hell of a year.

652
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,170
So many things happened.

653
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,230
Since...

654
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,350
the moment I woke up...

655
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,990
...and had a debt.

656
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,390
But at the end,

657
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:22,310
...plot twist.
My creditor has become my boyfriend.

658
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,180
Haaaa.

659
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,350
I have a question to ask you today as well.

660
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,520
What?

661
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,670
If you could wish for 3 things,

662
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,080
what would your wishes be?

663
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,090
3 wishes, right?

664
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,180
I'll give all the wishes to you.

665
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,860
Then I'll have 6 wishes?

666
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:42,780
Um.

667
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,250
What should I wish for?

668
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:51,250
I will ask my favorite game company

669
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,280
to produce a lot of new games.

670
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,200
And...

671
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,730
I'd wish for myself to have more money to buy their games.

672
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:59,210
I would wish to have time to play those games.

673
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:03,920
And I wish for myself, you, mom,

674
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,380
and eveyone around us to be so happy.

675
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:11,140
And lastly...

676
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,300
I'd wish for myself to win a lottery.

677
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:14,950
Even at least the last 3 digits.

678
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,170
You really wanna win a lottery that bad?

679
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,810
- Do you want the 2st prize? I will transfer for you.
- Wow.

680
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,470
You don't get me.

681
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:23,700
What I'm wishing for...

682
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,530
...is to make money for our household.

683
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,660
But if you give it to me,

684
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,740
the money is the same amount.

685
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,070
Yeah. I don't get it.

686
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,480
And anything else you would like to ask me?

687
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,510
I wanna ask you...

688
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:43,300
whether you have anything
that you wish I could change?

689
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:46,640
Or anything that you don't like about me?

690
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,050
Nothing. You?

691
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,640
For me?

692
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,660
If I'd have to change...

693
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:56,100
I would like to be more discrete.

694
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,090
Cause I think I'm too funny and immature.

695
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:04,240
I meant anything that you would like me to change?

696
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,670
See. I'm being funny again.

697
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,710
For you?

698
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,320
I think...

699
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:15,200
you don't need to change anything.

700
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,210
Cause you're already perfect.

701
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,080
Last question.

702
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:25,660
Do you have any questions that you wouldn't dare to ask me?

703
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,790
Every time I look at you,

704
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,430
I always have one question in mind.

705
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:34,530
What is it?

706
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,590
Who is this kid?

707
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,090
Where is he from?

708
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,060
How can he make me so in love with him?

709
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,760
Me too.

710
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,270
I also have a question.

711
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,390
Like who is this guy?

712
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,130
Who send him to me to make me happy in everyday?

713
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:03,360
Please be with me like this every year, okay?

714
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,690
Christmas and start a new year together.

715
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:07,930
Be together forever.

716
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,200
Sure.

717
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:13,890
I will be with you forever.

718
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:39,070
Whch one do you like better?

719
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,420
i like them both equally.

720
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,060
And you gave both of them to me.

721
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:46,720
And...

722
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,690
why don't you like this stupid ducky?

723
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,390
It is even the first gift you gave me.

724
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,230
Even though we didn't know each other
when we first met.

725
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,630
Because it was the first gift,

726
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:03,110
and I wanted to buy something nicer for you.

727
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:04,570
And...

728
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:06,810
what's wrong with this stupid ducky?

729
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,420
Look at his face.

730
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,700
Even you call him stupid ducky.

731
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,990
He looks stupid but he's still cute though.

732
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:16,980
Only his own mother would say he's cute.

733
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:20,300
Poor thing. Let me see.

734
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:22,340
What?
Your daddy doesn't love you?

735
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,860
What!?

736
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,880
Cause daddy can only love mommy.

737
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,960
P'Jo.
