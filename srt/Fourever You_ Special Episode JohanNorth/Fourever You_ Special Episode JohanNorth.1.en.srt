1
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,250
North.

2
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,630
I gotta go to the class.

3
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,160
You don't have any class today, right?

4
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,900
No, I don't.

5
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,170
Drive safe, P'Johan.

6
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,400
I'm going to class now.

7
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,100
Hey.

8
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,900
He had only coffee again?
Didn't eat any food.

9
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,410
Why didn't you eat something?
Only coffee again?

10
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,310
So stubborn.

11
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,550
We're have spaghetti for dinner.

12
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,300
North. I'm sorry. I have an urgent work.
Gotta go.

13
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,480
Don't wait up for me.

14
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,520
North.

15
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,480
I told you not to wait up.

16
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,030
I couldn't sleep when you're not around.

17
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,310
- Go where?
- To the bed.

18
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,120
This one has veggies.

19
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,320
I have to go to class.

20
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,370
What?

21
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,560
Wait. You said you have a class at 10?

22
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,480
You're not gonna eat first?

23
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,140
I remembered the wrong time.
And Hill called to wake me up.

24
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,190
I don't think I have time.

25
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,610
Sorry.

26
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,640
Hey. Is this mine?

27
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,810
Yes.

28
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,350
What about my food?

29
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,960
North.

30
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,460
North.

31
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,080
North.

32
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,300
You want me to carry you?

33
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,780
It's okay.

34
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,230
P'Jo.

35
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,420
Why are you still working?

36
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,350
You should go to bed already.

37
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,070
It's only a bit left.

38
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,400
Why are you out of bed?

39
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,210
I told you to go to sleep, didn't I?

40
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,110
I also told you before.

41
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,250
I cannot sleep when you're not around.

42
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,440
And why are you working so much?

43
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,850
As if you're in debt.

44
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,540
Are we in debt?

45
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,040
What if I said yes?

46
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,010
How much?

47
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,350
Umm...

48
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,800
Probably a billion.

49
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,380
A billion!?
Kidney is worth 4 million each.

50
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,790
If I sold 2 of mine, we'll have 8 million.
But it would not be enough still.

51
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,980
What did you do?
Why are we in such debt?

52
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,420
I don't think we should pay.

53
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,330
We should just flee the country.

54
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,110
Umm...

55
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,200
But are you gonna help me?

56
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,240
How am I going to help you?

57
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,090
Even if I sold my lungs too, still not enough.

58
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,180
Let's resign.

59
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,090
So you don't have to work
and I don't have to study.

60
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:19,630
But I will probably still need to work,
so I can take care of you.

61
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,240
Even I might get paid very little.

62
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,940
Cannot afford to eat..

63
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,300
...but we would still have each other.

64
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,780
Would you like to starve with me?

65
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,660
I'm not a high maintenance person.

66
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,510
Not picky about food either.

67
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,500
Very chill. Nothing serious.

68
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,400
What's the living condition gonna be like?

69
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,360
We'll probably need to sell your car.

70
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,580
Also your house and your condominium as well.

71
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,040
Then we will leave.

72
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,070
We might need to rent a small apartment.

73
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,140
I need a leader for the family.
Hand-to-mouth lifestyle.

74
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,420
Why?
You're in debt. You need to pay it off.

75
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,760
And what's gonna be your job?
What's the salary?

76
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,840
Just a normal job. THB15,000 salary.

77
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,330
15,000?

78
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,760
That's half day expense for me only.

79
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,450
Woah.
You need to live more frugally.

80
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,650
I don't like that word 'frugal'.

81
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,940
But I like it.

82
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,270
Like the word 'frugal'?
No. I like you. Haa!

83
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,760
I love you too.

84
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,950
I'm feeling sleepy already, P'Jo.

85
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,290
Shall we go to bed?

86
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,090
Let's go to bed.

87
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,520
Like really sleep.

88
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,970
Not like you trick me to go to sleep,
then you sneak out to work again.

89
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,670
I will really go to bed with you.

90
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,440
Let's go to bed.

91
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,310
Yeah.

92
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,800
Let's got to sleep.

93
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,780
- Haa!
- Again?

94
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,970
I will be home late today.

95
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,280
North.

96
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,410
What's the matter?

97
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,210
North.

98
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,110
North.

99
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,980
Eat.

100
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,860
I already heated up for you.

101
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,560
Why are you mad at me?

102
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,590
North. North. North.

103
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,540
Baby.

104
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,190
Baby.

105
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,610
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

106
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,500
North.

107
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,480
Babe.

108
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,940
You're that mad at me?

109
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,890
I will let you hit me.

110
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,770
- Hit me.
- No.

111
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,720
No, I won't.

112
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,920
You only care about work lately.
You don't take care of yourself.

113
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,720
You don't eat proper food.
Only drink coffee.

114
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,420
And you never rest.

115
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,770
I asked you to come to bed with me,
but you sneaked out to continue your work.

116
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,320
If I did all those things too,
wouldn't you be worried too?

117
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,870
I would.

118
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,910
Cause I care about you

119
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,800
that's why I work really hard,
so you don't have to work so hard.

120
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,430
And you're not going to think about how I feel?

121
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,660
I woke up early to cook your favorite food.

122
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,320
I wait up for you and you just never come home.

123
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,550
And when you do, you always work.

124
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,750
But..

125
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,570
I told you before...I understand that you need to work hard.

126
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,530
But please...

127
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,070
you need to take care of yourself too.

128
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,960
But I do all these for us.

129
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,620
I'm sorry.

130
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,540
I was wrong.

131
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,270
I will improve myself.

132
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,320
But can you please stop being mad at me?

133
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,130
Please stop being mad at me.

134
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,180
No.

135
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,740
If I stop being mad easily, you'll never remember.

136
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,310
I'm serious this time.

137
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,310
- I'm really mad at you.
- North.

138
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,150
Don't do this.

139
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,050
What do I have to do,
so you'll stop being mad at me?

140
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,460
Hmm?

141
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,000
I will stop eventually.

142
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,070
You should take a shower first.

143
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,090
Okay.

144
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,580
P'Jo.

145
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,340
I'm still mad at you.

146
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,670
Then how am I supposed to sleep?

147
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,360
When you work, I also have to sleep by myself.

148
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,170
I told you before.
I cannot sleep without you by my side.

149
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,920
Even I told you that,
you still don't come to bed with me.

150
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,640
P'Jo.

151
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,660
If you are not gonna stop,
I'll go sleep on the couch.

152
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,620
Go in. Yeah.

153
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,240
You're mad at me still?

154
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,100
Food is on the table.
If you don't wanna eat, you can toss it.

155
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,260
North.

156
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,380
Why do you have to be sarcastic?

157
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,230
Can't we just talk nicely?

158
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,760
I'm sorry.

159
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,010
I didn't mean to be so mean.

160
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,400
I won't be sarcastic then.

161
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,700
But if you're not gonna eat,
it's fine.

162
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,180
North.

163
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,670
When will you stop being mad at me?

164
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,980
I couldn't sleep last night.

165
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,260
You're not
gonna let your guard down a little?

166
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,870
Why are you so cruel?

167
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,500
I have to be firm with myself too.

168
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,660
Cause if I don't,

169
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,900
you will never remember.

170
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,700
I do now.

171
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,560
North. I won't be like that anymore.

172
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,290
Forgive me please.

173
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,640
Please.

174
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,180
I will do anything. Really.

175
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,860
Please.

176
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,530
Not yet.

177
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,320
Can I have a hug before I go to work?

178
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,310
Oh.

179
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,320
Woah. That's a lot.

180
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,130
Go. Go. Go.

181
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,900
Come on. Come.

182
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,530
Hey.

183
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,530
I have to go.
Stop being mad at me already.

184
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,960
Yeah.

185
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,090
You will be late.

186
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,170
I'm going to work.

187
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,580
I will be back as soon as possible.
Call me if you need anything.

188
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,000
Sure.

189
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,110
Dad.

190
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,590
When Jeen is mad at you,
what do you do?

191
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,190
Take her shopping.

192
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,080
What if he doesn't want to go?

193
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,970
Then find another excuse to go.
When he got something, he'll be in a better mood.

194
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,520
What if he doesn't want anything?

195
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:34,270
Just buy him everything he looks at.
Bring him there, grab the stuff and put it in his hand.

196
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,990
Are you sure this is gonna work?

197
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:40,350
Yeah, I've been doing this for the past 20 years.
Works every time.

198
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,250
North.

199
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,240
Talk to me first. This is urgent.

200
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,350
What urgent?

201
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,300
Jeen asked me to do an errand for her.

202
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,710
Come with me.

203
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,490
- What errand?
- You should go change first. Come on.

204
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,830
P'Jo.

205
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,610
What kind of errands at the mall?

206
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,670
Hello.

207
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,440
Err...can I see the shirt from the front?

208
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,550
- Which size?
- Medium.

209
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,780
Let's do both medium and large.

210
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,540
You want new clothes?

211
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,610
Large is better. Looks more comfortable.

212
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,650
I will take Large.

213
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,630
This one too.

214
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,370
This one.

215
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,940
And this one.

216
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,360
Please, this way.

217
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,910
P'Jo. You need to chill.

218
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,050
You want the bag from the front
or some other ones?

219
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,210
Err....I just--

220
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,890
If you are not gonna choose,
I'll choose it for you.

221
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,700
Fine. This one.

222
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,530
This one?

223
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,010
Isn't it a bit too cheap?

224
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,130
It's fine.

225
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,830
One is enough.

226
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,180
We might not be able to carry all of it home.

227
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,680
They do have delivery.

228
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,860
Would you like anything else?

229
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,990
It's fine.

230
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,670
Why are you doing this?

231
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,930
Are you pressuring me to stop being mad at you?

232
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,010
No, it's not like that.

233
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:51,040
I remember when Jeen is mad at my dad,
he'll buy her everything that she looks at and things will get better.

234
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,520
So...I thought I could try this
and you might stop being mad at me.

235
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,640
And when you said you had to do an errand today--

236
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,490
P'Jo.

237
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,900
This is not working.

238
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,890
That's okay. I can keep buying.

239
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,750
I will take all of them. One each.

240
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,010
You can do home delivery, right?

241
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,500
- Please wait a moment.
- Sure.

242
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,050
Now, you'll have multiple bags
for your class everyday.

243
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,590
I don't wanna switch everyday.

244
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:30,500
Could you please come to the cashier?

245
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,420
All set.

246
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,290
Products'll be delivered to you
within 3 working days.

247
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,420
Thank you so much.

248
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,210
I will buy everything that you look at today.

249
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,830
As a way of saying sorry. Okay?

250
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,480
P'Jo.

251
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,830
I think what you're doing is too much.

252
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,960
All these are so expensive.

253
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,490
This is not the right thing to do.

254
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,500
Even though I'm mad at you,

255
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,420
but I don't want you
to ask for forgiveness like this.

256
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,920
And how would you like me to do it?

257
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,700
I begged already.

258
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,760
Even talked nice and soft.
You're still not letting your guard down.

259
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,440
And...

260
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,670
this is the only way I can think of.

261
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,600
You looked at the shoes?
You want some shoes?

262
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,160
No. No. P'Jo.
When did I say I want it?

263
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,970
P'Jo.

264
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,820
- I will help you carry.
- It's fine. Let me carry it.

265
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,650
You need to stop buying.

266
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,690
Now, I have plenty of shoes.

267
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,290
I didn't look at anything either.

268
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,780
Anything else you want?

269
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,430
I didn't want anything in the first place.

270
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,150
So does this mean...you're no longer mad at me?

271
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,610
I'm even more mad now.

272
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,960
Hey. My dad told me he uses this trick with Jeen for 20 years.

273
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,100
It always works.

274
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,810
But it does not work with me.

275
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,310
Or I need to buy more?

276
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,090
P'Jo.

277
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,230
Let's do this way.

278
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,890
If you can catch one of these dolls for me,

279
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,230
I will stop being mad at you.

280
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,520
If I caught it,

281
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,050
you will completely stop?

282
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,320
Yes.

283
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,030
You will talk to me like usual?

284
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,620
Yes.

285
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,390
But...

286
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,350
You need to promise me
that you're not gonna over-working again.

287
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,180
And you need to eat proper food too.
Not just coffee.

288
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,830
If not,
I won't forgive you ever again.

289
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,700
I promise.

290
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,150
I will catch a doll for you.

291
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,710
P'Jo.

292
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,400
This duck looks exactly
like the one in our room.

293
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,280
Oh...do you want some other ones then?
You already have this one.

294
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,130
It's fine.
I can have another one.

295
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,470
One more thing, that ducky...

296
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:50,170
you gave it to me as a gift
since when did you know each other.

297
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,950
This one you can give it to me as gift from a boyfriend.

298
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,910
It's totally okay,
if you cannot catch it.

299
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,340
I'll catch this one for you.

300
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,780
Almost get it, P'Jo.

301
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,550
It's okay if you cannot.

302
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,880
I'm actually not that mad at you.

303
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,110
I just wanted to act cool and all.

304
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,030
I'm worried and care about you, P'Jo.

305
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,190
I really want you to take care of yourself.

306
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,950
But now I'm okay.

307
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,610
North. I almost got it.
Wait a min.

308
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:00,770
I think it's okay for people
to have things that they can't do.

309
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,510
Nobody's perfect with everything.

310
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,120
I'm perfect with everything.

311
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,040
P'Jo.

312
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,540
I really appreciate it.

313
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,140
Really...you're doing all these for me.

314
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:17,830
I know that you love me the most.

315
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,090
Nobody loves me like you do.

316
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,950
So....

317
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,820
...i'm hungry now.

318
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,000
P'Jo...shall we go eat something?

319
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,930
I can do anything for you.
I love you the most.

320
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,990
But you just need to wait a bit more.

321
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,230
Let's go, P'Jo.
I'm hungry.

322
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,030
North. Just a moment.

323
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,250
I almost got it.

324
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,600
- Let's go.
- North. North. North..

325
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,620
How much does this machine cost?
North.

326
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,670
North. Can I try again?

327
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,020
Stop it, P'Joham. Eat first.

328
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,550
Eat first.

329
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,890
You know that I don't really use all these stuff.
But...

330
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,710
thank you anyway. I will try to use all of them.

331
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,860
I know that you're not gonna use it,
but I want you to have it.

332
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,740
Thank you.

333
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,850
Oh there's another thing I want to buy for you.

334
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,720
And you need to take it.

335
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,770
But I don't want anything anymore.

336
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,070
My computer still working just fine.

337
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,150
Oh I heard you complained that it's over heating and it's lagging.

338
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,860
Just a little sometimes.

339
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,550
You're not gonna have a look?

340
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,430
New edition of Neon Horizon will be coming out soon.

341
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,000
What about Marvel Rival?

342
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,280
Naraka...we're talking about.

343
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,970
- Fine. We won't have a look.
- Fine. We can have a look just for a min.

344
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,420
Just a little bit.

345
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,640
Go check it out.

346
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,270
P'.

347
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,860
Do you have 5090 GPU available?

348
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,720
We do, but the price has gone up quite high.

349
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,780
How much is it?

350
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,230
THB140,000.
What are you currently using?

351
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,020
I'm using...

352
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,550
2060.

353
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,840
P'Jo.

354
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,330
Er...I just talked to the guy.

355
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,920
The price has increased so much,

356
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,350
If we're talking about the latest one.

357
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,250
It's THB140,000.

358
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,430
but if we're looking at one step down,

359
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,690
it's around THB70,000.

360
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,660
Which one do you want?

361
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,600
To be frank,
I kinda want the newest one of course.

362
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,490
But I can't afford with that price.

363
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,340
It's too high.

364
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,110
It's probably because there are so much demand
and they have little stock.

365
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,120
Price might go down in awhile.

366
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,830
It's fine.
Thing is...do you want it?

367
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,460
Err...

368
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,430
I think it's too expensive.

369
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,290
If I upgrad my GPU,
I'll need to upgrade my CPU too.

370
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,370
If I upgraded my CPU,
I'll need to upgrade my mainboard.

371
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:21,830
So with the upgraded mainboard, they'll draw a lot more power.
Then I need a new power supply.

372
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,820
So with all that,
there's only the case that I can keep.

373
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,060
Then we will change all of that.

374
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,090
Ughh. I can't.

375
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,490
Replace all of those, I cannot.

376
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,450
But my computer still working okay. Might be lagged a little.

377
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,520
Or maybe not so little.

378
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,770
It's quite lagging.

379
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,090
But I can bear with it.

380
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:49,430
But If you play open world games, and the graphic is not nice. It's lagging.

381
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,430
It's not gonna be fun, isn't it?

382
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,840
That's true.

383
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,110
But I think it's too expensive.
Really.

384
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,270
Do they have everything you just mentioned?

385
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,240
From what I talked to him, they do.

386
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,270
- Yeah I will take all those.
- Sure.

387
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,310
I already informed him.

388
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,540
If you'd like to upgrade anything,
I can recommend you.

389
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,300
What are you currently using?

390
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,810
I'm using 20.

391
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,330
Power supply too.

392
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,390
P'Jo.

393
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,630
All in all, it will be THB200,000.

394
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,440
Let's do it.

395
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,400
I think it's too expensive.

396
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,110
No, it's not.
Only THB200,000.

397
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,040
You have always wanted a good computer, right?

398
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,870
You also plays game everyday.

399
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,880
But I still think the price is too high.

400
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,410
It's true that I have always wanted a nice computer.

401
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,070
But it's too expensive.

402
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,450
Just take it as a gift from me.

403
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,040
Can you please accept it?

404
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,950
Or...you don't want it?

405
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,640
I do.

406
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,220
I have always wanted it.

407
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,440
Then shall I transfer to pay now?

408
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,780
Sure. You may transfer 50% deposit first.

409
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,330
Another 50%, you can pay when you come pick it up.

410
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,020
Then I will transfer now.

411
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,940
Here's the QR code.

412
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,850
Thank you very much.

413
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,270
Here's your receipt.
Use this on the day you come pick it up.

414
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,030
Thank you.

415
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,700
Let's go.

416
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,560
New computer. New computer.

417
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,700
Yayy. New computer.

418
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,940
I got a new computer, P'Jo!

419
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,510
- You're in such a good mood.
- Hey. Of course.

420
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:05,000
I got a brand new computer.
Thank you, P'Jo.

421
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,010
I love you so much.

422
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,710
Go.

423
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,100
That's it.

424
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,640
North's life.

425
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,040
Born to play games, love P'Jo, and just die.

426
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,100
New computer.

427
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,410
I didn't kiss you for the whole day.

428
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,520
I almost couldn't survive.

429
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,770
Me too.

430
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,140
No more being mad, yeah?

431
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,800
But you need to behave like a good boy too, understand?

432
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,190
Understood.

433
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,460
Heyyy. New computer.

434
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,170
Hmm the spec.

435
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,530
What are you doing, P'Jo?

436
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,920
I better go shower.

437
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,470
Can I join?

438
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,740
- No.
- Yes. I will join.

439
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,100
No.

440
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,740
- Let me join.
- No!

441
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,780
Soft lather.

442
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,730
That's tickling.

443
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,340
P'Jo.

444
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,520
You hands are so pretty.

445
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,520
What makes it pretty?

446
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,410
It's just beautiful.

447
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,580
Here. If you compared with my hand...

448
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,590
Look.

449
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,230
My hands are so chubby.

450
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,450
They are cute.

451
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,680
Looks like ginger root.

452
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,520
Umm...actually...

453
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,560
I've never asked you about  your tattoos.

454
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:30,990
What's the meaning behind?

455
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,580
I'm a realist dreaming.

456
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,840
The impossible.

457
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,500
I am...

458
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,570
The person who accepts a situation as it is.

459
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:50,450
Dreaming of thins that can't happen?

460
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,880
- Like that?
- Um.

461
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,070
Something like that.

462
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,740
I think I am a realist, who lives with the present.

463
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,290
But many times...

464
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,510
I do think about the impossibles as well.

465
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,320
Like what?

466
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,860
You.

467
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,360
When I got these tattoos,

468
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,350
I thought of you.

469
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,780
I did these in LA.

470
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,990
When I wanted to forget you.

471
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,520
So that's the story behind.

472
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,160
Umm...but there are some other stuff too.

473
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,920
There are things in life that's impossible too.

474
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,480
But 80% of the meaning behind is you.

475
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,760
Then...should I get some tattoos about you too?

476
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,190
What tattoos?

477
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,440
Like your name on my forehead.

478
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,190
Or you face on my chest.

479
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,050
Not a good idea?

480
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,050
Not at all.

481
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,890
I was just kidding, P'Jo.

482
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,150
I actually wanted to get a tattoo once.

483
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,040
But I didn't know what to get.

484
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,570
Then don't.

485
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,340
You don't think I should?

486
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:30,480
Um.

487
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,120
If you said so...

488
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,420
then I won't do it.

489
00:47:03,426 --> 00:47:04,543
Dad.

490
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:05,715
This is P'Jo.

491
00:47:05,725 --> 00:47:07,469
My precious boyfriend.

492
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:08,819
Hello dad.

493
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:11,038
There's anything you want to do in your birthday?

494
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,545
Having you makes my birthday becomes the best day in my life.

495
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,554
Will you marry me?
