[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,550
Baijiale Supermarket,

3
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,400
1,652 pairs.

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,030
Green Basket Market

5
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,470
is 2,115 pairs.

6
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,470
Xixingji online store

7
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,840
is 2,191 pairs.

8
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,680
Feiteng Market is...

9
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,750
The result.

10
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,000
Just tell me the result.

11
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,560
Until yesterday...

12
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,120
Uncle.

13
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,080
It's 17,134 pairs.

14
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,840
We still need more than 2,000 pairs.

15
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,840
Jiang Hu,

16
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,840
you're already amazing enough.

17
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,800
Truly.

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,880
You're a thousand times better

19
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
than that

20
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,440
salesperson from before.

21
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,120
My goal is 20,000 pairs.

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,400
This won't do.

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,440
I have to think of a way.

24
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,400
What card?

25
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,720
Are you Flash Slothmore?

26
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,800
You're so slow.

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,560
Can you put a card down or not?

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,600
Yes.

29
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,120
My cards are bad.

30
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,720
I asked you to put out a card.

31
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,960
I'm not asking you for money.

32
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,880
Hurry up.

33
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,240
I'm not scolding you,

34
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,400
but it's not good to play cards at work.

35
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:27,880
Put it away.

36
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,280
Hurry up.

37
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,560
Master,

38
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,600
what should we do then?

39
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,560
It's not that we won't work.

40
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,160
We have no work to do.

41
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,400
Play your card.

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,960
Okay, okay.

43
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,680
Hurry up.

44
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,160
A pair of kings.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,800
A pair of kings?

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,070
Three of a kind.

47
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,880
You're going to beat me with that?

48
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,360
Can you go higher?

49
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,520
If not, then it's over.

50
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,120
Shuffle the cards.

51
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,720
Shuffle the cards.

52
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,360
Hurry and shuffle.

53
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,000
Jiang Hu

54
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,280
used up all her tricks

55
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,440
and she still has 2,000 pairs left.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,960
She's quite good

57
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,680
with distribution.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,360
With her speed,

59
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,000
I think

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,160
it'll be impossible for her

61
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,800
to sell 2,000 pairs in two days.

62
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,030
Not necessarily.

63
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,920
Let's make a bet.

64
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,800
If she sells it all,

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,589
I'll sing a song for you.

66
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,160
By the way,

67
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,240
all the founders

68
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,920
of Baoxing Group

69
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,840
will go to the charity road trip

70
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,680
in two days.

71
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,560
Also, I heard from Qiao

72
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,600
that the two founders

73
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,480
of Kitchen Life

74
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
and Smart Home

75
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,000
heard that you helped contribute

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,680
to TT Media

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,600
and For City

78
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,400
in post-investment programs

79
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,120
and their performances have improved,

80
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,360
so they want to chat with you.

81
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,150
Be careful.

82
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,600
Master Zhang,

83
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,040
are you free now?

84
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,150
I need your help.

85
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,400
Working is part of my job.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,150
I'm taking your salary

87
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,600
and it's during work hours.

88
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:56,920
What do you need?

89
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,840
You might need to work overtime.

90
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,240
We have an order?

91
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,560
I'll gather everyone right away.

92
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,600
We don't need so many people.

93
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,560
It's a simple technical job.

94
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,120
We only need four or five people.

95
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,920
Let's go.

96
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,480
Come, come.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,680
Flying.

98
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,560
I'm flying.

99
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,040
I'm flying.

100
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
I'm flying.

101
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,600
Come on.

102
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,720
Lili's mom.

103
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,150
I've had enough.

104
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,600
When can I

105
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,720
be free?

106
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,480
What are you doing?

107
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,120
Why are you

108
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,600
talking to your mom like this?

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,240
How could I raise you

110
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,480
without making money?

111
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,600
Am I right?

112
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,360
Look at you now.

113
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,800
You're all grown up

114
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
and you don't take me seriously anymore.

115
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,160
Have you forgotten all of this?

116
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
What is this?

117
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,720
What happened?

118
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,400
Why are you two fighting?

119
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,160
Jian,

120
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,240
my daughter is ignoring me again

121
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
because

122
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,600
I borrowed a little bit of money.

123
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,840
If I'd known that I'd be

124
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,560
angered by my child,

125
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,480
I wouldn't have given birth in the first place.

126
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,560
I was just asking for trouble.

127
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,150
Mom,

128
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,280
you bought stocks again?

129
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,920
How much did you borrow?

130
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
I'll pay it back now.

131
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,400
You can't do that.

132
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,040
Why should you pay it back?

133
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,150
If you dare to pay a single cent,

134
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,360
don't ever

135
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,920
appear before me again.

136
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,800
How could you be like this?

137
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
It's fine if you're rude

138
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,360
to me,

139
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,720
but how can you talk to Jian like this?

140
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
Jian is being filial by paying my debt.

141
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,480
You...

142
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,600
He's not your son

143
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,840
and you're not his biological mother.

144
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,720
You two

145
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,120
aren't related at all.

146
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,160
Why should he be filial to you?

147
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,120
Jian, then...

148
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,600
Jian.

149
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:27,920
Jiâ€”

150
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,400
Run!

151
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,240
Run!

152
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,560
Run

153
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,120
Zhaoyang, hurry.

154
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,360
Zhaoyang hurry up.

155
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,360
Zhaoyang.

156
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,280
Zhaoyang, are you alright?

157
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,680
Zhaoyang, are you alright?

158
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,400
Does it hurt?

159
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,240
Let me see.

160
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Let me see.

161
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,560
I'm gonna call the cops on him for domestic violence.

162
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,720
You can't. He's your father.

163
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,360
You can't do that.

164
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,280
He's not my dad.

165
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,280
His surname is Yang. My dad's surname is Xiang.

166
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,560
Honey,

167
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,560
how can we live

168
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,040
without money?

169
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,400
How about this?

170
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,040
Wait for me.

171
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,800
Once I find his bank card

172
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,680
and figure out the password,

173
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,040
I'll divorce him right away.

174
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,800
Zhaoyang?

175
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,000
Zhaoyang!

176
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,840
Zhaoyang!

177
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,000
I took my car to the shop.

178
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,950
I'll ride yours today.

179
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,760
You drive.

180
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,240
Okay.

181
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,520
Hello, Mr. Xu and Mr. Wu.

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,080
Why are you here?

183
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm here to attend

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,080
Baoxing's roadtrip event.

185
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
This is a get-together

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,440
for the founders of Baoxing Investment.

187
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,720
I know.

188
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,000
After I rent your land,

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,880
Iâ€™ll also count

190
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,960
as a member of Baoxing.

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,720
Jiang Hu,

192
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,480
I seem to have found

193
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,520
another of your strong points.

194
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
You're shameless.

195
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,760
You don't say!

196
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,000
That really is one of my strong points.

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,960
I will definitely

198
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,320
carry it forward.

199
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,600
You're not selling shoes anymore?

200
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,640
The deadline is tomorrow.

201
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,600
I know there are 11 hours

202
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
and 23 minutes

203
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,640
before it's tomorrow

204
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,120
and I have to complete your order.

205
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,520
So, from now on,

206
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,760
I will cherish every minute and second.

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,760
Let's go.

208
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,000
The key.

209
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,840
Get in.

210
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,480
Not you.

211
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,880
You'll be disqualified if you don't leave now.

212
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,120
I...

213
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,640
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

214
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,480
No, I'll sit in the back.

215
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,440
Give me the car key.

216
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,760
Hey,

217
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,000
your car is huge.

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I can sit in the back.

219
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,480
My treatment is so different.

220
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,720
How can I drive this car?

221
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,200
It's a truck.

222
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,760
This is

223
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,480
the team building activity

224
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,720
for the founders of Baoxing Investment?

225
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,360
There's no dinner or wine.

226
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,880
Everyone just has

227
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,480
a trash grabber and a bag.

228
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,480
You investors

229
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,120
are truly meticulous.

230
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,000
With this event,

231
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,200
you can promote yourself

232
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,000
while saving on the promotion expenses.

233
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,360
Amazing.

234
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,080
The job of investors

235
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,480
is to integrate the up and downstream resources

236
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,320
and maximize the utilization

237
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,000
of resources.

238
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,760
You can even turn trash

239
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,440
into a resource to be integrated.

240
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Amazing.

241
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,840
The media needs positive vibes.

242
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,440
Our theme today is environmental protection.

243
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,200
It's a seamless link.

244
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,080
Is there a problem?

245
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,600
Of course not.

246
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,480
You always kill two birds with one stone,

247
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
eat one fish in three ways,

248
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,480
and trigger a thousand waves with one stone.

249
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,240
Stop beating around the bush.

250
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
You shamelessly

251
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
came here today.

252
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,520
What resources

253
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,480
do you want to get from me?

254
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,000
You're even kissing up to me.

255
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,520
I don't have any ulterior motives.

256
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,480
Tell me.

257
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,840
I miss you, okay?

258
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,240
What are you talking about? You two seem happy.

259
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,120
Nothing.

260
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,320
I was just kidding.

261
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,360
You guys continue.

262
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,760
I'll go get some water.

263
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,440
Thank you.

264
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,840
You've worked hard.

265
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,360
No problem.

266
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,360
Call me if you need anything.

267
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,480
I didn't expect you to be so enthusiastic.

268
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,600
If I don't ask you for help,

269
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,880
I'll seem impolite.

270
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,840
Thank you.

271
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,600
Let me help you.

272
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,320
It's okay.

273
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,600
Here.

274
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,360
Give it to me.

275
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,240
Fine.

276
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,120
I won't stand on ceremony then.

277
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,760
Okay, come on.

278
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,360
Ms. Song,

279
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,480
this is a pair of shoes

280
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,760
that Teng Yue customized for you.

281
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,360
Here you go.

282
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,240
Thank you for your kindness,

283
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,600
but the size of these shoes

284
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,640
might not fit me.

285
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,320
You're size 37, right?

286
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,240
Isn't that Jiang Qisheng's daughter?

287
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,880
Teng Yue has been in my family for three generations.

288
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,640
I've at least learned

289
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,480
how to estimate one's shoe size.

290
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,600
Is this also

291
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,120
part of today's activities?

292
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,440
You did your research well.

293
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,600
You're quite sincere.

294
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,480
We must have sincerity before doing business.

295
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,480
If you like it,

296
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,000
would you like to

297
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,480
customize a pair

298
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,720
for TT Media's

299
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,000
forty-four employees

300
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,840
and the influencers you signed?

301
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
Wearing the same shoes

302
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,960
and walking down the same path

303
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,720
is also a representation

304
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,960
of corporate culture.

305
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,360
I don't think

306
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,990
this is Xu Si's idea, right?

307
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,480
He hates this kind of public relations.

308
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,720
Mr. Xu,

309
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,320
these are custom-made shoes for Baoxing.

310
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,600
Itâ€™s for you.

311
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,720
Please be benevolent

312
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,520
and help me out.

313
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Why should I help you?

314
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,360
If Teng Yue's land is vacant for a year,

315
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,440
you'll lose one million yuan.

316
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,120
We are on the same boat now.

317
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,120
Take a look.

318
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,240
Everyone,

319
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,000
as someone who will

320
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,080
soon join Baoxing's family,

321
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,600
let me say hello

322
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,880
on behalf of

323
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,960
Shanghai Teng Yue Shoes Ltd.

324
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,600
Everyone must be curious

325
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,480
why Teng Yue

326
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
is gifting everyone shoes.

327
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,480
Let me explain.

328
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,600
First,

329
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,480
Teng Yue doesn't have anything

330
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,990
other than shoes

331
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,120
to give as gifts.

332
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,440
Second,

333
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
I think

334
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,080
that Baoxing's event

335
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,640
is great.

336
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,600
I hope you all

337
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,960
can participate in more environmental activities.

338
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,600
Drive less and exercise more.

339
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,200
Put on Teng Yue's shoes

340
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,440
and your road to wealth

341
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,000
will become even smoother.

342
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,840
Well said!

343
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,640
Great.

344
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,760
Also,

345
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,880
to thank Mr. Xu

346
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,240
for his favor towards Teng Yue,

347
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,320
I decided

348
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,360
to bring out Teng Yue's limited edition shoes

349
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,080
and customize corporate shoes

350
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,600
for all companies in the Baoxing Group.

351
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,240
The internal group purchase price

352
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,520
is 59 yuan per pair.

353
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,840
The sample is here.

354
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,240
This is how it looks.

355
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,480
It's classic and matches every style.

356
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,360
Do any companies want customized shoes?

357
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,000
Does anyone

358
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,480
want customized shoes?

359
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,120
Kitchen Life wants it.

360
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,480
Okay.

361
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,240
Kitchen Life,

362
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,120
88 employees

363
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,360
ordered 88 pairs.

364
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,200
You're very thoughtful.

365
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,750
You even know how many employees we have.

366
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,720
Not bad.

367
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,480
Thank you, Mr. Wan.

368
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,000
Fanyue wants it too.

369
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,440
Sure.

370
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,000
Fanyue, 55 employees

371
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
ordered 55 pairs.

372
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,480
For City

373
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,440
will order 198 pairs.

374
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,520
Mr. Lin.

375
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,360
Mr. Lin,

376
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,120
doesn't your company have 99 employees?

377
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,640
How come you're ordering

378
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,760
198 pairs?

379
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,120
Two pairs per person.

380
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,830
Of the two,

381
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,880
one is a company benefit.

382
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,520
The other pair

383
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,080
will be paid for by the employee.

384
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,080
Great,

385
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,600
no problem.

386
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,480
Alright, Star Gravity,

387
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,840
85 pairs.

388
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,320
Xu Si.

389
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,000
Your shoes.

390
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,240
You're done going crazy?

391
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,480
I'm done.

392
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,520
Thanks to all companies

393
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,000
in the Baoxing Group for helping me

394
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,200
complete

395
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,600
the last sales mission.

396
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,320
Jiang Hu, your talent

397
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,120
of bluffing without blushing

398
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,000
has improved again.

399
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,000
Of course.

400
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,600
Learning from you

401
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
helps me make great progress.

402
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,840
Don't get me involved.

403
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,320
No.

404
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,880
You taught me

405
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,720
that, compared to the process,

406
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,240
the result is the most important.

407
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,520
At least, this is the law

408
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,360
in Baoxing Investment.

409
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,480
Mr. Xu,

410
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,000
to express my gratitude,

411
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,320
I would like to treat you to a meal.

412
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,400
Please do me the honor.

413
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,000
I've already done enough.

414
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,680
Then, about renting the factory...

415
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,400
Wait for my call tomorrow.

416
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Dad.

417
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,920
I've almost saved Teng Yue!

418
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,240
I've almost saved Teng Yue!

419
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:23,000
You ask me how much I love you.

420
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,920
What's wrong?

421
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,400
Have you gone mad?

422
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,520
What do you mean?

423
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,280
Didn't I make a bet with you?

424
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,920
If Ms. Jiang

425
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,000
can complete the sales,

426
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
then I'll lose.

427
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,280
I lost now.

428
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,400
Gently.

429
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,320
I lost. I lost.

430
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,200
Stop singing.

431
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,440
Stop singing.

432
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,880
No, I admit defeat.

433
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,080
Actually, I can't sing high notes,

434
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,640
but my middle notes are quite stable.

435
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,560
When I was in school,

436
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,320
my teacher said I was a baritone.

437
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,760
You're the one who made the bet.

438
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,680
How come I'm the one getting punished?

439
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,240
Hello?

440
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,680
One and a half hours later,

441
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,280
see you at building 325

442
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,400
of Nanhua Villas.

443
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,400
Who are you?

444
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,470
Xu Si.

445
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,960
Repeat that.

446
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,880
What the heck?

447
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Mr. Xu, a Ms. Jiang is looking for you.

448
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,720
It's not ten o'clock yet.

449
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,720
You thought I would be late,

450
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,200
so you went for a relaxed swim?

451
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,200
Don't worry.

452
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,760
At 10 o'clock,

453
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
I will promptly

454
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,720
have a professional meeting with you.

455
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,560
What are you doing?

456
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,440
Aren't you going to

457
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,550
let me change my clothes?

458
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,480
We're going to Baoxing

459
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,960
for the seasonal report, right?

460
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,520
Yes.

461
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Is it necessary to dress

462
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,480
so formally?

463
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,760
You don't need to, but I do.

464
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,520
I realized

465
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,000
that every time

466
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,760
you go see Mr. Xu,

467
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,720
you're always

468
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,920
like a peacock trying to show off.

469
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,880
You're quite insightful.

470
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,800
Is there a story behind this?

471
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,080
He was my boyfriend in college.

472
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,240
In that case,

473
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,480
should I not go with you?

474
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,520
When peacocks open their tail,

475
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,320
they don't seem to want others to be nearby.

476
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,520
You

477
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,990
are the most beautiful feather

478
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,720
on the peacock's tail.

479
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,680
The last crisis was solved perfectly.

480
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,240
The redesigned video

481
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,680
had a good response.

482
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,480
We've signed the contract

483
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,640
with Lidu too

484
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,640
and we've reached one million followers.

485
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,200
Every aspect of the data is beautiful.

486
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,000
So,

487
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,240
you brought me along

488
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,880
to show off?

489
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,000
Let's go.

490
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,680
I've sold the 20,000 pairs

491
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,560
within a month

492
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,440
according to our agreement.

493
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,720
Selling 20,000 pairs of shoes

494
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,160
is just the beginning.

495
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,520
I will invest

496
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,480
all of the sales revenue

497
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,200
into the launch and research of new products.

498
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,280
Based on the inventory sales this time,

499
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,520
the first quarter's sales

500
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,080
can reach 980,000 yuan.

501
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,710
With this

502
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,680
as the KPI criteria,

503
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,760
my expected sales target

504
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,030
is a quarter-over-quarter increase

505
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:42,960
of 200% in the average increment

506
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,960
of new product launches

507
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,320
in the other three quarters.

508
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,680
Jiang Hu,

509
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,640
this isn't enough.

510
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,680
I made a proposal

511
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
according to your requirements

512
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,520
and sold the inventory.

513
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,720
I didn't do this to convince you to invest in me.

514
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,960
I just wanted to prove

515
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,720
that I have the ability

516
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,200
to pay Teng Yue's rent two years later.

517
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,280
As for my gross profit margin,

518
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,230
my net profit,

519
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,680
my team, my channels,

520
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,480
and my products,

521
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,240
you and Baoxing

522
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,800
will only focus

523
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,720
on the rent and not the rest,

524
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,480
okay?

525
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Look at you.

526
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,240
You revert

527
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,920
back to your articulate self

528
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,280
whenever you're agitated.

529
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,080
Faux politeness

530
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,640
doesn't suit you at all.

531
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,000
You...

532
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,000
What exactly do you want?

533
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,880
I can exempt

534
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,240
three million yuan for two years of rent.

535
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,240
In exchange

536
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,720
for 70% of Teng Yue's shares.

537
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,320
With Teng Yue's current market capacity,

538
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,520
exchanging three million yuan in rent

539
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,280
for 70% of the shares

540
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,320
is a reasonable valuation.

541
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,480
This way, you can stay at the original location

542
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,720
and operate in peace.

543
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,480
What about after that?

544
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,720
You'll have to pay the rent after that, naturally.

545
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Xu Si,

546
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,000
not only are you good at toying with people,

547
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,480
but you're also a good at calculations.

548
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,720
You can choose to reject the offer.

549
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,760
To be precise,

550
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,880
if I don't get

551
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,720
a clear answer from you

552
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,000
by the end of today,

553
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:58,960
we won't have to

554
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,640
talk about Teng Yue anymore.

555
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,920
My time is precious.

556
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,520
I don't want to keep wasting it

557
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,000
on unnecessary communication.

558
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,480
What are you doing?

559
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,240
Song Ya, go in first.

560
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,960
I'm going to talk to Jiang Hu.

561
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,000
Okay.

562
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,440
Judging by your looks,

563
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,760
you didn't have a great chat

564
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,000
with your investor.

565
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,440
It's good.

566
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,760
You can experience

567
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,520
how it feels

568
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,920
to negotiate with others.

569
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,080
Jiang Hu,

570
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,190
If you want to do things well,

571
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,040
you need to face reality first.

572
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,040
Whether I face reality or not,

573
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,800
at least

574
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,880
I'm doing what I like to do

575
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,920
and what I want to do.

576
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,200
What about you?

577
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,640
Do you like

578
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,400
what you're doing now?

579
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,480
You're here?

580
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,480
You realized I'm here?

581
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,080
I've been here for a while.

582
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,920
It looks ordinary.

583
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,200
What's so nice about it?

584
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,480
Yes, it's quite ordinary.

585
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,160
Why is it suddenly different now?

586
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,240
I'm talking about the chairs.

587
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,160
What are you talking about?

588
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,680
Start your report.

589
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,520
When your mother passed away,

590
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,960
what she cared about the most,

591
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,240
other than you and I,

592
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,480
was Teng Yue.

593
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,000
This is the brand that they managed

594
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,280
for three generations,

595
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,680
but these years,

596
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,640
I didn't manage Teng Yue well.

597
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,160
I only completed one of the promises

598
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,640
I made to your mom.

599
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,880
It's to take care of

600
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,440
the dozen of old workers

601
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,880
who'd worked with Grandpa

602
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,720
and not fire any of them,

603
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,240
right?

604
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,000
Without

605
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,440
the 70% of the shares,

606
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,160
it means

607
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,040
forever losing

608
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,320
the control over Teng Yue.

609
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,880
From now on, the blade will be in the hands of others,

610
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,080
while you're waiting to get butchered.

611
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,000
It means

612
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,920
that your fate

613
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,800
and Teng Yue's future

614
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,320
will be decided by others.

615
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,240
In fact, Teng Yue will no longer

616
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
be under the Jiang family.

617
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,480
You should be more practical in the industry.

618
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,520
That's a solid

619
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,200
three million yuan in rent.

620
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,880
Even if Teng Yue is in the Jiang family,

621
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,720
if you can't open and make money,

622
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,280
being in the Jiang family

623
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,800
will be useless too.

624
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,760
Don't you know

625
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,080
what kind of person Xu Si is?

626
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,720
He's an investor.

627
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,680
What is he calculating with the three million yuan?

628
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,000
If he controls the shares,

629
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,280
then he can fire people

630
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,720
at any time.

631
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,400
Still, we must

632
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,280
consider reality.

633
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,760
We need to see the situation clearly.

634
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,000
These workers are your responsibility.

635
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,520
You can't abandon them.

636
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,880
The biggest problem now

637
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,520
is not being able to rent a factory.

638
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,320
Plus, Xu Si's exchange

639
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,240
isn't exactly

640
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,560
a scam.

641
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,720
Okay.

642
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,560
Today's planned reports

643
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,400
are all completed.

644
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,000
That's all for today.

645
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,000
You all can leave now.

646
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,320
Okay.

647
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:45,760
Okay.

648
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Mr. Du, Mr. Xu,

649
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,720
this is the contract drafted by Lawyer Qin.

650
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,160
I'll get going then.

651
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,960
Xu Si,

652
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,680
you are really something.

653
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,240
You've been in Baoxing

654
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,480
for only a few months,

655
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,000
but you've already

656
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
established Baoxing's

657
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,880
post-investment service center.

658
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,640
TT Media especially

659
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,320
has improved their performance greatly.

660
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,960
The founders

661
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,320
all think highly of you.

662
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,720
I was right about you.

663
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,960
You're the type

664
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,160
to do well

665
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,320
in every aspect of business.

666
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,640
What is your opinion

667
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,800
on my arrangement for Teng Yue?

668
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,400
Do you really believe

669
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,760
Jiang Qisheng's daughter

670
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,640
can make Teng Yue great again?

671
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,040
It doesn't matter whether I believe her or not.

672
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,480
What matters is

673
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,040
that Baoxing has the majority ownership.

674
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:54,960
Whether she can do it

675
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,200
or not,

676
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,640
we won't lose anything.

677
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,920
We can both attack or defend.

678
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,800
This is a good move.

679
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,000
However, to make Teng Yue

680
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,160
perform and have value

681
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,240
like Cloud Footwear

682
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,920
in front of Aneda

683
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,400
or be even more valuable,

684
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,240
you may have to work hard.

685
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,320
Giving these zombie companies

686
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,760
new value

687
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,080
in the capital market

688
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,320
is one of our values

689
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,190
as investors.

690
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,680
It's late.

691
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,800
Will she still come?

692
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,960
Let's wait and see.

693
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,840
Three million yuan

694
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,440
for 45% of the shares.

695
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,320
There's no room

696
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,480
for negotation between us.

697
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,120
All businesses have room for negotiation.

698
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,760
You used five million yuan

699
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,280
to buy Teng Yue's shares,

700
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,200
but you want me

701
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,560
to buy 45%

702
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
with three million yuan.

703
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,680
Forty-nine.

704
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,760
This is my bottom line.

705
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,520
Impossible.

706
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,120
What's your bottom line?

707
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
Give me 51.

708
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,120
You take 49.

709
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,040
Okay.

710
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,160
Hurry, hurry.

711
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,480
Is everyone here?

712
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
Is everyone here?

713
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,080
Almost. Almost.

714
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,520
Jiang Hu,

715
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,960
you...

716
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,960
Why did you

717
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,200
call everyone over here?

718
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,440
I gathered you all today

719
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,160
to take photos for everyone.

720
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,840
Let's do it one by one.

721
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,000
Master Zhang,

722
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,520
please help organize everyone.

723
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,120
Okay.

724
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,000
Liu Jun,

725
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,040
you can lead.

726
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,200
No.

727
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,440
Ms. Jiang,

728
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,800
why are we taking photos?

729
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,080
Listen to Ms. Jiang.

730
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,360
Ask them to line up.

731
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:30,920
Hurry up.

732
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
Are we going to be fired

733
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,440
after taking the photos?

734
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:33,800
Yes.

735
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,400
The factory

736
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,160
hasn't had work in a month.

737
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,120
My hands are empty.

738
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,480
My heart feels empty too.

739
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,400
Okay, stop arguing.

740
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,480
This is a factory, not a market.

741
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,960
I told you all to line up and take photos.

742
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,080
Come on.

743
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,670
Line up.

744
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,320
Uncle.

745
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,000
Stand still.

746
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,360
Come.

747
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,040
Line up.

748
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,000
Come on. Don't just stand there.

749
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,840
The first of the new employee photos

750
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,400
starts with you.

751
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,440
I'll go first.

752
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,480
Okay.

753
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,200
Good. Look at the camera.

754
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,520
Fix your hair.

755
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,280
Okay, good.

756
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,360
Good. Look at the camera.

757
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,120
Smile.

758
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,480
Good.

759
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,600
Move your head to the right.

760
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,840
Wait.

761
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,400
What are you doing?

762
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,840
Sit down.

763
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,480
Let's finish first.

764
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,160
Sit down. Okay.

765
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,880
Good.

766
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,200
Okay. Come on.

767
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,040
Here.

768
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,480
Let me do it.

769
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,000
I...

770
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,280
You...

771
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,480
Your hat.

772
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,520
Good.

773
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,320
Done.

774
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,200
Okay.

775
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,000
Master.

776
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,880
Master, I didn't see you.

777
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,120
I didn't see you just now.

778
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,920
I didn't see you.

779
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,200
Okay.

780
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:14,920
Okay.

781
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,640
Now,

782
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,520
you all have

783
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,400
your own employee photos.

784
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,920
These will be used

785
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,400
in your new employee files

786
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,360
and badges.

787
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,560
Ms. Jiang,

788
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,000
are we going to start working again?

789
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,320
Yesterday,

790
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,040
I signed the lease contract

791
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,120
with Mr. Xu of Baoxing Investment.

792
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,880
From now on,

793
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,280
we will

794
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,360
stay here without worry.

795
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,960
As for the production orders,

796
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,480
I will arrange it

797
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,080
as soon as possible

798
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,000
according to the distributors' orders.

799
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,120
Great.

800
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,040
We have work to do.

801
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,480
We have work to do.

802
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,600
I have another good news

803
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,360
to tell everyone.

804
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,000
Baoxing Investment

805
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,680
has become Teng Yue's

806
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,280
important shareholder.

807
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,160
It's a very powerful

808
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,400
investment company.

809
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,160
From now on,

810
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,640
we will work together.

811
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,760
Great!

812
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,880
Great!

813
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,640
We have work to do.

814
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,120
We have work to do.

815
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,440
Jiang Hu,

816
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,920
well done.

817
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,560
Awesome.

818
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,800
Great.

819
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,520
Great!

820
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,040
How can you guarantee success

821
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,480
with the empty shell that is Teng Yue

822
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,920
and have no less than 10 million yuan

823
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,960
in revenue per year?

824
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,000
I can't guarantee anything.

825
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,320
Simon, you're being too casual.

826
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:39,840
This is not

827
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,280
what a mature investor should say.

828
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,280
Then, what do you think

829
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,030
a mature investor

830
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,200
should do?

831
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,120
What do you think?

832
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,880
Invest in people.

833
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,480
What?

834
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,320
The most important task of an investor

835
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,920
is to invest in people.

836
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,600
In this industry,

837
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,560
all data

838
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,560
can be built

839
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,400
by data models

840
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
to be calculated.

841
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,200
Only people can't be controlled.

842
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,800
As investors,

843
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,760
we must pick

844
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,560
the people

845
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,640
who have value.

846
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,200
So, you're saying

847
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,840
that Ms. Jiang who spends money like it's free

848
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,520
can make money for us?

849
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,480
Are we waiting for her

850
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,680
to do a magic trick for us?
