5
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:40,370
Put it here.

6
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,289
There's an empty space here.

7
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,370
Okay.

8
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:53,990
Thank you.

9
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,910
Thank you.

10
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,750
I'll get back to work.

11
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,390
Go ahead.

12
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:00,980
Why did that scum

13
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,060
suddenly send

14
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,380
a plant to me?

15
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,260
Are you afraid it may be poisonous?

16
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,120
This plant

17
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,150
has flat stems

18
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,390
that look like cacti

19
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,990
and flowers that look like orchids.

20
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,790
So it's called an orchid cactus.

21
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,530
Most importantly,

22
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,650
it symbolizes reminiscence.

23
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,890
Reminiscence?

24
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,079
So he sent it to me as a reminder.

25
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,940
A reminder of what?

26
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,200
He asked me a few questions

27
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
when I made my last report to him.

28
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,990
This plant is not worth much.

29
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,390
But this flowerpot

30
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,650
is a deep rectangular Yixing flowerpot.

31
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,230
It's big

32
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,230
and judging from its color,

33
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,280
it's quite old.

34
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,770
You're an expert.

35
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,200
I just like such things.

36
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,560
Ms. Yue.

37
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,990
Why don't you

38
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,800
take it home?

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,720
Iâ€¦

40
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,930
I may be too busy to take care of it.

41
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,860
Xu Si sent it to you

42
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,430
as a gift.

43
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,760
How can you give it to me?

44
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,130
What is he thinking?

45
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,440
Usually, when people give plants as gifts,

46
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,250
they give irises, lilies, or calla lilies.

47
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,070
Look at him.

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,970
He gave me

49
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,600
an orchid cactus.

50
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,520
I wonder what he meant by it.

51
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,600
It doesn't matter what he meant.

52
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,130
What matters is that it's a carefully selected gift.

53
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,790
About you and him,

54
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,450
I've been wanting to say this.

55
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,430
Xu Si is a strong wind.

56
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,900
Teng Yue can use it to fly high.

57
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,690
If you like him,

58
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,820
just follow your heart.

59
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,470
But if you don't like him,

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,040
what you need to do next

61
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,840
is keep a distance

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,680
from him.

63
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,750
VC boys are sophisticated

64
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,760
and good at playing tricks.

65
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,990
If one day,

66
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,370
you fall out with him,

67
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,530
I'm afraid you'll suffer losses.

68
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,350
Ms. Yue.

69
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,030
We're not there yet.

70
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,180
Besides,

71
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,490
I just want Teng Yue to thrive.

72
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,300
What if Teng Yue didn't exist?

73
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,820
How would you treat him?

74
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,470
But Teng Yue does exist.

75
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,820
I do have Teng Yue.

76
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,620
Now,

77
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,830
I just want to make Teng Yue thrive

78
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,030
and find a suitable designer

79
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,320
for Teng Yue.

80
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,470
Before that,

81
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,950
I'll do my best to sell shoes to make money.

82
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,340
By the way,

83
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,030
has Yang Jian

84
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,370
got licenses

85
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,500
for those three flagship stores?

86
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,159
He'll get them soon.

87
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,480
But after he does,

88
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,190
we need to have new shoes to put in the stores.

89
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,130
It takes time

90
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,460
to find a good designer.

91
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,030
Before we do,

92
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,790
let's keep selling

93
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,830
those shoes with rainbow laces

94
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,770
on the Internet.

95
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,730
In the next few days, I'll try new methods

96
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,880
like finding an influencer

97
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,340
to sell our shoes through livestreaming

98
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,940
to increase the sales first.

99
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,670
I've received your plant.

100
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,530
Thank you.

101
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,970
Why did you suddenly send me a plant?

102
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,190
[Xu Si invites you to a voice call.]

103
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,790
Hey.

104
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,950
Have you received the plant?

105
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,100
Yes.

106
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,350
I was too busy to tell you.

107
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,159
That plant is very precious.

108
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,540
Take good care of it.

109
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,980
It's very precious?

110
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,670
Maybe you should take it back.

111
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,290
I can't take back something

112
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,380
I already gave you.

113
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,630
Am I that stingy

114
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,860
in your eyes?

115
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,390
What if

116
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,710
your precious plant dies in my care?

117
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,670
If it does,

118
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,820
so will you.

119
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,700
Just kidding.

120
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,010
I mean

121
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,670
I had two such plants at my place,

122
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,430
so I sent one to you

123
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,120
to accompany your cactus.

124
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,860
I heard

125
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
this plant is a kind of cactus too.

126
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,130
Okay.

127
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,970
Thank you.

128
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,250
Anything else?

129
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,280
No.

130
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,600
What about you?

131
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,180
No.

132
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,490
I'm hanging up.

133
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,430
She hung up on me.

134
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,710
Has she got the hint

135
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,710
or not?

136
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,300
So cruel.

137
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,240
I'm talking about you.

138
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,210
Li said

139
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,890
you want to work with Lord Cat.

140
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,720
Yes.

141
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,230
I want him to do three livestreams for Teng Yue.

142
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,940
Teng Yue?

143
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,200
I've never heard of that brand before.

144
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,670
Li must have sent you

145
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,140
Lord Cat's rates.

146
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,080
We make you the same offer

147
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,590
as we do the base.

148
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,390
If Teng Yue can't afford it,

149
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,150
I don't think we need to sit here

150
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,909
wasting each other's time any longer.

151
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:55,920
We're both busy,

152
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,750
aren't we?

153
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,840
What's wrong with Jiang Hu?

154
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,070
You can't call her Jiang Hu.

155
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,110
Call her Ms. Jiang.

156
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,010
Be polite.

157
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,660
We're almost the same age.

158
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,470
You can call me Jiang Hu.

159
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:13,910
Okay.

160
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,220
You play this game too,

161
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:18,850
Jiang Hu?

162
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,870
That's a really hard level, Jiang Hu.

163
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,950
I can't pass it.

164
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,720
Jiang Hu.

165
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,539
I've been raising money for a while

166
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,080
but still can't get enough.

167
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,890
The three million yuan I borrowed from your dad,

168
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll pay it back

169
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,130
with interest in a year.

170
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,230
Micro Dance Club?

171
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,260
Is Mr. Li going to pay you back?

172
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,710
They opened a mall

173
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,640
in the latest version of their app.

174
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,350
He can't pay me the money,

175
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,680
but he can pay me the interest at least.

176
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,860
Interest?

177
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,170
How much do you want?

178
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,070
I want to advertise on the splash screen

179
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,340
of Micro Dance Club's app

180
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,150
for a week.

181
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,350
The users of your app

182
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,870
are mainly from the dance community.

183
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,710
They're also

184
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,590
Teng Yue's

185
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,650

186
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,430
So,

187
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,590
I hope I can sell Teng Yue shoes

188
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,870
in your mall.

189
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,740
The interest I'm asking for

190
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,350
is reasonable

191
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,190
and totally affordable, right?

192
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,100
You've

193
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,640
overestimated

194
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,570
the amount of daily active users of Micro Dance Club.

195
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,470
I've checked

196
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,510

197
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,870
That number has been increasing rapidly

198
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,670
these months.

199
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,150
I can afford that interest.

200

Thank you.

201
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,230
With due respect,

202
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,630
70% of my app's users

203
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,990

are too old-fashioned.

207
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,800
If you want to increase sales,

208
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,450
I'm afraid you'll have to try something new.

As it happens,

210
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,360
the app

211
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,300
will be updated tonight

212
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,350
and we'll launch a nationwide dance competition

213
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,840

Bring me that pair of shoes.

Zhaoyang may not give them to me.

I don't care how you get them.

Half an hour is not enough.

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,780
My inspection as your boss is over.

Farewell, Boss.

00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
I'll walk you out.

Zhaoyang.

530
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,930
Zhaoyang, open the door. It's me.

531
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,810
Zhaoyang.

532
00:23:50,740 --> 00:24:00,830
[Sorry]

533
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,560
Iâ€¦

534
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,150
Zhaoyang.

535
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,460
[Teng Yue retro rainbow lace shoes]

536
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,040
That's no design.

537
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,430
[Thank you for your order]

538
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,270
[Running against the wind, we'll always be together.]

539
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:41,930
Well,

540
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:42,880
Zhaoyang,

541
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,080
are you hungry?

542
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,290
I'll make some wontons

543
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,620
and let's eat together.

544
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:57,950
Zhaoyang.

545
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,270
Iâ€¦

546
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,620
I never thought

547
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,410
that one day

548
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,540
you'd collude with Jiang Hu

549
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,420
against me.

550
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,160
That's not the case.

551
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,890
We didn't collude against you.

552
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,310
Iâ€¦

553
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,410
I've consulted a lawyer.

554
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,430
If TT Media holds you accountable,

555
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:15,970
you can shift the blame

556
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:16,920
to us.

557
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:17,800
No matter how much TT Media

558
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,470
asks for compensation,

559
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,480
we'll pay it.

560
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,080
Zhaoyang.

561
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,360
Here is what I think.

562
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,740
Your hand-painted shoes

563
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,650
can be known by the public

564
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,850
through this method.

565
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,870
Isn't it good?

566
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,840
In the past two days,

567
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,750
over 4,000 pairs of those shoes

568
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,810
have been sold.

569
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,270
Many people love

570
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,050
the shoes you painted on

571
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,480
and want to buy a pair of them.

572
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,120
So,

573
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,240
we both think

574
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,500
this matterâ€¦

575
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,390
You both think.

576
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,340
You both want.

577
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,310
You both agree.

578
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,120
Do both of you think

579
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,190
I'm a pushover?

580
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,340
Have you ever asked

581
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,030
whether I'm willing

582
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:52,780
to do this?

583
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,880
It's not like that.

584
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,200
I was wrong this time.

585
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,910
I'll go to TT Media tomorrow

586
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,890
to explain things for you.

587
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,690
Don't do that!

588
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,470
Zhaoyang.

589
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,910
You guys shouldn't

590
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,410
have meddled in my business.

591
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,540
Especially not you.

592
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,240
What do you want me to do?

593
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,620
I'll do whatever you say.

594
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,380
Just leave.

595
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,500
I don't want to talk to you.

596
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,460
Have you forgiven me?

597
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,250
Go.

598
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,590
We agreed

599
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,330
that she'd go to the hospital

600
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,660
after the cups sold out.

601
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,950
But the host you found

602
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:17,730
was such a hard worker

603
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,330
that the cups were oversold.

604
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,500
As a result,

605
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,830
your mom goes to the factory to watch over the production every day

606
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,990
and is barely at home.

607
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,950
You know what?

608
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,030
She came back at midnight yesterday.

609
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,590
Where is she now?

610
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,440
At home.

611
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,220
She's going to work soon.

612
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,200
Stop her.

613
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,110
You know her temper.

614
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,890
How can I stop her?

615
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,130
I'll be right there.

616
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,820
Hurry up.

617
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,010
Moping, what do you think of this dress?

618
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,820
Compared to the previous one, which one is better?

619
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,690
It looks great.

620
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,250
You look great in anything.

621
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,400
Your clothes are all dresses.

622
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,140
They all look similar.

623
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,690
They're not similar.

624
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,600
This one is quite different from the one just now.

625
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,390
-Okay.
-Which one do you think is better?

626
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,350
Both of them are great.

627
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,610
I have to go to work now.

628
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,570
Take your time to try on your dresses.

629
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,510
There's one more dress.

630
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,390
Give me a moment.

631
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,310
I'll try that on

632
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,370
and you'll help me decide which of the three dresses is the best.

633
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,010
Okay.

634
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,120
Go get changed.

635
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,310
Don't go.

636
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,160
What are you doing here?

637
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,440
You're finally back.

638
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:22,840
Youâ€¦

639
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,920
What are you doing?

640
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,450
It's early in the morning.

641
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,890
What is this all about?

642
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,320
Let's go to the hospital.

643
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,020
I see.

644
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,370
You two are in cahoots.

645
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,510
Son.

646
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,940
I really have to go to the factory.

647
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,930
Can we wait until I get my work done?

648
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,240
I don't believe you.

649
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,080
Let's go.

650
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,110
You're a grown man now

651
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,410
but I can still beat you up.

652
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,810
Let go of me.

653
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,580
Teng Yue

654
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,470
just used the shoes I painted on

655
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,050
as product samples.

656
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,550
Do you think

657
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,360
because you didn't say anything

658
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,240
or make an appearance,

659
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,840
this can't be considered a breach of contract?

660
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,830
If the company

661
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,990
wants compensation,

662
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,550
just take it out of my paycheck.

663
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,190
You think what TT Media

664
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,050
wants is money?

665
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,240
Zhaoyang, I know.

666
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,200
You still dream

667
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,550
of becoming a designer.

668
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,900
But you must be devoted to what you're doing

669
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,170
and can't regret your choice.

670
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,430
Since you signed the contract with me,

671
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,670
you should abide by it.

672
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,620
That's the basic work ethic.

673
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,180
Haven't you learned a lesson

674
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,710
from the incident at Aneda?

675
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,670
Teng Yue has come to me

676
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,450
and paid to use

677
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,520
that paintingâ€¦

678
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,070
Why didn't you

679
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,660
tell me that?

680
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,780
But

681
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,110
I hope

682
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,000
it won't happen again.

683
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,170
You have to know

684
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,160
the focus of your work

685
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,270
and where you stand in this business.

686
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,950
Any collaborations with other companies

687
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,410
should be reported in advance.

688
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,140
Understand?

689
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:50,910
Otherwise,

690
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,290
I'll have to settle scores with you, new and old.

691
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,670
How could you

692
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,920
do that

693
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,080
without telling me?

694
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,470
The 15% of profits

695
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,470
TT Media takes,

696
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,330
I'll make it up.

697
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,830
Nonsense.

698
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,340
That's Teng Yue's

699
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,340
marketing cost.

700
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,810
It has nothing to do with you, the proxy operations agency.

701
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,480
Besides,

702
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,890
I made that decision myself

703
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,060
and it affected Zhaoyang.

704
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,670
Naturally,

705
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,600
I have to take the responsibility.

706
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,200
You

707
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,420
are too efficient.

708
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,060
You're used to asking for forgiveness rather than permission.

709
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,440
We'll talk about it later.

710
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,580
This pancake is almost done.

711
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,030
Save some room for it.

712
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,000
No brother

713
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,880
can treat his sister any better.

714
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,560
What did you say?

715
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,210
I said I'm stuffed.

716
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,870
I've eaten so many pancakes.

717
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,580
If I eat more, I'll become a scallion pancake.

718
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,120
Come on.

719
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:43,790
Try it.

720
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,120
Come on.

721
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,760
Try it.

722
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,840
No. I can't eat any more.

723
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,540
Look at my belly.

724
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,000
The food has piled up here.

725
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,140
Just one bite.

726
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,950
It was not easy for me to make it.

727
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,860
It took time, energy, water, and electricity.

728
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,090
You can do more experiments,

729
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,690
but if your lab rat dies,

730
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,050
you'll lose all hope.

731
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,320
Do me a favor.

732
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,470
Besides Zhaoyang,

733
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,200
you're the only one I know who tasted Ms. Chen's pancakes.

734
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,930
I can only turn to you.

735
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:05,880
I have no choice.

736
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:06,930
If I had other choices,

737
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:07,730
-Fine, fine, fine.
-I wouldn't have come to you.

738
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,410
Okay.

739
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,200
Just one bite.

740
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,700
One bite.

741
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,210
Just one bite.

742
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:11,870
Okay. Just one bite.

743
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,380
I promise.

744
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,130
Come on.

745
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:23,950
What do you think?

746
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,400
Comment on it.

747
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:38,620
Say something.

748
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:41,990
It tastesâ€¦

749
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,090
Wrong again?

750
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,990
I think you got it right this time.

751
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,140
Really?

752
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,370
I succeeded?

753
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,010
Let me try it.

754
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,600
I can't wait to find out how the pancakes

755
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,800
Ms. Chen made tasted.

756
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,770
My goodness.

757
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,020
Joey.

758
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:00,960
Rewrite the terms

759
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,320
of the request for proposal.

760
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,850
Give it to me in half an hour.

761
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:12,409
Zhaoyang.

762
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,170
What are you doing here?

763
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,290
The accounting department

764
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,159
needed me to sign some papers.

765
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,150
So I came.

766
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,120
You have difficulty with that?

767
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,330
No.

768
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,270
It's done.

769
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,020
Okay.

770
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,340
If you need anything,

771
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,469
feel free to call me.

772
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,330
Okay.

773
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,639
Anything else?

774
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Here's the thing.

775
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,610
Do you have a moment?

776
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,239
There are things

777
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,070
I want to ask your opinion about.

778
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,469
Would you like a cup of coffee?

779
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,310
Sure.

780
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,429
So,

781
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,790
both Teng Yue and Free Unicorn

782
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,060
want to work with you?

783
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:50,679
What do you think?

784
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,010
Which one do you prefer?

785
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,690
Do I have a choice?

786
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,760
The contract with TT Media

787
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,550
and the non-compete agreement with Aneda

788
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,770
are leaving me

789
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,030
with no choice at all.

790
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,540
There's no difficulty

791
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,440
that can't be overcome.

792
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,690
Check your phone.

793
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,330
I've sent you the contact of a friend of mine.

794
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,570
Wang Peng, a lawyer.

795
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:13,500
He specializes in

796
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,670
contract litigation.

797
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,990
He can definitely help you

798
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,320
find the best solution.

799
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,830
Do you think I should wait a little longer?

800
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:21,980
That way,

801
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,530
it won't be so troublesome.

802
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,420
But deep down,

803
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,240
you don't want to wait anymore,

804
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,650
do you?

805
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,280
Otherwise,

806
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,740
you wouldn't feel so torn.

807
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,310
Do you remember

808
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,740
the pair of hand-painted Teng Yue shoes

809
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,740
you gave me?

810
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,560
You still keep them?

811
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,840
I never saw you wearing them,

812
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,040
so I thoughtâ€¦

813
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,670
The paintings on them are incredible.

814
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,930
They may get dirty if I wear them,

815
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:49,930
so I put them away.

816
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,510
Since then,

817
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:53,920
I've never doubted

818
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,860
that you'll become

819
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,190
an excellent designer,

820
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,500
because you have both talent

821
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
and passion.

822
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,850
So,

823
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,310
your advice is that I should

824
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,360
choose Teng Yue?

825
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,630
It's your decision to make.

826
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,440
I just want to say,

827
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,010
you shouldn't give up your dream

828
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:16,360
or make decisions

829
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,220
that you'll regret in the future.

830
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,520
Thank you.

831
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,880
I'll take your advice

832
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,600
into careful consideration.

833
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,210
You're back.

834
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,410
Just to let you know,

835
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,560
I'm going out for dinner.

836
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,360
Again?

837
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,820
I don't want to eat out.

838
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,370
But what can I eat at home?

839
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,120
Tell me.

840
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,880
Jian

841
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,310
doesn't come to cook now.

842
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:06,880
Have you

843
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,360
been mean to him recently?

844
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,380
He's your brother.

845
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,700
You should respect him.

846
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,430
Understand?

847
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,320
I do respect him.

848
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,410
I really need to

849
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,710
talk some sense into you.

850
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,590
You know it.

851
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:19,880
Jian

852
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,810
used to send us all kinds of food

853
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,960
regularly.

854
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,270
Couldn't you be a little nicer

855
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,180
to him?

856
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,920
You count on him to cook for us and bring us necessities.

857
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,170
Who is he to you?

858
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,120
What a strange question.

859
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,200
Who is he to me?

860
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,120
He is my son,

861
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,370
your brother.

862
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,750
You didn't respect him.

863
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,480
Look what happened.

864
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,370
He doesn't come to cook for us

865
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,370
and do the cleaning anymore.

866
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,260
You can't do those things yourself.

867
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,130
I hope

868
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,080
you really think of him as your son.

869
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,090
Look at you,

870
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,020
so serious.

871
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,380
That's no way to talk to your mother.

872
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,420
It's true

873
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,300
that you didn't respect him.

874
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:52,900
Am I wrong?

875
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,030
[Teng Yue Shoes]

876
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,100
You're the big boss

877
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,020
yet I brought you to eat at the canteen every time you came.

878
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,080
I'm sorry about it.

879
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,730
If you hadn't

880
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,990
hired my favorite chef

881
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,930
to cook here,

882
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,200
I wouldn't have come so often

883
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,730
to increase your food cost.

884
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,680
As long as you like the food here,

885
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,710
I don't mind a little increase

886
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,550
in the food cost.

887
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,410
I can afford it.

888
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,810
You're getting better at flattery.

889
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:13,890
I appreciate it.

890
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,740
Really?

891
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,040
I don't want verbal praise.

892
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,250
Is there any reward?

893
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:19,650
I knew it.

894
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,000
You can use everything to your advantage.

895
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,810
Do me a favor.

896
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,080
What you ask for may be out of my reach.

897
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,340
Modesty is not one of your good virtues.

898
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,390
I talked with Song Zhi

899
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,120
of TT Media

900
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,220
about Xiang Zhaoyang's management contract.

901
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,350
She won't let her go.

902
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,050
Could you please

903
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,970
do something to change her mind?

904
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,920
Every time you're extra polite,

905
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,580
I know you're up to something.

906
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,270
It's not something bad.

907
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,560
In business,

908
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,550
you've invested

909
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,210
in both Teng Yue and TT Media.

910
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,480
If we're at loggerheads

911
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,340
and go to trial,

912
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,900
it won't do you any good, right?

913
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,310
You'll be put on the spot.

914
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,350
In life,

915
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,970
the history between you

916
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,510
and Song Zhiâ€¦

917
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,150
You know what I mean?

918
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,670
Do you expect me to praise you

919
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,680
for being thoughtful

920
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,860
and having done a thorough investigation?

921
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,450
Jiang Hu.

922
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,440
You've taken

923
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,840
every advantage

924
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,650
you can take of me.

925
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,390
You're a master

926
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,040
of getting people

927
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,370
to pull strings for you.

928
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,850
I'll take it as a compliment.

929
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,730
Then can you help me?

930
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,670
Can you?

931
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:40,730
Eat.

932
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:41,950
Okay.

933
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,700
Have some more, Boss.

934
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,280
-Hello, Mr. Xu.
-Hello, Mr. Xu.

935
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:48,870
Hello.

936
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,760
When will you come again, Mr. Xu?

937
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,690
I'll ask the chef to prepare something special for you.

938
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,270
I heard you love hairy crabs.

939
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,840
Hairy crabs are in season now.

940
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,330
Tomorrow,

941
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,590
I'll ask the chef to prepare some for you.

942
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,110
You know exactly

943
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,660
what my favorite foods are.

944
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,690
Chef Lin

945
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,720
violated the privacy of his client.

946
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,140
How could you say that?

947
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,360
He just wants

948
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,750
to serve you better.

949
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,510
He didn't violate anything.

950
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,280
I doubt that.

951
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,240
Congratulations, Boss.

952
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,060
You're going to be lucky.

953
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,880
I mean it.

954
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,860
Not everyone

955
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,240
can step on dog shit.

956
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,310
The odds of it

957
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,730
are even lower than finding money in the street.

958
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,710
They're about 1,000 to 1.

959
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,510
There's a science to this, Boss.

960
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,160
Shut up.

961
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,220
I understand.

962
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,630
You don't want to talk about dog shit.

963
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,130
Fine.

964
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,580
Let's keep talking about food.

965
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,300
It's fine if you can't come in person.

966
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,230
I'll ask Chef Lin

967
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,360
to prepare hairy crabs with rice cakes

968
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,560
and send them to you.

969
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,760
That's sticky.

970
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,150
I've lost interest

971
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,010
in hairy crabs.

972
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,290
Then what do you want to eat?

973
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,550
That dog!

974
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,200
Throw it away.

975
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,340
Goodbye, Boss.

976
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,570
Good job.

977
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,890
I'll give you more bones for dinner tonight.

978
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,260
So, Lawyer Wang, you mean

979
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,820
as long as I can sign an agreement

980
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,950
with my previous company

981
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,000
to terminate the non-compete agreement

982
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,600
and return the compensation

983
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,170
for the non-compete period,

984
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,130
I'll be fine?

985
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,010
Yes.

986
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,090
Besides,

987
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,890
there's room for negotiation

988
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,450
about the compensation terms in the non-compete agreement.

989
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,730
I'm confident of keeping it

990
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:02,970
under 200,000 yuan.

991
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,120
Then how about my management contract

992
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,990
with TT Media?

993
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,730
It's hard to get out of that contract.

994
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,560
According to the materials you provided,

995
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,380
during your cooperation

996
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,260
with TT Media,

997
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,370
they didn't

998
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,590
breach the contract.

999
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,610
Moreover,

1000
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,360
according to the terms of the contract,

1001
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,520
after they offered you job opportunities

1002
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,580
that earned you a great deal of money,

1003
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,910
if you want to terminate the contract,

1004
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,710
the compensation will be more than a million yuan.

1005
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,340
Okay. I got it.

1006
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,190
Lawyer Wang.

1007
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,230
Let me think about it.

1008
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,680
I'll call you back.

1009
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,270
Okay.
