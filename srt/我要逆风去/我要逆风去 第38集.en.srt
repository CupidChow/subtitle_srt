00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,229
Let's welcome Mr. Xu.

6
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:43,920
Mr. Xu,

7
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,680
welcome.

8
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,650
Ms. Jiang,

9
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,440
I’m looking forward to your elaboration.

10
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:58,910
Okay.

11
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,440
I'll leave the stage to you.

12
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,070
Thank you.

13
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,150
Then,

14
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:02,910
please allow me

15
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,600
to welcome my partner, Wu.

16
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,930
Please show everyone.

17
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,180
Mr. Ye, come here.

18
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,390
Look.

19
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,380
Let's hear what Jiang Hu says.

20
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,070
This is the fabric

21
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,950
that we just got patented.

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,640
A normal knife

23
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,230
would never cut it open.

24
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,310
Well,

25
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,790
Jiang Hu and her boyfriend

26
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,550
match each other

27
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,730
so well

28
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,230
wearing our t-shirts

29
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:29,870
and cloth shoes.

30
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,390
The sweatshirt we're wearing

31
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,840
-is made of this material.
-I haven’t agreed

32
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,100
to making clothes yet.

33
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,110
Ms. Jiang

34
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,210
is so good

35
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,960
at introducing the patent.

36
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,490
We're really old now.

37
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,460
We can't

38
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,880
even explain the good products

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,710
we made.

40
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,560
You've said a lot already

41
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,550
about a brand that's more than 100 years old

42
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,790
and an old factory director devoted to research and development,

43
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,350
but if you want to spread

44
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,000
your beautiful story to consumers,

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,790
you have to spend most of the money

46
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,670
on marketing

47
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,020
and brand creativity.

48
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,350
It will take a long period.

49
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,920
However,

50
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,510
don’t you think

51
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,880
the old factory director of Cloud Footwear

52
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,560
has already wasted

53
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,570
the best time?

54
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,280
Listen.

55
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,050
What is she talking about?

56
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,180
These investors

57
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,590
just like

58
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,210
these performative things.

59
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,270
If we need to spend money for ads,

60
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,210
then tell me.

61
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,030
Why would we join this show?

62
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,660
Mr. Ye, calm down.

63
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,770
Let's keep watching.

64
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,570
It might work.

65
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,140
I believe

66
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,660
that as long as you want to start a business,

67
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,920
you should never be afraid of being late.

68
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,390
Cowards never set off,

69
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,950
the weak die on the way,

70
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,790
and only we keep advancing.

71
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,240
As long as we persevere

72
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,880
and do everything possible,

73
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,800
fate

74
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,290
will favor us.

75
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,250
Well,

76
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,230
Ms. Jiang's words

77
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,590
are very powerful.

78
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,560
Here's the thing. I have a question.

79
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,240
I've seen Mr Wu

80
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,970
doing livestreams for Teng Yue before.

81
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,300
He was very successful,

82
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,610
but I’m curious

83
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,280
how you divided your work

84
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,430
for the Cloud Footwear project.

85
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,230
It's still...

86
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,670
It's still the same

87
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,000
as when I was in Teng Yue.

88
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,350
I'm responsible for selling goods online.

89
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,230
Jiang Hu is responsible for

90
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,250
the branding, research and development, production,

91
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,250
and marketing.

92
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,480
Yes.

93
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,829
After experiencing

94
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,709
all the difficulties in starting a business,

95
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,910
we developed

96
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,240
our latest product line

97
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,350
on the basis of Cloud Footwear's patent,

98
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:24,950
For Young.

99
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,240
The concept expresses

100
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,970
that the youth

101
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,720
should have the courage to try.

102
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,710
This is

103
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,790
a new interpretation

104
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,850
after inheriting the classic brand.

105
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,230
Ms. Jiang,

106
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,800
I heard

107
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,390
that when you took over Teng Yue,

108
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,390
you had some

109
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,120
conflicts with the investors?

110
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,150
Well,

111
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,150
in my opinion,

112
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,000
a pair of shoes

113
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,940
has both the lining and surface.

114
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,790
Both are important.

115
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,580
If the lining isn't sturdy enough,

116
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,860
but you insist on walking,

117
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,150
this pair of shoes

118
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,680
will soon be destroyed.

119
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,630
You won't be able to walk too far.

120
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,420
It's the same for companies.

121
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,140
What I want to do

122
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,350
isa

123
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,880
century-old brand that can keep developing.

124
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,590
It can walk slowly,

125
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,640
but it must pass down

126
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,270
the genes that have been built up for 100 years.

127
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,350
Before it is

128
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,900
fully prepared,

129
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,270
I don't want it

130
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,730
to become a tool for capitalist operations.

131
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,270
This is the maximization of interests

132
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,690
within the shortest time

133
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,590
that many investors

134
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,670
work for.

135
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,840
This is the concept I can't accept.

136
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,110
Ms. Jiang,

137
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,890
whether from scale

138
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,770
or business format,

139
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,760
your project

140
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,150
is still a traditional project.

141
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,320
So...

142
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,710
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,490
This...

144
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,470
What did Jiang Hu say wrong?

145
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,120
Yeah.

146
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,620
These investors

147
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,320
-Sir.
-are overreaching.

148
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Calm down.

149
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,270
Don't get worked up.

150
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,230
Come on.

151
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,200
What happened?

152
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,910
Two mentors turned off their lights.

153
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,150
Two of the four investors

154
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,480
cast dissenting votes.

155
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,550
According to the rules

156
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,710
of our show,

157
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,480
I can only apologize

158
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
to you, Ms. Jiang.

159
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:39,900
It's okay.

160
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,350
Actually,

161
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,360
coming to this show,

162
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,909
I didn't plan on

163
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,710
getting successful financing.

164
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,940
I just wanted to use this show

165
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,500
to let more people know about

166
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,390
our old brand, Cloud Footwear,

167
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,300
learn about our new product line,

168
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,030
For Young,

169
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,850
acknowledge the cross-generational

170
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,080
startup team

171
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,670
formed by the old factory director Ye Guoming,

172
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,150
Wu, and I,

173
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,390
and know about our heritage

174
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,720
and innovative spirit.

175
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,980
My mission

176
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,280
is done.

177
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Thank you all.

178
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,960
This is

179
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,480
something unexpected.

180
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,910
So, Ms. Jiang

181
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,240
came here to advertise.

182
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,150
As expected of Jiang Hu.

183
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,650
Will this

184
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,320
affect their sales?

185
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,350
Master Zhang, look.

186
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,390
The netizens

187
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,820
in the comments

188
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,030
are all asking where to buy

189
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,890
Cloud Footwear's For Young line.

190
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,150
Jiang Hu turned this entrepreneurship show

191
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,790
into

192
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,120
the new product launch of Cloud Footwear.

193
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,870
Attracting investments

194
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,430
is not her purpose.

195
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,630
Amazing.

196
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,590
That's it?

197
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,220
We didn't get anything.

198
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,320
It was all in vain.

199
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,350
Okay.

200
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,590
Mr. Wang,

201
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,850
just a moment. please.

202
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,480
Mr. Ye,

203
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,280
Mr. Wang from Hetian Trading

204
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,620
wants to talk about our new products.

205
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,680
Please talk to him.

206
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,290
Mr. Wang?

207
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:14,820
Mr. Wang.

208
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,150
Hello.

209
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,680
Mr. Wang.

210
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,870
Do we have a new order?

211
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,030
Of course.

212
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,050
They want to order 50,000 pairs.

213
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:26,830
Fifty-thousand pairs?

214
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,160
Fifty-thousand pairs.

215
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,310
Yes.

216
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,559
You can say

217
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,070
that our fabric

218
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,419
is at the national level.

219
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,450
I didn't expect

220
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,590
her to

221
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,049
still not play by the book.

222
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,240
Xu Si,

223
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,530
look at you.

224
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,430
During the whole recording,

225
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,530
you were either anxious

226
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,840
or transfixed.

227
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,340
As an experienced person,

228
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,870
let me give you some advice.

229
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,390
If you go out now,

230
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,330
you'll have all kinds of possibilities.

231
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,330
If you don't move,

232
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,930
you'll have no possibility

233
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:05,640
at all.

234
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,340
Let me hold it for you.

235
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,080
I'll throw this away for you.

236
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,040
Thank you.

237
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,950
My motorcycle

238
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,750
is over there.

239
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,930
Let me send you back.

240
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,590
It's okay.

241
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,590
It's just a few steps away.

242
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,350
The subway station is just ahead.

243
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,990
It's close.

244
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,590
It's okay.

245
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,640
Let's go.

246
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,640
I'll take it back to the factory.

247
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,940
Okay.

248
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,240
Okay, go on back.

249
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,970
I'm leaving.

250
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,680
Bye.

251
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,940
Why are you here?

252
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,920
You didn't go home?

253
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,050
I...

254
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,310
I was thinking that since

255
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,990
today was a success,

256
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,350
let's have a celebration party.

257
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,220
There's a seafood restaurant

258
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,150
near your place.

259
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,250
I've always wanted to take you there.

260
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,890
Wu,

261
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,350
what you said to me that day

262
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,320
really touched me.

263
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,110
At my most difficult period,

264
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,070
I met Yang,

265
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,910
Jiu,

266
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,640
you,

267
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,670
and Qi.

268
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,470
This entire time,

269
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,990
you all stood by my side

270
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,540
no matter what happened,

271
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,690
accompanying me

272
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,570
and helping me.

273
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,610
I'm really grateful.

274
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,230
You...

275
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,180
No,

276
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,110
you all

277
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,360
are like my brothers.

278
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,740
We're like best friends.

279
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,990
Yang and Jiu

280
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,410
are like my big brothers.

281
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,820
You and Qi

282
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,270
are like my little brothers.

283
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,990
Do you understand?

284
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,240
Have you never

285
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
considered me?

286
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,790
Jiang Hu.

287
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,230
You'll still be my little brother

288
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,160
and good friend.

289
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,380
Go home early.

290
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,820
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

291
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,270
Be careful.

292
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,700
These are our treasures.

293
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,730
Okay, director.

294
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,460
Mr. Ye.

295
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,770
Mr. Ye,

296
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,660
you don't know.

297
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,000
These days,

298
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,110
the two phones in the office

299
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,870
for taking orders

300
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,070
are about to explode.

301
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,080
We have orders lined up until the end of the year.

302
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,690
I didn't expect

303
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,790
that the entrepreneurship show

304
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,520
would have such a big effect.

305
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,270
Mr. Ye,

306
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,410
you shouldn't underestimate

307
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,330
the influence of the media.

308
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,480
I must admit that I'm old now.

309
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,520
Oh my, this entrepreneurship show

310
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,490
made my heart flutter when watching.

311
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,350
Did we accidentally

312
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,950
switch to a romance drama?

313
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,250
I actually found a couple to ship.

314
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,460
They match so well.

315
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,090
Support for our Wuhu couple.

316
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,130
My soul is burning with love.

317
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,830
I want to see them advance.

318
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,590
Come on.

319
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,970
They're so adorable.

320
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,610
Date! Date! Date!

321
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,190
Help,

322
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,590
this is too sweet!

323
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,390
Shut up!

324
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,590
This cost of the homepage ad spot

325
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,910
of this shopping festival

326
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,050
is totally different

327
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,250
from the usual price.

328
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,050
Personally, I suggest

329
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,940
that Cloud Footwear shouldn't compete for this.

330
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,870
I don’t want to miss

331
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,530
this promotion opportunity.

332
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,490
Can you do something about it?

333
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,840
I'll be frank then.

334
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,170
Cloud Footwear's monthly sales

335
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,470
aren't up to standard yet.

336
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,630
But the sales this month

337
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,470
are already five times more

338
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,520
than last month.

339
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,750
I know

340
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,950
this is already a miracle

341
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,080
for Cloud Footwear,

342
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,870
but...

343
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,800
Just take Teng Yue.

344
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,150
You know

345
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,790
what kind of sales they have.

346
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,190
I know,

347
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,230
but Cloud Footwear

348
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,360
is a century-old brand and household name.

349
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,590
The value of a brand

350
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,410
should be more important than sales, right?

351
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,350
The rules are set.

352
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,950
I can't do anything about it.

353
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,370
How about this?

354
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,030
I'll find a way

355
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,350
to find more discounts

356
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,710
from other aspects,

357
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:00,590
okay?

358
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:02,880
Have a seat.

359
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,510
I have to go.

360
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,630
Let's proceed

361
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,430
by pushing the project's key points.

362
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:16,840
Okay.

363
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,480
Please keep an eye on

364
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,870
on the data.

365
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,330
Okay.

366
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,270
I look forward to working with you.

367
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:21,560
Bye.

368
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,350
See you.

369
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,430
Bye.

370
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,440
Ms. Jiang,

371
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,020
I didn't expect to meet you here.

372
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,480
I'm Teng Yue's new managing director,

373
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,160
Shi Jialun.

374
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,090
We met before.

375
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,880
You gave Teng Yue proposals before.

376
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,540
I remember.

377
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,710
I didn't expect that Teng Yue

378
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,840
really is yours now.

379
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,390
After I joined Teng Yue

380
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,230
and learned more about Teng Yue,

381
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,710
the more I was impressed

382
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,400
by the previous management and development strategy.

383
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,000
By the way,

384
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,870
Teng Yue's sales this season

385
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,330
increased by another 50%.

386
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,170
We've also opened

387
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,230
direct

388
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,180
specialty stores

389
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,160
in Beijing, Tianjin,

390
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,230
and Ha'erbin.

391
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,420
It's the same as

392
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,550
your previous plan.

393
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,270
When are you free?

394
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,990
You're welcome to visit.

395
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:10,710
Everything

396
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,910
is the same as before.

397
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,900
You can give us some guidance too.

398
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,790
I can't guide Teng Yue

399
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
after it was acquired by a big group.

400
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,560
Acquired by a big group?

401
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,390
Boss.

402
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,440
Perfect timing.

403
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,630
This is the

404
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,430
acquisition plan

405
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,430
drafted with Aneda

406
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,160
for three Chinese shoe brands.

407
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:47,880
Also,

408
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,130
have you reviewed

409
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,360
Teng Yue's contract?

410
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,060
Let's go to the meeting first.

411
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,710
When the season changes

412
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,230
and when my face

413
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,710
is sensitive and turns red,

414
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,310
I always use Aushilai's

415
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,710
repair lotion.

416
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,470
It's very refreshing

417
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,670
and not sticky at all.

418
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,860
Why are we pausing

419
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,350
the M&A process

420
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,230
for Teng Yue?

421
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,620
I don't need to

422
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,820
report my work to you.

423
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,230
When did you

424
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,360
learn to deceive yourself?

425
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,310
Have you fallen in love

426
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,480
and are unable to get out of it?

427
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,140
It has nothing to do with love.

428
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,630
I know you don't want

429
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,710
Teng Yue to be acquired now,

430
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,510
but it can't save

431
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,870
the relationship between you and Jiang Hu.

432
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,230
She doesn't know anything.

433
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,600
Are you going to be muddled like her?

434
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,240
I told you

435
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,900
it has nothing to do with love.

436
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,110
Okay.

437
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,890
Even if it has nothing to do with love,

438
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,640
Xu Si,

439
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,430
we are an investment company.

440
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,950
You're turning a project into the main business.

441
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,750
Do you want the whole industry

442
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,870
to laugh at us?

443
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,560
I will give Mr. Du and Baoxing

444
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,880
a satisfactory explanation.

445
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,390
Congratulations.

446
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,230
You're already

447
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,690
number five in the livestreaming industry.

448
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,800
I'm working with Cloud Footwear now.

449
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,580
I’m here

450
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,120
to invite you to sell Cloud Footwear.

451
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,840
You can discuss the fee and commission

452
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,160
with my management.

453
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:44,640
I did.

454
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,520
I just didn't expect

455
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,380
that your fees have grown so much.

456
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,710
It's all thanks to

457
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,230
your help.

458
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,990
We worked together before.

459
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,820
Give me a discount.

460
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:57,990
Ms. Jiang,

461
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,450
you've always been a boss.

462
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,350
Why do you still care about this little money?

463
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,200
I'm just

464
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,310
the marketing director of Cloud Footwear now.

465
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,640
Since I work for others,

466
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,750
I have to share the boss's burden.

467
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,470
With your ability,

468
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,240
it shouldn't be difficult

469
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,640
even if you left Teng Yue

470
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,200
and started a new business.

471
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,600
Why did you choose

472
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
a half-dead old cloth shoe factory?

473
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,900
I have many reasons,

474
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,320
but as you know,

475
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,430
I won’t do a losing business.

476
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,360
Ms. Jiang,

477
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,840
I'm also a businesswomen.

478
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,120
Livestreams have their rules.

479
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,080
Livestream hosts also have

480
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,010
their professional differences.

481
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,910
How about I introduce

482
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,230
other hosts to you?

483
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:45,750
Okay.

484
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,960
I accept your fee

485
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,510
and commission rate.

486
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,550
Negotiations

487
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,630
for the homepage ad for the shopping festival

488
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,760
are basically done.

489
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,360
We will use the users' search habits

490
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,630
and attention points

491
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,490
of different data to blast the ad.

492
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,730
The remaining details

493
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,360
for the ad design

494
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,510
will be done after reviewing them

495
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,730
with Designer Xiang.

496
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,520
You're better at this than me.

497
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,640
You can decide.

498
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,670
By the way,

499
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,480
I met Ms. Jiang today.

500
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,620
She was probably trying to get

501
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,870
the shopping festival's ad for Cloud Footwear.

502
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,240
I planned to clarify

503
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,400
her misunderstanding about Teng Yue,

504
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,940
but her attitude

505
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,750
was not very good.

506
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,830
Next time.

507
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,880
If I have a chance next time,

508
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,990
I'll try again.

509
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,570
We can't control

510
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,130
what others think.

511
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,890
Just do your job.

512
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,310
Okay.

513
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,560
I'm leaving.

514
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,920
When will you meet

515
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,220
with the workers next?

516
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,830
Tomorrow afternoon.

517
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,720
I'll go with you.

518
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,210
I happen to be free.

519
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,130
I can listen in.

520
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,670
Okay.

521
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,450
Advertising on the homepage is already expensive,

522
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,580
let alone during a shopping festival.

523
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,430
Why don't you do something realistic?

524
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,870
Add in more keywords,

525
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,550
pay for orders,

526
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,550
give free shipping,

527
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,390
or pay for targeted ads.

528
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,720
Don't those sound good?

529
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,520
I have to open up the market for young people.

530
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,380
Placing ads on the homepage

531
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,470
only between 9 p.m.

532
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,550
to midnight

533
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,480
will save money.

534
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,440
But Cloud Footwear

535
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,670
won't reach the sales quota

536
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,750
in a while.

537
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,070
I have an idea.

538
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,700
I've talked to Tao Xiaoying already.

539
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,390
Do a livestream?

540
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,490
How did you persuade Ye?

541
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,620
He doesn't know yet?

542
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:44,910
Later,

543
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,150
I'll give you another bowl of wontons

544
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,510
so you won't die on an empty stomach.

545
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,310
Jiu, get her another bowl of wontons.

546
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,300
And a fried egg!

547
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:50,610
Okay.

548
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,870
You're really eating?

549
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,620
I've been busy all day. I'm starving.

550
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,640
Ever since I became a worker,

551
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,550
I really

552
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,710
learned about

553
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,360
how different bosses can be.

554
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,710
It's not easy for me.

555
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,110
Eat more.

556
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,490
Come with me tomorrow.

557
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,000
If Ye wants to kill you,

558
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,580
I won't be able to handle him either.

559
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,040
You know them well.

560
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,000
Please help me beg them

561
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,330
to give me one more week.

562
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,680
Jiang Hu,

563
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,950
you're going full out

564
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,180
to sell shoes.

565
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,800
No,

566
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,320
you're killing yourself.

567
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,490
You need ads,

568
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,670
livestream fees,

569
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,670
and commissions.

570
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,630
Ye will spit blood if he finds out.

571
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,630
I must make the biggest sacrifices

572
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,480
so Cloud Footwear's sales

573
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,920
can reach the quota.

574
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,760
I want to talk to you.

575
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,190
What do you want to drink?

576
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,950
Mojito.

577
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,260
Mei,

578
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,850
be straightforward.

579
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,600
What exactly are you thinking

580
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,920
about Teng Yue?

581
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,150
Why haven't you

582
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,680
advanced the contract yet?

583
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,720
Are you really

584
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,950
not going to move it forward?

585
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,870
Didn't you say

586
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,600
you would respect my judgment?

587
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,290
I respect your judgment

588
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,110
as an investor

589
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,870
with years of experience.

590
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,330
Look at you now.

591
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,350
Are you acting like an investor?

592
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,290
Can't you understand the situation?

593
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,170
Don't

594
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,590
ruin your career

595
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,230
just because you want to

596
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,160
get your ex back.

597
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,110
If Teng Yue's acquisition

598
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,150
can't go on,

599
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,150
our cooperation with Aneda

600
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,550
will be completely over.

601
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,910
The past two years of hard work

602
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,170
will be wasted.

603
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm old.

604
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,780
My heart can't take it.

605
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,430
Mei,

606
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,600
I understand.

607
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,970
You have take responsibility

608
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,170
for the employees of Jingyang Capital.

609
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,130
I will also

610
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,190
take responsibility for your heart.

611
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,080
Stop.

612
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,670
You should

613
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,270
take care of yourself first.

614
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,390
Aneda's big boss

615
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,510
surnamed Tang

616
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,840
is not easy to deal with.

617
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,070
He is not

618
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,760
a refined person like Tang Ya.

619
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,100
Didn’t you

620
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,340
deal with him before?

621
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,990
Do you know

622
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,850
what he did before he became rich?

623
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,510
You know the punks

624
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,470
with your ex?

625
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,390
Those punks

626
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,030
can't compare with

627
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,230
his tactics.

628
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,910
By then, what we'll be worrying about

629
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,670
won't be property.

630
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,220
Mei,

631
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,680
stop scaremongering.

632
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,580
I need to take this call.

633
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,220
[Du Weiye]

634
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:02,910
Great.

635
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,520
The other difficult guy is here first.

636
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,320
Hello, Mr. Du.

637
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,200
I just found out today

638
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,750
that the chess game

639
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,150
I played with you

640
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,550
has reached the final step.

641
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,170
The final situation

642
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,390
is quite interesting.

643
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,020
Look.

644
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,770
Take a step forward

645
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,770
and you'll win completely.

646
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,970
If you take a step back,

647
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,560
you'll lose the whole game.

648
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,210
I understand.

649
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,040
Why didn't you

650
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,560
finish this game?

651
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,700
Because at that time,

652
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,960
neither of us was in the mood

653
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,090
to finish this game.

654
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,910
How about now?

655
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,940
Are you in the mood?

656
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,320
Xu Si,

657
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,080
when you first came to Baoxing,

658
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,030
I promised you

659
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,290
that you'd be Baoxing's

660
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,420
management partner

661
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,510
after completing

662
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,930
Aneda's M&A case.

663
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,150
I’m not someone

664
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,790
who makes casual promises to others.

665
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,390
I know.

666
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,910
But I didn't say

667
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,470
what would happen

668
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,270
if this case can't be completed,

669
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
because I believe

670
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,480
you know it clearly.

671
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,620
An unprofessional investor

672
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,020
failing

673
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,450
a major project

674
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,880
is enough to ruin his career.

675
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,890
You're a sensible man.

676
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,530
Sit down.

677
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,470
Sit.

678
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,170
Xu Si,

679
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,260
you're still young.

680
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,510
Don't make

681
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,150
any irrational decisions.

682
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,610
In that case,

683
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,750
what you've accumulated

684
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,060
in this industry for eight years

685
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,140
may be destroyed.

686
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,480
Aneda's merge is like this game.

687
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,150
If one step goes wrong,

688
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,620
you will

689
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,960
lose the whole game.

690
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,470
Come.

691
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,610
Time to eat.

692
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,100
Eat.

693
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,200
Slow down.

694
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,780
I won't see you off.

695
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,470
You seem distracted

696
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,540
all day.

697
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,390
Are you looking for someone?

698
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,080
Later, talk to Mr. Shi

699
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,150
about

700
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,140
the ad page's design plan.

701
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,740
Seriously, Jiang Hu?

702
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,440
What are you thinking?

703
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,900
You promised Wu so easily?

704
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,740
Won't you test him for a year or a half?

705
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,020
Wu isn't bad.

706
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:35,750
Bro,

707
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,750
I'll buy you a drink tonight.

708
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,210
Don't embarrass me, okay?

709
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,120
I'll get the car out first.

710
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,460
We'll wait for you downstairs.

711
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:39,590
Jiang Hu.

712
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,570
Cloud Footwear is not Teng Yue.

713
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,710
Some things are worth working hard for.

714
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,030
Some,

715
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,470
will make you

716
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,780
lose more opportunities.

717
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,150
That's what you think.

718
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,120
We have different values.

719
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,070
Hello, Yang Jian.

720
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,400
You guys go back first.

721
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,550
I'll take a taxi.

722
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,130
What's wrong with that car?

723
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,790
Why does it keep following us?

724
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,600
Sir,

725
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,090
stop up front.

726
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,150
Okay.

727
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,450
Xu Si, get out of there.

728
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,500
Get out!

729
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,660
Will you get out or not?

730
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:18,760
Why

731
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,380
can you still not act like a woman?

732
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,530
Then you should act

733
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,640
like a man first.

734
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,070
Are you getting out or not?

735
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,480
Why are you following me?

736
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,600
It's a coincidence.

737
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,400
Coincidence?

738
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,590
You've been following me

739
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,590
for two hours

740
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,470
and you tell me it's a coincidence?

741
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,600
What a coincidence!

742
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,190
Yes.

743
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,590
It's just a coincidence.

744
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,060
Since we're fated,

745
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:47,730
let's

746
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,260
have dinner together tonight.

747
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,460
I happen to be hungry.

748
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,910
Stay hungry if you want.

749
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,660
My treat.

750
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,760
No need to act polite.

751
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,230
Then we might have to

752
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,560
continue having coincidences like this.

753
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:00,820
You...

754
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,470
Let go, Xu Si.

755
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,910
You two haven't been here for a long time.

756
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,380
I thought you broke up.

757
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,290
We're both busy at work.

758

Hong Kong milk tea, double sugar.

763
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,580
We didn't order Hong Kong milk tea.

764
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,690
It’s from Lu.

It's happiness.

768

00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,620
you'll forget all your worries.

No need. I'll take the subway.

876
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:04,870
Tell me.

877
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,690
I’ll give you Changle Restaurant.

878
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,290
You can't

879
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,620
tell Wu and the others about it.

880
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,140
This place is not big,

881
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,790
but it's somewhere they live in.

882
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,990
It's like their home.

883
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,630
If they know about this,

884
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,070
they won't

885
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,110
stay here.

886
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,330
Over the past few years,

887
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,780
you're the boss

888
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,320
of Xixingji,

889
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,720
but the salary you give them

890
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,320
is enough for them

891
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,880
to live a comfortable life.

892
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,840
Do you think they'll need this place to stay in?

893
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,880
It's livelier

894
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,190
when we're together.

895
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,400
We're used to it.

896
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,750
What if I disagree?

897
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,200
Give me some time.

898
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,810
I'll find a place

899
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,830
and we'll move out.

900
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,340
It's fine

901
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,170
if you keep Changle Restaurant.

902
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,390
There's a solution.

903
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,520
What?

904
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,270
Tear up the divorce agreement.

905
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,380
It tastes good.

906
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,640
Your cooking skills

907
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,980
have indeed improved.

908
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,080
You just—

909
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,040
Unfortunately,

910
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,270
you don’t like this dish,

911
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:39,790
because it has

912
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,700
the coriander that you dislike.

913
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,520
When you are upset,

914
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,980
you go fishing.

915
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,390
The book by your bed...

916
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:54,140
No,

917
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,990
it should be New Concept English textbook

918
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,650
is to bore you to sleep, right?

919
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,790
You always keep

920
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,960
the tasty food until the end.

921
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,730
Also,

922
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,610
no matter what others say,

923
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,150
you never drink alcohol,

924
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,230
-because you don’t like it.
-No.

925
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:12,820
I like drinking.

926
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,020
I love it.

927
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,430
I'm my dad's son.

928
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,320
I'm scared

929
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,810
I inherited his bad genes.

930
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:30,870
I'm scared

931
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,470
that if I get drunk,

932
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,290
I'll be like him

933
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,880
and hurt you.

934
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:41,820
Even if I can control it,

935
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:44,910
I'm scared

936
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:49,740
that when you stand in the same yard

937
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:52,580
and see me drunk

938
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,700
while reeking of alcohol,

939
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:56,690
it will make you

940
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,140
remember some bad memories.

941
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:05,370
I don't dare to try

942
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:08,850
even once.

943
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,640
♫We stare blankly together♫

944
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,660
♫The stars fall down♫

945

♫That night is worth♫
