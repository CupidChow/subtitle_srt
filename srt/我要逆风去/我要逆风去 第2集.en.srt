It turns out that Free Unicorn

has been established for 30 years.

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,230
there is no

13
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,390
It looks a little deserted.

14
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,920
It's not grand.

No.

Are the people from Baoxing Investment

53
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,010
in a hurry?

54
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,150
You havenâ€™t officially joined Baoxing

55
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,070
and you've already helped them with

56
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,720
such a big land-buying project.

57
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,690
The position they gave you

58
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,710
is not bad, right?

59
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,330

Later, in the company,

67
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,909
I'll have to call you lord.

68

Mr. Yan, I can explain.

200,000 followers.

70
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,670
Our company has an influencer,

71
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,780
and I didn't even know that.

72
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,230
I can explain.

73
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,030
Explain what?

74
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,909
Before you joined the company,

75
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,040
you are already an influencer.

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,460
So it has nothing to do with the company.

77
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,350
No.

78
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,550
Since Weibo

79
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,030
is my personal social tool,

80
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,210
I didn't report to the company

81
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,710
when I joined.

82
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,710
So...

83
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,910
There is no problem that it's personal.

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,390
But if you have hundreds of thousands of fans,

85
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,390
you'll have social influence.

86
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,990
Use your influence

87
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,710
to get advertisements

88
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,970
is not unacceptable.

Over the years,

Of course, it can't be helped.

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,190
Back then,

353
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,920
I went back to the city

354
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
and was assigned here.

355
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,090
It was my first day.

356
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,510
There was a girl standing in front of the factory

357
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,630
wearing a white

358
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,790
dacron shirt.

359
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,870
She smiled at me.

360
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,630
In a blink of an eye,

361
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,750
Teng Yue is almost 100 years old.

362
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,490
Yes.

363
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,710
You fell in love with my mom at first sight.

364
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,460
This is your first time

365
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,250
bringing a boy

366
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,480
to me.

367
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,830
What are you thinking?

368
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,910
It's not like that.

369
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,990
Then what is it?

370
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,230
I just made a bet

371
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,870
with that investor Xu.

372
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,970
Nothing else.

373
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,780
That's great.

374
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,280
I'm relieved.

375
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,630
Why?

376
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,030
Don't you know?

377
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,470
Xu Si

378
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,990
is smart, resourceful

379
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,230
and ambitious.

380
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,630
If you like him,

381
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,860
I'll have to worry.

382
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,710
In my eyes,

383
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,160
no one is better

384
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,470
than my dad.

385
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,720
What are you looking at?

386
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,650
58 points.

387
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,470
What's wrong with 58 points?

388
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,230
I was sick so I didn't do well this time.

389
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,590
I'll get 100 points next time.

390
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,870
Your answer is not wrong.

391
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,470
It's the problem of this question.

392
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,270
Your answer is also right.

393
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,380
Really?

394
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:36,490
[Gao Yi, what have you been busy with recently?]

395
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:58,690
[Gao Yi, my dad wants me to take over Teng Yue first.]

396
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,850
Seven points for this question.

397
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,020
You should get 65 points.

398
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,250
Really?

399
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,710
Dad.

400
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,030
I passed.

401
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,310
Let me see.
I can stop standing.

402
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,270
I didn't ask you to stand.

403
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,850
You insisted on doing that.

404
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,870
I don't want to accept the fact that

405
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,640
I didn't do well in the exam.

406
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,380
Let him

407
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,390
tutor me in the future.

408
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,670
He's better than the math teacher.

409
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,840
Stop it.

410
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:22,890
He is the son

411
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
of my comrade-in-arms

412
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,780
when I settled down in the countryside.

413
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,760
From now on,

414
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,790
heâ€™ll live in our house.

415
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,520
You can call him Brother Gao Yi.

416
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,630
Brother Gao Yi.

417
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,310
Hello.

418
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,160
We don't know anything about Shen Gui.

419
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,280
Please don't make any unnecessary association.

420
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,100
Mr. Jiang.

421
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,680
Okay. Okay.

422
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,050
Hand the documents over there.

423
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,750
Don't spread it.

424
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,670
Let me do it.

425
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,410
Note it down.

426
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,390
Did you see that?

427
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,100
Today's stocks.

428
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:27,650
Let's go.

429
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,190
Hurry.

430
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,230
Turn on the computer.

431
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:30,700
Ms. Yue.

432
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,360
Ms. Yue.

433
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,230
Ms. Yue.

434
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:35,940
Rumors are spreading in the market

435
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,630
about Shen Guiâ€™s disappearance.

436
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:36,890
I...

437
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,960
Pay us back! Pay us back!

438
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,030
Hurry up.

439
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,150
Liar! Pay us back!

440
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,390
Pay us back! Hurry!

441
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,760
Shen Gui.

442
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,160
Come out and explain!

443
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,550
Come out! Pay us back!

444
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,670
Come out!

445
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,000
Hello.

446
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,830
Hello, Gao Yi.

447
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,430
Something happened to the company.

448
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:19,710
Jiang Hu.

449
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,380
I have something urgent to do.

450
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,580
Take care of yourself.

451
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:27,640
Bye.

452
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,910
Affiliate companies in Lido

453
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,510
also bought Peace Loan

454
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,530
through you.

455
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,470
Why didnâ€™t this affect them?

456
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,710
Uncle Jiang.

457
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,870
I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s too late

458
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,950
to say sorry now.

459
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:44,960
Gao Yi,

460
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,520
you introduced me to Shen Gui

461
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,410
and asked me to invest in Peace Loan.

462
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,430
Did you do it on purpose?

463
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Please

464
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,120
help me

465
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:06,960
to re-register

466
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,020
Gao Zheng's payment account.

467
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:09,740
Thank you.

468
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,740
It's time to cancel

469
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,210
Jiang Qisheng's account.

470
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,310
Right, Dad?

471
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,670
Jiang...

472
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:34,610
Jiang...

473
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,850
We won!

474
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,560
We won!

475
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,870
Shen Gui was arrested.

476
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,990
Peace Loan is over.

477
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:10,710
Uncle Jiang.

478
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,970
I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s too late

479
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,990
to say sorry now.

480
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,470
Hello, welcome.

481
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,100
Xu Si.

482
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,380
Have a seat.

483
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,670
I'm here for Teng Yue.

484
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:50,790
I know.

485
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,220
Can you accept

486
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,420
this price?

487
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,170
Shameless!

488
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,790
You're looting a burning house.

489
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,680
Do you want to hear the truth from me?

490
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,370
A person like you...

491
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,680
What kind of truth can come out from you?

492
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,000
I thought you asked me out

493
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,070
because you've figured it out.

494
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,600
The price fluctuation is

495
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,070
according to the market rules.

496
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,040
You are Jiang Qisheng's daughter.

497
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,110
Don't be so childish.

498
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,200
Besides,

499
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,230
under the current situation,

500
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,880
this price is the most reasonable.

501
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,440
Of course,

502
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,890
it is your choice to accept

503
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,370
or refuse.

504
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,640
I never buy or sell by force,

505
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,330
as it is not how I do business.

506
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:54,740
You...

507
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,640
To be honest,

508
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,680
even if I add

509
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,040
ten times the price,

510
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,450
I can't

511
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,970
save Free Unicorn from the disaster.

512
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,020
Even if your dad is god.

513
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:24,890
Hello, uncle.

514
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,550
What is it?

515
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,310
Tell me.

516
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,300
It's snowing.

517
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,670
Really?

518
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,560
How about

519
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,670
having hot pot tonight?

520
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:32,990
Sure.

521
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,470
It's so cold today.

522
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,710
I want hot milk tea.

523
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,070
Okay, let's go.

524
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,710
Let's go.

525
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,730
Brother.

526
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,160
