The only solution

192
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,610
is to find an OEM.

193
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,240
I think that's a good idea.

194

If we don't work with him,

203
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,240
then let me ask you,

204
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,760
can you find another partner to work with?

205
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,330

are you sincere?

317
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,490
I just don't want to miss my chance anymore.

326
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,990
explain everything.

What exactly is going on?

328
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,960
You two got married out of the blue

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,800
without even dating.

330
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,720
My relationship with Zhaoyang

331
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,930
is not out of the blue.

332
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,420
Don't worry.

333
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,100

Her name is Hai Lan.

She and Gao Yi

339
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,910
are the real childhood sweethearts.

340
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,170
During Gao Yi's most difficult time,

341
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,020
for him,

342
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,390
Hai Lan dropped out of school
and came to work in the city.

343
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,330
They got together

344
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,250
at that time.

345
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,170
Actually, I don't know

346
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,100
when their relationship started.

347
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,970
At that time,

348
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,200
after I knew about their relationship,

349
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,920
I was deluded

350
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,030
and even thought

351
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,710
that I was the best choice for Gao Yi.

352
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,600
But delusions are delusions after all.

353
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,810
Hai Lan...

354
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,270
I saw them last month.

355
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,780
She was with Gao Yi.

356
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,200
Hai Lan...

357
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,780
Over the years,

358
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,200
Gao Yi's heart has never once wavered.

359
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,800
So, you and I

360
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,330
have never attained

361
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,070
the significance we wanted

362
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,310
in Gao Yi's heart.

363
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:39,910
So,

364
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,520
you already knew.

365
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,200
Now I feel like

366
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,670
I've been a joke

367
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,600
all these years.

368
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:53,980
Zhaoyang.

369
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,330
Yang Jian loves you.

370
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,540
He has loved you for many years.

371
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,990
I believe you're well aware

372
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,990
of that too.

373
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,830
Yang is a good man.

374
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,050
I just want to say

375
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,680
that if you've really let go of Gao Yi,

376
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,220
then have a good life with Yang Jian.

377
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,960
I'll give you my best wishes.

378
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,960
Tell me.

379
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,950
What will Boss do in the future?

380
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,340
What do you mean?

381
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,020
The siblings became husband and wife

382
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,390
and the stepmother became his mother-in-law.

383
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,120
We are the most miserable ones.

384
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,760
From now on, do you think

385
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,710
we should call Zhaoyang

386
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,670
Sister-in-law?

387
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,770
You don't understand, do you?

388
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,910
That's right.

389
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,850
Just wipe the table in the room.

390
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,170
Mom is upstairs?

391
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,120
I'll go upstairs with you.

392
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,810
I'll talk to her alone.

393
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,160
There's no room for discussion.

394
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,490
Get a divorce right now!

395
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,900
Are you kidding me?

396
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,570
I can't believe

397
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,320
the daughter I've raised for over 20 years

398
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,800
would do this to me.

399
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,000
What are you thinking about

400
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,930
every day?

401
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,120
What am I thinking about?

402
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,140
I'm thinking about my daughter's wellbeing.

403
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,050
You're the problem.

404
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,380
Are you out of your mind?

405
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,340
I told you to be nicer and gentler

406
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,040
to Yang Jian

407
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,100
in hopes that he'll take good care of you,

408
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,960
and not that

409
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,790
you two would become a couple.

410
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,500
Now that you mention it,

411
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,980
you really do care for me.

412
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,250
Who else should I care for?

413
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,980
Do you think it was easy for me
to raise you throughout the years?

414
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,350
After your dad passed away,

415
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,460
I've been investing in stocks and funds

416
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,310
to support you!

417
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,460
Do you really regard me

418
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,590
as your daughter?

419
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,420
Am I not just

420
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,670
another stock or fund

421
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,560
you invested in

422
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,590
that'll pay you the interest when it matures,

423
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,470
to repay you

424
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,900
for giving birth to me?

425
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,010
Yes.

426
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,080
I admit

427
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,460
that after you started making money,

428
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,000
I did ask too much from you.

429
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,760
But as the saying goes,

430
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,010
raise your children well so that
they'll take care of you in old age.

431
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,210
Doesn't that apply here?

432
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,550
Besides,

433
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,980
it was not easy for me throughout the years.

434
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,200
When people bullied us

435
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,030
for being a single mother and a child without a father,

436
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,910
I gave my all to protect you.

437
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,560
Have you forgotten everything?

438
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,800
Now, I just hope

439
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,500
that you can get married

440
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,350
to someone better and rich.

441
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,540
Is that wrong?

442
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,610
Marry a better man?

443
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,480
Yes.

444
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,610
In the end, the person I married

445
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,110
is not a rich man.

446
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,510
He's not the person you want.

447
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,570
That's really why you're against it.

448
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,470
You...

449
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,310
You really underestimate me.

450
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,880
Although

451
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,990
I don't have much money now,

452
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,700
I'm savvy enough due to my life experiences.

453
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,010
Do you think I'm against this

454
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,580
because Yang Jian

455
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,640
is uneducated and runs an individual business

456
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,900
with just a small shop?

457
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,960
Have you forgotten

458
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,310
how Yang Jian's father

459
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,180
was like when he got drunk?

460
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,510
I'm worried that in 20 years,

461
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,640
Yang Jian will be like him.

462
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,080
What will you do then?

463
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,580
That's why I'm against it.

464
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,210
Do you get it?

465
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,990
Sweetie.

466
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,230
Listen to me.

467
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,960
Okay?

468
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,330
You're so stubborn.

469
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,760
I'm really sad.

470
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,440
Let's talk about what'll happen in 20 years

471
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,040
when the time comes.

472
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,570
Who knows? In 20 years,

473
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,320
I might become

474
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,660
like you now.

475
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,690
Then I'd be a good match with him if he turns out...

476
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,300
like his dad.

477
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,400
Zhaoyang.

478
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,630
I'm fine.

479
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,270
Do you regret it?

480
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,700
What about you?

481
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,970
Do you regret it?

482
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,750
Our relationship

483
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,290
will always be up to you.

484
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,650
I will do my best in everything

485
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,560
and wait until you accept me.

486
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,170
You haven't eaten, have you?

487
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,900
I'll make you a bowl of wontons.

488
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,220
Hello, Miss.

489
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,630
What are you looking for?

490
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,410
I want to pick a gift.

491
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,750
Is it for a friend or...

492
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,130
A wedding gift.

493
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,580
♫Twinkle, twinkle, little star♫

494
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,790
♫How I wonder what you are♫

495
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:32,390
♫Up above the world so high♫

496
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:36,880
♫Like a diamond in the sky♫

497
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,200
♫Twinkle, twinkle, little star♫

498
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,310
Okay.

499
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,730
That's all for today.

500
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,080
Hurry up

501
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,500
and go back to your wards.

502
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,050
Or your parents will be worried.

503
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,160
Okay.

504
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,460
Bye, Sister Hai Lan.

505
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,020
-Bye.
-Bye, Sister Hai Lan.

506
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,670
Jiang Hu?

507
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,150
Come in and have a seat.

508
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,480
You know me?

509
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,930
You've grown taller

510
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,240
and prettier.

511
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,850
I've seen you

512
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,080
when you were little.

513
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,860
Come in.

514
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,890
Have a seat.

515
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,170
I didn't expect that we already

516
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,130
knew about each other's existence back then.

517
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,060
I'm glad you came to see me.

518
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,430
I just didn't expect

519
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,530
that our first official meeting

520
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,900
would be under such circumstances...

521
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,490
and that I'd be in such a state.

522
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,500
I don't know what to say either.

523
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,130
I'm just here to give you a wedding gift.

524
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,490
I'll put

525
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,370
the flowers here.

526
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,180
The sunflower is my favorite flower.

527
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,720
Every day,

528
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,320
it blooms

529
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,820
towards the sun.

530
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,500
It exudes a sense of vitality

531
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,690
and energy.

532
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,070
Thank you, Jiang Hu.

533
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,360
About the matter

534
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,500
of Gao Yi and your family,

535
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,860
I know everything.

536
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,310
You hate Gao Yi, don’t you?

537
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,990
Maybe it’s inappropriate for me to say this.

538
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,430
You've experienced

539
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,510
such a big change,

540
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,390
so you won't necessarily be persuaded.

541
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,670
But I still want to beg you.

542
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,470
Don’t blame Gao Yi.

543
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,410
This is between

544
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,280
me and Gao Yi.

545
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,930
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

546
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:08,960
I know.

547
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,690
But there's a side of Gao Yi

548
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,820
that you don't know.

549
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,000
He's actually very kind.

550
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,790
I have terminal breast cancer.

551
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,490
But he still

552
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,520
insisted on holding a wedding for me

553
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,840
so that I could have a complete life.

554
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,380
I'm just here

555
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,840
to give you a wedding gift.

556
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:28,620
After all,

557
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,220
I was acquainted with Gao Yi.

558
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,000
But I really don’t want to know

559
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,820
any more

560
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,780
about him.

561
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,320
Gao Yi is actually really pitiful.

562
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,110
His father went to jail

563
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,400
when he was very young.

564
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,590
Soon after, his mother passed away.

565
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,740
I should leave now.

566
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,460
His father is sick now

567
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,120
and I'm like this too.

568
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,100
He has never felt

569
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,380
the warmth of a family.

570
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,860
Didn’t Gao Yi’s father

571
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,340
pass away a long time ago?

572
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,980
Ms. Hai.

573
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,000
It's time to go to the doctor

574
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,060
for your check-up.

575
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,950
Jiang Hu.

576
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,680
Trust me.

577
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,690
Gao Yi has his reasons

578
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,710
and his grudges.

579
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:30,590
Dad.

580
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,100
This weekend,

581
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,050
I'm getting married

582
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,830
with Hai Lan.

583
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,780
She lived in

584
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,390
the same neighborhood as us.

585
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,830
When I was young,

586
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,840
she often came to our house.

587
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,900
She has been with me all these years.

588
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,310
Do you remember?

589
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,490
Mar...

590
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,410
riage...

591
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,730
Marriage?

592
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,370
Good.

593
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,350
There'll be someone to take care of you.

594
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,770
Someone to take care of you.

595
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,300
Don't worry.

596
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,090
His father is sick now

597
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,640
and I'm like this too.

598
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,170
He has never felt

599
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,440
the warmth of a family.

600
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,660
What's wrong?

601
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,580
Nothing.

602
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,199
Here are all

603
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,480
the financial statements for this year.

604
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,239
Take a look.

605
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:18,610
If there's nothing wrong,

606
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,310
within a few days,

607
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,420
I'll personally head to Baoxing

608
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,420
to report to them.

609
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:27,770
Ms. Yue.

610
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:31,360
Thank you for your hard work during this period.

611
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,420
You're the one who suffered the most.

612
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,219
Teng Yue

613
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,590
has achieved the most splendid annual report

614
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,000
in 30 years thanks to you.

615
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,210
We should celebrate.

616
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,449
What's wrong?

617
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,690
It's something to be happy about.

618
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,050
You seem to have a lot on your mind.

619
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,290
Can I help you?

620
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:00,570
Do you know

621
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,530
the procedure of my dad's adoption of Gao Yi

622
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,470
back then?

623
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,770
His secretary handled it.

624
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,560
It's been many years since that person resigned

625
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,420
and they've settled down abroad.

626
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,470
Back then,

627
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,310
had Gao Yi’s parents

628
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,970
both passed away?

629
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,870
Why do you suddenly ask?

630
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:25,490
I remember

631
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,780
my dad told me

632
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,380
that when he adopted Gao Yi,

633
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,580
both his parents had passed away.

634
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,320
It happened so long ago.

635
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,690
And I think you should let go of

636
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,050
the matters about Gao Yi.

637
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,630
Well,

638
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,530
I'm just confused.

639
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,040
Because I heard

640
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,370
that Gao Yi’s father

641
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,360
is not dead.

642
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,500
You think it's strange too, right?

643
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,210
But back then,

644
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,240
why did Dad tell me

645
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,570
that his father is dead?

646
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,060
Ms. Yue.

647
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,550
Can you check it for me?

648
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,940
You really want to know?

649
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,220
Okay.

650
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,970
If it's important to you,

651
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,890
I can ask around for you.

652
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,350
Thank you, Ms. Yue.

653
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,670
Boss, what's wrong?

654
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:23,930
You've been ignoring me lately

655
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,190
whenever I talk to you.

656
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,240
Why aren't you active?

657
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,280
You don't like to play with me anymore?

658
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,560
It has a poor appetite recently.

659
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,090
It hasn't been eating much.

660
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,410
I have to make time

661
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,870
to take it to the hospital.

662
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,710
It's getting old.

663
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,570
It should get regular check-ups.

664
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,690
Why are you looking for me?

665
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,100
Let's take a walk.

666
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,870
I'm leaving.

667
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:47,790
Let's go.

668
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,270
Are you okay?

669
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,060
I'm fine.

670
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,910
I remember the first time

671
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,640
you came here to collect debts.

672
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,020
Teng Yue was

673
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,340
in ruins like the other

674
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,540
factories here.

675
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,730
At that time, I already knew

676
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,410
that you'd definitely succeed.

677
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:20,810
Yang.

678
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,670
Thank you.

679
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,890
It's not exaggerated

680
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,570
to say that

681
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,120
we have a life-and-death friendship, right?

682
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:28,730
Yes.

683
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,840
A life-and-death friendship.

684
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,670
You and Zhaoyang...

685
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,550
Do you also think

686
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,080
I'm not good enough for her?

687
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,280
You're a good catch for everyone.

688
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,440
Xiang Zhaoyang is blessed

689
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,500
to have you.

690
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,280
You're a woman after all.

691
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,120
You're good at comforting people.

Unlike me, I'll be frank with you.

693

Xu Si doesn't deserve you.

694

If he hears this,

695
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,150
he'll go crazy.

696
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,000
That fellow

697
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,590
is always so arrogant.

698
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,980
He acts like he's better than

699
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,100
everyone else.

700
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,700
He's just a little arrogant,

701
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,700
which makes people misunderstand.

702
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,990
Teng Yue's revival

703
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,840
owes a lot to him.

704
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,320
Also, he's actually

705
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,880
a very warm person inside.

706
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,890
But he just doesn't

show it

708
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,830
to others easily.

709

Fine.

As long as you think he's good.

711

In any case, if he dares to bully you,

712
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,300
just tell me.

713
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,300
I won't spare him.

I always think

717
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,250
that Teng Yue is

718
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,360
the thread of fate between you and Zhaoyang.

719
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,090
It brought you two even closer.

720

I even feel responsible for you two.

721

the acquisition of these three brands.

In the next stage,

we can speed things up.

Back then,

734
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,490
I thought Teng Yue was not worth investing in.

735

You can praise Simon alone.

The land on which Teng Yue sits

Simon wouldn't bear to give up this land.

764

It was only until

I saw Guanglei interacting with him

Yes.

Both companies have their own strengths.

So, we often work together

I'm unavailable on Saturday.

Nothing.

Is that true?

Yes.

Jiang Hu is still inexperienced in the market.

853
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,980

00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,520
what implications the mergers and acquisitions

855
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,830
in the market entail.

856
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,780
Have you reminded her about that?

857
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:16,550
Not yet.

858
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,580
Then, pardon me for being bold,

859
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,110
but what project is the cooperation

860
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,970
of Jingyang and Baoxing based on?

861
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:26,800
Aneda.
