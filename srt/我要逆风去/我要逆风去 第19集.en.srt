According to the information you provided,

00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,920
TT Media

7
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,030
didn't breach the contract

8
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,750
during their partnership

9
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,990
with you.

10
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,190
Also,

11
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,910
according to the contract agreement,

12
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,280
the business opportunities they supplied

13
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,160
also had a high compensation total.

14
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,390
To terminate the contract,

15
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,320
you'll have to compensate at least one million yuan.

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,840
Okay, I got it.

17
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,760
Lawyer Wang,

18
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,840
let me think about it.

19
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,400
I'll discuss it with you later.

20
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,730
Okay.

21
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,710

I don't need it.

26
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,070
You want to be a designer.

27
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,250
Now is not the time

28
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,470
to be willful.

29
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,850
If I can't be a designer now,

30
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,240
I can wait for a few more years if I must.

31
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,710
Won't you think it's a pity

32
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,970
to waste so many years?

33
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,710
Some people's time

34
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,960
are to be wasted.

35
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,190

TT Media's commision

37
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,800
or did Jiang Hu?

38
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,710
Jiang Hu.

39
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,570
I said I'll pay,

40
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,050
but she refused to take it.

41
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,710
Okay.

42
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,150
Eat something.

43
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,620

you don't have to keep coming here anymore.

46
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,980
Okay.

47
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,720

Thank you.

96
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,670
I took the initiative

97
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,230
to order a cup of coffee for you.

98
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,350
You still remember

99
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,910
that I like Mandheling coffee.

100
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,470
After all, we've been

101
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,860
business partners for years.

102
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,850
I realize

103
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,030
that I have been

104
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,940
clearly categorized

105
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,750
in your mind.

106
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,670
I can finally understand

107
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,240
Mei Shaowang's view of you.

108
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:35,710
What is it?

109
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,890
You act decisively.

110
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,550
You're calm to the point of heartlessness.

111
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,670
It doesn't sound

112
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,790
like a compliment.

113
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,110
Back in school,

114
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,590
I thought that people like you

115
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,490
were cool.

116
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,200
After dating, I realized

117
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,150
that dating someone

118
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,840
like you

119
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,970
is no different from not dating at all.

120
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,270
You separate each matter

121
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,909
more clearly than anyone else.

122
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,570
Are you complaining about me?

123
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,760
I don't dare to now.

124
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,030
Tell me.

125
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,490
What can I do for you, Boss?

126
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,670
Teng Yue plans to invite Xiang Zhaoyang

127
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,870
to be their designer.

128
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,800
Have they discussed

129
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,000
this matter with you?

130
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,740
Why do you care about such a small matter?

131
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,220
Both companies are within the range

132
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,620
of my post-investment service, after all.

133
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,090
You're too modest.

134
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,620
So your suggestion is...

135
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,710
Be lenient?

136
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,830
Do you want to be my boss

137
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,000
and handle this business matter

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,409
or do you want to chat with me

139
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,010
with your private identity?

140
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,110
It's work hours right now.

141
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,500
It's a business matter.

142
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,950
Okay, let me hear your suggestion.

143
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,520
You're the one who discovered Xiang Zhaoyang

144
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,120
and put her in the position.

145
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,110
Why is the current arrangement

146
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,140
completely different from before?

147
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,410
Xiang Zhaoyang

148
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,310
indeed has

149
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,630
the conditions

150
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,960
to develop into more commercial fields

151
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
as an influencer.

152
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:05,990
Moreover,

153
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,110
she really doesn't want to be an influencer.

154
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,190
Why don't you put her

155
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,720
where she's more valuable?

156
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,390
So you want me to terminate the contract with her

157
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,790
and let her go to Teng Yue?

158
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,800
I just want to remind you

159
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,990
that apart from traditional advertising

160
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,590
and livestream commissions,

161
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,110
you can also

162
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,170
build a deeper and more long-term

163
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,270
collaboration with the brands.

164
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,470
You mean

165
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,360
we are in charge of

166
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,710
creating influencers on the front-end.

167
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,510
Then we'll deliver them to a single brand

168
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,070
for long-term cooperation

169
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,870
and build the brand with them?

170
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,640
New methods need new cases.

171
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,630
No,

172
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,870
are you asking me to send her there for free

173
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,720
just to have a new case?

174
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,990
After the Shangchun Art Project

175
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,790
is completed,

176
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,230
Xiang Zhaoyang's popularity

177
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,980
should reach a higher level.

178
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,050
You'll have the upper hand

179
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,950
in negotiating with Teng Yue by then.

180
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,920
Plus, giving a quote,

181
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,890
bargaining,

182
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,230
and whether it's a good deal or not

183
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,990
will only be known after negotiating,

184
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,590
right?

185
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,230
It seems that my direction

186
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,960
has been wrong since the start.

187
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,320
To have Mr. Xu,

188
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,500
who either has physical or mental issues,

189

190
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,660
is not a popular influencer

191
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,710
but an heiress from a bankrupted family.

192
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,800
If you put half of your gossip skills

193
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,210
into your work,

194
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,230
TT Media would already be listed in the stock market.

195
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,470
You didn't deny it?

196
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,630
It must be true then.

197
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,190
I never thought this.

198
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,430
If you didn't,

199
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,230
then you can think more about it.

200
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,710
We need to push Zhang Wenshan

201
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,710
for their payment again.

202
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,430
It was delayed for two days last time.

203
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,410
I guess the final payment

204
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,830
will be delayed for even longer.

205
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,230
I've already pushed him.

206
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,730
Let me do it again.

207

Has the money from Fahe arrived?

208
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,200
They said they'll pay in a few days,

209
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,310
but they didn't give a specific date.

Are you kidding me?

Who said that?

214
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,560
Are you sure?

215
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,790
We have...

What's wrong?

223
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,000
How could it be unqualified?

224
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,130
They said our shoes aren't qualified.

225
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,260
No.

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,750

00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,510
will come first.

What's wrong?

234
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,070
Something didn't meet requirements.

235
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,890
One hormone-containing substance exceeded limits.

236

Keep an eye on this.

237
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,950
Okay, I got it.

238
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,110
Have you heard about Teng Yue's news?

I just heard.

You're still so calm after knowing it.

beaten to death now.

248
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,430
As an investor,

249
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,590
you should have confidence and patience

00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,190
for your prejudgment.

still catch their eye?

258
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,210
I hope it won't end

with Baoxing’s efforts being in vain.

260

hasn't officially announced anything yet,

269

many negative comments online.

Yes.

The Market Supervision Administration

280

received a report.

by the local Market Supervision Administration.

283
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,430
So this time,

284
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,470
they didn't just investigate Teng Yue.

285
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,110
Next Monday,

Liu Jun did it.

Do you know how much

347
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,560
this will affect Free Unicorn?

348
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,970
Teng Yue's shoes got inspected.

349
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,200
It has nothing to do with Free Unicorn.

350
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,270
You're wrong.

351
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,310
What do you mean

352
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,310
by "it has nothing to do with Free Unicorn"?

353
00:16:59,310 --> 00:16:59,880
My shoes

354
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,670
were made by your factory,

355
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,230
right?

356
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,920
You think my shoes will be fine

357
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,790
if Teng Yue's shoes have problems?

358
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,099
We both know that

359
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,470
Teng Yue and Free Unicorn

360
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,950
don't use the same suppliers.

361
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,510
Besides,

362
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,240
it can be proven with evidence.

363
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,230
Anyway, you got me into trouble.

364
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,460
What are you trying to say?

365
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,230
The legal department suggested

366
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,470
to ask you for compensation,

367
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,000
but with our relationship,

368
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,470
it's too hurtful to request compensation.

369
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,470
Instead, I'll deduct

370
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,400
a fine from the final payment.

371
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,260
It's just a show

372
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,670
for the Board of Directors.

373
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,580
Zhang Wenshan,

374
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,410
you're taking advantage of me.

375
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,190
I can only do this much to help you.

376
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,590
Pause the OEM orders

377
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,390
for now.

378
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,510
Let's talk after you solve

379
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,240
this crisis.

380
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,630
Jiang Hu is still too inexperienced.

381
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,190
She can't even do

382
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,230
such a simple task

383
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,690
as factory HR management.

384
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,910
It's not the time

385
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,510
to abandon any soldiers yet.

386
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,730
The general must be decisive

387
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,510
about soldiers who can't cross

388
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,670
to the other side.

389
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,470
Don't worry.

390
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,070
I've set up the bridge

391
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,810
for Teng Yue to cross over.

392
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,550
Now, we just need someone

393
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,480
who can put on a show on the bridge.

394
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,190
You mean

395
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,070
Jiang Hu can put on a good show?

396
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,510
Experience needs to be accumulated.

397
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,750
Plus, Teng Yue's current stage

398
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,640
of development is the perfect time

399
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,270
to take advantage

400
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,210
of her identity as the daughter of Jiang Qisheng,

401
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,710
the former King of Apparel.

402
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,040
This will be a good story

403
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,000
for the market.

404
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,330
As long as it doesn't affect

405
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,450
the final result.

406
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,430
It won't.

407
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,360
Try to give it to me next week.

408
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,540
That's all.

409
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,700
I'll leave you to it.

410
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,100
What's wrong?

411
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,650
Inform Teng Yue

412
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,480
that the next quarter's KPI,

413
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,890
especially the profit margin,

414
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,350
won't be reviewed for now.

415
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,430
Am I

416
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,540
too tired from work recently?

417
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,630
I'm hallucinating.

418
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,960
Must be hallucinating.

419
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,030
If Teng Yue wants to make a comeback,

420
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,230
they'll definitely increase

421
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,430
marketing expenses.

422
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,620
Also, Free Unicorn

423
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,650
has stopped

424
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,880
their OEM order.

425
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,300
It won't be easy for them.

426
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,670
You care too much about Teng Yue.

427
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,750
If Teng Yue can't achieve a goal,

428
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,500
Jiang Hu won't be able to do it,

429
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,410
even if I push her to her limit.

430
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,550
I won’t give the founders

431
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,160
an impossible KPI.

432
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,830
It's better to wait until the end of the year

433
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,150
and calculate it as a whole.

434
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,950
Right?

435
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,370
You don't have to explain to me, actually.

436
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,370
You don't have to.

437
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,690
I'm not explaining to you.

438
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,710
I'm trying to convince myself.

439
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,130
Convince yourself?

440
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,000
This is the last batch of shoes

441
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,390
to be destroyed.

442
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,480
It's 500 pairs in total.

443
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,750
There's no way

444
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,350
we can meet

445
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,270
the next quarter's KPI.

446
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,080
Think about it.

447
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,510
How can you explain to Mr. Xu?

448
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,510
Master Zhang,

449
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,790
Baoxing just notified me

450
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,480
that they canceled

451
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,000
this quarter's KPI review for Teng Yue.

452
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,130
They'll only look at the annual total.

453
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,280
Looks like Mr. Xu

454
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
gave us some help.

455
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,950
I don't even know

456
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,150
how to celebrate now.

457
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,790
About the KPI review,

458
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,510
thanks.

459
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,150
A verbal thanks doesn't count.

460
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,910
What should we do then, Boss?

461
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,370
Accompany me to a dinner tonight.

462
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,540
I can't.

463
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,840
I have a meeting at the factory tonight.

464
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,870
Your boss gave you an order.

465
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,670
There's no room for discussion.

466
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,320
Fine.

467
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,390
I'll be there in half an hour.

468
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,360
You're pretty good

469
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,010
at acting like the boss.

470
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,390
Don't forget to dress up.

471
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,180
Master Zhang,

472
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,270
reschedule tonight's meeting to tomorrow morning.

473
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,730
Help me inform the others.

474
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:16,930
Okay.

475
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,750
Are these your most formal clothes?

476
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,710
You should be satisfied.

477
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,190
This is

478
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,430
my only dress.

479
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,060
You know that

480
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,150
in order to pay for Teng Yue,

481
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:47,990
I sold all

482
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,190
of my decent clothes.

483
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,630
Your jacket

484
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,420
is pretty handsome.

485
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,420
I have good taste.

486
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,600
It depends on the person wearing it too.

487
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,130
Let's go.

488
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,830
What dinner is it tonight?

489
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,640
The attendees include

490
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,640
a reporter from the city's business newspaper,

491
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
some finance

492
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,150
and production field bloggers,

493
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,230
and

494
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,230
a host of a venture capital podcast.

495
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,350
Then,

496
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,950
am I

497
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,130
the only founder

498
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,390
attending with you?

499
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,880
You're the only one.

500
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,450
You have half an hour

501
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,650
to prepare mentally.

502
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,870
Think about what you should chat about

503
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,270
when you meet them later.

504
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,390
Thank you.

505
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,820
Ms. Yue.

506
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,920
Jiang Hu,

507
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,680
tonight's meeting was changed to tomorrow.

508
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,120
Do you have

509
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,100
some problem?

510
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,200
Where are you?

511
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,660
I've been looking for you.

512
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,870
No.

513
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,750
Xu Si and I

514
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,580
are going to a reporter's dinner

515
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,780
to chat with them

516
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,640
about Teng Yue's recent matters.

517
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,190
That's great of Xu Si.

518
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,660
Don't forget when you're interacting with him...

519
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,790
You know what I mean.

520
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,780
I understand.

521
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,290
Okay, go ahead.

522
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,230
What do you understand?

523
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,470
How to get along with the boss.

524
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,630
Jiang Hu,

525
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,780
when you're wooing a girl,

526
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,480
you must have

527
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,010
the most sincere attitude.

528
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,340
What do you think of my attitude?

529
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,220
Playing dumb

530
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,300
doesn't solve problems.

531
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,550
What?

532
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,880
Teng Yue already has

533
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,570
its own shoe last laboratory.

534
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,290
Just like in the 90s,

535
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,320
everything from design to the R&D and production

536
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,250
is all completed

537
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,340
in our own factory.

538
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,260
Many new brands

539
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,470
in the apparel and fashion industry

540
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,700
choose OEMs

541
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,980
and outsource

542
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,180
the parts that they don't understand

543
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,180
or aren't good at.

544
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,030
Then, why

545
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,060
did you choose from the start

546
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,440
to do the opposite?

547
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,140
Many people would think

548
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,450
that you must completely understand

549
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,900
an industry

550
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,370
before you work in it

551
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,840
and start to take action,

552
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,570
but that's practically impossible.

553
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,830
No one

554
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,170
can completely grasp

555
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,730
an industry in a short time.

556
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,900
If you

557
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
put all your time

558
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,920
on learning and preparation,

559
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,080
then the real action

560
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,230
will never happen.

561
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,890
So, I chose to work first

562
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,370
and learn and improve

563
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,860
in the process of working.

564
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,560
Ms. Jiang,

565
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,520
aren’t you afraid that the cost of mistakes

566
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,380
in this process would be too high?

567
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,150
When people do something

568
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,190
they've never

569
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,670
done before,

570
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,610
they always fear mistakes

571
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,270
and will repeatedly weigh the pros and cons,

572
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,590
but they often don't produce results.

573
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,820
Before I'm sure

574
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,920
which direction

575
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,810
I should run in,

576
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,740
I choose to start running first.

577
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,950
It's better than staying in one place.

578
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,860
What if you fall?

579
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,750
In the process of running,

580
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,600
I can't help falling

581
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
due to lack of experience or skills,

582
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,420
but I can only know

583
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,130
where the pits are by falling.

584
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,720
Just like this time,

585
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,550
we used

586
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,680
the wrong supplier.

587
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,540
I'm very apologetic

588
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,350
to the consumers for this.

589
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,840
I won't make

590
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,310
such a mistake again.

591
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,070
Now,

592
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,350
we've introduced a tracking system

593
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,940
so that consumers

594
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,190
can see clearly

595
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,590
who we are working with

596
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,470
and whether they are safe or not.

597
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,790
Yes. Generally speaking,

598
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,730
the problems faced by companies

599
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,820
in the early stages

600
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,280
are made up for

601
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,020
in the process of development.

602
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,710
Teng Yue

603
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,280
was founded in the 1920s.

604
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,410
It was originally

605
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,470
a branch factory of a rubber company.

606
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,780
Before making rubber-soled shoes,

607
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,650
they didn't have much experience in making shoes either.

608
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,050
It developed step by step

609
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,230
to gradually become a national brand.

[Xixingji E-commerce]

611
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,470
Hello, everyone.

612
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,230
I am Wu

613
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,780
from Xixingji E-commerce.

614
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,680
Teng Yue

615
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,510
indeed made a mistake this time.

616
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,400
We promise

617
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,970
we won't hide it,

make excuses,

619
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,440
or delay things.

620
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,120
From now on,

621
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,200
there won't be

622
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,940
another pair of Teng Yue shoes with problems

in the market.

our product

will have a comprehensive upgrade.

628

Within three months,

we will launch

By then,

632

I'll send you all a pair,

633
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,260

our shoes.

635
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:05,880
Who will design

636
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,450
the Revival series?

637
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,440
Well...

I'll keep you in suspense,

639
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,330
but I promise

our designer

I see.

Let me take a look.

Okay, I got it.

I'll check over here.

656
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,050
Okay.

657
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,520
Someone is having a wedding here.

No one knows us.

very well last time?

for us to put on airs anymore.

766

Consider me.

767
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,520
I can't consider now.

768
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,780
Can you go back first?

769
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:53,950
Okay.

770
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,650
I'll wait for your reply.
