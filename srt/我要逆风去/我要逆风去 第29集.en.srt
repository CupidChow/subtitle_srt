Failure is not necessarily a bad thing.

Today,

177
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,050
Jiang Hu has to be here.

178
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,660
I think I know

179
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,470
where she is.

180
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,090
Me too.

181
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,410
I'm gonna go find her

182
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,310
and take her back as soon as possible.

183
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,960
I'll leave you to it.

184
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,320
Okay. Okay.

185
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:04,920
Well,

186
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,980
we'll be waiting here.

187
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,430
Take her back as soon as possible.

188
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,770
Take a look, okay?

189
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,280
Teng...

190
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,940
Teng Yue's shoes.

191
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,830
Teng Yue's shoes.

192
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,630
Do you want to buy them?

193
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:21,700
Thank you.

194
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Thank you. Thank you.

195
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:31,860
Sorry.

196
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,640
I just remembered

197
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,720
today is your father's birthday.

198
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,760
It's already a great comfort

199
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,220
that someone still remembers it.

200
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,400
You know what?

201
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,750
When I just took over Teng Yue,

202
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,210
no one had faith in me.

203
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,640
Everyone advised me to give up.

204
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,410
I felt upset every day.

205
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,600
Only when I was here

206
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,850
could I calm down to think.

207
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,790
From now on,

208
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,260
Teng Yue will be different.

209
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,320
Running against the wind.

210
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,750
Beginning with Jiang Hu.

211
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,400
This is what my dad told me.

212
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,970
He always said

213
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,690
a girl

214
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,460
should live a carefree life.

215
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,980
But I think he also wanted to see

216
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,230
when I face challenges,

217
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,800
I can go against the wind

218
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,400
instead of retreating,

219
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,900
so that I will not disgrace him or the Jiang family.

220
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,490
You've already done a good job.

221
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,020
I will do better.

222
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,530
Let's go.

223
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,620

00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,710
You can rest in peace.

226
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,760
I will take good care of Jiang Hu.

227
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,430
Let's go.

Stand properly. Stand properly.

230
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:00,650
Come on.

231
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,610
Smile. Smile. Smile.

232
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,230
Good.

233
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,970
What's so attractive over there?

234
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,920
Ours is the most attractive.

235
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,070
We need to brace ourselves up.

236
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:13,860
Okay.

237
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,010
Brace ourselves up.

238
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:33,750
Mr. Zhang.

239
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,130
What do you think?

240
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,280
Jiang Hu can change her name into Jiang Lang.

241
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,050
She is at her wits' end.

242
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,080
Their event is so boring.

243
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,300
I overestimated her.

244
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,880
No matter how good the creativity is,

245
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,510
it's important to have enough budget.

It's already noon.

249
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,230
Are we...

250
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,900
going to do it or not?

251
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,369
Xu Si and Jiang Hu are on the way.

252
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,920
They'll be here soon.

253
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,369
Will it be too late?

254
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,270
Whether it's too late or not,

255
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,650
everything goes as planned.

256
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,040
Yes.

257
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:19,550
Okay.

to get ready.

260
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:23,930
Okay.

261
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,660
When do you plan

262
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,580
to tell me the answer to the riddle?

263
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,810
What do you mean?

264
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,150
The event.

you still have a trump card, right?

269
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,710
What's your purpose

270
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,830
of going to the Studio City?

271
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,440
You'll know soon.

272
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,840
So mysterious.

273
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:40,930
There are really more people

274

compared with this morning.

275
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,850
Of course.

276
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,620
Otherwise, I wouldn't have decided

277
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,850
to do it at this hour.

It's the perfect time to draw public attention.

692
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,110
She has already done a good job.

693
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:11,190
♫When we are upset♫

694
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,330
♫We feel lonely easily♫

695
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,720
♫I really wish those who understand me♫

696
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,850
♫Could comfort me and lend me a shoulder♫

697
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,490
Xu Si,

698
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:25,440
♫I'm so glad that we've had a tactic understanding all this time♫

699
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,780
as Jiang Hu's aunt,

700
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,210
I think I can call you that.

701
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,490
♫After going through the wind and making a turn, our hearts are still connected♫

702
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,060
Sure.

703
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,400
In my eyes,

704
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,340
she's still a child.

705
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,660
♫Just as usual♫

706
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,940
But she

707
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,990
is carrying a heavy burden.

708
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:36,860
♫The original dreams are firmly held in our hands♫

709
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,630
What she needs now

710
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,750
is someone

711
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,070
who can share the burden with her.

712
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,940
Do you understand what I mean?

713
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,980
♫If that's the place we desire to go the most♫

714
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,790
I'll always be by her side

715
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,360
♫How could we return halfway?♫

716
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:43,660
and accompany her.

717
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:49,150
♫We will definitely achieve our original dreams♫

718
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,090
♫Only by realizing true desires♫

719
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:57,890
♫Can we say we've been to the paradise♫

720
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:05,420
She sings so beautifully.

721
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,170
Join me.

722
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:08,800
Come on, Uncle.

723
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,510
Come on.

724
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,520
Come on, Master Zhang.

725
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,250
Come on. Let's sing together.

726
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,190
Come on. Let's sing together.

727
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:15,700
Come on.

728
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,080
♫When we are upset♫
