that you'd sell goods in tonight's livestream.

349
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,000
I never take livestreams where goods are sold.

350
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,470
Besides, you even do click farming.

351
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,900
You're cheating consumers.

352
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,070
Where did you come from?

353
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,140
Are you picking a fight?

354
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,210
I'm sorry.

355
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,700
I don't accept

356
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,920
the kind of livestream that is cheating.

357
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,990
I have my own rules for livestreams.

358
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,430
Are you questioning me?

359
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,190
Besides,

360
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,420
hosts shouldn't wear masks.

361
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,830
Should the audience

362
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,340
look at the products in my hands

363
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,280
or the mask on your face by then?

364
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,710
Replace her.

365
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,660
If you work with me,

366
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,730
you can't change the designated plan at will.

367
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,740
I don't care if she's wearing a mask or not.

368
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,860
You two must

369
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,960
livestream together.

370
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,940
Now that you've accepted the Free Unicorn's business activity,

371
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,910
you should consider for our brand whole-heartedly.

372
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,110
I've never met

You only have two options now.

Either livestream as planned,

or leave.

I'm the only top influencer, right?

379
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,300
Ms. Jiang, do you know

380
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,350
what's the impact to

381
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,790
the effect and sales of the livestream

382
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,100
if I leave?

383
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,820
Can you find anyone else now?

384
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,710
I don't know.

385
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,660
Because it doesn't matter at all.

386
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,960
In this world,

387
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,780
no one is irreplaceable.

388
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,790
Let's wait and see.

389
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,680
Since she's gone,

390
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,260
you don't have to stay here, either.

391
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:50,910
Hello?

392
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,040
Hello?

393
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,660
Everyone,

394
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,770
you've seen

395
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,980
what happened just now.

396
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,530
You should be very clear

397
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,830
about the sales of

398
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,340
Momo Sakura's livestream last night.

399
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,650
Her commission is

400
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,350
over ten percent.

401
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,090
I believe

402
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,540
this is the performance you want to achieve

403
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,980
even in your dreams.

404
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,300
But at this moment,

405
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,830
you must be thinking,

406
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,020
"I'm not a top influencer

407
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,900
like Momo Sakura.

408
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,300
I don't have that kind of chance."

409
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,090
That's because

410
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,060
before she became popular,

411
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,810
she seized

412
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,190
the opportunity you missed.

why Free Unicorn and Aneda

make it to trending topics together?

459

Is the influencer designer from Aneda

460
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,300
really that popular?

461
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,060

And she's quite manipulative.

Unless something unexpected happens,

494
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,770
Aneda will most probably fire you

00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,090
Don't you want it?

521
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,830
Everything I have today

522
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,210
was earned by myself.

523
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,150
And you

524
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,590
will be nobody

525
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,780
without your father.

526
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:04,830
Boss.

527
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,620
I guess she won't be in a good mood.

528
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,900
A bad mood

529
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,140
creates a good opportunity.

530
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,820
Didn't she just

531
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,390
create a good opportunity

532
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,800
among the boos and hisses today?

533
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,300
Yes, let's go.

534
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,390
Where are you going?

535
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,700
You go home.

536
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:24,990
Don't I need to wait for you?

537
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,700
Here's my chance.

538
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,640
♫Let the tides surge♫

539

544
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,460
Thank you.

545
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,540
Congratulations.

546
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,920
I saw the sales tonight.

547
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,520
They're going to exceed 50 million soon.

548
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,260
Congratulations to you, too.

549
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,370
The followers of your Weibo account

550
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,550
have exceeded 12 million, right?

551
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,980
The traffic you earned today

552
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,110
is the total amount of three months.

553
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,580
The data for the livestream tomorrow will hit a new record.

554
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,740
Thank you for guiding me, Ms. Jiang.

555
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:03,520
Come on.

556
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,230
Cheers to our win-win situation.

557
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,620
That illustrator

558
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,090
was also good at acting.

559
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,300
Her?

560
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,670
She was not acting.

561
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,910
It seems

562
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,060
we cooperated really well.

563
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,580
We have a tacit understanding between good friends.

564
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,140
Cheers.

565
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,450
We just cooperated well.

566
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,980
That's all.

567
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,680
I'll be off now.

568
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,710
Suit yourself.

569
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,850
You could remove her mask,

570
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,270
but you shouldn't have slapped her in the face.

571
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,900

We've met before.

582
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,510
What a cheesy pickup line.

583
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,020
I don't have time for you.

584
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,660
Let me put it another way.

585
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,060
The daughter of the boss of Free Unicorn, Jiang Hu,

586
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,030
and the influencer host Momo Sakura

587
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,880
performed a play in which the influencer refused to livestream

588
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,860
in Teng Yue's workshop

589
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,140
this afternoon.

590
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,610
It went on quite a few charts of trending searches.

591
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,740
Amazing.

592
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,540
You're so good at acting.

593
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,060
Are you interested in being an actress?

594
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,070
Can you say something new?

595
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,300
It's already very effective.

596
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,580
At least I've got your attention.

597
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,050
What do you want?

598
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,720

00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,120

What's the bet?

658
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,700
If I win,

659
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,620
don't ever

660
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,000

Don't you know anything?

668
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,560
Should the audience

669
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,980
look at the products in my hands

670
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,000
or the mask on your face by then?

671
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,860
In this world,

672
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,660
no one is irreplaceable.

673
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,180
Since she's gone,

674
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,620
you don't have to stay here, either.

675
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,420
That's right.

676
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,680
You're absolutely right.

677
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,900
But this time,

678
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,410
the appearance fee

679
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,900
should be more.

680
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,300
I...

681
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,460
Daughter. Daughter!

682

683
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,660
I've taken another business activity

684
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,260
for you.

685
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,510
What kind of attitude is that?

686
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,780
Why didn't you say hello to me?

687
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,810
