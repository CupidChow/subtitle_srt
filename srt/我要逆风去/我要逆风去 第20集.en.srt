I tried everything I could when I talked to the Board of Directors.

7
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,440
They agreed

8
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,880
to give you one last chance

this matter

12
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,000
has caused a decline in trust

toward Free Unicorn and Teng Yue.

I've already taken care of everything.

And this matter

16
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,690
didn't cause Free Unicorn

any negative influence.

18
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,770
Jiang Hu, you should know

that the consumers don't think so.

20
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,150
You have to take responsibility.

Fine.

65
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,040
are increasingly more interested

What are you trying to say?

What Teng Yue wants to do

69
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,080
is to create Chinese-style products

70
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,830
to continue

71
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,780
the current national trend of our national culture.

72
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,680
And Xiang Zhaoyang

73
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,480
is the most suitable candidate.

to be Teng Yue's designer.

76
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,800
Only by making a qualitative breakthrough

77
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,040
with our products

78
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,480
can we get rid of all the constraints

the response on overseas platforms

87

96
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,830
Shangchun Art Project has also invested a lot

97
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,220
in this collaboration.

102
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,230
the bottle art you drew for them

00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,830
in their promotional video.

104
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,710
Zhaoyang.

105
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,970
You're quite good

106
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,230
at design indeed.

107
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,110
A few days ago, Shangchun Art Project's

108
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,000
stock market was sluggish.

109
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,350
Just after working with an influencer once,

110
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,230
it had a boom?

111
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,710
According to this trend,

112
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,590
I estimate

113
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,190
that the limit up price will be increased soon.

114
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:52,840
I think an increase in the limit up price

115
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,700
is pretty good.

116
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,710
For other healthcare companies,

117
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,670
it's a good thing.

118
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,880
But not necessarily for Shangchun Art Project.

119
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,760
In the past two years,

120
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,590
the couple who founded the company haven't been getting along.

121
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,600
The company has been poorly managed internally.

122
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,670
And the launch of their new products

123
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,150
has been continually postponed.

124
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,910
There's no need to mention profit.

125
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,710
Do you mean

126
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,270
to investigate

127
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,350
the other shareholders' backgrounds

128
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,160
apart from the founders

129
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,140
Hua Wenhai and Cao Jing?

130
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,180
Okay.

131
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,200
Hello.

132
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,120
Are you free tonight?

133
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,120
For a date?

134
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,680
Let me make it clear.

135
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,470
This meal is not a date.

136
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,330
Then what is it?

137
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,670
A meeting.

138
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,360
What meeting?

139
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,710
Shangchun Art Project's

140
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,310
stocks have been surging these days.

141
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,350
Is it temporary

142
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,410
or will it last for a while?

143
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,710
You pay so much attention to Shangchun Art Project

144
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,640
because of Xiang Zhaoyang, right?

145
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,520
Does this business cooperation of hers

146
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,380
have anything to do with Baoxing?

147
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,870
Why do you ask?

148
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,170
Behind any abnormal

149
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,350
stock price fluctuation,

150
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,470
there must be some unusual

151
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,400
business moves.

152
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,670
How much

153
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,470
will this affect her?

154
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,490
What do you think?

155
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,190
If it's

156
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,230
her market influence

157
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,000
that caused a natural fluctuation in stock prices,

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,400
then there'll be a further premium

159
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,830
on her market value in the future.

160
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,170
I'm afraid it'll be too high for me to afford her.

161
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,100
If it's not a natural fluctuation,

162
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,700
with her personality,

163
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,160
I don't think she'll agree

164
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,620
with your company's game.

165
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,500
I'm getting a little jealous of Xiang Zhaoyang.

166
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,680
You asked me out today

167
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,950
just for her.

168
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,910
You even did such a thorough analysis of me.

169
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,790
Shangchun Art Project's

170
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,850
recent stock fluctuation

171
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,910
is only temporary.

172
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,750
It won't last long.

173
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,220
I see.

174
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,310
Thank you.

175
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,640

Let's talk about something personal.

177
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,090
Have you made up your mind?

178
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,010
Mr. Xu, sorry.

179
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,590
Mr. Xu?

180
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,940
Sorry?

181
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,720
If I did something

182
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,380
that made you misunderstand,

183
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,730
it's all my fault.

184
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,930
What are you talking about?

185
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,700
I said I wanted to pursue you.

186
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,750
So there's no need

187
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,520
to put up a front between you and me.

188
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,770
Take some time to consider me.

189
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,420
Xu Si.

190
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,830
If I

191
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,870
said or did

192
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,980
something to you,

193
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,710
I'll apologize first.

194
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,640
â™«The moon has replaced the sunsetâ™«

195
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,350
It's all my fault.

196
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,320
â™«The Milky Way twinkles in the night skyâ™«

197
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:57,900
That's it?

198
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:04,210
â™«Flowers sleep soundly on leavesâ™«

199
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,470
You're

200
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,360
not someone who doesn't own up to your actions.

201
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,230
Just treat me as someone

202
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,240
who doesn't own up to my actions.

203
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,690
â™«My expectation is like a teddy bearâ™«

204
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,250
What do you mean?

205
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,780
â™«Whose dream is it in?â™«

206
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,350
Are you rejecting me?

207
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,380
You're my boss.

208
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,190
â™«My heart seems to flutter againâ™«

209
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:16,890
That's it.

210
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,470
No.

211
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,900
â™«Unconsciouslyâ™«

212
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,180
It's all my fault.

213
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,120
I gave you the wrong idea.

214
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,810
â™«My breathing becomes ragged under your touchâ™«

215
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,290
But we're both adults.

216
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,510
For such matters,

â™«Three lines of poemâ™«

218

222
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,170
Have you finished your meeting?

223
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,460
Are you ready to order?

224
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,380
One Hong Kong milk tea, large,

225
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,050
â™«We stare blankly togetherâ™«

226
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,760
with two portions of sugar.

00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,070
â™«The stars fall downâ™«

229
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,460
Okay.

â™«You're the moonlightâ™«

231

â™«Expectingâ™«

â™«Which flows into my heartâ™«

250
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,100
The marriage flower?

251
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,180
â™«We stare blankly togetherâ™«

252

â™«The stars fall downâ™«

Let's go.

266
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,630
I think there's no problem.

267
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:06,960
Yeah.

268
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,590
They introduced us to this.

269
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,590
It must be fine.

270
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,150
I heard that this kind...

271
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,190
I'll be rich.

Yes.

Time for breakfast.

Breakfast is ready.

Where is my toothpaste?

279
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,270
You ran out of toothpaste.

280
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,550
I bought you a new one.

She's here.

Don't worry. What's wrong?

Mom.

My dear daughter.

291
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,050
You've made a fortune.

292
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,310
Why didn't you tell me?

293
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,240
Mom.

294
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,120
Are you daydreaming again?

00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,340
No.

296
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,040
I met Lili's mom this morning.

297
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,190
You borrowed money from her again?

298
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:57,590
No.

299
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,350
I promised you I wouldn't.

300
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,870
Lili's mom told me

301
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,830
that

302
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,350
the cosmetics products you're advertising for,

303
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,360
Shangchun something...

304
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,710
Its stock price increased from 4.1 yuan

305
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,930
all the way to

306
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,860
8.9 yuan.

307
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,790
Why didn't you tell me?

308
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,600
What?

309
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,630
Mom.

310
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,960
You'd better not touch stocks.

311
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,990
You're not destined to strike it rich.

312
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,310
Just be resigned to your fate and work hard.

313
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,710
Both of you didn't buy it?

314
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,830
What fools!

315
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,040
The wallet fell

316
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,470
right in front of you.

317
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,320
You just had to bend down and pick it up.

318
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,720
You...

319
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,630
Seriously.

320
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,890
Lili's mom

321
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,100
picked this wallet up

322
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,140
at 3.9 yuan.

323
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,190
Mom.

324
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,730
Is the rise really that high?

325
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,870
Yes.

326
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,910
From what I heard from an insider

327
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,410
who knows the stock market,

328
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,650
do you know?

329
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,550
Thanks to

330
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,750
your advertisements,

331
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,830
what's that called...

332
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,470
The official term is

333
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,340
influencer concept stocks.

334
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,070
Now,

335
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,190
all concept stocks from collaborations

336
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:55,710
with influencers

337
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,360
are going up.

338
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,730
With this...

339
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,710
All right. Enough.

340
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,230
I can't talk with you anymore.

341
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:01,710
I...

342
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,870
I need to use my personal savings

343
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,140
to buy some stocks.

344
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,020
I'll have to queue up if I delay it any further.

345
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,460
Wait, take it easy.

346
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,600
Just buy a little.

347
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,400
Don't put all your money in this.

348
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,230
What's wrong?

349
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,350
Although I don't know much about stocks,

350
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,350
I always feel like something is off.

351
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,780
What's off?

352
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,230
Aren't you working with them

353
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,110
for their advertising?

354
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,070
Now that the stocks have risen,

355
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,270
isn't it a good thing?

356
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,480
Last week,

357
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,990
Xu Si had a meeting with Song Zhi

358
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,860
about this.

359
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,590
He even asked Song Zhi

360
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,190
to closely observe the rise and fall

361
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,240
of the stocks.

362
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,550
Why do I feel like

363
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,430
Xu Si

364
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,690
is hiding something?

365
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,400
I'm going to the company.

366
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,290
Wait, eat your breakfast first.

367
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,870
Iâ€™ll drive you there.

368
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:09,900
[Baoxing Investment]

369
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,079
Shangchun Art Project

370
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,400
has just issued an announcement.

371
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,930
The actual controllers of their company,

372
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,010
Chairman Hua Wenhai

373
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,470
and shareholder Cao Jing,

374
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,410
have divorced.

375
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:19,960
After the separation,

376
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,390
their shares will account for

377
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,710
19.34% of the total shares

378
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,220
of the company.

379
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:25,200
Also, Hua Wenhai

380
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,560
and other shareholders of the company,

381
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,579
Zhang Jiong and five others,

382
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,310
signed the voting rights agreement.

383
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,060
So,

384
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,150
he is still

385
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,460
the actual controller of the company.

386
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,100
But the most interesting thing is

387
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,190
that in both

388
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,380
Fangpei Shares

389
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,730
and Heshan Technology,

390
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,980
this guy surnamed Zhang is holding shares

391
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,040
on behalf of Mr. Du.

392
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,610
Actually, Mr. Du has personally

393
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,400
invested in a lot of companies.

394
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,590
It's normal that he has a lot of shares

395
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,120
in other listed companies.

396
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,260
Shangchun Art Project's stock price

397
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:50,950
has reached

398
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,790
its highest point in the past two years.

399
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,050
If nothing goes wrong,

400
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,080
the rise will stop today.

401
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,870
And then?

402
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,590
Ms. Song, bad news.

403
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,510
Shangchun Art Project's stock price

404
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,710
has dropped rapidly.

405
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,440
My 50,000 yuan

406
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,510
is gone just like that?

407
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,230
Where can we return it?

408
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,550
How can it be gone?

409
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,820
I was still waiting for it to make me a fortune.

410
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,100
In just five minutes,

411
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,730
it fell right to the bottom.

412
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,770
You only invested 50,000 yuan.

413
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,260
I invested 300,000 yuan.

414
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,540
In a blink of an eye,

415
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,760
it's gone.

416
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,870
What should I do?

417
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,360
Shangchun Art Project...

418
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,900
That Zhou Suqing.

419
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,230
They got me into trouble again.

420
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,820
They are all bad guys.

421
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,110
I think we should find them.

422
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,200
My life is still better than yours.

423
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,610
Even God

424
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,720
helped a beautiful woman like me.

425
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,300
It's Zhou Suqing again.

426
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,780
They got me into trouble.

427
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,500
What are you talking about?

428
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,940
What did you say?

429
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,500
Can you say something nice?

430
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,250
You deserve it this time.

431
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,410
Bless me.

432
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,660
You don't look like

433
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,120
you're here

434
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,850
specially to play golf with me.

435
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,630
I'm here to consult you, Mr. Du.

436
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,710
About...

437
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,140
Shangchun Art Project?

438
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,490
First, you used internal equity adjustment

439
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,230
and reduced the influence the costly divorce case would have had

440
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,340
on the stock price.

441
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,480
Then you used

442
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,550
the influencer concept stocks to increase the stock price.

443
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,480
So, what's next?

444
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,140
What's your plan with Hua Wenhai

445
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,700
for Shangchun Art Project?

446
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,330
My plan...

447
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,450
is similar to what you're thinking.

448
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,880
Hua Wenhai and his wife have been dragging on

449
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
their divorce for nearly two years.

450
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,230
It had a great impact on the development

451
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,630
of Sangchun Art Project.

452
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,750
It's better to rip off the band-aid.

453
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,040
Letting them get what

454
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,030
each of them want

455
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,180
and ending the internal strife as soon as possible

456
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,730
is the most

457
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,800
efficient method for the company

458
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,530
to resume regular operations.

459
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,740
But

460
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,450
the market reputation of TT Media

461
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,310
will not be so favorable.

462
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,320
The stock price fluctuation

463
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,050
is too great.

464
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,380
This little loss

465
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,790
is not worth mentioning

466
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,060
in the face of profit.

467
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,940
This is a consensus of the smart people

468
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,540
involved in this situation.

469
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,290
Xu Si.

470
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,850
Seize the opportunity

471
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,800
that is about to pass.

472
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,970
Letting the most important person

473
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,340
get the maximum benefit

474
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,430
is the best-case scenario.

475
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,560
Is there no turning back

476
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,000
with the current situation?

477
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,940
Focus on the direction.

478
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,150
When you hit the ball,

479
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,640
it'll never come back.

480
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,510
Mr. Du.

481
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,430
The direction I'm aim for

482
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,760
is to allow everyone in the situation

483
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,690
to win together.

484
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,720
This is my principle

485
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,180
as an investor.

486
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,160
Since

487
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,900
Baoxing invested in these three companies,

488
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,700
only when everyone is doing well

489
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,990
can Baoxing be better.

490
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,380
When we worked with Shangchun Art Project,

491
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,350
you never told me

492
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,590
that it'd be so risky.

493
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,350
This is not the direction I want.

494
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,820
What happened now

495
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,870
is completely beyond

496
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,670
my knowledge.

497
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,390
Zhaoyang.

498
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,680
You're too sensitive.

499
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,500
The client's stock price

500
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,850
has nothing to do with you.

501
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,330
Don't worry about it.

502
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,990
Still, I can't be a tool to be used

503
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,230
in the games of the stock market.

504
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,420
Although I don't know how to invest in stocks,

505
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,250
I think this steep rise and fall

506
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,420
has

507
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,480
already affected many people.

508
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,110
Why do you care so much

509
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,980
about others?

510
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,720
Right now, things are at the height

511
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,450
of the storm.

512
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,200
There is a lot good and bad news.

513
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,380
When things blow over,

514
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,030
everything will be peaceful again.

515
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,590
Just like the last ordeal,

516
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,940
now, no one mentions

517
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,870
your family background anymore,

518
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,500
no?

519
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,480
Although I admit

520
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,210
that I'm in this line of work for money,

521
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,200
I won't make money

522
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,530
through illicit means.

523
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,230
Zhaoyang.

524
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,400
Are you blaming us and Baoxing

525
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,800
for making you go against your principles?

526
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,740
Maybe this is

527
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,110
what this industry is about.

528
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,910
Harvesting traffic dividends.

529
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,240
I think

530
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,120
I'm not suitable for it.

531
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,280
What do you mean?

532
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,670
You want to terminate the contract?

533
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,550
You should know

534
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,510
that you are heading to the peak of your career.

535
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,230
Your business resources

536
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,960
are the best brands.

537
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,520
Your quotation is also of top-tier standard.

538
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:39,750
Song Zhi.

539
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,200
You

540
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,980
are my first agent.

541
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,770
Maybe

542
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,040
you'd be my only one too.

543
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,240
I'm grateful

544
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,910
for all your help.

545
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,200
You're giving up a successful path

546
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,070
that can become even more successful

547
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,770
to take a tough path

548
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,750
where the future is uncertain.

549
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,430
I feel bad for you.

550
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,400
You don't have to feel bad for me.

551
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,070
I have to

552
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,210
walk my own path.

553
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,430
It seems that Jiang Hu's evaluation of you

554
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,390
and the direction

555
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,690
you set for yourself

556
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,080
is quite consistent.

557
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,990
She talked about me with you?

558
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,060
Ms. Song.

559
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,730
Big Bird's interview is about to begin.

560
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:21,990
We're waiting for you.

561
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:22,870
Zhaoyang.

562
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,480
Please reconsider carefully.

563
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,560
We'll talk later.

564
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,220
It's in this factory

565
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,570
that you two started

566
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,480
Shangchun Art Project's business.

567
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,990
In 2006,

568
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,830
when no one dared to venture into group buying,

569
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,210
the flagship shop of your ace product,

570
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,680
Huajian Baini,

571
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,410
ventured into group buying as soon as it was listed,

572
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,250
and the sales

573
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,520
was ten times that of Korean products.

574
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,230
The sales in a quarter

575
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,360
exceeded 1 million.

576
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,710
In less than five years,

577
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,080
your IPO was successful.

578
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,150
In the history of A-shares,

579
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,410
you became one of the capital operation cases

580
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,070
with the fastest IPO process.

581
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,760
It was also one of the first

582
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,560
e-commerce brands to be listed.

583
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,160
I think both of you can't forget those years

584
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,820
you've spent creating your business together.

585
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,200
For the past decade,

586
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,440
I have only five words.

587
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,030
Unbearable to look back at.

588
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,780
So, Mr. Xu,

589
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,360
just get to the point.

590
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,730
From 2006 to now,

591
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,790
Shangchun Art Project's reputation

592
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,230
as the top national cosmetics brand

593
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,360
wasn't easy to come.

594
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,230
I suppose you two wouldn't want to see

595
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:47,990
the brand

596
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,610
you created by dedicating your entire youth to

597
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,940
be burned to the ground.

598
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,510
Xu Si.

599
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,310
You made it sound too serious.

600
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,680
Too serious.

601
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,000
You two have worked together

602
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,390
for over ten years.

603
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,760
If it's just for the pleasure

604
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,530
of earning a lot of money today,

605
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,050
I can help you

606
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,110
expedite this.

607
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,260
Let's let go

608
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,870
of the past together

609
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,110
and give Shangchun Art Project

610
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,130
a grand funeral.

611
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,330
Sorry.

612
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,060
I failed to protect the painting for you.

613
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,510
This afternoon,

614
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,270
a dozen stockholders gathered here.

615
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,230
Even the security couldn't stop them.

616
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,830
There was almost a conflict.

617
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,830
But don't worry.

618
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,070
The Marketing Department

619
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,510
has made an emergency plan

620
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,040
for this sudden situation.

621
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,300
For the time being,

622
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,080
try to stay at home as much as possible.

623
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,140
Let's wait until things settle down.

624
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,820
I caused you trouble.

625
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,680
I'm sorry.

626
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,770
Why are you sorry?

627
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,940
It's not your fault.

628
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,910
All the chaos and losses

629
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,130
were caused by me.

630
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,850
How could it not be my fault?

631
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,710
You must remember

632
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,650
that you mustn't always take on

633
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,390
the responsibilities of others.

634
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,340
In this situation,

635
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:23,870
you need to learn

636
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,330
to reduce your own burden.

637
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,380
Excuse me.

638
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:31,950
Hello?

639
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,610
Okay.

640
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,790
I'll go back now.

641
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,130
What's wrong?

642
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,000
Something urgent came up at home.

643
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,780
I have to go.

644
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,510
Is it serious?

645
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,430
Do you need my help?

646
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,030
It's okay.

647
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,790
Let me call a taxi for you.

648
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,130
No, I can do it myself.

649
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,300
Okay.

650
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,190
When you get home,

651
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,290
remember to give me a text.

652
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,020
I'm leaving.

653
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,150
Go ahead.

654
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:56,730
Okay.

655
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,070
At home?

656
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,080
Hasnâ€™t Gao Yiâ€™s parentsâ€¦

657
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,510
[Iâ€™ll be home soon. Get some rest.]

658
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,140
How unlucky.

659
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:31,750
I'm sorry.

660
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,560
My car broke down again.

661
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,820
What bad luck.

662
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,300
Well...

663
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,300
I'm really sorry.

664
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:38,900
It's okay.

665
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,770
How about I pay you first?

666
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,980
Well, out of 18 yuan,

667
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,350
I'll charge you 10 yuan.

668
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,280
Thank you.

669
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,750
Okay.

670
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,190
Got it.

671
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,030
Thank you.

672
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,710
Thank you.

673
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,470
Thank you for understanding.

674
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,130
No problem.

675
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,970
Who's it at this late hour?

676
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Hello, Zhaoyang.

677
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,790
Hello, Yang Jian.

678
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,650
I think I'm being tailed.

679
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:33,630
What?

680
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,920
Where are you? I'm on my way now.

681
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,060
Where's my car?

682
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,350
Go away!

683
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:22,860
Zhaoyang.

684
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,300
Zhaoyang, it's me.

685
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,630
It's me.

686
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,560
Yang Jian.

687
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,910
Stop chasing.

688
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,340
It's my fault.

689
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,440
I was careless.

690
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,210
I should have

691
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:22,920
noticed this beforehand.

692
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,050
It's not your fault.

693
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,550
Finish your shower. Don't catch a cold.

694
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,120
Let's go.

695
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,790
Come on.

696
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,470
Zhaoyang.

697
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,140
Don't bother.

698
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,080
I'm going back.

699
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,060
The water is ready.

700
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,390
Hurry and take a shower.

701
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,470
What are you waiting for?

702
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,270
Take a shower.

703
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,510
Zhaoyang.

704
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,910
Zhaoyang.

705
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,780
Is there a towel I can use?

706
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,830
Hold on.

707
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,810
Here. You can use this.

708
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:42,800
How about I come in and give it to you?

709
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,690
No, no, no.

710
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,420
I-I can

711
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,480
g-get it myself.

712
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:19,900
Did you get it?

713
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,000
Well, push it forward

714
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,720
a little bit more.

715
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,410
Okay.

716
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,580
Watch your hand.

717
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,590
Done.

718
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,020
I-I can do it myself.

719
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,020
I can do it myself.

720
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,410
L-Let me do it.

721
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,790
This...

722
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,180
Do I need to apply this?

723
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,080
Wait, this is...

724
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,740
Don't move.

725
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,730
Can't you stop fighting?

726
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,490
Is it so hard to be good in school?

727
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,030
Unlike you,

728
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,240
I'm not good at studying at all.

729
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,920
You have to think highly of yourself

730
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,890
if you don't want others to look down on you.

731
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,150
Turn your face around.

732
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,530
The other side.

733
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,410
You can wear this, right?

734
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,640
Okay.

735
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,500
Why don't you try it on?

736
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,050
A-Anything is fine.
