00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,910
My dad once worked at Cloud Footwear?

6
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,550
He really didn't tell you?

7
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,380
After he came back from the production team in the countryside,

8
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,550
his first job

9
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,030
was a salesman of Cloud Footwear.

10
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,190
Really?

11
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,750
Really?

12
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,490
The horse is still here.

13
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,150
It just doesn't move forward.

14
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,590
People who made shoes know

15
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,060
non-slip rubber soles

16
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,669
were rare.

17
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,470
Whoever made it first

18
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,990
could get the upper hand in the market.

19
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,990
When I told your dad

20
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,960
about these methods,

21
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,990
I hadn't filed a patent application.

22
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,829
Mr. Ye,

23
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,380
stop talking.

24
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
I'm not gonna stop.

25
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,590
Two years later,

26
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,590
Teng Yue

27
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,390
launched cloth shoes

28
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,450
with rubber soles.

29
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,760
Soon,

30
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,730
he married the factory director's daughter.

31
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,590
And the patent became Teng Yue's.

32
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,130
If this wasn't theft, what was it?

33
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,550
No, it was a robbery.

34
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,100
I'm not done yet.

35
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,000
See if you dare to come again.

36
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,850
Du Botao from Baoxing Investment

37
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,950
wants to see her.

38
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,540
Then go see her.

39
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,340
Jiang Hu refused everyone's WeChat messages

40
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,470
and calls,

41
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,790
except yours.

42
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,920
I think it's Xu Si who wants to see her.

43
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,670
This has nothing

44
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,740
to do with Xu Si.

45
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,270
It's what Du Botao wants.

46
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,829
If Xu Si and Jiang Hu

47
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,230
keep being in a stalemate,

48
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,760
it won't do anyone any good.

49
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,670
Since

50
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,270
both of them

51
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,060
can't talk rationally,

52
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,720
why don't we let him try?

53
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,390
No matter what Jiang Hu asks for,

54
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,490
he can consider it carefully.

55
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,390
But

56
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,890
Jiang Hu needs to say it first.

57
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:38,890
Otherwise,

58
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,520
he can't help us even if he wants to.

59
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,440
Jiang Hu is no longer a kid.

60
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,550
Even if she keeps hiding,

61
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,670
can she avoid

62
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,530
the fact that Teng Yue has been acquired?

63
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,840
Ask Jiang Hu.

64
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,070
It's up to her

65
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,570
whether she wants to meet him or not.

66
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,480
Du Botao wants to see you.

67
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,500
Ms. Jiang,

68
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,030
it's not easy to see you.

69
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,510
I'm gonna get straight to the point.

70
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,930
You have done what you should do.

71
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,320
Don't misinterpret

72
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,180
the definition of "getting straight to the point".

73
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,110
Indeed.

74
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,030
The cooperation between Baoxing and Aneda

75
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,040
is on track.

76
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,670
It won't be changed

77
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,750
because of anyone.

78
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,590
Then do whatever you want.

79
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,990
Why are you here to see me?

80
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,360
My reason for coming to see you is simple.

81
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,150
I hope you can face reality.

82
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,720
To maximize

83
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,990
the benefits for you

84
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,880
and everyone,

85
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,010
we need you

86
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,210
to cooperate with us.

87
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,710
On what?

88
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,790
First,

89
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,470
you need to apologize and explain

90
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,670
your extreme behavior

91
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,150
at Teng Yue's 100th anniversary celebration.

92
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,830
Second,

93
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,380
you need to promote the two companies'

94
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,270
merger.

95
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,150
Last,

96
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,810
leave Teng Yue.

97
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,030
Is this what Xu Si wants?

98
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,550
As long as he has a bit of senses left,

99
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,940
he won't object to it.

100
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,370
I'm sure you know this too.

101
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,150
Aneda agreed

102
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,150
to keep you in Teng Yue

103
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,610
after acquiring Teng Yue.

104
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,030
But you broke the tranquility yourself

105
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,860
with your extreme behavior.

106
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,170
What if I disagree?

107
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,550
Considering where we are,

108
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,550
your opinion doesn't matter,

109
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,150
Ms. Jiang.

110
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,040
You can't just

111
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,390
take away my stakes in Teng Yue

112
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,790
just because you want to.

113
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,030
You're right.

114
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,710
But you can't

115
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,150
stop Aneda from dismissing Teng Yue's employees

116
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:37,670
after

117
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,800
acquiring Teng Yue.

118
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,990
After all,

119
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,830
the land where Teng Yue is

120
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,760
will be sold to Yuanfeng Logistics

121
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,990
in the near future.

122
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,480
After Aneda

123
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,360
completes its acquisition of Teng Yue,

124
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,350
whether it will

125
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,220
keep all the production lines and employees

126
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,830
in its own production park

127
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,230
or dismiss everyone

128
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:57,909
is not something

129
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:58,830
you can

130
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,670
decide.

131
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,840
It depends

132
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,920
on your attitude and behavior today.

133
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,780
Ms. Jiang, I think

134
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,470
I have made advantages and disadvantages very clear

135
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,550
today.

136
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,270
I believe you're a smart person.

137
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,210
You will make the right choice.

138
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,400
Right?

139
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,030
But you can't

140
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,390
stop Aneda from dismissing Teng Yue's employees

141
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:43,909
after

142
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,110
acquiring Teng Yue.

143
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,150
After all,

144
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,140
the land where Teng Yue is

145
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,070
will be sold to Yuanfeng Logistics

146
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,710
in the near future.

147
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,110
After your dad came back from the production team in the countryside,

148
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,270
his first job

149
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,720
was a salesman of Cloud Footwear.

150
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,550
People who made shoes know

151
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,100
non-slip rubber soles

152
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,590
were rare.

153
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,400
Whoever made it first

154
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,900
could get the upper hand in the market.

155
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,250
You have deviated from the route.

156
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,110
A new route has been found for you.

157
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,280
Please turn around

158
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,370
at the right place.

159
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,520
You knelt in front of me

160
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,530
and begged me

161
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,350
to take all the responsibility,

162
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:40,510
so that you can help me handle the problems

163
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,820
and take care of my family.

164
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,830
Free Unicorn is playing capital games.

165
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,960
Jiang Qisheng and Shen Gui

166
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,000
have colluded with each other.

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,730
That's right. They've colluded with each other.

168
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,190
Boss,

169
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,970
Mr. Mei has been asking

170
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,450
when you will have a meeting

171
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,010
with Ms. Tang.

172
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,890
After I finish the ongoing projects.

173
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:32,830
Okay.

174
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,310
One more thing.

175
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,110
Teng Yue

176
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,430
hasn't submitted its daily work report

177
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,590
for days.

178
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,480
No one knows

179
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,520
where Jiang Hu is.

180
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,320
Pei Zhiyuan asked me in private

181
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,350
if you two are together.

182
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,620
No.

183
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,980
She is wilful.

184
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,330
Actually, I think...

185
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,750
Hello?

186
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,210
What are you doing?

187
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,130
Fine.

188
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,140
You...

189
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,830
You are in a temper.

190
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,510
Go on a vacation to relax

191
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,830
and rest for a few days.

192
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,680
When you rest well and feel better,

193
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,250
come back

194
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,830
to the factory immediately.

195
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,830
There are a lot of things

196
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,470
waiting to be handled by you.

197
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:39,760
Alright?

198
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,690
You...

199
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,900
What are you doing?

200
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,230
You're not going on a vacation.

201
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,890
Are you... Are you moving out?

202
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:51,870
You...

203
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,110
You want to...

204
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,640
You want to move out of here?

205
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,370
Why are you doing this?

206
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,710
Why are you so serious,

207
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,710
huh?

208
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,190
Finally, Teng Yue

209
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:06,980
is about

210
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,000
to achieve better development soon.

211
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,870
And we can make

212
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,830
a lot of money.

213
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,470
Why do you...

214
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,800
want to leave suddenly?

215
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,640
Uncle,

216
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,580
after I leave today,

217
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,990
my journey in Teng Yue

218
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,830
will be over.

219
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,830
Over?

220
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,450
Well, you...

221
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,360
you want to cut ties

222
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,430
with Teng Yue?

223
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,650
Are you going to leave this place?

224
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,130
Well,

225
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,130
are you blaming someone?

226
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,830
Teng Yue is about to achieve better development soon.

227
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,120
Well...

228
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,820
We will make

229
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,060
a lot of money soon.

230
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,110
Why... Why are you

231
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,090
leaving suddenly?

232
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,350
You won't understand.

233
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,590
Well.

234
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,070
Fine.

235
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:46,880
Then...

236
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,720
can you tell me

237
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,870
something that I understand?

238
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,650
Tell me.

239
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,430
Why do you insist on leaving?

240
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,410
Jiang Hu.

241
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,330
Are you really leaving?

242
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,760
I have no choice.

243
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,630
I always thought

244
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,780
you just...

245
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,220
I thought your goal was to make Teng Yue bigger.

246
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,280
-Enough.
-Then we…

247
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,090
It's useless to say anything now.

248
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,350
But congratulations.

249
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,830
You can finally go back to Aneda

250
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,290
proudly.

251
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,750
Jiang Hu.

252
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,370
This

253
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,830
is not like you at all.

254
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,910
People change.

255
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,130
Jiang Hu.

256
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,350
Ms. Jiang,

257
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,490
can you not leave?

258
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,540
You saw it.

259
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,350
Look.

260
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,830
If you don't want to sell Teng Yue,

261
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,940
don't sell it.

262
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,470
We're all on your side.

263
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,300
Yes.

264
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,990
Yes, we're with you.

265
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,560
We're with you.

266
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,150
Don't go.

267
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,590
Thank you.

268
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,420
Thank you for your support and care

269
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,410
in the past year.

270
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,390
It was

271
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,430
really not easy

272
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,590
for you guys.

273
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,830
Actually, I really

274
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,360
don't want to part with you.

275
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,990
We don't want to part with you either.

276
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,440
Teng Yue can't lose you.

277
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,110
Stay.

278
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,750
Don't worry.

279
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,830
When I settle down,

280
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,820
I'll come back to see you

281
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,590
and treat you to dinner.

282
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,230
Okay?

283
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,610
No.

284
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,470
We'll go with you.

285
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,920
Yes, we'll go with you.

286
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,100
Listen to me.

287
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,440
Teng Yue can lose me,

288
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,869
but it can't lose you.

289
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,550
Understand?

290
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,270
Bye.

291
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,630
-Ms. Jiang.
-Ms. Jiang.

292
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,470
Ms. Jiang.

293
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,190
Can you not leave?

294
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,200
Jiang Hu!

295
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,850
Why didn't you reply to my messages

296
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,170
or answer my calls?

297
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,350
I just want to rest for a few days.

298
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,270
Have you made up your mind?

299
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,080
In fact, this ending has been predetermined

300
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,670
since the beginning.

301
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,390
What I want is different from what you want.

302
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,840
I lost.

303
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,330
I've decided to let go of Teng Yue.

304
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,390
I know

305
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,390
you must feel wronged in your heart.

306
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,430
What you did

307
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,160
is a reasonable business plan,

308
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,230
but I ruined it.

309
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,570
You want to be in a good relationship,

310
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,070
but there are

311
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,800
so many problems for no reason.

312
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,710
So I give in.

313
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,190
I've decided

314
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,670
to let go of Teng Yue.

315
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,910
As for us,

316
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,300
we're over.

317
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,290
Let go.

318
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,250
Let go!

00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,870
how Jiang Hu felt.

521
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,840
Then your feeling now is...

522
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,150
In terms of the age structure

523
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,750
of the management

524
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,090
of Teng Yue,

525
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,280
they are indeed old.

526
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:55,510
She hired old people

527
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,840
who are about to retire.

528
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,380
But you are an exception.

529
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,730
They are the reason

530
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,510
why Teng Yue has made its current achievement.

531
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,530
Maybe

532
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,170
except Jiang Hu,

533
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,430
no one has the right

534
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,780
to decide

535
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,670
Teng Yue's future.

536
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,590
Mr. Pei.

537
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,800
Designer Xiang.

538
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,070
Master Xiang.

539
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,190
Have you heard

540
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,120
our factory will

541
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,460
have a new managing director?

542
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,550
A new managing director?

543
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,800
Didn't Xu Si tell you?

544
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,340
He just asked me to prepare a new office

545
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,940
in the factory.

546
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,390
He said it's for the new managing director,

547
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,230
who will

548
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,050
take office tomorrow.

549
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,990
Well... Look what he...

550
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,470
he... is doing.

551
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,820
What does he want?

552
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,590
Does he want to discard us?

553
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,840
Well... Jiang Hu just left,

554
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,460
and he...

555
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,920
he wants to replace

556
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,950
the old workers.

557
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,270
Do you think he...

558
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,440
I'm going to ask him.

559
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,400
Do... Do you need me to go with you?

560
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,070
Mr. Xu.

561
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:07,990
Mr. Xu.

562
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,590
I heard

563
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,910
you have hired a new managing director.

564
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:13,710
Yes.

565
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,990
He will take office tomorrow.

566
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,900
He will attend the regular meeting at 10:00.

567
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,030
What about Jiang Hu?

568
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,360
Emotionally,

569
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,150
Teng Yue can't lose Jiang Hu.

570
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,580
But now, Teng Yue

571
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,160
needs a managing director.

572
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,430
The person I hired is named Shi Jialun.

573
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,560
He has a background of e-commerce

574
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,220
and has operated shoe brands.

575
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,620
After he takes office,

576
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,990
his e-commerce team

577
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,120
will do a work handover with Yang Jian.

578
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,610
I hope you have a pleasant collaboration.

579
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,200
No.

580
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,740
We must wait for Jiang Hu.

581
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,390
We can wait for Jiang Hu,

582
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,280
but Teng Yue can't.

583
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,010
Soon,

584
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,070
Teng Yue will be moved

585
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,990
to a new factory.

586
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,330
This is a new stage.

587
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,320
It needs more orderly management.

588
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,130
Jiang Hu is sentimental.

589
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:06,830
Why did she

590
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,159
fall in love with you, a cold-blooded man?

591
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,670
Yeah.

592
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,090
Why did she fall in love with me?

593
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,920
Jiang Hu,

594
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,550
you really look like a villain.

595
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,730
You really have the guts to come.

596
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,210
Let me tell you the truth.

597
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,469
Cloud Footwear

598
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,469
is actively

599
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,050
recruiting salesmen.

600
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,460
I will never hire you.

601
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,850
Just give up.

602
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,739
I want to be hired by Cloud Footwear.

603
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,889
You decide my salary.

604
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:50,150
I decide my position.

605
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,989
What kind of attitude is that?

606
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,320
You are quite arrogant.

607
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,969
Without me, Cloud Footwear

608
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:56,370
can never prosper again.

609
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,900
How arrogant!

610
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,980
Is it

611
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,160
up to you?

612
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,240
Yes, it's up to me.

613
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,900
Considering Cloud Footwear's current situation,

614
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,630
you are in urgent need of someone who can drive the market

615
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,200
and brand influence.

616
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,640
And in the current talent market,

617
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,310
no one will give Cloud Footwear

618
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,760
a better offer

619
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,780
than me.

620
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,630
Well,

621
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,680
should I

622
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,990
thank

623
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,330
you?

624
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,280
You're welcome.

625
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,880
It's a deal then.

626
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,940
What are you

627
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,210
talking about?

628
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,090
Did I agree?

629
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,150
Didn't you just

630
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,390
thank me for joining the company?

631
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:33,790
You...

632
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,360
You...

633
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,510
You

634
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,990
are really...

635
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:38,980
Fine.

636
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,090
You're better than your dad.

637
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,770
I never said that.

638
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,550
You did.

639
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,610
I heard it.

640
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,280
Don't misunderstand me.

641
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,310
Okay?

642
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,830
But now, except me,

643
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,590
no one

644
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,870
on the same level as me

645
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,960
will come to your factory to apply for a job.

646
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,870
Mr. Ye,

647
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,630
if you don't hire me,

648
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,470
it'll be the negligence of you, the factory director.

649
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,070
It's irresponsible for Cloud Footwear.

650
00:35:59,070 --> 00:35:59,510
Stop.

651
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,270
Stop. Stop.

652
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,840
That's even more ridiculous.

653
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,770
You just want to work here, right?

654
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,850
How about this?

655
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,950
Sell a batch of shoes first.

656
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,330
And we'll talk about it later.

657
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,880
Okay. How many pairs do you want me to sell?

658
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,910
Sell 30,000 pairs

659
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,810
within a month.

660
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,270
You are serious

661
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,350
this time, right?

662
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,470
This makes me seem a bit unkind.

663
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,540
Let's not make it 30 days.

664
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,700
Let's make it 50 days.

665
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,760
If you sell 30,000 pairs of shoes within 50 days,

666
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,960
you can work here.

667
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,270
Okay.

668
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,060
Okay.

669
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,190
A word spoken

670
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,830
is an arrow let fly.

671
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,000
I hope we have a happy collaboration.

672
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,380
Okay.

673
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,500
That's all

674
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,550
I want to say today.

675
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,040
Please support me.

676
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,510
I hope we can cooperate happily

677
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,620
in the future.

678
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,710
Thank you.

679
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,130
I hope you can make Teng Yue

680
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,250
be normal

681
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,490
as before.

682
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,350
Dismiss.

683

[Building 100-Year Foundation]

684
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,620
What is this?

685
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,260
The payment for 30,000 pairs of shoes.

686
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,440
Youjia and Baihui Shoes

687
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,340
will come

688
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,870
to pick up the goods tomorrow morning.

689
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,510
One ordered 16,000 pairs,

690
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,750
and the other ordered 14,000 pairs.

691
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,410
That's 30,000 pairs in total.

692
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,150
I've already given the orders

to the Sales Department.

00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:19,910
If you don't believe me,

695
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:20,830
you can ask the financial staff

696
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,830
to come to verify it.

697
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,070
Or you can call the bank.

698
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:23,750
It's up to you.

699
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,540
Wait.

700
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,350
I said 50 days.

701
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,680
And you have sold

702
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,950
30,000 pairs of shoes

703
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,270
within just less than half a day?

704
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,080
Is there a problem?

705
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,710
Well,

706
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,210
when things go awry, there must be a reason.

707
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,440
When a person behaves abnormally,

708
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,030
there must be a hidden agenda.

709
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,700
What's so unusual about this?

710
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,430
These two companies

711
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,160
cooperated well with Teng Yue.

712
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,620
It's not difficult

713
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,860
for me

714
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,520
to ask them to buy those shoes.

715
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
What do you think?

716
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,550
Now, do you think

717
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,310
Cloud Footwear

718
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,190
really needs me

719
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,870
as the marketing director?

720
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,830
What?

721
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,470
The marketing director?

722
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,670
Yes.

723
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,180
We... We had a deal.

724
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,550
Well,

725
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,760
I decide your salary.

726
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,250
You decide the position.

727
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,400
No problem.

728
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,290
I was careless.

729
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,590
I was careless.

730
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,880
Why did I neglect

731
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,960
she just left Teng Yue

732
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,890
and she still has

733
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,040
connections with a few distributors?

734
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,400
I was careless.

735
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,060
Then... should we still hire her?

736
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,090
When

737
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,970
it comes to her,

738
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,190
I can't go back on my word.

739
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,820
A word spoken is an arrow let fly.

740
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,250
Right.

741
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,470
When she came this afternoon

742
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,470
to deliver the cheque,

743
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,500
she asked us

744
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,790
how much marketing budget we have left this year.

745
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,050
This is also a problem.

746
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,270
She is Jiang Qisheng's daughter.

747
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,470
She is used to spending money lavishly.

748
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:03,910
Well,

749
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,320
you keep an eye on her

750
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,590
financial transactions.

751
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,190
Okay.

752
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:08,870
In addition,

753
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,130
you need...

754
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:10,950
to keep an eye on

755
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,300
the key

756
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,850
of the technical R&D office.

757
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,060
We can't let her

758
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,890
approach our technical core.

759
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,130
Sir,

760
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,760
you are so wary of her.

761
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,190
Why did you even hire her?

762
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,000
To increase our workload?

763
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,400
I failed to keep her out.

764
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,490
The internal defense

765
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,230
must be very strong.

766
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,670
Okay.

767
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,760
-Very strong.
-Very strong.

768
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,220
Well...

769
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:56,360
♫Come back when the sea becomes calm again♫

770
