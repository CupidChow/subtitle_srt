162
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,990

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,830
next, next month,

179
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,370
and every month after that.

180
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,000
Where will you get the money?

181
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,140
Are you really

182
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,650
going to risk everything?

183
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,970
Jiang Hu?

184
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,830
Jiang Hu?

185
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,000
Where's the person in charge?

186
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,740
The jinx is here again.

187
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:06,990
You...

188
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,120
Hide first.

189
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,290
Hide first.

190
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,510
Hide.

191
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,640
Go and hide.

192
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,100
You...

193
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,260
Who are you?

194
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,400
We're looking for Jiang Hu.

195
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,540
Jiang Hu?

196
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,490
She...

197
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,370
She's abroad.

198
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,550
She's abroad.

199
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,010
Why did you point back there if she's abroad?

200
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,720
Do you think I'm stupid?

201
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,120
She just bought Teng Yue.

202
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,920
Hurry up and have Ms. Jiang come out.

203
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,300
It's true.

204
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,990
You came at a bad time.

205
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,410
She really went abroad.

206
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,120
You're not good at lying,

207
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,630
bro.

208
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,470
Come here.

209
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,610
Let me tell you.

210
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,450
she really went abroad.

211
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:13,850
You...

212
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,640
Hey—

213
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,030
Isn't she here?

214
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,220
I heard

215
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,990
you just spent five million

216
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:29,990
to buy Teng Yue.

217
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,380
That's right.

218
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,990
Okay.

219
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,230
Since you have money,

220
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,110
how about you

221
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,340
pay off our debt too?

222
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,830
I don't have money right now.

223
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,350
That doesn't sound right.

224
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,230
Why does the Jiang family

225
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,350
all go back on their words?

226
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,110
Back then, your dad also—

227
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,040
You have no right to mention my dad.

228
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,790
Ms. Jiang,

229
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,830
we always

230
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,700
try to be polite.

231
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,310
I've given you

232
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,190
enough respect and time.

233
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,990
Don't take my kindness for granted.

234
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,760
I said

235
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,990
I don't have money right now.

236
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,000
What do you want?

237
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,580
Go!

238
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,110
Are you trying to default on the debt?

239
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,110
Don't test me.

240
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,110
I have 100 ways

241
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,440
to make you regret this.

242
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,150
Boss,

243
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:56,510
come.

244
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,190
Listen.

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,940
When you go in,

246
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,280
bite all of them,

247
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,040
other than Jiang Hu.

248
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,840
Bite them all.

249
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,190
Eat...

250
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,120
No,

251
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,310
you have high blood sugar.

252
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,060
Eating this will give you high blood sugar.

253
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,500
Go.

254
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,360
Go bite them.

255
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,870
Go.

256
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,540
I'm not trying to default on the debt.

257
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,710
It's that you're asking for money in the wrong way.

258
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,040
You're quite arrogant.

259
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,990
Bite, bite, bite.

260
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,490
Sit.

261
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,160
Everyone, sit.

262
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,590
Having you all stand while I sit

263
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,110
is not the way to treat guests.

264
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,990
Also, craning my neck

265
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,870
to look at you all

266
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,670
is too tiring.

267
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,350
Speak.

268
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,340
The creditor has the right to require the debtor

269
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,470
to follow the contract

270
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,830
or the law

271
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,070
to fulfill the obligation.

272
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,200
I don't understand these legal terms.

273
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,370
Who does Teng Yue owe money to?

274
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,470
I will pay

275
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,180
without missing a single cent.

276
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,690
Good.

277
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,560
Then, go get the money.

278
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,710
There's no hurry.

279
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,440
Are you playing with me?

280
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,160
According to the rules,

281
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,790
you have to show me the supply contract.

282
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,900
The purchase order

283
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,500
or credit terms are fine too.

284
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,210
You said that Teng Yue owes money,

285
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,680
so show me the evidence.

286
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,710
How much do we owe?

287
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,990
I'll pay you back

288
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,710
every cent.

289
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,350
Ms. Jiang,

290
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,350
are you kidding me?

291
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,990
Don't tell me you don't know

292
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,790
why they didn't sign a contract,

293
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,630
didn't want a purchase order

294
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,630
or credit IOU.

295
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,350
If it weren't for them being reasonable,

296
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,220
having a low price,

297
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,470
and being willing to let you get the goods first and pay later,

298
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,270
they'd never get this business.

299
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,810
You took advantage of them

300
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,830
and now,

301
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,690
you're asking them for evidence.

302
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,200
Is that moral?

303
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,690
Give me three days.

304
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,310
I need to check all the accounts.

305
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,040
Fine.

306
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,120
I'll give you three days.

307
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,900
Everyone,

308
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,160
the most shocking thing

309
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,109
is not that Free Unicorn's distributor

310
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,240
bought Free Unicorn.

311
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,490
Instead, it's that the former heiress of Free Unicorn

312
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,660
bought Teng Yue.

313
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,630
What is this for?

314
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,770
If you don't get it, then that's normal.

315
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,119
I'm confused too.

316
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,230
The daughter of Jiang Qisheng

317
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,260
gave up on inheriting Free Unicorn

318
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,859
in order to avoid inheriting

319
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,069
the huge debt.

320
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,260
I understand that.

321
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,589
But then, she spent all her money

322
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,670
and bought

323
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,109
the half-dead Teng Yue.

324
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,300
This is crazy.

325
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,470
Back then, I invested in TT Media

326
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,470
because Ms. Song

327
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,870
was your ex-girlfriend.

328
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,470
I didn't expect that you'd be

329
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,990
even stricter than me

330
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,850
as soon as you came into position.

331
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,920
You're so unbiased.

332
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,570
How about this?

333
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,990
I'll quickly draft

334
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,120
an ex-girlfriend list.

335
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,470
Hope you can generously empty your wallet for them.

336
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,710
I'm just...

337
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,240
I was just kidding.

338
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,710
Anyway, Ms. Song

339
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,440
indeed found the right person.

340
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,950
Do you have

341
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,610
other livestream resources?

342
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,070
Only good post-investment service

343
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,870
can increase

344
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,530
the success rate of quitting.

345
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,760
But I didn't expect it.

346
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,470
Didn't expect what?

347
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:21,870
I didn't expect

348
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,910
that Ms. Jiang's speed of ruining herself

349
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,170
is surprisingly fast.

350
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,750
She could've done anything with that money.

351
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,930
She could even start from scratch

352
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,660
and open another shoe factory.

353
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,030
Rationality is the basic requirement

354
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,270
for investors.

355
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,910
The reality is

356
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,910
that she no longer has an advantage,

357
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,380
while her rationality

358
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,580
is still where it was

359
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,650
before Jiang Qisheng died.

360
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,570
What do you mean?

361
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,030
She's gone mad.

362
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,450
You didn't consider

363
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,270
reality at all

364
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,630
for your actions.

365
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,510
You can't even protect yourself

366
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,390
right now.

367
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,470
Why are you caring so much about them?

368
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,150
Anyway,

369
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,390
they don't have that contract anyway.

370
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:09,870
Right?

371
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,440
Even the court

372
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,930
and police can't do anything to you.

373
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,860
What can they do?

374
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,080
At most,

375
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,430
they'll just vent their anger.

376
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:17,970
Take some paint

377
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,250
and pour it here.

378
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,150
What are you afraid of?

379
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,220
Uncle,

380
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,200
just follow my instructions

381
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,510
and check the accounts.

382
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,990
Just ignore them.

383
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,710
I'm telling you to ignore them,

384
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,170
so just ignore them, okay?

385
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,380
I told you.

386
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,200
Let's do it.

387
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,950
Okay.

388
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,920
I'll listen to you.

389
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,160
I'm not your dad.

390
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,510
I can't control you.

391
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,230
Fine.

392
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,490
I need to find Yue Shan

393
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,230
and finish

394
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,690
the rest of the paperwork.

395
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,950
As for the money...

396
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,910
I, I...

397
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,970
I don't have any.

398
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,100
I've put them all into the stock market.

399
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,750
I'm not asking you for money.

400
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,620
That's good.

401
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,880
I'm terrified when talking about money.

402
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,670
Uncle,

403
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,130
you’re Teng Yue's factory director.

404
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,840
You make me speechless.

405
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,600
Find some time in the coming days

406
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,060
to find a factory

407
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,020
with a suitable price and location.

408
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,880
I'll figure out the money matter.

409
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,310
Alright.

410
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,740
You don't need me anymore.

411
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,440
That's all.

412
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:19,880
I'm leaving.

413
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,380
We're at the bottom already.

414
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,580
Why are you still looking for a factory?

415
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,230
A factory for what?

416
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,350
After paying

417
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,740
for the bid for Teng Yue,

418
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,650
your account

419
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,430
only has 6,730 yuan left.

420
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,020
Don't you think

421
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,770
your action was too impulsive?

422
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,950
I already did it.

423
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,930
I got the text too,

424
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,920
so you don't have to remind me

425
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,520
what these four numbers are.

426
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,120
Your sports car has been towed away.

427
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,440
The house you live in now

428
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,430
has to be emptied

429
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,150
in three days too.

430
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,670
I know that too.

431
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,820
Move in with me.

432
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,110
We can take care of each other.

433
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,230
No need.

434
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,070
I have a place to stay.

435
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,950
Use this card

436
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,620
for now.

437
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,170
It can be emergency aid.

438
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,380
Take it.

439
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,310
If your dad knew about

440
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,710
your current situation,

441
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,090
he'd be sad.

442
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,710
Why are you so stubborn?

443
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,270
Ms. Yue,

444
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,290
my dad has already passed away.

445
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,830
You don't have to pretend

446
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,290
to be so kind to me anymore.

447
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,130
I know you don't like me.

448
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
How would you feel

449
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,560
if someone kept wanting

450
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,850
to be your stepmom?

451
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,300
I'm not the third party

452
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,350
and I didn't destroy your family.

453
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,950
That doesn't mean

454
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,970
that I have to accept

455
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,170
every woman who has feelings for my dad.

456
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,840
You have done your part

457
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,410
for Free Unicorn and my dad.

458
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,810
You've done your job.

459
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,070
I'll take care of Teng Yue

460
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,780
by myself.

461
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,710
Wait.

462
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,540
Take the card.

463
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,300
Mr. Xu.

464
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,650
Baoxing

465
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,220
has given us a lot of support.

466
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,390
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

467
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,790
We will try our best

468
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,130
to reach the goal for user growth.

469
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:18,460
Okay?

470
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,100
No problem.

471
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,050
I'll wait for your proposal.

472
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,750
See you next time.

473
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,510
Okay.

474
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,720
Liu, see everyone off.

475
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,470
Okay, Mr. Xu.

476
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,070
This way, please.
Thank you.

477
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,100
You joined Baoxing?

478
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,140
The land under Teng Yue

479
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,900
is yours now.

480
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,880
Since we've met,

481
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,680
then let's make things clear

482
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,880
between the two of us.

483
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,870
It will save our time effectively.

484
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,310
Speak.

485
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,760
How many days will you give me?

486
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,360
I'll move.

487
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,270
Internally, we planned for

488
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,870
before the end of the month.

489
00:23:58,890 --> 00:23:59,690
Okay, I got it.

490
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,790
Get in.

491
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,170
Let me give you a ride.

492
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,520
No need.

493
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,640
It's hard for you to get a taxi at this hour.

494
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,240
It's okay.

495
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,360
I have time.

496
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:55,940
What you're wasting now

497
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,220
is not only your time,

498
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,510
but also mine.

499
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,590
Huazhou Junting neighborhood, thank you.

500
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,380
You're really treating me as your driver.

501
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,510
Please fasten your seat belt.

502
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,350
We'll depart right away.

503
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,920
You were fired by Aneda,

504
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,440
right?

505
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,550
Tang Ya is truly

506
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,240
a cold-blooded demoness.

507
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,250
I've seen your designs

508
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,150
and also

509
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,350
your videos on Weibo.

510
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,440
You really like designing

511
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,510
and your usage of traditional elements

512
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,510
is very creative.

513
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,010
However, your agreement with Aneda

514
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,760
is in the way.

515
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,830
Other companies in the industry can't hire you.

516
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,290
Then why did you ask me to come here?

517
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,120
We are all designers, right?

518
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,230
This is an independent studio.

519
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,890
For designs, we pay per piece.

520
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,780
So, what you mean is

521
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,650
you want me to do private work

522
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,910
with your studio.

523
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:24,990
Smart.

524
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,230
As long as your designs

525
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,690

00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,390
You look even prettier in person.

700
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,290
Qiandai, the female sportswear brand

701
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,620
that Mr. Fang represents,

702
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,800
is planning a sales promotion

703
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,130
for 618 Sales this year.

704
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,910
He hopes to work with you.

705
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,140
Four hours.

706
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,800
Fifty thousand yuan for service fee

707
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,320
and 20% commission.

708
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:46,910
Yes.

709
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,570
This will be your debut livestream

710
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,580
with your face shown.

711
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,310
I will definitely pay you well.

712
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,310
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

713
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:54,900
Come,

714
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,600
have a seat.

715
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:57,890
Come,

716
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,580
have a seat.

717
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:58,900
Sit.

718
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,480
Have some water.

719
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,440
Have some water.

720
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:02,990
Thank you.

721
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:03,920
Have some water.

722
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,010
You've worked hard.

723
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,210
It's okay. Thank you.

724
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,860
Here.

725
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,870
This is

726
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,900
our proposal.

727
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:25,710
Okay.

728
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,580
Have a look.

729
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,000
Okay.

730
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,180
How many e-commerce platforms

731
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,550
have signed strategic agreements

732
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,320
with you so far?

733
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,120
Five so far,

734
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,600
but our biggest advantage

735
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,630
is that there are many

736
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,460
clothing, shoe, and hat production bases

737
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,260
and some food factories nearby.

738
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,740
There is pretty big demand.

739
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:02,050
There are some key points in the proposal

740
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,330
that I must tell you.

741
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:09,980
Yes.

742
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,630
This is the first one.

743
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,800
This is the second one.

744
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:24,250
Come on.

745
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,360
Airdrop. I'll do the smoke mirage for you.

746
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:25,670
Yes.

747
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,480
Give me some medicine.

748
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,780
I'll give you eight times.

749
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,960
Do you have any thoughts?

750
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,190
The base

751
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,790
is in touch with many brands.

752
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,570
I’ve connected you to them.

753
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,730
The next step

754
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,550
is up to you.

755
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,420
In order to transform,

756
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,530
TT Media needs a new track

757
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,860
and the most efficient operation method.

758
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,640
Calm down.

759
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:49,990
Calm down.

760
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,590
Take it easy.

761
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,110
This is my answer.

762
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,360
Don't come near me.

763
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,490
I was standing there.

764
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,690
I didn't do anything.

765
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,030
Mr. Fang.

766
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,620
I didn't do anything!

767
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,430
So many people are watching.

768
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,000
Mr. Fang,

769
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,390
don't be angry.

770
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,870
See Mr. Fang off.

771
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,400
Hurry up.

772
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,570
Ridiculous.

773
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,860
I'm sorry, Mr. Fang.

774
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,220
I'm really sorry.

775
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,290
Please don't take this to heart.

776
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:19,890
Take care.

777
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,350
What's wrong with you?

778
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,010
You...

779
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,370
I'm going to lose my job

780
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,200
if you treat my client like this.

781
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,590
His entire body

782
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,390
was almost pressed onto my back.

783
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,480
Do you know how many people

784
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,410
are fighting to work with Qiandai?

785
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,910
Do you understand?

786
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,370
Your value will only skyrocket

787
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,650
if you can get the biggest brands.

788
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160
In this business,

789
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,240
you can only get traffic

790
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,680
by selling big brands.

791
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,220
Only with traffic can you have high status.

792
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,450
Get to work.

793
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,080
His logic was flawed.

794
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,620
What?

795
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,410
Needing big brands to have traffic

796
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,250
is the biggest logical flaw.

797
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,940
Of course, in real life,

798
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,420
there are many such cases.

799
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,730
Do you still want to continue this job?

800
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,570
For me, this job

801
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,370
can quickly solve

802
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,150
my financial problems.

803
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,040
Turning yourself

804
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,350
into someone

805
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,070
who doesn't need to be controlled by others

806
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:08,800
can solve

807
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,220
your financial problems in the long-term.

808
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,640
What do you mean?

809
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,110
You have to

810
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,710
have big support behind you.

811
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,510
This way,

812
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,270
you won't be bullied so easily.

813
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,770
Big support?

814
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,630
What do you mean?

815
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,500
If you want to

816
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,720
continue this job,

817
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,390
you can come find me

818
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,390
at the address on the business card.

819
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,620
What just happened

820
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,450
will never happen

821
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,350
in my place.

822
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,800
This is my first promise

823
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,570
to you.

824
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,850
Xu Si?
