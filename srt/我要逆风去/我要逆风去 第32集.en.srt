5
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,740
Do you think

6
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,770
Jiang Hu would

7
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,490
separate it clearly like you?

8
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,820
Don't worry.

9
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,390
Everything I do

10
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,650
is for Jiang Hu's sake.

11
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,229
You do everything for her sake.

12
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,590
That's what you think.

13
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,990
Maybe in her eyes,

14
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,450
she doesn't need it at all.

15
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,590
In a sense,

16
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,690
it may even hurt

17
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
her feelings.

18
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,669
Hello?

19
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,350
Okay, I got it.

20
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:18,829
You can go.

21
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,990
On the way,

22
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,590
think about what I just said.

23
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,390
You're taking it?

24
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,630
I thought you skinned it for me.

25
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,490
Sir, this way please.

26
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,120
Thank you.

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,840
Hello, Mr. Xu.

28
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,400
Ms. Tang,

29
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:43,980
hello.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,730
Have a seat.

31
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,770
Carbonated water, please.

32
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,829
-Okay.
-Thank you.

33
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,230
Mr. Mei said

34
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,550
he'd like to discuss

35
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,510
the specifics of Teng Yue

36
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,570
with you in person.

37
00:02:59,210 --> 00:02:59,890
Go ahead.

38
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,390
Teng Yue's controlling interest

39
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,390
has always been in Baoxing’s hands,

40
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,410
but Teng Yue’s project

41
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,920
hasn't been advancing as swiftly.

42
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,640
Do you have any concerns?

43
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,829
Just be frank.

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,620
I have two conditions.

45
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,100
First,

46
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,240
keep the brand of Teng Yue.

47
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,590
Second,

48
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,070
keep everyone

49
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,670
in Teng Yue's original team.

50
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,270
The first condition is no problem.

51
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,060
This is also why

52
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,510
we acquire old brands.

53
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,520
But for the second one,

54
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:46,550
I'm not sure

55
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,510
Teng Yue's current

56
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,710
internal personnel structure

57
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,550
is in accordance with

58
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,510
Aneda's employee standards.

59
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,190
A team's ability is more important than personal ability.

60
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,060
Teng Yue

61
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,450
could be revived

62
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,110
in a short time

63
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,070
because everyone in the team

64
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,190
contributed a lot.

65
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,230
I have a bold question.

66
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,140
I heard

67
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,090
that you're dating

68
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,290
Ms. Jiang of Teng Yue.

69
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,510
Sir, your carbonated water.

70
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,320
Enjoy.

71
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:18,820
Thank you.

72
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,280
I know

73
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,440
the person you really worry about

74
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,580
is Ms. Jiang.

75
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,150
You're afraid Aneda will kick her out

76
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,610
after acquiring Teng Yue.

77
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,500
I can promise you now

78
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,850
that you don't have to worry.

79
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,840
We acknowledge

80
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,940
and appreciate Ms. Jiang's ability.

81
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,830
We hope

82
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,450
she can stay in Teng Yue

83
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,590
and become

84
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,520
an indispensable member of Aneda.

85
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,190
As for the others,

86
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,030
we totally respect

87
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,690
Ms. Jiang's personnel transfer and mangement.

88
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,730
However,

89
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,520
for Xiang Zhaoyang,

90
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,520
we hope

91
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,250
she is not only

92
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,920
Teng Yue's chief designer,

93
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,909
but also

94
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,550
design an independent line

95
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,880
for Aneda.

96
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,460
I'm afraid

97
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,030
I can't guarantee that.

98
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,790
After all,

99
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,990
Xiang Zhaoyang didn't seem

100
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,830
very happy

101
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,470
when leaving Aneda.

102
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,390
I understand.

103
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,280
Xiang Zhaoyang is different now

104
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,690
I don't mind showing her our sincerity.

105
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,920
But the most important thing now

106
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,900
is to speed up

107
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,830
Teng Yue's acquisition progress.

108
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,760
Do you agree?

109
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,650
Is that true?

110
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,550
Teng Yue as designed by you

111
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,120
will be a precious treasure

112
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,020
for Aneda in the future.

113
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,430
Zhaoyang,

114
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:46,790
I told you

115
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,909
that we will soon

116
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,770
work together in a different way.

117
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,520
I hope

118
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,570
you can return to Aneda.

119
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,710
You don't have to answer me now.

120
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,620
Think about it.

121
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,920
I'm leaving.

122
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,790
Okay.

123
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,430
Take that bag down.

124
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:19,990
Thank you, Master Qian.

125
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,590
Okay.

126
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,830
Put them down and get in one by one.

127
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,830
Okay.

128
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,350
Get in one by one.

129
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,790
Get in.

130
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,590
Get in.

131
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,230
Come on.

132
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,590
Is everyone here?

133
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,970
Yue Shan sprained her ankle.

134
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,900
Is it serious?

135
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,000
She'll be fine after resting for a few days.

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,370
Yang Jian will bring Wu

137
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,570
and Xiang Zhaoyang.

138
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,210
They will arrive later.

139
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,050
Have you arranged

140
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,610
what I asked you to arrange?

141
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:48,920
So reliable.

142
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,960
Okay, let's go.

143
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,280
Okay.

144
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,909
Is everything ready?

145
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:57,860
Is your luggage packed?

146
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,490
Yes.

147
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:58,909
Okay.

148
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,409
Let's go.

149
00:06:59,409 --> 00:06:59,940
Let's go.

150
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,550
Be careful.

151
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:01,920
Take your time.

152
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,720
Master Zhang.

153
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,580
Are you...

154
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,570
I'm supervising.

155
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,770
What do you mean?

156
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,520
Are you coming with us?

157
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,590
What?

158
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,050
You don't want me

159
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,010
to go with you?

160
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,190
No.

161
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,270
Of course not.

162
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,900
Have you eaten?

163
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,720
No.

164
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,350
I knew it.

165
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,780
No matter how busy you are, remember to eat.

166
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,230
Let's go. Let's eat in the car.

167
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:46,730
Here.

168
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,440
Open your mouth.

169
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,470
Is it good?

170
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,030
Yes.

171
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,560
Why is there only one worker

172
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,990
bringing a kid?

173
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,170
Many people are busy working

174
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,030
and can't take care of their kids.

175
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,310
They can only have

176
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,540
the grandparents take care of the kids.

177
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,780
I remember when I was young,

178
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,160
my dad always went on

179
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,520
long business trips.

180
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,540
Every day,

181
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,750
I would stand

182
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,950
on a small stool

183
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,090
placed on the balcony

184
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,150
and look outside through the window,

185
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,590
looking at the road in front of my house.

186
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,470
I would wait and wait,

187
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,150
hoping my dad could come back soon.

188
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,510
In the adult world,

189
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,360
there are many things you're forced to do.

190
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:51,690
Good girl.

191
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,330
Your chubby cheeks.

192
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,990
When we go back,

193
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,510
I'll discuss it

194
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,710
with Uncle and Ms. Yue

195
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,350
to adjust the days off

196
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,230
for the holiday

197
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,350
so that the workers have more time

198
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,750
to spend with their kids.

199
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,510
There's almost an hour

200
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,510
before we arrive.

201
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,350
Take a rest.

202
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,620
The ones in front, go down in the front.

203
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,380
Hurry up.

204
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:24,710
Hurry up.

205
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,110
The ones behind, go down from the middle door.

206
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,570
The one in front, go down from the front door.

207
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,600
Great!

208
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,870
Hurry, hurry.

209
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,260
Come,

210
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,740
take your luggage slowly.

211
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,890
Don't block the way.

212
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,020
Don't block the way.

213
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,150
Hurry up.

214
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,200
Come.

215
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,690
Come.

216
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,280
We'll check in on the left.

217
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,670
Here.

218
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,700
Hello.

219
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,330
We are from Teng Yue.

220
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,130
Come.

221
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,030
I didn't know there's such a hotel in the suburbs.

222
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,430
When did you discover it?

223
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:04,950
Before, Free Unicorn

224
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,830
would come for team building every year.

225
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,590
Welcome.

226
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,550
Ms. Jiang is so generous.

227
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,080
This is the standard of Baoxing.

228
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,280
My dad treated the workers very well.

229
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,220
He said he wanted the workers

230
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,390
to feel that they are valued,

231
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,520
so they can be loyal.

232
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,370
It's easy for me.

233
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,880
If you give me your room card,

234
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,530
not just my heart,

235
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,270
but my entire being will also be yours.

236
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,200
What room card?

237
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,990
What room card do you think?

238
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,750
We will notify you

239
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,110
for dinner later.

240
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,990
Okay.

241
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,590
Do you want me to

242
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,990
sleep on the streets?

243
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,200
You didn't book a room?

244
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,130
I've been busy working

245
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,970
since the morning.

246
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,730
I wasn't sure I could come until noon.

247
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,530
I didn't have time to book a room.

248
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:02,750
It's okay.

249
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,290
I can book one for you.

250
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,030
I just want to stay in your room

251
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,950
to save public expenses.

252
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,510
It's okay.

253
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,110
Don't worry.

254
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,640
I'll pay for it personally.

255
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,210
Wait for me.

256
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,470
I need to answer a call.

257
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,430
Wu Guanglei brought me my luggage.

258
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,790
I’ll come to your room

259
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,010
after I get it.

260
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,190
Scum.

261
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,030
Yang Jian,

262
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,330
are you on your way?

263
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,220
Okay.

264
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,460
When will you arrive?

265
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,390
Okay.

266
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,430
Okay.

267
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,100
Okay. Drive slowly.

268
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,890
We'll wait for you.

269
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,240
It's windy on the road.

270
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
Be careful.

271
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,150
Okay.

272
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:58,890
Okay.

273
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,980
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

274
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,990
It's such a good arrangement.

275
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,790
Thank you for the hard work.

276
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,590
It's nothing.

277
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,470
Being able to leave

278
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:03,830
every guest

279
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,590
an unforgettable memory

280
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,630
is our honor.

281
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,550
Ms. Jiang,

282
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,470
is there anything else you need?

283
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,310
I can prepare it.

284
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,780
No.

285
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,840
Everything is great.

286
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,100
Okay, take a look.

287
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,320
If you're satisfied,

288
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
sign here.

289
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,940
Okay.

290
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,720
Ms. Leng from Star Gravity.

291
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,190
It's an honor.

292
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,710
I didn't expect you to remember me.

293
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,590
Hello.

294
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,070
Mr. Xu,

295
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,190
our last meeting

296
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,350
ended in a hurry.

297
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,070
I didn't have time

298
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,210
to add you on WeChat.

299
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,190
I heard that

300
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,230
there will be a meeting

301
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,260
at the headquarters next month.

302
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,710
Do you think

303
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,750
I can add you on WeChat?

304
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,190
I'll send you my PowerPoint

305
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,350
and proposal.

306
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,100
Is that okay?

307
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,660
Sure, no problem.

308
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,710
Great.

309
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,450
I'll scan your QR code.

310
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:37,890
Okay.

311
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,110
Here.

312
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,320
Okay, Ms. Jiang.

313
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,490
If you need anything,

314
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,450
just call me.

315
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,240
Mr. Wu, wait.

316
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,640
Please get me another room.

317
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,520
Okay,

318
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,920
no problem.

319
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,120
Please wait a moment.

320
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,260
I'm here.

321
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,020
Your room card.

322
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,070
What is this for?

323
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,340
Weren't you

324
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,600
having an enthusiastic chat with someone?

325
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,850
You even added her on WeChat.

326
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,380
I'll give you some privacy.

327
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,470
That Ms. Leng in the lobby?

328
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,910
I don't care who she is.

329
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,930
Are you jealous?

330
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,740
I'm not jealous.

331
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,750
How can you be jealous over this?

332
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,070
She is the president

333
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,600
of one of our partners.

334
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:00,990
Next month,

335
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,500
she's coming for a meeting.

336
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,900
She wanted to add me on WeChat

337
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,370
to show me the PowerPoint.

338
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,660
Meeting?

339
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,430
Then you can have dinner after the meeting, right?

340
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,150
If I eat dinner, it'll be with you.

341
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,140
We just chatted a little.

342
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,550
How can you be jealous?

343
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,630
You are

344
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,270
so unconfident in yourself.

345
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,530
I don't know

346
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,130
why I became like this.

347
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,810
I wasn't like this before.

348
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,750
Am I abnormal?

349
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,470
I can't believe

350
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,930
I got angry about this.

351
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,260
Your abnormal behavior

352
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,340
makes me happy.

353
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,410
How can you be happy?

354
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,680
I hate you.

355
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,610
I hated you from the beginning.

356
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,010
I hate you.

357
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,550
When did this start?

358
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,420
Tell me.

359
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,590
Since

360
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,940
you owed me 100 yuan,

361
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,430
I started hating you.

362
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,470
So, you've liked me

363
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,990
since so long ago.

364
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,370
Who?

365
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,710
Who likes you?

366
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:00,590
You know

367
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,800
who likes who.

368
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,860
Look at you.

369
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,460
You used to be so arrogant

370
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,180
and you're still like this.

371
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,630
You haven't changed at all.

372
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,900
You said I'm arrogant.

373
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,230
Now you're picking on me.

374
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:13,710
Are you

375
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,040
starting to dislike me?

376
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,750
Look at you.

377
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,830
Look at how aggressive you are.

378
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,590
Aren't you arrogant?

379
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,360
I really want to get a mirror

380
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,280
so you can look at yourself.

381
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,680
You...

382
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,020
What?

383
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,370
You can't win the fight?

384
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,150
Why are you biting me?

385
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,630
Your bad habit hasn't changed at all.

386
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,690
You still bite people.

387
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,320
I can't change it.

388
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,180
This is how I am.

389
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,640
Everyone can do it.

390
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,670
I can bite too.

391
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,050
I can bite too.

392
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,430
Let's fight!

393
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,260
I can do it too.

394
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,170
Your teeth are so sharp.

395
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,390
Jiang Hu,

396
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,370
go downstairs for dinner.

397
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,730
Your uncle?

398
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,710
Jiang Hu?

399
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,620
Coming.

400
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,990
Don't talk.

401
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,600
Mr. Xu?

402
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,310
Okay.

403
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,579
Continue what you're doing.

404
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,359
Go ahead.

405
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,960
Come down after you're done.

406
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:07,890
Okay.

407
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,170
Come down after you're done!

408
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:09,930
Stop talking.

409
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,130
You did it on purpose.

410
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,700
Young people.

411
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,349
Let's continue what we're doing.

412
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,540
What are we doing?

413
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,569
You are annoying.

414
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,859
So impatient.

415
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,200
It's getting late.

416
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,260
Let's go eat first.

417
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,030
Where is Jiang Hu?

418
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,160
Let's eat together.

419
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,160
I won't go over now.

420
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,900
I ate

421
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:53,790
on the way here.

422
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,380
Go get the room card.

423
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,670
Jiang Hu left us two rooms.

424
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,980
The room cards are with the receptionist.

425
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,380
Okay.

426
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,870
I'll have a room alone.

427
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,140
What are you thinking?

428
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,740
Let's sleep in the same room.

429
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,630
What?

430
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,800
What kind of couple is this?

431
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,580
You're still up?

432
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,900
I can't sleep.

433
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,570
Are you designing shoes?

434
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,040
I knew it.

435
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,880
Wait.

436
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:20,040
[Dangerous action. Please don't imitate]

437
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,890
No.

438
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,230
How could you jump from there?

439
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,270
Do you know how dangerous it is?

440
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,020
It's okay.

441
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,200
I've jumped in higher places before.

442
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,430
That was before.

443
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,690
You're different now.

444
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,850
This is the last time.

445
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,320
I won't make you worry next time.

446
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,360
Here.

447
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:45,850
Here.

448
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,720
I knew you'd be hungry at night.

449
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,520
I prepared it for you.

450
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,780
Eat.

451
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,150
You'll get inspiration when you're full.

452
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:03,910
How about...

453
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,510
Go to bed early after eating.

454
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,240
Don't stay up too late.

455
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,360
One.

456
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,430
Two.

457
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,460
Three.

458
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,680
Four.

459
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:53,960
Five.

460
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,130
I'm coming.

461
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,210
Where is she?

462
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,380
Jiang Hu?

463
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,550
You're up?

464
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,070
You slept well, huh?

465
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:11,860
It's time.

466
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,010
Let's go.

467
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:15,900
Wait.

468
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,490
I'm going to take a shower.

469
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,220
I'll be fast.

470
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,740
Come on, cooperate.

471
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,130
Wang and the others are doing barbecue.

472
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,160
Let's get some skewers.

473
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,890
I...

474
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,200
I don't like to eat those things.

475
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,870
You want it?

476
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,480
It smells so good.

477
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,240
Go ahead.

478
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,630
I'll just walk around.

479
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,860
Okay.

480
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,860
I'm going to grill it.

481
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,120
I'll come to you later.

482
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,620
I'm coming.

483
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,480
It smells so good.

484
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,740
You're done with work?

485
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,300
Here.

486
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,790
Mr. Xu.

487
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,720
Hello, Mr. Xu.

488
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,590
Eat up.

489
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,100
Is anyone here?

490
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,150
No.

491
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,050
Have you talked to Tang Ya?

492
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,900
Do you accept her proposal?

493
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,890
What do you think?

494
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,310
My opinion doesn't matter,

495
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,190
but I think you will

496
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,520
consider it carefully.

497
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,940
Being a designer

498
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,370
has always been my dream,

499
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,030
but I didn't expect

500
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,420
that Jiang Hu would agree

501
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,940
to sell Teng Yue to Aneda.

502
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,220
I haven't told her yet,

503
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,300
but I think she will agree.

504
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,960
Have you two

505
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,390
really settled down?

506
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,680
Both of us are suitable

507
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,640
for each other.

508
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,290
In that case,

509
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,880
you need to think about

510
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,440
how to tell her about Aneda.

511
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,600
Aneda's offer

512
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,470
is very good.

513
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,450
She is a businesswoman after all.

514
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
But she's not just a businesswoman.

515
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,740
You two

516
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,310
are not just business partners either.

517
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,600
Anyway,

518
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,210
tell her as soon as possible.

519
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,390
I will choose

520
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,620
to tell her

521
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,650
at the right time.

522
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,490
I'm going over.

523
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,440
Okay.

524
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,440
It smells so good.

525
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,840
I think I'm full already.

526
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:58,910
Have a chicken wing.

527
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,920
I ate so much.

528
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,090
Chicken wings and squid.

529
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:01,670
No.

530
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,390
The squid is too dry.

531
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,150
Are you full?

532
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,920
I'll help you digest.

533
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,590
You two are wearing a couple outfit?

534
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,140
Go do your work.

535
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,880
Put more garlic, Uncle.

536
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,500
Okay.

537
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,190
Do you know how to do this?

538
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,270
Do I or do I not?

539
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,600
If you are better than me,

540
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,140
then I'll be embarrassed.

541
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,390
I haven't done it for a long time.

542
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,590
I don't remember how.

543
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,220
It's okay.

544
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,270
Let me help you review.

545
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,010
You seem to be good at it.

546
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,110
Like this?

547
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,790
Yes.

548
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,960
Stand up straight.

549
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,990
Adjust your breathing.

550
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,930
Aim at the bullseye.

551
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,130
Straighten up and suck in your stomach.

552
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,630
Tonight,

553
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,730
you're not allowed to drink anymore.

554
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,440
It's all your fault.

555
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,270
You distracted me.

556
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,810
I didn't even hit the target.

557
00:25:58,810 --> 00:25:59,870
You're blaming me?

558
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,170
Who else can I blame?

559
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,570
I don't believe it.

560
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,700
I have to do it again.

561
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,180
Let's compete.

562
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,480
You're pretty brave.

563
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,910
You're so arrogant.

564
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,920
I'll go first.

565
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,630
One round.

566
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,360
It's time

567
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,790
to show my real strength.

568
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,080
Come on.

569
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,310
The wind is too strong.

570
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,790
It's my turn.

571
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,370
You're pretty experienced.

572
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:44,780
Of course.

573
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:54,890
I won.

574
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,770
You're supposed to be a gentleman.

575
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,580
Going easy on someone like you

576
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,580
is more disrespectful.

577
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,310
You can't take any loss.

578
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,720
You exposed your nature as a businessman.

579
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,320
We are both businesspeople.

580
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,110
Maximizing interests

581
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,350
is what we should do

582
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,460
and what we must do.

583
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,890
That's true.

584
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,120
Have you ever thought

585
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,680
how merging Teng Yue

586
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,000
with a more powerful company

587
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,740
will give it a better future?

588
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,560
The maximization of interests doesn't mean

589
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,130
maximizing profit.

590
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,430
Also,

591
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,890
why must we become a group?

592
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:40,630
Why can't we be

593
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,230
a small and beautiful brand?

594
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,120
The company will develop too slowly.

595
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,140
Why can't we slow down

596
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,770
and be more concentrated?

597
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,540
What you said

598
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,870
doesn't suit Teng Yue,

599
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,650
nor is it the Teng Yue I want.

600
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,810
Ms. Jiang.

601
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,360
Mr. Wu.

602
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,960
Is everything ready?

603
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,820
Everything is ready.

604
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,230
We're waiting for you

605
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,760
and your friends to go over.

606
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:04,390
Okay.

607
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,660
Okay, we'll be on our way.

608
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,000
Okay.

609
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,070
What's ready?

610
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,950
Let's go.

611
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:08,560
Let's go.

612
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,650
Where are we going?

613
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,710
You'll know later.

614
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:14,870
What is it?

615
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,080
How is the grill?

616
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,360
Why are you here?

617
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,900
I want to see if I can help.

618
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,150
Your phone is ringing.

619
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:34,750
Yours.

620
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,010
Yours.

621
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,070
Yours.

622
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,420
I didn't bring my phone.

623
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,400
It's yours.

624
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,550
It seems to be yours.

625
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,310
What?

626
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,500
I ordered something.

627
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,190
I'll go

628
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:53,970
get it.

629
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,230
Okay.

630
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,160
You two have fun.

631
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:56,810
Okay.

632
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,450
What would you like to eat, Ms. Xiang?

633
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,510
I'll just have some lamb.

634
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,240
This is done.

635
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,790
Thank you.

636
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,640
Teng Yue Barbecue.

637
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,390
Eggplants.

638
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:11,710
Okay.

639
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,510
Let me help.

640
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,050
Okay.

641
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,790
Uncle.

642
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:17,830
It's ready.

643
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,550
Come.

644
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,680
Come, everyone.

645
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,410
Listen to me.

646
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,360
Listen to me.

647
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,220
Gather around.

648
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,410
Let's move on to the next activity.

649
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,510
Come on.

650
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,070
Okay.

651
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,810
What activity?

652
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,320
You'll know later.

653
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,520
Let me introduce

654
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,420
our next

655
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,140
activity.

656
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:37,710
Come on.

657
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:38,070
Okay.

658
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,080
Let me handle the grill.

659
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,700
You go first.

660
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,830
I'll be right there.

661
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,530
You ate a lot just now.

662
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
This way.

663
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,600
This way.

664
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:46,910
Okay.

665
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,080
Here.

666
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,100
Let's go.

667
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,930
Yang is not back yet.

668
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,310
It's okay. He can find us.

669
00:29:59,310 --> 00:29:59,840
Let's go.

670
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,200
Come on.

671
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,460
We're here.

672
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,420
Here we are.

673
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,420
Here.

674
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:08,860
Here.

675
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,930
What do you think?

676
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,550
You need to have a sense of ceremony.

677
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,120
So beautiful.

678
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,670
Come on.

679
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,790
What is this?

680
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,800
Go.

681
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,170
It wasn't my idea.

682
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,850
Everything was arranged by Jiang Hu.

683
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,510
I also feel unprepared.

684
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,820
That's not what I meant.

685
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,050
Actually,

686
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,830
I've always wanted to do this

687
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,930
and today is a good opportunity.

688
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:16,760
Zhaoyang,

689
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,770
I know you don't actually care

690
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,400
if we have this ritual or not,

691
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,170
but I hope

692
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,860
that you have

693
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,420
what the others have.

694
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,590
What the others don't have,

695
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,780
you will have it too.

696
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,100
Today,

697
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
under the witness of so many people,

698
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,010
I, Yang Jian, promise you

699
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,560
I will use all my power

700
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,560
to make you feel safe

701
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,050
and make you feel happiness

702
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,080
and joy.

703
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,390
Zhaoyang,

704
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,910
will you marry me?

705
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,490
Say yes.

706
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,670

Thank you.

786
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,280
Five of Teng Yue's stores

787
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,870
in Lidu Department Store.

788
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,310
opened simultaneously today.

789
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,760
Today is Teng Yue's 100-Year Anniversary Sale.

790
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,820
There's a press conference tonight.

791
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,250
Including the stores

792
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,850
in other department stores,

793
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,040
does Teng Yue have

794
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,040
28 stores now?

795
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,110
No, there are two more in supermarkets.

796
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,510
It's 30 in total.

797
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,820
His sassy girlfriend

798
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
is quite skilled.

799
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,440
Do you think

800
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,080
we sold Teng Yue too cheaply?

801
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,310
The price is negotiable

802
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,060
as long as we can sell it.

803
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,350
Xu Si,

804
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,980
when are you

805
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,710
going to come clean to Jiang Hu?

806
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,950
I'm eating lunch with her today.

807
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,780
My dad once told me

808
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:11,770
that he saw

809
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,520
these quotes in the newspaper.

810
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,040
A brand needs a long time to be built up,

811
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,870
like water weathering a rock.

812
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,090
The construction of a brand

813
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,090
needs the help of the whole society.

814
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,560
It really touched me.

815
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,180
I really appreciate

816
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,250
consumers' support forTeng Yue.

817
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,230
For Teng Yue to continue on

818
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,310
and become a brand with social responsibility,

819
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,740
national characteristics,

820
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,360
and be able to export

821
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,410
the beauty of Chinese culture,

822
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,480
I still have a lot of work to do.

823
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,260
Now is only

824
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,960
the starting point for Teng Yue's next 100 years.

825
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,770
Thank you.

826
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,790
Ms. Jiang, your speech is great.

827

If you have questions,

838
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,150
our store manager is over there.

839

Okay.

840
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,140
That's right.

841
00:41:59,140 --> 00:41:59,890

842
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,070
anything else,

843
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,120

Thank you.

846
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,110
Are you tired?

847
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,860
I'm fine.

848
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,220
Slow down. Don't choke.

849
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,650
I have to go now.

850
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,250
Go ahead.

851
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,660
I'm here, so don't worry.

852
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,640
Thank you.

853
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,030
See you tonight.

854
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,630
Okay.

855
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:18,600
Take care.

856
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,580
Okay, call me if you need anything.

857
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,530
Okay.

Don't worry.

860
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,250
Dear media friends,

861
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,080
would you like to take a look inside?

862
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,160
Our shoes are beautiful.

863
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,180
Take some photos.

864
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,100
Come on.

865
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,880
Welcome.

866

Let me take some photos.
