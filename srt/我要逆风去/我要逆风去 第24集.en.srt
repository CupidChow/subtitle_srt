Jian.

6
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,670
Mom, good morning.

7
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,070
Did you stay up all night

8
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,400
or did you wake up early?

9
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,340
I just finished my work.

10
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,829
What would you like for breakfast?

11
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:56,950
-I’ll cook for you.
-No, thanks.

12
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,010
I have an appointment for breakfast.

13
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,010
Jian.

14
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,190
Zhaoyang went to work overtime.

15
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,990
Why are you being so suspicious?

16
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,870
What were you doing in the studio?

17
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,000
I left her a surprise for when she comes back.

18
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,550
A surprise?

19
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,030
What surprise?

20
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,790
Let me see.

21
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,790
Don't look.

22
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,010
You're so curious.

23
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,670
Fine.

24
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,450
Listen, this girl

25
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,670
is so silly.

26
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,600
Let me tell you.

27
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,440
When she works for Jiang Hu,

28
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,350
she leaves early and comes home late every day.

29
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,590
Her face is full of wrinkles.

30
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,030
No matter how many facial masks she applies, it's useless.

31
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,960
Isn't she silly?

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,230
Do you think

33
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,550
I should go to Jiang Hu's company

34
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,710
and talk to her?

35
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,350
Demand a raise, maybe?

36
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,150
That's enough.

37
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,580
Don't you want a breakfast to attend?

38
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,720
All the food will be gone if you're late.

39
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,080
That's right.

40
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,760
I'm going.

41
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,950
I have to dress up.

42
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,700
Actually,

43
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,550
I'm a good mother.

44
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,990
I may have many social activities,

45
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,590
but I still have my daughter in my heart.

46
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,909
I mean, look at her.

47
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,659
You are her brother.

48
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:47,790
Help me talk to her.

49
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,270
Okay.

50
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:48,870
Off you go.

51
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,790
Always making me worry.

52
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,230
Master Zhang.

53
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,110
We've completed the orders

54
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,020
for this month.

55
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,180
The orders for next month...

56
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,080
Don't worry.

57
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,860
We will arrange

58
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,290
the production process.

59
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,480
Do you think that designer is capable?

60
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,590
She's good-looking but she seems useless.

61
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,630
What if she's a fake?

62
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,790
You can’t say that.

63
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,150
Ms. Jiang couldn't have picked the wrong person.

64
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,010
Think about it.

65
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,150
The factory is cold and quiet.

66
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,720
It's like we're back to half a year ago.

67
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,560
Such a pity.

68
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,440
I have no work to do.

69
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,780
Uncle.

70
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,710
Can you sit down?

71
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,590
Watching you pace around in circles

72
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,840
makes me dizzy.

73
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,030
Sit down?

74
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,870
How can I?

75
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,560
I'm not in the mood to sit down.

76
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,770
The fabric

77
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,830
has not been confirmed.

78
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,790
The design

79
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,960
is nowhere to be seen.

80
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
You want me to sit?

81
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,750
I'm not in the mood to sit.

82
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,730
I've found the fabric.

83
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:38,810
It’s a type of fabric

84
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,870
that contains cotton from Xinjiang.

85
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,670
I also bought the patent

86
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,150
for the latest

87
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,600
anti-odor and anti-sweat spray.

88
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,150
It can better absorb moisture and sweat

89
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,280
and remove the odor.

90
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,710
Jiang Hu.

91
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,159
Are we really going to sell

92
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,750
a pair of shoes for 599?

93
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,840
Is it that hard to ask her

94
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,590
to design a cheaper

95
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,950
model of shoes?

96
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,350
If it were that simple,

97
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,670
I wouldn't have gone through the trouble

98
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,870
of inviting her here.

99
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,730
The price of Teng Yue's products

100
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,230
is a secondary concern.

101
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,490
The quality of the product is the main concern.

102
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,230
I don't care if it's a secondary concern

103
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,790
or main concern.

104
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,910
My concern is,

105
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,610
in the next quarter,

106
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,200
we must have new products.

107
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,150
Without new products,

108
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,180
we can't make money.

109
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,910
If we can't make money,

110
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,880
then...

111
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,170
Well...

112
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,830
We're doomed.

113
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,580
Just one word.

114
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,500
Doomed.

115
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,030

116
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,590
these problems.

117
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,590
Isn't she

118
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,550
working overtime every day,

119
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,800
thinking about new ideas?

120
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,360
Stop rushing her.

121

I...

122
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,400
She's under a lot of pressure.

123
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:41,390
Okay.

124
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,960
I won't rush her.

125
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,030
Let me ask you.

126
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,150

How can you stream without new products?

129

What will you stream about?

130
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:49,550
Tell me.

00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,110
if you screw up by then,

135
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,470

Can you?

140

Uncle,

141
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,590
stop making me

142
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,670
anxious.

143
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,270
I'm not making you anxious.

I'm caring about you.

147
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,150
We have a problem.

148
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,590
We...

149
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:11,850
Okay.

150

We have a problem,

151
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,390
so we have to face the problem.

152
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,850
I am being objective here.

153
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,100
Let me tell you again.

154
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,910
If our factory has to shut down,

155
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,150
it will be because

156
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,910
the big designer you hired,

157
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,790
Xiang Zhaoyang,

158
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,880
has dragged us down.

159
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,370
If she keeps dragging,

160
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,080
she'll doom our factory.

161
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,350
Do you think that designer

162
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,430
is capable?

163
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,510
She's good-looking but she seems useless.

164
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,510

00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,370
Why are you here?

179
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,710
Do you have unfinished work

180
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,430
to settle with

181
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,960
the Marketing Department?

182
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,650
No.

183
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,590
I just walked around

184
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,750
and ended up here.

185
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,800
Let's go.

186
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,890
I'll take you home.

187
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,200
Since you're in a bad mood,

188
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,060
you need someone to talk with you.

189
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,250
[Changle Restaurant]

190
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,000
Is something bothering you?

191
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,600
Why do you look so depressed?

192
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,230
I just suddenly feel

193
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,030
that

194
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,710
I might not be

195
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,970
a qualified designer.

196
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,770
Why did you suddenly say that?

197
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,000
I can't draw

198
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,130
anything to my satisfaction anymore.

199
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,450
The more anxious I get,

200
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,830
the more I can't draw.

201
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,470
Did you and Jiang Hu argue?

202
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,250
Did she criticize you?

203
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,290
I wouldn't be this stressed

204
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,680
if she did

205
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,610
criticize me.

206
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,310
Not only did she not criticize me,

207
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,520
she even helped me

208
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,050
relieve some of my stress.

209
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,250
That makes me even more upset.

210
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,090
Not only am I unable to help her,

211
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,190
I made her situation

212
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,420
even worse.

213
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,190
Zhaoyang, do you know

214
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,750
how I felt

215
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,880
when I first saw you?

216
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,740
I thought you were very similar to Jiang Hu.

217
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,490
Both of you

218
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,050
are very stubborn.

219
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,190
Whatever you like and want to do,

220
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,230
you will stick to it

221
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,110
without hesitation.

222
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,470
Also,

223
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,210
you two are the same.

224
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,400
You both love shoes.

225
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,540
But one loves drawing shoes,

226
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,580
and the other

227
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,160
loves to buy shoes.

228
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,760
Jiang Hu

229
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,430
has become someone

230
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,710
who loves to make shoes.

231
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,310
So even I

232
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,660
admire both of you

233
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,590
and your perseverance

234
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,960
for your hobbies.

235
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,190
So,

236
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,230
I also believe

237
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,690
your cooperation

238
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,570
will have

239
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,400
a good result.

240
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,640
Really?

241
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,870
Of course.

242
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,230
But

243
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,180
you have to have faith in yourself.

244
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,790
My house is just ahead.

245
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:27,770
It's okay.

246
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,930
I'll walk you there.

247
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,120
It's over there.

248
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,290
Are you going to deliver the goods?

249
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,680
This is my brother.

250
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,510
Hello.

251
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,230
I'm Gao Yi.

252
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,400
I'm Zhaoyang's friend.

253
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:07,760
Well

254
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,470
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,570
My hands are dirty.

256
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,110
Have we met before?

257
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,190
No.

258
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,300
You guys talk.

259
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,560
I'll get back to work.

260
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,150
What's wrong?

261
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,570
Nothing.

262
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,630
I feel like I've met

263
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,830
your brother before.

264
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,470
Alright.

265
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,530
Have a good rest.

266
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,260
I'm leaving.

267
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,710
Okay.

268
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,710
Thank you, Gao Yi.

269
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,750
You’re welcome.

270
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,110
Call me if you need anything.

271
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,550
Okay.

272
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,310
I'm leaving.

273
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,590
He left?

274
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:49,990
Let's go.

275
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,790
Let's go home.

276
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,830
Aren't you going to deliver the goods?

277
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,830
I'll get Xiao Qi to do it.

278
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,110
Come on,

279
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,710
follow me.

280
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:25,590
Here.

281
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,690
Let me introduce these to you.

282
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:29,930
Take a look.

283
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,410
Let's start with this one.

284
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,470
This is you.

285
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,290
This is you.

286
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,590
Your face is so big.

287
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,350
Have you forgotten?

288
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,280
When I was young,

289
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,450
I referenced your face when I drew it.

290
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,430
Yes.

291
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,760

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,550
♫Of your love story♫

352
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,670
♫I want to♫

353
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:02,190
♫Write you a poem and a fairy tale♫

354
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,970
♫Where the land is criss-crossed♫

355
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,770
♫With green grass and flowers♫

356
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,770
♫The view on the mountain top is as beautiful as you♫

357
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,200
♫I don't know how to describe it♫

358
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,190
♫But it's just like you♫

359
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,960
♫Like you, while you are♫

360
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,770
♫So different and unique♫

361
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,110
Go forward.

362
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,020
Okay.

363
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,090
Okay.

364
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,900
Is everything clear?

365
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,710
What's there not to be clear about?

366
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,160
Teng Yue won't owe you a single pair of shoes.

367
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,760
Pei, did you have to say that?

368
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,870
I mean,

369
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,710
I never noticed

370
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,510
how big Teng Yue's warehouse is.

371
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,150
I wonder

372
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,750
when it will be filled again.

373
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,240
Don't worry about it.

374
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,640
Okay.

375
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,520
I'm leaving.

376
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,810
Bye.

377
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,270
Uncle.

378
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,040
Anything else?

379
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,650
Go back to your Free Unicorn.

380
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,440
Go. Go.

381
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,070
Turning left.

382
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,380
Be careful.

383
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,990
Turning left.

384
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,550
Okay.

385
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,240
Free Unicorn's last batch of goods

386
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,680
has been taken away.

387
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,690
What should we do next?

388
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,750
We must get rid of old things

389
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,350
to make space for new things.

390
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,430
Yes.

391
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,960
The old things are gone.

392
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,730
But the new designer

393
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,320
you spent so much money to hire

394
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,780
hasn't shown up for a week.

395
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,280
Don't count on her.

396
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,240
Let's go.

397
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,390
Jiang Hu!

398
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,710
What are you doing here?

399
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,550
I'm Teng Yue's designer.

400
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,480
Where else can I go

401
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,430
if I don't come here?

402
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,790
You haven't been here for a week.

403
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,320
What are you doing here now?

404
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:55,520
Jiang Hu.

405
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,020
I've rushed out a few drafts.

406
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,680
Take a look.

407
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,810
Uncle.

408
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,240
Okay.

409
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,710
Get Master Zhang to make a sample immediately.

410
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,510
Okay.

411
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,730
I'm going to make a sample.

412
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,990
Don't you want to take a look first?

413
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,670
I told you.

414
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,970
I trust you.

415
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,130
There's a loose thread.

416
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,880
The workmanship...

417
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,770
Master Zhang.

418
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,250
Have you changed to the new insole?

419
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,650
It's inside. Take a look.

420
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,400
Is there anything special about these shoes?

421
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,190
The new insole

422
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:36,790
is made of

423
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,750
wool fabric with natural castor oil added inside.

424
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,440
I also bought

425
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,240
the patent for an anti-odor and anti-sweat spray.

426
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,510
This pair of shoes

427
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,710
should be expensive.

428
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,480
599.

429
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,920
Zhaoyang also designed another

430
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,430
series of shoes

431
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,870
priced below 200 yuan.

432
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,070
Let me keep you in suspense.

433
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,700
It will be revealed

434
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,410
at Teng Yue's

435
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,010
first livestream next week.

436
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,990
You're using your marketing method

437
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,760
on me as well?

438
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,320
Yesterday,

439
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,230
I also thought of

440
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:09,950
a summer-style design

441
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,480
that doesn't need insoles.

442
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,380
Not bad.

443
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,710
I'll sell

444
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,610
the insoles separately.

445
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,680
What?

446
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,230
Sell them separately?

447
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,230
It's expensive just to buy the shoes.

448
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:38,990
And now you want the consumers

449
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,470
to spend more money on the insoles.

450
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,310
Do you think it's appropriate?

451
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,470
It's not like that.

452
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,080
If you only buy the insoles,

453
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,750
they cost 59.9 yuan.

454
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,140
But if you buy a pair of shoes,

455
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,230
the insoles only cost 9.9 yuan.

456
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,710
Nice one,

457
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,610
Jiang Hu.

458
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,050
You're so good at selling shoes.

459
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,440
Be gentle.

460
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,660
I’m a professional in my field.

461
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,860
Ms. Jiang.

462
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,550
Xiaolin.

463
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,040
You came at the right time.

464
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,960
Try on the new shoes.

465
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,160
How big are your feet?

466
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,740
I'm a size 39.

467
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,710
You're quite small

468
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,130
but your feet are big.

469
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,390
People with big feet work hard.

470
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,680
Exactly.

471
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,430
Capable, I see.

472
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,560
Let me do it.

473
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,410
It's okay.

474
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:19,510
It's okay.

475
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,490
Let me help you.

476
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,190
Let me help you.

477
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,150
No, no, no.

478
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:23,990
No need. Let me do it.

479
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,550
Ms. Jiang.

480
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,310
It's fine.

481
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:25,950
Come on.

482
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,410
Put your foot in.

483
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,950
The shoelace

484
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,090
must be adjusted

485
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,370
to the best tightness

486
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,430
to see if the shoe is good or bad.

487
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,740
Thank you.

488
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,970
Here, this one.

489
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,070
Is it okay?

490
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,840
Not bad.

491
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,310
Come on. Take a few steps.

492
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,910
Try it.

493
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,270
How is it?

494
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,130
How do you feel?

495
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,360
It's quite comfortable.

496
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,490
Try walking around.

497
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,890
Is it comfortable?

498
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,130
Yes.

499
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,450
So pretty.

500
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,390
How about

501
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,990
I modify the patterns

502
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,310
according to the line of the shoes

503
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,950
and see if it could make your feet

504
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,420
look longer and smaller?

505
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,840
Okay.

506
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,790
I'll contact the distributors

507
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,690
and ask them to look at the shoes.

508
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,950
Okay, let's get working.

509
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,320
Okay.

510
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:18,790
Okay.

511
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,100
Ms. Jiang, I’m leaving.

512
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:21,730
Go.

513
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,710
Leave a backup copy for me.

514
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,030
I think this looks nice.

515
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,550
Really?

516
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,370
Master Zhang.

517
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,950
Jiang Hu,

518
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,880
I find that you are

519
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,790
more organized

520
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,980
and steady at work.

521
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,620
You're no longer

522
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
willful and impulsive like before.

523
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,040
It's really good.

524
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,900
How bad did you

525
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,100
think I was?

526
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,940
Let me do it.

527
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,440
So dumb.

528
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,560
Let's go to your office.

529
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,630
I have something to tell you.

530
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,370
The new product is not bad, right?

531
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,280
Next, we'll focus on sales.

532
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:44,710
I plan to

533
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,310
promote it online and offline at the same time.

534
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,730
What do you think?

535
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,730
Your Teng Yue, your decision.

536
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,630
If you need any help,

537
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,410
just tell me.

538
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,680
I'll do my best.

539
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,630
You still have these?

540
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,330
I bought them when I was in school.

541
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,140
I like them a lot.

542
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,410
So I didn't sell it.

543
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,550
Does Yang Jian come to the factory often?

544
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,450
He still has his Plus-size Clothing for Women

545
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,900
and wonton shops to tend to.

546
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,700
I only discuss marketing decisions

547
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,960
with him sometimes.

548
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,990
After all, he is more experienced

549
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,950
in e-commerce.

550
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:47,860
Then why do I

551
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,320
always see him in Teng Yue?

552
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,640
He has to send and pick Zhaoyang up.

553
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,230
Their relationship is so close

554
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,560
even as step-siblings?

555
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,440
Of course.

556
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,220
In Yang's eyes,

557
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,150
Zhaoyang is the most important.

558
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,630
Didn't you see it for yourself last time?

559
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:06,950
That's good.

560
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,410
What's good about it?

561
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,730
Don't touch my stuff.

562
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,620
Do you know why I said

563
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,400
it's good?

564
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,640
You...

565
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,460
What are you thinking about?

566
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,850
You think about

567
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,600
nonsense all day long.

568
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,740
Why are you being unreasonable?

569
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,750
You were just...

570
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,540
No.

571
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,470
What is it?

572
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,950
You know it.

573
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,990
What do I know?

574
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,300
Right.

575
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,030
I'm not like someone

576
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,430
who doesn't dare to admit to her actions.

577
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,290
She struck with

578
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,760
both hands.

579
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,030
She hugged and kissed...

580
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,760
See? You struck with both hands again.

581
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,680
So annoying.

582
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,900
You did it on purpose.

583
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,710
Yes.

584
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,650
To improve

585
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,100
our relationship.

586
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,590
I did it on purpose.

587
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,500
Don't worry.

588
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,520
Before you confirm

589
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,880
the private relationship

590
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,230
between us,

591
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,910
I will maintain

592
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,330
my gentlemanly manners.

593
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:48,890
Should I thank you

594
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,340
while you're at it?

595
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,160
You're welcome.

596
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,670
I think you're here to piss me off.

597
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,900
You're the one who's organized.

598
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,340
But you're also the one who's spoiled and willful.

599
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,670
And you're still the one who dares not admit to your actions.

600
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,070
Lend me the CD for two days.

[Teng Yue Shoes]

627
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,230
These days,

628
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,070
I've tried

629
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,390
some new colors.

630
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,810
This blue hue

631
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,610
was called Tianqing in the past.

632
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,010
The boat departs in the southern waters.

633
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,540
In the blue sky, the sun sets into white water.

634
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,510
And this

635
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,720
is the Tai Chi we all know.

636
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,830
Tai Chi produces two forces.

637
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,390
The two forces produce the four forms.

638
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,790
The four forms produce the eight trigrams.

639
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,080
We use black and white

640
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,700
to summarize everything.

641
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,990
Just like

642
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,940
Chinese ink painting.

643
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,970
Our predecessors have a beautiful

644
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,790
and romantic interpretation of colors.

645
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,040
It's very advanced

646
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,320
for our culture

647
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,100
and our aesthetics.

648
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,130
Yes.

649
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
Looking forward to

650
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,390
Zhaoyang's new design.

651
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,910
A few days ago,

652
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,990
I went to the Lidu Department Store

653
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,990
and attended a new folk kiln exhibition.

654
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,720
I was thinking about one thing.

655
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,000
Usually,

656
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,080
we use traditional technology

657
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,990
or innovation

658
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,790
to create a single piece of work

659
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,520
that showcases the aesthetics of Chinese style.

660
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,520
Well,

661
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,910
I'm wondering

662
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,410
if I can

663
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,150
use

664
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:54,670
commercialized products

665
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,840
to express the same thought.

666
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,510
When did you start forming

667
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,150
a ship with Xiang Zhaoyang?

668
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:06,880
Recently.

669
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,179
In the future,

670
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,030
if you must form a ship

671
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,510
with a guy for your career,

672
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,370
remember to inform me in advance.

673
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,060
Why?

674
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,860
It'll give me enough time

675
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,489
to prepare myself mentally.

676
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,030
But you and Xiang Zhaoyang

677
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,290
are quite compatible.

678
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,350
There is a motto

679
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,880
that is perfect for you two.

680
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:26,810
What?

681
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,949
Somewhere against the wind,

682
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,639
there will always be Zhaoyang (rising sun).

683
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,719
Isn't your WeChat signature always

684
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,350
"I will go against the wind"?

685
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,480
That's because

686
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,870
you are the wind

687
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:39,100
in my way.

688
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,110
It's an honor.

689
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,000
My boss also told me

690
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,270
our products

691
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,030
should show

692
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,110
the emotional values

693
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,909
of Chinese consumers

694
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,670
and how these value trends evolve.

695
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,630
She is willing to use better materials...

696
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,030
It's less than a week

697
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,909
before the product reveal livestream.

698
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,840
Even I'm getting a little nervous.

699
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,860
What for?

700
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,670
I believe they

701
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,600
can handle it.

702
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,900
You think you can

703
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,310
support an entire factory

704
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,700
with your new online store

705
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,360
that has little to no traffic?

706
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,540
Probably not.

707
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,720
Pei and Jiang Hu

708
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,910
are already working on

709
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,510
the offline sales channels.

710
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,630
It was easier when we had

711
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,030
Free Unicorn's support.

712
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:19,950
Now,

713
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,070
the real test

714
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,400
for Ms. Jiang has begun.

715
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,300
It's okay.

716
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,230
Now that they are working together,

717
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,490
they can do it for sure.

718
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,940
There were many problems.

719
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,910
But

720
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:37,870
my boss

721
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,860
who is very wise with her words

722
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,250
told me there would always be a way.

723
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,210
Xiang Zhaoyang has streamed

724
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,140
for seven weeks.

725
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,280
Now,

726
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,870
the number of people watching her livestream

727
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,600
average at 100,000 to 150,000.

728
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,070
When their new product is launched,

729
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,820
it's hard to say how much of that viewership

730
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,950
will convert to actual transactions.

731
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,140
They played a good emotion card.

732
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,380
Just like crowdfunding.

733
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,060
The purpose

734
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,890
is to involve

735
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,880
the consumers' participation.

736
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,750
Have you found out

737
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,080
what their designs are?

738
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,630
Teng Yue did a good job

739
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,750
keeping it confidential this time.

740
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,280
No one has seen this series.

741
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,900
Jiang Hu

742
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,910
will be officially releasing

743
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,110
the new products during the

744
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,690
new product launch livestream in three days.

745
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,970
I finally understand.

746
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,020
This is the biggest reason why

747
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,380
she insisted on keeping

748
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,530
Teng Yue's factory.

749
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,190
This way, she can personally seize

750
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,250
the R&D and core production process.

751
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,010
She has done a good job online.

752
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,810
Many distributors

753
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,160
are ready to make a move.

754
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,280
Mr. Zhang,

755
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,430
we have to find a way.

756
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,370
I heard

757
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,050
Jiang Hu

758
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,410
will launch two products with different prices.

759
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,430
One of them

760
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,730
is priced at 189 yuan.

761
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,910
It directly clashes with the price of

762
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,440
Free Unicorn's leisure shoes.

763
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,140
We can't let them

764
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,670
take away our market share.

765
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,070
I made a big promise

766
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,160
about this year's performance

767
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,360
at the board meeting.

768
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:59,470
Maybe

769
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,740
we can talk to the distributor.

770
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,510
Fang's major agents

771
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,570
won't listen to me.

772
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,670
They may not

773
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,030
like Teng Yue now.

774
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,460
They won't offend us

775
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,610
for Teng Yue either.

776
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,530
The focus may be

777
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,180
on those small agents.

778
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,660
But those agents

779
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,680
are all hoping

780
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,760
to get goods from

781
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,640
Free Unicorn and the

782
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,370
other brands you're carrying.

783
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,000
If we keep a firm grasp on them,

784
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
won't it make matters easier for us?

785
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,350
Beauty,

786
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,550
I made an appointment

787
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,950
with Mr. Liu.

788
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,350
Sorry, Mr. Liu has something to do.

789
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,280
He just went out.

790
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,340
Just now?

791
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,120
Yes.

792
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,390
He really left?

793
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,190
Yes.

794
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,430
Sorry,

795
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,360
the subscriber you dialed

796
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,930
is unavailable.

797
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,230
Did he say

798
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,420
when he'll be back?

799
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,410
No.

800
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
I'm really sorry.

801
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,760
Okay.

802
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:28,390
Thank you.

803
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,310
Profit is the nature of a businessman.

804
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,630
The sales of Teng Yue Shoes

805
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,720
is not good enough.

806
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,110
Free Unicorn, on the other hand...

807
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,420
Although the group is disbanded,

808
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,740
the brand's

809
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,690
legacy remains.

810
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,550
We can't blame

811
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,520
those distributors

812
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,470
for prioritizing profit

813
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,270
and ignoring Jiang Hu,

814
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,870
the lone lady with no legacy.

815
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,830
Then again,

816
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,740
it hasn't been easy for Ms. Jiang.

817
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:58,580
Free Unicorn

818
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,910
was founded by her father.

819
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:00,990
Of course she doesn't want

820
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,250
this brand to suffer a setback.

821
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:02,990
But I think

822
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,290
what she doesn't want to see the most

823
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,410
is a stand-off

824
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,280
between Free Unicorn

825
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,720
and Teng Yuan.

826
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,510
Boss,

827
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,680
isn't it hard for Ms. Jiang?

828
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,790
They're using our own weapons to break our defense.

829
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,910
Nothing is more upsetting than this.

830
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,060
Free Unicorn held my father's legacy hostage

831
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,460
and continues to thrive.

832
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,030
But without my dad,

833
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,990
Teng Yue and I

834
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,290
struggle

835
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,460
to take every step.

836
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,600
Alright.

837
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,190
You...

838
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,070
Don't think about

839
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,330
those things anymore.

840
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,250
How about this?

841
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,760
I'm going all out

842
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,180
with my pride on the line.

843
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:13,990
I'll go plead with those

844
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,990
major distributors

845
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,720
and see if there's any room to turn things around.

846
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:18,810
Alright?

847
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,210
I'm afraid

848
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,130
it might not work.

849
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,390
Well,

850
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,390
how about

851
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,410
going to Xu Si

852
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,470
to see if he can help?

853
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,790
It's not that easy

854
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,580
to ask for help.

855
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,880
But

856
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,650
he is Teng Yue's shareholder.

857
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,750
It’s better than begging others.

858
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,850
Jiang Hu won't come to me.

859
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,010
When she needed money,

860
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,870
she sold her only luxury item

861
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:13,780
instead of asking me

862
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,190
to help her get a loan from the bank.

863
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,860
Her dignity

864
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,590
won't allow her to bow her head.

865
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,630
You're right.

866
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,030
But

867
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,340
who will sell

868
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,060
Teng Yue's new shoes offline?

869
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,230
I watched your livestream for Teng Yue.

870
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,190
The theme of Chinese-style

871
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,250
was a great choice.

872
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,890
Congratulations.

873
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,150
As a designer,

874
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,790
you can finally design

875
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,620
what you want to design the most.

876
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,670
Hearing that,

877
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,760
I feel much more relieved.

878
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,710
Don't worry.

879
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,550
I will never

880
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,310
let them down.

881
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,090
I'm sure you won't.

882
00:41:58,830 --> 00:41:59,760
One more thing.

883
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,720
I want to invite Teng Yue

884
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,720
to attend Lidu's New Chinese Fashion Festival.

885
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,470
This is also our first

886
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,470
major event before the

887
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,410
Chinese Fashion and Culture Festival

888
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,200
that involves

889
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,350
all our branches

890
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,240
in the country.

891
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,110
Really?

892
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,430
It's such a big event.

893
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,290
There must be

894
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,060
a lot of famous brands

895
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,260
participating in it.

896
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:19,390
But...

897
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,100
with Teng Yue's current condition,

898
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,710
are we qualified?

899
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,550
All I can do

900
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,510
is invite you in.

901
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:28,900
Whether you can succeed or not

902
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,950
depends on

903
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,050
your planning abilities.

904
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,380
The project team will be evaluating that.

905
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,630
Planning and marketing

906
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,990
are Jiang Hu's forte.

907
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,570
Have you

908
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,330
told Jiang Hu about it already?

909
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,050
I didn’t have time

910
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:46,750
to tell her.

911
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,670
Why don't you discuss it with her?

912
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:54,870
Dad.

913
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,150
You did it.

914
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:58,910
I can do it too.
