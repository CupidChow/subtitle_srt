Let's call it a day.

00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,270
Thank you, everyone.

7
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,430
Thank you.

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,860
Here's the coffee.

Zhaoyang.

10
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,550
We've filmed

11
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,430
five videos of you drawing on the shoes.

12
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,160
I think the material

13
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,690
may be a little repetitive.

14
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,230
Well,

15
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:28,950
I booked the

16
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,400
the Jinshan Beach event board.

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,350
Let's film there next time?

18
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,010
Sure.

19
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,180
I have to say, you look really comfortable

20
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,230
drawing on the shoes.

21
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,750
I'm sure it'll be wonderful after editing.

22
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,760
Of course.

23
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,210
Zhaoyang is a professional

24
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,490
shoe designer.

25
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,430
A person is most charming

26
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,630
when they're serious about their work.

27
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,870
Are you guys done?

28
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,530
That's great timing.

29
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,160
The dumplings are almost done.

30
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,760
Have lunch before you leave.

31
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,510
Every time we come,

32
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,270
we have to trouble you

33
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,410
to cook for us.

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,000
We're embarrassed.

35
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,550
It's okay, it's what I should do.

36
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,790
You are all colleagues of Zhaoyang

37
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,120
and you take care of her.

38
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,180
All right, wash your hands, come and eat.

39
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,070
Okay.

40
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,760
Zhaoyang, your brother is so nice.

41
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,320
How is it?

42
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,620

Mr. Gao,

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,380
The Marketing Department requested

45
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,840
to delay the dismantling of the boards by a week.

46
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,910
Brands are still requesting to conduct live broadcasts

47
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,110
in front of the board.

48
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,829
Our event

49
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:30,829
is so successful.

50
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,240
Our brand partners

51
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,370
have offered to allocate more budget

52
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,030
to support our future events.

53
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,579
Get the Marketing Department

54
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:40,390
to monitor our clients' needs closely.

55
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,270
The next six months

56
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,780
is a critical period for Lido's transformation.

57
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,670
We need strong support

58
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,600
from the brands.

59
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,510
Yes.

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,390
What are you laughing at?

61
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,220
They all said

62
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,390
that really

63
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,450
looks like you.

64
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:57,550
It's true.

65
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,350
We'll leave it then.

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,070
Yes, leave it.

67
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,670
Clean it up yourself.

68
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,430
It's okay.

69
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,480
Okay.

70
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,070
Thank you.

71
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:05,400
Okay.

72
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,710
Zhaoyang's brother, we're leaving.

73
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,590
Okay, bye.

74
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,600
See you next time.

75
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,590
Okay. Come again.

76
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,150
Okay.

77
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,910
Bye.

78
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:14,730
Bye.

79
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,630
Take care.

80
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:18,510
Bye.

81
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,060
Bye.

82
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,200
For me?

83
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,540
My ex-colleague gave it to me.

84
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,110
It's a new product that Aneda

85
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,310
hasn't launched yet.

86
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,580
They are doing

87
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,230
user experience research.

88
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,630
So try it on for a few days.

89
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,720
Okay.

90
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,750
I'll try it now.

91
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,610
It's perfect.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,800
What do you think? Do I look good?

93

fill out the section about how it feels on your feet.

101

right?

102
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,910
So what if I want to?

103
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,590
Just leave it there. I can do it.

104
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,610
It's okay. Let's do it together.

105

You're wiping your shoes?

112
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,960
What shoes are these, are they so precious?

113
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,150
Aren't these Aneda shoes?

114
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,470
Why haven't I seen them

144

turn the heat down a little?

145
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,230
It'll dry up.

146
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,550
Turn it off.

147
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,070
Okay I turned it off.

148
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,030
Let's eat when Zhaoyang comes back.

149

Didn't you see his face that day?

00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,230
Really.

156
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,050
You were impressive.

157
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,140
When your car came in...

158
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,150
I would've scared him with my phone.

159
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,270
Zhaoyang is back, hurry.

160
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,230
Hurry, we're waiting for you.

161

Hurry up.

162
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,080
Come on.

163
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,550
We've been waiting for you.

164
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,610
You must be hungry.

165
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:25,910
Have a seat.

166
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,590
Come on.

167
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,760
Perfect.

Hurry up, tell me what you want to talk about.

174
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,630
Come to Tengyue to be a designer.

175
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,840
Do you know what you're talking about?

176
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,590
I saw your collaboration with Lidu.

177
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,190
You drew on a lot of shoes.

This time, yet again...

355
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,420
I didn't expect

356
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,040
you would be like this

357
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,270
when you're drunk.

358
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,910
What did I do?

359
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,190
You did some

360
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,190
indescribable

361
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,470
and unspeakable

362
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,750
stuff.

363
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,930
-Let's keep drinking.
-Who is it?

364
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,920
Let's find a place to continue.

365
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,580
Xu Si.

366
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,390
Mr. Xu.

367
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,440
Let's keep drinking.

368
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,350
Do you need help?

369
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,590
No, no. Go back.

370
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,600
Are you kidding me?

371
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,800
You didn't

372
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,300
call a taxi, did you?

373
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,670
Who said I didn't?

374
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,510
The taxi will be here soon.

375
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,240
Don't worry.

376
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,250
Take care, Mr. Xu.

377
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,690
Go back.

378
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,070
What kind of taxi did you call?

379
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,030
Why is it so bumpy?

380
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,790
It's an SUV.

381
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,230
Sit tight.

382
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,750
It's overturned!

383
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,360
It's overturned!

384
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:20,720
No.

385
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,910
It's a roller coaster.

386
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,660
Roller coaster.

387
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,790
I like roller coasters.

388
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,970
They're exciting.

389
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,550
Yes, they are.

390
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,700
Pour me some liquor.

391
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,030
I want baijiu.

392
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,960
Okay.

393
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,780
The liquor is ready.

394
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,950
Coming.

395
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,850
Get up. Here comes the baijiu.

396
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:19,850
Jiang Hu.

397
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,870
Get up and drink.

398
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,020
Get up.

399
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,310
Come.

400
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,330
Here, Jiang Hu.

401
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,190
Why are you grabbing me?

402
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,510
Get up and drink.

403
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,270
Why are you grabbing me?

404
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,040
My hair.

405
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,870
Let go!

406
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,430
Let go!

407
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,030
Why are you biting me?

408
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,570
Let go.

409
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,620
Jiang Hu!

410
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,060
It hurts.

411
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,470
I don't understand.

412
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,710
Others see me

413
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,140
as capable and astute.

414
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,630
How did I become

415
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,060
a scumbag in your eyes?

416
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,920
Don't go off-topic.

417
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,250
Answer my question.

418
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,510
I'm almost at the office.

419
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,310
I have a meeting.

420
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,990
I have to go.

421
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,590
By the way,

422
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,310
are you coming to the office

423
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,310
to do a project presentation today?

424
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,230
Remember to return my tie to me.

425
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,380
Bye.

426
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,270
Indescribable

427
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,710
and unspeakable.

428
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,270
Financial capacity analysis

429
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,240
for investments in the finance industry

430
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,280
mainly includes

431
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,790
the company's

432
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,460
ability to make profit

433
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,950
in the finance industry,

434
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,470
its ability to repay debts

435
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,010
and its operational capabilities.

436
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,680
♫Come back when the sea becomes calm again♫

437

what's in the report.

Thomas,

456
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,130
do you have anything to add

457
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,400
for the industry trends

458
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,730

♫I want to♫

461
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,910

♫Write you a poem and a fairy tale♫

463

to inspect our business.

464
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,630
I'll talk more about the growth of

465
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,360
unicorns in the industry then.

466
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:05,970
Okay.

♫I don't know how to describe it♫

472
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,370
♫But it's just like you♫

473

♫Like you, while you are♫

474
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,940
♫So different and unique♫

475
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,730
Simon.

476
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,760
You're in a good mood today.

477
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,420
That's because you're here.

478
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,680
Cut it out.

479
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,430
Your current state

480
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,390
is totally different from

481
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,230
the last time

482
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,580
when I saw you in the UK.

483
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,550
Really?

484
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:07,870
Because

485
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,710
Baoxing's performance

486
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,640
has been improving steadily.

487
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,600
We feel like

488
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,610
we didn't let you down.

489
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,070
That's why he's relieved.

490
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,750
When Simon introduced Baoxing

491
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,950
to me,

492
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,470
I worked with you guys

493
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,730
because I trusted him.

494
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,630
Now it seems that Baoxing’s performance

495
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,830
has proved one thing.

496
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,920
That is, Simon and I

497
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,080
both have a good eye.

498
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,100
Okay, that's all for today.

499
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,550
By the way, Simon,

500
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,950
have you been single for a long time?

501
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,670
There's a vice president in our group,

502
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,950
a girl who's very outstanding.

503
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,890
I'll ask her out for you.

504
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,490
Let's have dinner together.

505
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,250
Don't make fun of me.

506
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,280
I'm not joking.

507
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,010
I'm serious.

508
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,540
A man's

509
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,130
career and family are equally important.

510
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,160
I have a girlfriend.

511
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,230
When did that happen?

512
00:25:59,320 --> 00:25:59,990
Which girl

513
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,550
can subdue a fox like you?

514
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,020
Mr. Xu, someone is looking for you.

515
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,280
The one who subdued me is here.

516
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,310
I can't accompany you for lunch.

517
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,430
I seek your understanding.

518
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,830
Sure, sure I understand.

519
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,670
I'll wait for news on your wedding then.

520
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,590
Bye.

521
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,360
Are you and Jiang Hu for real?

522
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,070
When did you

523
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,230
become so gossipy?

524
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,120
Are you just using her as your shield then?

525
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,710
But why did you

526
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,220
refuse Gary's kindness?

527
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,470
This is a good chance

528
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,600
to get closer to him.

529
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,710
You’re really making the most of your talents.

530
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,670
Not only will it be good for Baoxing,

531
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,110
but

532
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,210
for you too.

533
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,950
Gary is famous

534
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,070
for being a matchmaker.

535
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,710
He's introducing someone on his side

536
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,710
to his business partner.

537
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,920
Do you really think

538
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,320
he's just being warm-hearted?

539
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,850
What else could he be doing?

540
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,990
Don't tell me you're thinking of

541
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,270
sharing Baoxing's financial report

542
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,390
with a limited partner

543
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,230
like Gary

544
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,870
so he can take

545
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,260
more good projects

546
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,940
with joint-investment opportunities from us?

547
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:18,710
Mr. Du.

548
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,460
Okay.

549
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,040
Go on with your work.

550
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,770
Xu Si, last night...

551
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,860
During working hours, we'll only talk about work.

552
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:32,900
Take a seat.

553
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,640
We've recruited

554
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,070
all necessary staff for Teng Yue

555
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,150
and all production lines

556
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,610
are back to production.

557
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,750
My next focus will be

558
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,370
on signing designers.

559
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,900
Do you have a candidate?

560
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,450
It's hard to find designers for Teng Yue.

561
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,360
He needs to know Teng Yue's past

562
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,520
and design Teng Yue's future.

563
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,640
He has to get Teng Yue's new products out

564
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,470
as soon as possible

565
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,800
and open up a new market.

566
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,820
The way you said that

567
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,910
makes me sense

568
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,430
another meaning.

569
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,710
I've found

570
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,970
a suitable candidate.

571
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,900
You want to poach someone from me?

572
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,910
You can't say that.

573
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,550
In the human resource market,

574
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,630
it's a fair fight.

575
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,790
Although

576
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,590
we are both financed by Baoxing,

577
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,550
we hope

578
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,580
our efforts

579
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,190
will bring you more satisfactory profits.

580
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,570
From what you said,

581
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,200
it seems like you're doing this for me.

582
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,920
I know

583
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,150
you've never allowed

584
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,150
malicious competition

585
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,000
between all the companies

586
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,990
that Baoxing

587
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,150
has invested in.

588
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,030
So you know

589
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,910
my bottom line.

590
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,470
But I really don't have

591
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,900
a better candidate.

592
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:03,920
Tell me.

593
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,490
Who are you looking at?

594
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,310
Xiang Zhaoyang.

595
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:23,990
Not only is Xiang Zhaoyang

596
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,470
from TT Media,

597
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,400
but she also has a non-compete agreement with Aneda.

598
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,660
She can't be a designer within two years.

599
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,840
You know that right?

600
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,990
I know.

601
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,670
And she has no experience

602
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,470
being an independent designer.

603
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,090
I know that too.

604
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,880
So, what are you plotting?

605
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,390
The problem issue

606
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,200
with TT Media and Aneda

607
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,320
can be resolved.

608
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,750
It doesn't take away the talent

609
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,510
that Xiang Zhaoyang

610
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,090
has for designing shoes.

611
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,390
And as an influencer,

612
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,470
she also has her own sales channels.

613
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,710
She is more suitable

614
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,550
than other designers for Teng Yue,

615
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,880
which needs to open new markets urgently.

616
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,670
I really admire people

617
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,390
who impose challenges on themselves

618
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,830
even when there're no difficulties.

619
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,010
You're hardcore.

620
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,060
So, what do you think?

621
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,110
I'll think about it.

622
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,140
Anything else?

623
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,820
I'm waiting for your answer.

624
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,390
I didn't say I'll give you an answer now.

625
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,000
You said you'll think about it.

626
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,410
It's just

627
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,010
a polite way to phrase it.

628
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,000
It's like, let's talk about it another day.

629
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,460
Let's talk about it later.

630
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,760
Let's meet again sometime.

631
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,000
It's the same.

632
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,650
Teng Yue wants to poach Zhaoyang?

633
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,120
Well,

634
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,960
what about our

635
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,270
Shangchun Art Project?

636
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,930
Both Dus are paying close attention to it.

637
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,260
They're very interested in this project.

638
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,210
Did I say I would help Teng Yue?

639
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,450
Let TT Media

640
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,020
continue with the Shangchun Art Project.

641
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,970
Are you not going to let her go?

642
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,240
Okay.

643
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,670
At least for now,

644
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,990
influencer Zhaoyang

645
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,870
is more valuable to me than designer Zhaoyang.

646
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,930
Then we're doomed.

647
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,540
Teng Yue's definitely not going to meet

648
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,940
this quarter's targets.

649
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,780
Miss Jiang is bold

650
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,200
and dares to play tricks.

651
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,910
She's full of ideas.

652
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,390
Would she make a loss?

653
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,360
Do you think she should be happy

654
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,510
or sad that you trust her so much?

655
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,950
You're buying lunch.

656
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:46,880
Okay.

657
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,610
Why are you still here?

658
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,070
We're outside of working hours now.

659
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,070
It's lunch time.

660
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,560
Can we talk?

661
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,280
Isn't lunch time

662
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,610
meant for resting?

663
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,230
Xu Si.

664
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,330
How about this?

665
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,670
Treat me to a meal,

666
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,230
let's talk while eating.

667
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,170
There's a lot of things

668
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,220
I need to deal with for Teng Yue.

669
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,750
I don't have that much time.

670
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,360
When I'm hungry,

671
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,000
my memory gets really lousy,

672
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,400
right?

673
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,150
Yes.

674
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:21,840
He knows it best.

675
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,760
Yes, I do.

676
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,120
I'll choose what to eat.

677
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,520
Okay.

678
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,020
Don't you have work to do?

679
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,070
Go.

680
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,200
Don't you have work?

681
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,060
Weren't you going to buy me lunch?

682
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,190
I'm not following your motto anymore.

683
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,090
Wu Guanglei.

684
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,350
Wu Guanglei.

685
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,780
That means you'll never be fair and square.

686
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,080
I've been exposed.

687
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,980
What are you treating me to?

688
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:54,850
To this.

689
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,600
You like convenience stores so much?

690
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,150
Well, it's quick.

691
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,190
It's cheap.

692
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,800
And it suits me.

693
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,710
Why are you standing there?

694
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,310
Sit down.

695
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,940
I can't bring myself

696
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,980
to do that.

697
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,489
It's not like you haven't eaten this before.

698
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
That was at night.

699
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,120
It's different.

700
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,670
I said you're capitalist,

701
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,470
and now you really think

702
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,480
you're a vampire?

703
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,360
You can eat it at night

704
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,620
but not during the day?

705
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,510
Don't be so self-conscious.

706
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,590
All the passers-by are really busy today.

707
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,750
They won't have time to notice you.

708
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,480
Eat up.

709
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,620
Sit down.

710
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,190
Sit down.

711
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,320
Thank you, boss.

712
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,780
Okay, I'm done.

713
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:29,880
We can talk now.

714
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,590
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

715
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,680
Yes, I did.

716
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,230
So what?

717
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,990
I haven't seen anyone

718
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,830
who

719
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,960
makes it so obvious.

720
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,690
I said I don't have time.

721
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,950
And you agreed

722
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,210
to eat whatever I want.

723
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,310
What good does it do

724
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,390
for you to offend me,

725
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:49,920
Jiang Hu?

726
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,080
I do get something.

727
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:51,780
What?

728
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,430
I get to relieve my anger.

A cover-up reveals the truth.

Xiang Zhaoyang

signed a full five-year contract with me.

If you insist on hiring her,

815

you should know

816
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,060
you'll have to pay

817
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,660
tens of millions in penalty.

818

Ms. Song, you must be joking.

821

Tens of millions is indeed too much.

Xiang Zhaoyang is worth that much

Otherwise,

831
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,430
why would we keep a legal department

832

833
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,840

If the case drags on for one or two years,

838
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,790
it won't do us any harm.

839

I won't keep you.

841
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,810
You studied at Cambridge too?

Ms. Jiang.

Okay.

861
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,970
Thank you.
I’ll put it here.

862
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,330
