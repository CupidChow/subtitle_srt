What do you mean?

6
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,509
You mean it's my mistake?

7
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,190
Although you foresaw

8
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,330
the prospect of rubber soles 30 years ago,

9
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,000
replaced multi-layered cloth soles with rubber soles,

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,470
and developed

11
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,970
the affordable rubber-sole cloth shoes series,

12
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,250
over the past few years,

13
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,530
Cloud Footwear's shoes haven't been good,

14
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,060
whether in terms of design,

15
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,520
style, or color.

16
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,870
With all due respect,

17
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,900
if it weren't for your long-term relationship

18
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,110
with those state-owned department stores,

19
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,370
I'm afraid Cloud Footwear would have closed down long ago.

20
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,710
Do you know

21
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,670
why your father's Free Unicorn

22
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,730
couldn't last for more than 30 years?

23

Yes.

24
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,070
He knew the market well,

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,770
and he was good at sales,

26
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,390
but he liked

27
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,040
to make quick money.

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,520
He was never willing

29
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,930
to spend time on product research.

30
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,590
As a 30-year-old brand,

31

its core competitiveness.

33
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,360
It only survived

34
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,800
to this point by maneuvering capital.

35
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,790
You've been working for Teng Yue for over a year.

36
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,480
I saw what you've done.

37
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,910
You're just like your dad.

38
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,930
You like phony things

39
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,180
like sales and design

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,570

41
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,690
You've never settled down

42
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,040
to do research

43
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,970

44
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,320
develop good products.

45

49
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,670

really angry this time.

88
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,550

00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,710
you would

90

your breakup this time was the same as before.

96
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,600

97

She definitely doesn't hate me either.

108

109

I'm already a "mama's boy".

112
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,320
am I a man or not?

113
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,520

I'll make you some breakfast.

120
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,230

121
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,390
No.

122
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,540
I have a morning company meeting at 10.

123
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,360
Morning meeting?

124
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,270
But your company's morning meeting isn't at this time.

125
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,590
Not my company.

126

It's Teng Yue.

Cloud Footwear's shoes

128
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,560
don't sell well now, right?

129
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,790
What do you think?

130
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,390
They only make a few old types of cloth shoes.

131
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,050
They have too few categories.

132
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,990
Although they got many patents,

133
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,140
the conversion rate of patents into products

134
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,270
isn't high.

135
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,340
Their distribution channels lack diversity,

136
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,640
and their e-commerce hasn't been doing well.

137
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,790
Their problems are quite similar

138
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,650
to Teng Yue's problems back then.

139
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,790
So you've figured out

140
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,560
what to do?

141
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,670
Old cloth shoes

142
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,850
are the traditional shoes

143
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,910
of Chinese people.

144
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,780
They have 3000 years of history.

145
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,830
They came into being even earlier

146
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,630
than clogs and ramie sole shoes.

147
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,800
With such a historical background,

148
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,710
cloth shoes themselves are an icon,

149
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,590
and an element

150
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,190
with great cultural impact.

151
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,000
If we can extend this element

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,640
to other categories,

153
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,510
there's a variety of things we can do.

154
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,370
Soon, it will also become a part of Chinese fashion.

155
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,390
This industry

156
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,790
really suits you well.

157
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,740
It's in our family.

158
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,260
Yes.

159
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,909
I'm resigning next month.

160
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,330
Ms. Song,

161
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,909
you don't have to do that for me...

162
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:40,510
No, no, no.

163
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,450
It's not entirely because of you.

164
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,860
Actually, I should consider

165
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,890
retiring at my age.

166
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,470
Besides, my daughter is pregnant.

167
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,620
I thought

168
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,350
I'd resign

169
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,550
after you find

170
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,750
a new sales director.

171
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,110

He's been working

176
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,380
at Teng Yue this week.

177
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,790
The new

178
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,230
managing director,

179
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,020
the new

180
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,250
marketing director,

181
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,390
and the new deputy factory director

182
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,850
were all recruited by him.

183
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,910
Not bad.

184
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,890
They're quite professional.

185
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,310
I didn't expect that.

186
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,230
No matter what,

187
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,000
Ms. Song,

188
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
thank you

189
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,850
for what you did during this time.

190
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll keep an eye on you.

191
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,760
Let's keep in touch.

192
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,710
Of course.

193
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,480
Hello, Mom.

194
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,870
Sweetie.

195
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,770
I'm viewing houses again.

196
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,320
This house is not bad.

197
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,200
The kitchen and the bathroom

198
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,170
are both okay.

199
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,790
It's not overly large.

200
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,710
There are two rooms facing south.

201
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,070
The traffic here is convenient.

202
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,110
There's a subway station right downstairs.

203
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,170
It's convenient for you to go to work.

204
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,230
It's just the price

205
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,580
is a bit high.

206
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,870
A little higher than your budget.

207
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,310
7,500 yuan a month.

208
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,440
Sweetie, don't you think it's a catch?

209
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,830
Mom, didn't you say you have rheumatism?

210
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,380
It's not suitable for you to live by the river.

211
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,550
Not suitable?

212
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,470
Even so, you should come and take a look.

213
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,950
You always say it's not suitable.

214
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,780
I've viewed 5 houses.

215
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,280
It's also tiring for me.

216
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,230
Okay, I got it.

217
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,950
I'm still at work.

218
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,980
Let's talk about it when I'm back.

219
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,260
Did you catch any?

220
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,590
Is there any fish?

221
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,360
Why are you here?

222
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,440
I helped auntie

223
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,970
to move quite a lot of things

224
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,850
up and down the stairs.

225
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:06,950
I'm exhausted.

226
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,740
I wanted to ask you

227
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,340
if there's any overtime pay.

228
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,830
Thank you.

229
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,310
So you agreed

230
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,230
to let them move out?

231
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,870
Life has to go on.

232
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,310
After they leave,

233
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,250
I should change my habits too.

234
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,470
Years ago,

235
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,070
I've started wondering

236
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,710
why you have such strong feelings

237
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,840
for Zhaoyang.

238
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,520
What exactly do you like about her?

239
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,610
You don't know, do you?

240
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,510
No.

241
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,470
We grew up together.

242
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,610
The image of her in my eyes

243
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,960
is different from what others think of her.

244
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,870
Everyone else thinks she's cold, distant,

245
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,470
and hard to get close to.

246
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,760
But I know

247
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,480
she is actually

248
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,310
a warm-hearted person with a cold appearance.

249
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,590
She knows her mother

250
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,890
is not reliable.

251
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,630
But she also knows

252
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,590
it's not been easy for her mother to raise her.

253
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,920
So she works extremely hard to make money.

254
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,140
She likes design,

255
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,070
and she tries her best.

256
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,860
She sacrificed too much

257
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,460
and got too little in return.

258
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,490
It's actually not fair to her.

259
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,500
No one gets her.

260
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,690
I know you feel sorry for her.

261
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,890
But she...

262
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,000
That's your ten years after all.

263
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,360
You know what?

264
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,430
When she told me

265
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,690
she wanted to marry me,

266
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,640
I was so happy.

267
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,610
I thought

268
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,990
even if she doesn't have

269
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,390
the same feelings for me,

270
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,230
at least she knows

271
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,990
how I feel.

272
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,440
I still have a chance,

273
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,960
and we can take our time.

274
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,010
Now

275
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,580
I finally wake up.

276
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,160
I've never

277
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,450
made it into her world.

278
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,780
She doesn't want me to get in, either.

279
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,590
Mr. Xu.

280
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,310
It's so late.

281
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,570
Why are you still here?

282
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,350
You still couldn't reach

283
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,510
Jiang Hu?

284
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:03,970
No.

285
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,370
She even deleted my WeChat as well.

286
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,110
Now,

287
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,260
I'm just like you.

288
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,510
I can't reach her

289
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,410
through WeChat or by phone.

290
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,460
But

291
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,000
Yang Jian told us

292
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,550
she's doing well.

293
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,660
He told us not to worry about her.

294
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,590
What is this?

295
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,150
The Smart Shoe Production Line.

296
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,830
Let Zhang Sheng and the other old masters

297
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,760
take a look at it.

298
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,040
Go to their R&D Center

299
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,740
with me in a few days

300
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,710
to do a test.

301
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,190
I didn't expect

302
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,280
you'd not only be in charge of HR,

303
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,010
but also the production line.

304
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,490
I didn't expect it myself either.

305
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,060
So

306
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,660
Aneda's staff

307
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,610
won't come in Teng Yue yet?

308
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,440
I know

309
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,730
it's quite hard for you

310
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,260
to live outside alone.

311
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,070
And I know

312
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,190
you like pure cotton bedding.

313
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,470
So I thought I'd replace your bedsheet

314
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,190
with a pure cotton one.

315
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,360
That Song Jiali...

316
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,880
She's really...

317
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,340
It's really unkind of her.

318
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,950
She knows where you live,

319
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,470
but she refused

320
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,670
to bring me to see you.

321
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,710
I had to

322
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,710
follow her

323
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,970
to find where you live.

324
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,830
What...

325
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,950
What do you mean?

326
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,750
Do you still think of me

327
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,750
as your uncle?

328
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,630
Do you know

329
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,710
how hard it was for me to find you?

330
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,430
I'm like

331
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,830
a private detective now.

332
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,900
Uncle, your nagging is giving me a headache.

333
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,970
You have a headache?

334
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,830
My headache is even more serious.

335
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,560
You just left like that.

336
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,830
You let them have what we achieved

337
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,950
so easily

338
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,110
and left me there to guard it alone.

339
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,110
Do you know how hard it's been for me?

340
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,950
How hard?

341
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,840
Isn't it good?

342
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,560
Xu Si recruited someone

343
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,190
to share your work pressure.

344
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,590
Good?

345
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,150
What's good about that?

346
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,520
Xu Si

347
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,030
is such a traitor.

348
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,300
He's even more cruel

349
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,720
and vicious than Liu Jun.

350
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,150
I finally saw his true colors

351
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,380
of a greedy

352
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,859
and ruthless capitalist.

353
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,940
He's so good at being bad.

354
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,869
You know?

355
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,310
First, he forced you to leave.

356
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,869
Then, he found someone new

357
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,650
to threaten my position.

358
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,130
It's like

359
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,560
he kicked down the ladder

360
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,349
and tried to exterminate us.

361
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:25,910
If I had known

362
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,390
he was like this,

363
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,790
I'd...

364
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,280
Don't.

365
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,480
Don't look.

366
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,740
You'd what?

367
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,670
I'm sorry.

368
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,030
I'm...

369
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,200
I'm sorry, Niece.

370
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,820
Bad uncle.

371
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,560
Well...

372
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,950
It's common for people in our family

373
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,900
to misjudge people.

374
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,170
Look at your dad,

375
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,690
you, and me.

376
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,560
Right?

377
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,910
Since I misjudged him,

378
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,750
I have to accept it and admit we're unlucky.

379
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,560
Right?

380
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,030
Since we're doing business,

381
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,720
it's...

382
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,670
It's inevitable

383
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,070
to be mistaken.

384
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,150
Right?

385
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:54,790
Right?

386
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,850
You really started working for Cloud Footwear?

387
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,620
Great.

388
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,630
Great.

389
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,470
If this isn't the place for me,

390
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,750
I'll find somewhere else to stay.

391
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,990
Since you are there,

392
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,380
get that place ready.

393
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,890
I'll go

394
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,390
find you in a few days.

395
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,570
I'll go find you.

396
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,720
What?

397
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,630
Are you kidding me?

398
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,710
Of course not.

399
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,240
I'll hand in my resignation letter to Xu Si tomorrow.

400
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,340
I'll quit too.

401
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,720
Uncle.

402
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,230
There are enough elders

403
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,470
in Cloud Footwear.

404
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,470
If you come too,

405
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,910
we won't be able to afford it.

406
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,310
You...

407
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,520
You...

408
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,850
What do you mean by that?

409
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,840
You also want to be like Xu Si,

410
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,900
kick down the ladder

411
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,660
and abandon me?

412
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,760
I'm almost 65 years old.

413
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,770
You know?

414
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,150
Can you bear

415
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,630
to let me retire like that?

416
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,870
Exactly, Uncle.

417
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,120
So you know you're almost 65?

418
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,830
It's time for you to retire.

419
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,590
I can't.

420
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,750
You know? I can't.

421
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,910
Look what you did.

422
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,950
Look how well

423
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:00,710
you ran Teng Yue,

424
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,230
right?

425
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,940
We two made a good team

426
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,770
and created

427
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,720
a miracle

428
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,780
for Teng Yue.

429
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,400
Now,

430
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,240
since you started working for Cloud Footwear,

431
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,760
we two can work together again.

432
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,570
-Uncle!
-Right?

433
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:12,950
Although I

434
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,270
don't have much talent,

435
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,960
as long as

436
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,150
I'm by your side,

437
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,470
I can help you make decisions.

438
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,470
I can provide you with ideas, right?

439
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:26,490
[Jishi Hotel Apartment]
[No. 806]

440
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,910
Welcome.

441
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,620
Ms. Jiang.

442
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,650
I’m surprised you'd come to me.

443
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,210
Why are you surprised?

444
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,810
When I saw

445
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,950
the proposal you and Alan

446
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,910
made for Teng Yue

447
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,430
on behalf of FW,

448
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,390
I knew

449
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,750
you're able to make better designs.

450
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,090
Alan

451
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,610
went to Teng Yue.

452
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,710
I know.

453
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,520
Luckily, you didn't go with him.

454
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,100
So we can still work together.

455
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,960
Work together?

456
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,310
This is the product I'm working on.

457
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,870
The design isn't very good.

458
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,230
Your style is simple, clear,

459
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,930
and modern.

460
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,620
I hope

461
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,340
you can make a few designs for us.

462
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,760
Ms. Jiang.

463
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,220
You are really interesting.

464
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,990
Recently,

465
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,990
there's been a saying in the industry.

466
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,670
I wonder if you've heard of it.

467
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:42,710
Go ahead.

468
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,020
Although Jiang Hu is no longer in the martial world ("Jiang Hu" has the meaning of "martial world"),

469
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,410
stories of Jiang Hu

470
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,900
are still

471
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,460
all over the martial world.

472
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,030
The martial world

473
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,310
may lose some color because someone's gone,

474
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,440
but it will always be the martial world

475
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,820
no matter who's gone.

476
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:05,910
Here.

477
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,470
How do you feel?

478
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,130
Are these shoes comfortable?

479
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,740
Have some fruits.

480
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:12,810
Good.

481
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,510
I'll peel an orange.

482
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,790
You're here.

483
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,230
Dad.

484
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,400
I want to have fruits.

485
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,540
All right. A minute.

486
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,000
Let me do it.

487
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,610
Does it have seeds?

488
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,080
Thank you.

489
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,470
You've come to visit my dad a lot

490
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,220
these days.

491
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
I brought him

492
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,590
a pair of Cloud Footwear's old cloth shoes.

493
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,540
These shoes are extra soft.

494
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,600
They are suitable for elders to wear.

495
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,520
Shoes.

496
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,830
New shoes.

497
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,790
I'm glad you like them, Uncle.

498
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,750
Are you busy

499
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,150
with these shoes lately?

500
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,150
I started working for Cloud Footwear.

501
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,680
I'm in charge of marketing.

502
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:18,670
Good.

503
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,230
You're good at it.

504
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,070
I'm relieved to see

505
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,470
you're back on your feet.

506
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,450
But I didn't expect

507
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,020
I'd come all the way

508
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,760
back to the starting point.

509
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,510
I encountered the old problems all over again.

510
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,370
Is there anything I can help with?

511
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,480
Nothing really.

512
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,710
Every step is hard, but every step has to be taken.

513
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,150
There are many things that I have to deal with

514
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,470
by myself.

515
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,240
Still, you can complain to me.

516
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,990
There are

517
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,250
two biggest problems.

518
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,710
One is related to human relations.

519
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,630
I still don't get along

520
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,200
with that stubborn factory director.

521
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,360
The other

522
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,490
is about money.

523
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,950
Cloud Footwear's net profit is very low.

524
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,630
The old factory director

525
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,960
doesn't want to spend money on marketing.

526
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,660
He thinks it's troublesome.

527
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,750
I believe

528
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:09,790
you have your own way

529
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,790
to deal with the problem of

530
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,790
human relations.

531
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,080
You handled it very well

532
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,480
when you were in Teng Yue.

533
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,940
As for the money...

534
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,960
I'm done.

535
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,030
Have one more.

536
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,080
Here.

537
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:31,990
Xingyan Video

538
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,250
has a new variety show,

539
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,030
called The Age of Entrepreneurship.

540
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,630
It's to help

541
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,950
investors to find projects openly,

542
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,870
and it also provides founders

543
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,670
with a stage to showcase their projects.

544
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,710
They've contacted

545
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,180
our company with the willingness to cooperate.

546
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,910
They rated this show as Class S.

547
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,870
That means Xingyan

548
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,430
attaches great importance to this variety show.

549
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,320
And they can offer

550
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,320
quite a lot of promotion resources.

551
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,530
You mean...

552
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,750
I'll try to recommend you

553
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,210
to their producer.

554
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,150
Okay.

555
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,190
Thank you.

556
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,870
We don't need to say thank you to each other.

557
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,460
Uncle, do you want more oranges?

558
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,350
Have one more.

559
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,270
Are you really going to

560
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,530
move Teng Yue into a new industrial park?

561
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,380
Aneda's factory

562
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,290
isn't in that industrial park...

563
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,230
Do you plan to keep working

564
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,230
in Teng Yue?

565
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,960
Are you not going back to Aneda?

566
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,990
It was my promise to Jiang Hu

567
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,790
to make Teng Yue great when I started working here.

568
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,230
I don't

569
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,790
make promises easily.

570
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,930
Since I've made a promise,

571
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,630
I'll keep it.

572
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,570
Saying this now,

573
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,490
do you think

574
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,640
it's belated?

575
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,690
If Jiang Hu knows,

576
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,390
will she be happy?

577
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,410
As one of the people

578
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,470
who hurt her the most,

579
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,510
I have no right

580
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,040
to ask for her forgiveness.

581
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:24,910
But I don't know

582
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,910
what I can do

583
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,430
to make her happy.

584
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,840
Holding on to Teng Yue

585
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,190
is the best thing

586
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,470
I can do

587
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,280
for her, myself,

588
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,520
and Teng Yue.

589
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,230
Find her

590
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,880
and talk to her.

591
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,860
What should I talk to her about?

592
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,910
Talk about you,

593
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,960
the major shareholder and

594
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,470
investor of Teng Yue.

595
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,030
Now you even started

596
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,160
to do store inspections

597
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,970
with me.

598
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,630
Sorry.

599
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,420
I was informed of this meeting at short notice.

600
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,220
I can't drive you back directly.

601
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:14,670
How about

602
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,800
I call a taxi for you?

603
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,230
It's okay. The subway is not far ahead.

604
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,410
It's very convenient.

605
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,900
Okay, take care.

606
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,530
I'm leaving.

607
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,840
Why don't you go?

608
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,340
I have something else to do.

609
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:43,770
Okay.

610
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,320
Let's go.

611
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,220
Stop for a second.

612
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,130
Let's go.

613
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,490
This is a Welsh Corgi.

614
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,920
It's a medium-sized dog.

615
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,230
Look here.

616
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,080
This is an English Bulldog.

617
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,970
It's also a medium-sized dog.

618
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,600
Look.

619
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,040
Look over here.

620
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,950
This one up here

621
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,210
is a French Bulldog.

622
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,770
It's a small-sized dog.

623
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,650
What about this one?

624
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,430
This is also a French Bulldog.

625
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,240
Look.

626
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,200
But its physique

627
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,030
is a little bigger than this one.

628
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,050
It's also a medium-sized dog.

629
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,000
Look.

630
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:10,650
Come here.

631
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,650
Look over here.

632
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,210
Isn't it great?

633
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,470
It's adorable.

634
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,520
This one up here

635
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,670
is a French Bulldog.

636
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,420
It's a small-sized dog.

637
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,800
A small female dog.

638
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,130
Take a look over here.

639
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,700
What is it looking at?

640
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,790
It's thinking about life.

641
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,530
Kid is so cute.

642
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,180
Boy.

643
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,290
I made a deal with your parents.

644
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,550
You have a lot of homework to do,

645
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,950
and they are busy with work.

646
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,680
So I'll take care of Kid for you.

647
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,880
If you want to see it,

648
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,700
you can come anytime.

649
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,390
It's only a few hundred meters away anyway.

650
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,940
How could you do this?

651
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,470
Mr. Xu, you're cheating.

652
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,750
Kid is mine.

653
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,410
Why are you the one to raise it?

654
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,950
Because I'm an adult.

655
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,770
I have more knowledge

656
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,280
and more money to raise it,

657
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,800
and I'm more attentive than you.

658
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,330
My parents are also adults,

659
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,610
and they're also rich.

660
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,070
Given your parents' frequency of going on business trips,

661
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,070
your family owes a lot to me

662
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,870
that you could grow up like this.

663
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,270
You...

664
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,140
You adults are bullies.

665
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,740
No.

666
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,890
I'm going to complain to Miss Jiang Hu.

667
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:14,950
Let's go.

668
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,430
Kid. Come with me.

669
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,470
Kid.

670
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,270
Come with me.

671
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,610
Kid, come with me.

672
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,440
Come with me.

673
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,030
Miss Jiang Hu.

674
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,950
I have a dog now.

675
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,520
I'll show you next time.

676
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,310
Let's meet.

677
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,740
I miss you so much.

678
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,680
Sure.

679
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,160
I'll take you out

680
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,220
when I'm free.

681
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,020
This is my Kid.

682
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,400
It's the smaller version of Boss

683
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,490
in my heart.

684
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:09,790
But it

685
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,280
fell into Mr. Xu's hands.

686
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,900
He broke his promise

687
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,000
and took my puppy to raise it himself.

688
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,270
I'm so angry.

689
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,460
Boss...

690
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,950
We're home.

691
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,320
Come out.

692
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:48,950
Let me hug you.

693
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,160
Let me hug you.

694
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,590
You

695
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,910
are the first dog I have

696
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,990
in my life.

Recently,

770
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,810
I've been viewing houses for Zhaoyang.

771
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:11,910
I think

772
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,110
she's determined to move out this time.

773
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,230
I know.

774
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,110
If you need any help

775
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:18,870
with moving.

776
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,800
just let me know.

777

between you two.

779
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,030
But you two

780
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,870
grew up together.

781
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,590
You're the closest family.

00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,550
Even if you're not married,

783
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,350
you're still friends,

784
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:30,830
right?

785
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:31,990
I know.

786
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,460
She has a bad temper.

787
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,270
Just be more

788
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,430
tolerant

789
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,870
and bear with her, okay?

790
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,790
Mom, Zhaoyang is great.

791
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,390
She's not as weak as you said.

792
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,610
And she doesn't need me to take care of her.

793
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,750
On the contrary,

794
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,470
you are her only family

795
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,450
in this world.

796
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,100
And she loves you the most.

797
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:49,950
All these years,

798
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,310
she has been working hard

799
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,750
to take good care of you.

800
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,470
Since she grew up,

801
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,770
she has been indulging you.

802
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:55,790
So, as long as you

803
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,110
don't cause her any more trouble,

804
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,360
you two will live happily

805
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,420
with or without me.

806
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,370
I disagree.

807
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,110
I already signed up.

808
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,790
Whether you agree or not,

809
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,650
I will participate in The Age of Entrepreneurship.

810
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,670
Cloud Footwear is not short of money.

811
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,190
I even rejected

812
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,430
Aneda's acquisition.

813
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,540
Now you are

814
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,270
going on an entrepreneurship show

815
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,440
to find investors?

816
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,160
Isn't that a slap in my face?

817
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,380
You can

818
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,950
think that Cloud Footwear is not short of money,

819
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,190
and you may not care about investment,

820
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,520
but I do.

821
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,910
I care if I can get an advertising space

822
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,470
on the front page

823
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,550
of the E-commerce Shopping Festival

824
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,900
in 4 months.

825
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:45,730
Wait, wait.

826
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,370
Wait, wait.

827
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,290
What advertising space?

828
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,630
What does this have to do

829
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,790
with participating in that show?

830
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,670
Let me tell you.

831
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,150
We never advertise randomly

832
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,780
for online sales.

833
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,150
Don't.

834
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,310
Don't you

835
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,550
do those phony things.

836
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,580
Don't worry.

837
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,950
I won't spend a penny of your budget

838
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,090
to participate in this show.

839
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,070
It's free?

840
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,880
You can't do whatever you want just because it's free.

841
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,670
All right, I've reported to you.

842
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,070
I'm getting back to work.

843
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,860
I didn't agree.

844
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,870
I can't hear you.

845
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,800
I have to defend from both outside and inside.

846
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,260
It's almost impregnable like chicken soup.

847
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,430
So this is

848
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,030
the No.1 Napoleon cake?

849
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,230
I heard it's even a limited edition.

850
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,310
It's expensive,

851
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,980
but it's sold out

852
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,870
before 10 a.m. every day.

853
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,070
Jiang Hu, you really have connections.

854
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,670
I just bought it by chance.

855
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,230
Nice things

856
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,790
have to be shared.

857
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:46,850
Try it.

858
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,290
-Is it good?
-It's delicious.

859
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:55,370
No wonder people can't get it even if they line up for it.

860
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,400
It's delicious.

861
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,400
Zhu.

862
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,390
I checked

863
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,360
the previous financial reports

864
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,230
of our factory's Marketing Department.

865
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,000
It seems the design fee

866
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,360
was also included in the marketing budget.

867
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,230
So,

868
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,050
other than the material fee,

869
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,010
like posters and direct-mail fee,

870
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,120
is product design fee

871
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,840
also included?

872
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,960
The annual sales volume

873
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,440
is less than 300,000.

874
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,750
If the product design fee is included,

875
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,100
that should be the best.

876
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,380
As long as the price is transparent

877
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,390
and the procedure is clear,

878
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,910
the factory will surely approve it.

879
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,470
Right?

the procedure of marketing budget application.

No hurry.

Eat first.

885
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:37,760
Okay.

886
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,400
It's delicious.

887

Eat more.

Why did you

develop this all of a sudden?

895
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,390
You're not making wontons anymore?

Even an old restaurant

897

Let me tell you.

905
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,930
If you want to do something well,

906
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,790
you have to have the genes for it.

907
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,400
Your genes

908

are for making wontons.

Genes are inborn,
