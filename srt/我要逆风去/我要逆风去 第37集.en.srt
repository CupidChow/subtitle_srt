to make a full evaluation

66

you need a means of transportation,

67
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,030

78

I don't need it. Keep it for yourself.

79
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,909
No.

80
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,120
It's getting cold.

81
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,080
Try it on.

82
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,780
I think it suits you.

83
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:49,440
I mean it.

84
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,790
I really don't need it.

85
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,110
I have lots of scarves at home.

86
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,470
I barely wear them.

87
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,170
Try it on.

88
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,710
It suits you.

89
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,510
Look at you.

90
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,790
You don't wear anything around your neck

91

92
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,710

93
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,590

94

95
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,990
It's warm now, right?

96
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,730
Thank you for sending my scooter

97
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,350
to Changle Restaurant.

98
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,110

That boy

108
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,350
looked like a teenager

109
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,080
yet had started chasing girls.

110
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,470
You can't do that after you grow up.

111

Understand?

112
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,710
Do you think

113
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,310
she doesn't want me anymore?

114
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,330
Don't worry.

115

Your mom doesn't want you,

119

I officially resigned from Teng Yue today.

122

It was my fault.

128

You could've had a rest.

129

all your decisions

133

thank you.

144

146
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,810
I accept

30 years.

149
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,720
I devoted half of my life

to Free Unicorn and Teng Yue.

151

Both you and your dad

152
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,510
were the best bosses I'd ever worked for.

153
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,420
For me, these 30 years

154
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,370
was worth it.

155

Ms. Yue.

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,480
Free Unicorn and Teng Yue

157

are both in the past.

158
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,110
You shouldn't let them

159
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,600
hold you back.

160
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,770
You know,

161
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,410
I met you when you were just this tall

162
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,710
and watched you grow up.

163
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,770
In the past year,

164
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,330
I've watched you start your business

165
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,570
and gradually become the girl you are now.

166
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,350
I can finally be relieved

167
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,760

168
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,770
for sure

169
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,180
that now,

170
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,860
you're strong enough

171
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,030
to face all the ups and downs

172

175
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,280
I'm surprised.

176
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,000
Ms. Yue is still so cool

177

at her age.

178
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:43,950
She let go of everything

179
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,830
and left

180
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,240
to travel around the world.

181
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,750
Yeah.

Jiang Hu said

183
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,150
women in this era

184
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,750
have the ability and right

185

to decide how to live their lives.

186
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,750
She's right.

187
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,690
I heard

188
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,750
that the show Jiang Hu is going on

189
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,350
has invited Xu Si as a tutor.

190
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,230
Is Jiang Hu really going on that show?

191
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,620
Sure. Why not?

192
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,770
I dare him to play dirty tricks again.

193
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,960
Life is so unpredictable.

please come here and draw a number.

This way.

202

You got Tutor 3.

very strict

212
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,630
and asks tricky questions.

213
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,590
It's true.

214
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,150
How about Tutor 3?

is Xu Si from Baoxing Investment.

217

Baoxing Investment?

218
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,590
He's the youngest

219
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,790
among all the tutors.

220
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,220
He likes investing

221
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,840
in new forms of consumption,

222
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,510

financial services, and technology.

224
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,630
You know,

225

industries like those.

226
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,150
So,

will have no chance with him?

230
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,890
No.

231
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,200
Wrong industries.

232
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,750
Yeah.

233
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,370
What a pity.

234
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,160
Mr. Xu, you're Tutor 3.

235
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,230
You'll use Room 3.

236
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,590
Mr. Mei from Jingyang Capital

237
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,580
is Tutor 4.

238

He'll use Room 4.

239
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,710
By the way,

240
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,110
the tutors will interview the entrepreneurs today

241
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:42,990
to learn about their projects

242
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,290
and give them preliminary scores.

243
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,750
It's not anything official.

244
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,970
They're drawing straws to decide which tutor they'll meet.

245
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,600
Two tutors arrived early

246
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,530
and have started the interviews.

247
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,710
The odds are one to four.

248
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,410
What did you say?

249
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,470
Nothing.

250
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,590
Please.

with 100 years of history.

in the country for cloth shoe production.

270
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,950
Its hand-made, 1000-layer sole

obtained seven patents.

Those two advantages are far from enough.

280

Do you mind meeting Tutor 4?

No.

301
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:29,920
Come with me.

302
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,180
Ms. Jiang.

See you later.

305
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,350
Sorry.

306

It's okay. Thank you.

307
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,480
You just missed her.

308

What?

309
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,850
Guess who I interviewed just now.

310
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:00,790
Who?

311
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,440
Miss Shoe Dog.

312
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,150
She loves making and selling shoes.

313
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,270
So she's a shoe dog.

314
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,770
Miss Shoe Dog is the best nickname

315
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,099
for Ms. Jiang, isn't it?

316
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,190
Stop looking.

317
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:11,910
She's gone.

318
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,390
Why are you so annoying?

319
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:17,520
Annoying?

320
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,430
I'm

321
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,069
very considerate, okay?

322
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,770
Don't worry.

323
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,609
I cut her some slack

324
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,890
and let her pass.

325
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,230
Just wait

326
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,630
to be reunited with her under the spotlight.

327
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,000

Uncle Xu.

337
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,000
My dad told me you went through a breakup.

338
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,710
Miss Jiang Hu dumped you.

339
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,160
I didn't know

340
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,430
your dad was so nosy.

341
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,450
You were dumped.

342
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,470
Would you like a beer?

343
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,220
That's what they would do on TV shows.

344
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,410
My mom just bought some beers

345
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,870
and cooled them in the fridge.

346
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,390
They can calm you down.

347
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,470
I'm very calm now.

348
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,720
I don't need a beer.

349
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,010
I think you're anything but calm.

350
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,700
I understand.

351
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,190
You adults

352
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,650
are under great pressure.

353
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,390
Thank you.

354
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,230
You're so sweet.

355
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,660
Since you're so sad,

356
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,560
I'll let Kid stay at your place

357
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,790
to keep you company.

358
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,880
I'm very generous.

359
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,710
You're so nice.

360
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,870
As your friend,

361
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,330
can I do something for you?

362
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,710
Just stop talking

363
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:09,910
and quietly

364
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,790
stay here with me

365
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,850
for a little while.

366
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,240
Alex.

367
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,270
Well,

368
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,230
when can you give me

369
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,090
the new designs of men's clothes?

370
00:19:47,900 --> 00:20:01,380
[Soon. The day after tomorrow.]

371
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,230
Jiang Hu took a job at Cloud Footwear.

372
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,630
I'm not surprised at all.

373
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,710
Of course she did.

374
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,510
She won't stay where she falls

375
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,510
and wallow in misery and self-pity.

376
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,700
However,

377
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,190
in the future, our Teng Yue

378
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,100
and her Cloud Footwear

379
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,430
will be competitors

380
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,550
in the market.

381
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,070
Zhaoyang.

382
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,120
Actually, the relationship

383
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,630
between you and Jiang Hu

384
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,560
is not as terrible as you two think.

385
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,530
She knows you well.

386
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,950
You know her well too.

387
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,150
You two made a great team.

388
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,710
Yes.

389
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,960
But when I realized that,

390
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,990
I had already hurt her.

391
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,690
I'll never leave Teng Yue.

392
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,040
Teng Yue means as much to her

393
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,160
as it does to me.

394
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,430
Maybe

395
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,250
you can make peace with her.

396
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,760
Timing is very important

397
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,260
in relationships.

398
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,880
I missed the moment.

399
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,270
So I guess

400
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,000
I have to wait for the next right moment.

401
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,710
You've always

402
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,950
been very sensitive.

403
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,430
Gao Yi.

404
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,720
Do you remember

405
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,990
the first time we met?

406
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,070
The first time we met?

407
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,510
Looks like

408
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,770
you don't remember it.

409
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,510
I was in middle school that year.

410
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,380
Zhaoyang.

411
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,450
Xiang Zhaoyang.

412
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,720
Xiang Zhaoyang!

413
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,310
Zhaoyang.

414
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,590
Zhaoyang.

415
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,450
Zhaoyang, wake up.

416
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,160
You're fine.

417
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,630
You're fine.

418
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,750
That was the first time

419
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,150
someone was willing to help me.

420
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,270
That someone was you.

421
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,140
I remember

422
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,180
that day.

423
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,400
But the person who saved you

424
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,210
was not me.

425
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,960
When I saw you,

426
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,710
Yang Jian

427
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:18,750
had already brought you

428
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,710
out of the river.

429
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,640
Excuse me.

430
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,550
Zhaoyang.

431
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,590
Zhaoyang.

432
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,880
Xiang Zhaoyang.

433
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,400
Then he left

434
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
to settle the score with those boys.

435
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,990
Actually, at that time,

436
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,990
I didn't know that boy

437
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,790
was Yang Jian.

438
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,840
But I recognized him

439
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,720
when we met the other day.

440
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,050
I was surprised

441
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,480
that he was your brother.

442
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,220
-Watch where you're going.
-Mom.

443
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,070
Mom.

444
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,320
What's this?

445
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,040
It's…

446
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,330
It's…

447
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,990
Don't worry.

448
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,320
I won't buy stocks

449
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,420
or mutual funds.

450
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,790
Then what's this?

451
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,140
It's…

452
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,670
Do you remember the thing

453
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,600
with Lili's mom?

454
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,190
Jian took care of it

455
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,190
and

456
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,460
paid the money for me.

457
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,950
I have some savings

458
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,300
but didn't want to pay him back.

459
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,150
So…

460
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,350
I've come around now.

461
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,760
We won't rely on Jian anymore.

462
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,560

in the young people's language.

524
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,990
This is

525
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,980
an unprecedented breakthrough.

526
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,880
I think

527
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,380
they look great.

528
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,710
What does this "for" mean?

529
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,950
What is this?

530
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,770
For Young.

531
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,770
For Young?

532
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,990
These are our new products for the next season.

533
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,220
There are hoodies, coats and shoes.

534
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,230
The designer

535
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,030
was born in the 1990s

536
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,760
and won a design prize in Milan.

537
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,680
When did I

538
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,710
allow you to find a designer?

539
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,040
Where did you get the money

540
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,300
to pay for the designs?

541
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,790
I used what was left of the marketing budget.

542
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,190
I followed the procedure

543
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,990
and made an application

544
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,430
in accordance with the regulations.

545
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,510
All these designs

546
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,040
cost 180,000 yuan in total.

547
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,190
180,000 yuan?

548
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,800
That 180,000 yuan

549
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,910
was all the money

550
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,960
we had left this year.

551
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,440
Zhang, what's going on?

552
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,540
Mr. Ye.

553
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,150
The budget proposal from the Marketing Department

554
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,920
was up to code.

555
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,240
It was detailed and met all the requirements.

556
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,450
So I approved it.

557
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,710
And the designs are paid in installments.

558
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,550
We've only paid less than 50,000 yuan by now.

559
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:42,990
You…

560
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,500
Why didn't you ask for my permission?

561
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,750
You used the marketing budget

562
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,470
to pay for these designs?

563
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,640
You should've talked with me about it!

564
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,990
You spent 180,000 yuan

565
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,870
in one go!

566
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,410
Mr. Ye.

567
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,710
The 180,000 yuan

568
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,990
covers product designs

569
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,630
and the designs

570
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,750
of all promotional materials.

571
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,070
And this award-winning designer

572
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,250
can endorse

573
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,440
Cloud Footwear.

574
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,820
It's good for us.

575
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,550
Endorse?

576
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,560
We don't need endorsement.

577
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,710
You spent

578
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,990
the whole year's marketing budget

579
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,270
in one go!

580
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,470
I think these designs

581
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,230
look great.

582
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:22,650
Yes.

583
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,670
They're much better

584
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,390
than the old-fashioned ones we have.

585
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,270
I think so too.

586
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:25,790
They're great.

587
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,450
I disagree!

588
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,590
It's too late.

589
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,470
I've used

590
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,750
Cloud Footwear's business license

591
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,990
to register these designs.

592
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,850
In other words,

593
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,470
whether you want these designs or not,

594
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,130
Cloud Footwear owns them now.

595
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,390
So beautiful.

596
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,000
Look.

597
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,330
They're amazing,

598
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,210
aren't they?

599
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,730
Look at the details.

600
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,550
Look. Young people will love them.

601
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,250
They're really nice.

602
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:53,850
Very chic.

603
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,890
Look at the embroidery.

604
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,970
[Divorce Agreement]

605
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,100
You've signed it?

606
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,430
Okay.

607
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,970
How about

608
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,370
we go to the Civil Affairs Bureau today

609
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,170
and get it done?

610
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:31,930
Don't rush.

611
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,990
We haven't talked about

612
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,320
the division of assets.

613
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,390
Sit.

614
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,690
Go ahead.

615
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,700
I want Changle Restaurant

616
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,500
and Xixingji.

617
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,130
I don't agree.

618
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,680
It's none of your business.

619
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,920
I'll think about it.

620
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,100
Give me a week.

621
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,580
Okay.

622
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,350
I'll wait for your answer.

623
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,560
Are you serious?

624
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,230
You'll just let her have what she wants?

625
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,390
Why?

626
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,470
She's gone too far.

627
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,270
I don't agree.

628
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,210
Boss.

629
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,550
What's so good about her

630
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,790
that has made you love her for so many years?

631
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,720
She's never seen you as her husband

632
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,720
yet when she's about to divorce you,

633
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,190
she wants to take away everything you have.

634
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,250
How can she do that?

635
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:43,890
Enough.

636
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:44,920
I've seen pushovers

637
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,430
but never one

638
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,390
as hopeless as you.

639
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,190
Stop it.

640
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,630
Have you finished your work?

641
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,790
Go clean the table.

642
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,910
I'm always cleaning the table.

643
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,450
What time is it now?

644
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,470
Don't you need

645
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,510
to attend a meeting at Cloud Footwear?

646
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,370
What time is it?

647
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,670
I don't agree.

648
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,550
I don't know why Zhaoyang

649
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,670
has made such a ridiculous request

650
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,090
and don't want to know why.

651
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,810
I just want to say,

652
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,260
you don't understand girls.

653
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,830
Neither do I.

654
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,810
So make your decision.

655
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,050
Don't care about the three of us.

656
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,350
At worst, we'll just be beggars.

657
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:39,960
Mr. Ye.

658
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,340
You're here.

659
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,880
I've been looking for you.

660
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:43,750
I need you

661
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,150
to sign this file.

662
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,270
Okay. Thank you.

663
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,199
You're welcome.

664
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,510
Zhu.

665
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,810
Do you like

666
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,550
these designs too?

667
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:55,590
Yeah.

668
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,720
Okay, I see.

669
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,830
Tell Zhang

670
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,530
to bring Jiang Hu's reimbursement requests

671
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,120
to me.

672
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,190
I'll sign them.

673
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,130
Okay.

674
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:07,830
Great.

675
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:44,990
Come.

676
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:46,950
Let's go.

677
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,940
Let's go for a walk.

678
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,550
Even the dog

679
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,880
is going around in a car.

680
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,120
The dog's life is better than mine.

681
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,480
You heard them?

682
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,760
I'm so good to you.

683
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,640
I always take you for a drive before walking you.

684
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,090
Your mom doesn't want you,

685
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,660
so I have to love you more.

686
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,450
Let's go.

687
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,120
Let's go.

688
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,160
Come.

689
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,930
Your mom hasn't come back yet.

690
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,200
Let's go.

691
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,230
I want a cup of milk tea. Let's go buy it.

692
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,580
Thanks a lot.

693
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,890
I got to carry so many bags.

694
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,630
I would've been exhausted if I had taken the subway.

695
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,170
I'll go.

696
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:08,990

Jiang Hu.

699
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,930
I need to tell you something.

700
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,300
I know you think I'm too young for you.

701
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,800
I also know

702
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,480
you may haven't got over Xu Si.

703
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,570
I like you, Jiang Hu.

704
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,510
I've liked you for a long time.

705
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,150
So can you give me a chance

706
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,730
to be with you?

707
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,990
You don't have to answer me now.

708
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,450
Go back and think about it.

709
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,040
A young boy he is.

Hurry. It's about to start.

Hello, audience at the studio

the first group

726
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,190
of entrepreneurs on stage

727
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,790
to introduce their project.

728

Dear audience,

729
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,110
four tutors, good afternoon.

730
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,030
We're a young entrepreneur team

731
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,830
that just came back from abroad.

732

You're trying to cure insomnia

with candies.

734
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,820
I'm not interested in this project.

735
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,420
Thank you.

736
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
Tutors,

737
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,270
dear audience, good afternoon.

738
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,650
We're the second group of entrepreneurs.

739
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:44,530
Sorry.

740
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:45,990
Thank you.

741
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,160
I can't accept

742
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,350
your preschool philosophy.

743
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:53,950
Thank you.

744
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,270
Simon is so strict.

745
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,890
He hasn't passed any project yet.

746
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:02,480
It figures.

747
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,790
He's always like that.

748
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,080
He's trying to be cool.

749
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,810
I think it's my turn.

750
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,870
Contestant 3, it's your turn.

751
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:16,400

Designer Xiang.

753

Master Zhang.

754
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,340
Has Ms. Jiang come out?

755
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,390
The host just introduced them.

756
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,160
She'll be out soon.

757
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,820
Okay. Then I'll watch it here.

758
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:27,860
Okay.

759
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,590
I can do it.

760
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,720
Okay. Next,

761
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,550
let's invite

762
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,990
the next entrepreneur group

763
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,110
on stage.

764
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,290
Their representative

765
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:37,810
is Ms. Jiang Hu

766
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:38,900
from Cloud Footwear.

767
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,400
Let's welcome her.

768
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,470
Hello, everyone.

769
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,810
My name is Jiang Hu.

770
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,870
Jiang Qisheng.

771
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:55,990
I believe

772
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,630
you all know that name.

773
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,150
Yes.

774
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,410
He was my father.

775
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,710
Unfortunately,

776
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,470
a year ago,

777
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,220
in an accident,

778
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,310
he left

779
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,470
this world forever.

780
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,540
The tree that used to shield me

781
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,670
from this treacherous world was gone.

782
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,430
My life was no longer sunshine and rainbows.

783
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,430
It became a mess.

784
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,610
At the last moment,

785
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,080
I tried my best

786
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,630
and kept

787
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,870
the only thing I could keep

788
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,800
that belonged to the Jiang family:

789
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,370
Teng Yue.

790
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,110
It was once a household name

791
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,110
but when I took it over,

792
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,590
it had fallen off the pedestal

793
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,140
and was hanging by a thread.

794
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,860
At that time,

795
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,210
it felt like I was trying to make something

796
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,720
out of nothing.

797
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,510
I had nothing left

798
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,110
but was in a game

799
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,570
full of traps and dangers.

800
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,020
But one year later,

801
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,330
Teng Yue came back to life

802
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,790
and found its way back

803
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,250
to the center of the stage.

804
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,670
I experienced things

805
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,470
I never did before

806
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,310
and never felt so fulfilled.

807
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:08,910
Of course,

808
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,070
during this process,

809
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,290
I met many great people.

810
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,750
They gave me

811
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,900
a lot of support and help.

812
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,950
I'm very grateful to them.

813
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,870
However,

814
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,220
nothing lasts forever.

815
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,350
Although

816
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,500
I've left Teng Yue

817
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:29,470
and come to

818
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,270
another 100-year-old company,

819
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,240
Cloud Footwear,

820
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,890
I still believe

821
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,170
that a good brand

822
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,850
deserves to be known and loved

823
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,190
by more people.

824
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,240
The third entrepreneur

825
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:44,990
just came on stage

826
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:45,670
and introduced herself.

827
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,630
I believe she's moved

828
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,630
everyone present

829
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,760
including me.

830
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,590
Before

831
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,100
the third entrepreneur

832
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:51,950
starts sharing

833
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,870
her startup story,

834
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:54,430
I want to ask

835
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,530
if the tutors

836
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,220
have any questions

837
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,050
for her.

838
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,480
Mr. Xu, do you have anything to say?

839
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,440
Mr. Xu?

840
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,200
Please.

841
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,230
Ms. Jiang.

842
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,900
I'm looking forward to your presentation.
