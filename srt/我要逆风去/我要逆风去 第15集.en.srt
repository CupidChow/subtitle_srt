Hello.

Who are you?

I'm Xu Si. I'm here to see Jiang Hu.

You are

Mr. Xu from Baoxing Investment?

Nice to meet you.

Have the surveillance cameras been installed?

00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,960
Yes.

yet you're here

41
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,730
playing cards.

42
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,760
You play cards every day.

43
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,750
What do you want?

44
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,350
Huh?

Ms. Jiang is over there.

47

She doesn't know what's going on here

48
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,340
and may misunderstand me.

49
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,240
You're a leader

50
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,390
but don't behave like a leader.

51
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,550
You play cards here every day.

52
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,760
Look at yourself!

53
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,070
You're also a leader!

54
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,870
You're the factory director

55
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,280
but play the market during working hours.

56
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,430
Does Ms. Jiang know about that?

57
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,240
I…

58
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,220
I'm the factory director. Who are you to tell me what to do?

59
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,160
I am playing the market but what does that have to do with you?

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,920
You're the factory director

61
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,390
so you should set a good example.

62
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,270
Don't you know that?

63
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,110
You misbehaved first.

64
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,070
I just followed suit.

65
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,920
Listen up.

66
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,710
Liu Jun.

67
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,980

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,530
go home and play it.

70
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,180
Go home and play it!

71
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,630
You can play all you want.

72
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,190
You don't need to come tomorrow.

73
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,180
What does that mean?

74
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,450
You're fired!

75
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,350
Do you hear me?

76
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,540
You're fired.

77
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,270
Who are you to fire me?

78
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,190
He's fired!

79
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,520
Do you hear me?

80
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,510
What a jerk.

81
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,500
All he does is play cards.

82
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,270
Ms. Jiang.

83
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,150
I did a lot for this factory.

84
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,820
How could he fire me just like that?

85
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,340
Guys, be careful.

86
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,250
He can fire anyone he wants!

87
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,400
You're fired.

88
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,940
Uncle.

89
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,159
I must fire you!

90
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,340
That's enough, Uncle.

91
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,970
Mr. Liu, calm down.

92
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,650
Mr. Pei

93
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,710
has got his concerns.

94
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,060
If you play poker

95
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,050
in the factory,

96
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,440
you'll indeed be bad influences.

97
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,110
But

98
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,620
you need to loosen up.

99
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,590
I understand that.

100
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,260
He said that just now out of anger.

101
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,520
Don't take it to heart.

102
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,950
I'll talk to him later.

103
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,150
Okay.

104
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,100
All right. Everyone, get back to work.

105
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,480
Complete this batch of goods.

106
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,490
We'll finish this deal before this month ends.

107
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,560
What's this surprise inspection

108
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,830
at noon all about?

109
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,150
What?

110
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,470
You don't want to see me?

111
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,860
No. That's not what I mean.

112
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,310
I just haven't seen you

113
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,340
in a long time

114
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,150
and am a bit surprised

115
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,490
by your sudden visit.

116
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,230
A long time?

117
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,830
Are you sure?

118
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,080
The last time we met,

119
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,510
we dined together at Bo's.

120
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,650
Since then, I've been working hard in the factory

121
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,080
to run a tight ship

122
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,780
as you advised.

123
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,310
You could say that.

124
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,110
But I can't believe you.

125
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,060
There's no booze at your place?

126
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,540
It makes sense.

127
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,110
Booze can get in the way.

128
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,590
Some people

129
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,780
do weird things

130
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,940
when they're drunk.

131
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,910
To stay

132
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,910
clear-minded,

133
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,990
I haven't drunk

134
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,710
in a long time.

135
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,650
A long time?

136
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,470
Are you sure?

137
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,110
Strictly speaking,

138
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,030
I drank

139
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,880
just a little bit

140
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:40,990
last night.

141
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,060
Just a little bit?

142
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,310
Yes.

143
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,360
Our CFO,

144
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,700
Yue Shan, can prove that.

145
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:48,230
I was with her

146
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,150
last night.

147
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,790
Just her?

148
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,550
No one else?

149
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,700
No.

150
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,590
It was just me and her.

151
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,510
Do you want me to swear?

152
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,990
I swear, last night, I…

153
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,030
All right.

154
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,550
I didn't ask you to swear.

155
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,910
I just want you to believe me.

156
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,550
You go insane when you're drunk,

157
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,480
so you'd better stay on the wagon.

158
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,990
Okay. Then let's not talk about booze.

159
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,540
Let me get you a bottle of water.

160
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,540
Here. Please have some water, Boss.

161
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,980
Show me the financial report

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,840
of Teng Yue.

163
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:43,530
Jiang Hu.

164
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,590
Jiang Hu.

165
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,720
How could you do that?

166
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,420
I fired Liu Jun

167
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,230
but you let him stay

168
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,550
in front of so many people.

169
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,900
Yeah, you're the head now.

170
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,920
Your word carries a lot of weight.

171
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,190
I'm just the factory director

172
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,350
and don't need to be taken seriously, right?

173
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,670
Uncle.

174
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,710
You can't

175
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,490
handle things that way.

176
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,270
So many workers were watching.

177
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,970
Liu Jun is a veteran worker.

178
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,190
You shouldn't have embarrassed him

179
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,310
in front of everyone.

180
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,470
I don't care

181
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,200
that he's a veteran worker.

182
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,590
Look at what he did.

183
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,550
All he does every day

184
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,230
is play cards.

185
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,470
Listen.

186
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,590
If your dad were here

187
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,430
dealing with this matter,

188
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,460
he'd have fired him as well.

189
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,580
Unlike you,

190
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,470
he wouldn't

191
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,310
be a fence-sitter

192
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,310
and avoid problems.

193
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,870
Why am I a fence-sitter?

194
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,789
You're too extreme.

195
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,789
The working environment

196
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,640
should be harmonious.

197
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,340
If you fire whoever you want,

198
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,650
what will other workers think?

199
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,110
I

200
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,110
don't care

201
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,990
what others think.

202
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,870
I'm in charge of this factory.

203
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,560
I'm running it my way.

204
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,640
Liu Jun

205
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,470
is always

206
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,690
against me.

207
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,460
Listen.

208
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,470
If I don't kick him out today,

209
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,750
he'll kick me out in the future.

210
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,830
I'm the factory director.

211
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,880
What do you expect me to do?

212
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,750
What do you expect me to do?

213
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,590
Enough.

214
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,630
-What do you expect me to do?
-Enough.

215
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,070
Uncle.

216
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,960
You're too excited.

217
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,710
Go home

218
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,430
and chill out.

219
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,750
He didn't drive me away

220
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,620
yet you're doing it?

221
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,680
Please get it straight.

222
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,230
I'm your uncle.

223
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,470
Okay.

224
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,390
Okay.

225
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,590
Let me

226
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,590
make it clear.

227
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,670
If Liu Jun stays

228
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,470
in this factory,

229
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,470
I'll never come back.

230
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,890
Just wait and see

231
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,560
how this factory goes under.

232
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,310
If you let him stay,

233
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,460
you'll be letting a menace stay.

234
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,080
You'll see.

235
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:32,990
You'll see.

236
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,000
Just wait and see.

237
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,810
As you can see,

238
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,910
things are a bit messy here.

239
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,750
In principle,

240
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,560
we shouldn't be involved

241
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,830
in the management of the company.

242
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:00,960
But

243
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,050
if the companies we own

244
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,260
are in serious trouble,

245
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,870
we can provide

246
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,190
professional help.

247
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:12,990
It's okay.

248
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,960
I'll handle it myself.

249
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,320
Okay.

250
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,950
Give me the financial report.

251
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,570
I'll read it after going back.

252
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,710
Wait, Mr. Pei.

253
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,230
I know you…

254
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,230
Alright. Stop.

255
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,110
I don't want to hear it.

256
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,020
You…

257
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,230
Go back to work with Liu Jun.

258
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,000
He's better than me.

259
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,510
No, no.

260
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,130
Wait, Mr. Pei.

261
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:40,990
Calm down.

262
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,710
He's amazing.

263
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,230
Mr. Pei. Mr. Pei.

264
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,110
I saw Mr. Pei

265
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,230
storming out.

266
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,710
Let him be.

267
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,750
He said he won't come back.

268
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,590
He can use a few days' rest at home

269
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,750
to calm down.

270
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,870
Are you two kids?

271
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,470
You're mad at each other like kids.

272
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,930
You're family.

273
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,290
You should talk calmly and rationally

274
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,630
about the problems in production.

275
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,830
Ms. Yue.

276
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,190
I want to adjust the salary and bonus structure

277
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,470
and set

278
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,000
new performance standards.

279
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,010
I'm already working on that,

280
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,710
together with a piecework wage system.

281
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,230
I'll show them to you in a few days.

282
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,340
You're so considerate.

283
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,470
I have something to tell you.

284
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,850
We've changed

285
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,120
some suppliers,

286
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,710
but for insoles,

287
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,630
Mr. Qian of Lianfa

288
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,600
has the lowest price.

289
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,990
The suppliers Liu Jun introduced to us

290
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,990
can't offer

291
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,750
a lower price.

292
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,030
Then let's buy from him.

293
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,190
But here is the problem.

294
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,580
Mr. Qian asks for a full payment.

295
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,520
That will be a lot of money.

296
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,590
I'm afraid

297
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,750
it'll impact our cash flow.

298
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,590
Production is priority one.

299
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,110
As for other things,

300
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,560
I'll take care of them.

301
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:17,830
Okay.

302
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,120
You want me to talk to Qian

303
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,950
and vouch for you?

304
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,450
I don't have that much money now.

305
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,350
I can only pay

306
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,380
part of the deposit first.

307
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,240
After Zhang Wenshan pays me,

308
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,540
I'll pay him. Will it work?

309
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,620
Qian is running a small business too.

310
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,190
He needs money to keep things afloat.

311
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:42,930
I know.

312
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:43,760
I promise

313
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,870
to pay him

314
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,470
as soon as possible.

315
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,790
Now I understand

316
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,500
how hard it was for my dad to start a business.

317
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,830
There are coyotes around me on the ground

318
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,350
and vultures

319
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,590
above my head

320
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,590
biding their time.

321
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,210
Everything has a price.

322
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:06,990
I'll pay him in three months.

323
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:07,850
How's it?

324
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,610
Let me try.

325
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,640
Cut it out.

326
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,720
This is juice, not booze.

327
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,630
This is no way to say thank you.

328
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,320
After I finish this deal,

329
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,590
I'll get drunk with you.

330
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,190
Okay?

331
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,990
We'll get wasted.

332
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,510
Alright.

333
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,510
Get wasted?

334
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,190
But I won't drink.

335
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,470
Okay.

336
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,080
I'll drink.

337
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,950
I'll drink alone.

338
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,840
I'll get wasted.

339
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,510
You're all here.

340
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,560
I have two things to announce.

341
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,900
Meeting time.

342
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,150
First,

343
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,830
from now on, the delivery dockets

344
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,590
of all raw materials and products

345
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,710
must be reviewed

346
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,950
by the accounting department

347
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,830
before they go in and out of the factory.

348
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,310
Understand?

349
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,490
Yes.

350
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,670
Second.

351
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,810
Master Zhang, come.

352
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,310
Let's congratulate Master Zhang.

353
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,750
Master Zhang has been working at Teng Yue

354
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,990
for over 40 years.

355
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,450
We've decided

356
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,130
to promote him as deputy director.

357
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,540
Let's congratulate him.

358
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,950
Congratulations. Congratulations.

359
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,160
Congratulations, Master Zhang.

360
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:36,750
Congratulations, Master Zhang.

361
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,630
No, no.

362
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,230
I…

363
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,140
I can't…

364
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:39,920
Master Zhang.

365
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,180
Congratulations.

366
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,330
In the future, you can directly

367
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,630
go to the deputy director

368
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,350
to sign production orders.

369
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:49,500
Great.

370
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,940
The food made by a big restaurant chef

371
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,030
was indeed amazing.

372
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,470
Xiaolin, come.

373
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,110
Have a seat.

374
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,510
Sit.

375
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,630
Was the food good?

376
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,350
Great.

377
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,110
Not bad.

378
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,110
It was horrible.

379
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,450
Here. Help yourselves.

380
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,400
The sales of Teng Yue shoes

381
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,550
have dropped again

382
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,710
this month.

383
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,270
Ms. Jiang is ruining this company.

384
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,910
We just got a small order from Free Unicorn

385
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,300
yet has to stand Zhang Wenshan patronizing us.

386
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,510
If he stops buying from us one day,

387
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,410
we'll have to live on air.

388
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,630
So, you should

389
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,260
go work somewhere else

390
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,530
when you can.

391
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,190
If you drag it out,

392
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,230
you'll miss the chance to work at a better place.

393
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:46,990
Can we get as many perks

394
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,000
as we do here at Teng Yue?

395
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,820
Only four workers share a dorm room.

396
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,710
Ms. Jiang even sent for a restaurant chef

397
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,930
to cook for us.

398
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,800
You oaf.

399
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,110
All you care about is food?

400
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,080
If you can make more money,

401
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,950
you can eat whatever you want.

402
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,470
Only the money earned by yourself

403
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,590
is real.

404
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,230
A man dies if uprooted, but a tree thrives.

405
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,950
Sorry.

406
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,140
A tree dies if uprooted, but a man thrives.

407
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,400
Think about it.

408
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,470
Which sounds more promising,

409
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:13,990
working in a big factory

410
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,610
or working for that young girl?

411
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,500
Jun.

412
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,110
In the factory you mentioned,

413
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,350
how much can we earn per month?

414
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,870
It's hard to say.

415
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,360
In big factories,

416
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,350
workers do piecework.

417
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,940
Big factories like that

418
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,790
get orders worth tens of millions of yuan every month.

419
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,720
Xiaolin,

420
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,440
you're skilled and efficient.

421
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,630
I think you'll be able to earn

422
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,840
at least three times more money every month.

423
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,350
It doesn't sound very tempting, does it?

424
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,300
There's only one shortcoming.

425
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,080
There are only several openings.

426
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,830
You need to hurry

427
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,920
if you want to work there.

428
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,400
That's the only shortcoming.

429
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,110
Think it over.

430
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,050
Jun.

431
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,020
I'll go with you.

432
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,960
Jun. Jun.

433
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,390
Me too.

434
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:58,970
Me too.

435
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,260
What about you?

436
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,070
Okay.

437
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,190
I'm in too.

438
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,650
Since it's piecework,

439
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,470
I'll sign up too.

440
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,770
Okay. I got you. Don't worry.

441
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,720
Xiaolin.

442
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,829
What are you

443
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:12,660
thinking about?

444
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:13,950
Fine.

445
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,510
Think it over.

446
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,390
Tell me when you make up your mind.

447
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,640
That silly girl

448
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,130
thinks she can wrap me around her little finger.

449
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,030
Jiang Hu, I'm back from the business trip.

450
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,410
Let's have dinner together tonight.

451
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,430
Okay.

452
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,560
Orchid cacti,

453
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,310
a kind of hybrid cactus.

454
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:06,990
They don't need much water

455
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,750
and suit you.

456
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,630
You need some flowers

457
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,750
in your room

458
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,950
so that you can get married sooner.

459
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,630
Let me tell you.

460
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,190
Your mother

461
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,640
picked those flowerpots herself.

462
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,430
They're very expensive.

463
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,390
If you

464
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,230
let them die again,

465
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,470
she'll give you a hard time.

466
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,000
By the way,

467
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,160
this

468
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,150
is the advice

469
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,630
from a fortune-telling app.

470
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,040
Who would invest in that kind of app?

471
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,030
This dish is good.

472
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,910
Why don't you try it?

473
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,870
Give me two bottles of this.

474
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,240
Okay.

475
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,300
Lu.

476
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,230
Xu.

477
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,520
Wait a second.

478
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,360
Xu.

479
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,790
Are you alone or will someone join you later?

480
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,470
She's on her way.

481
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,470
Okay.

482
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,070
I'll take your order after she arrives.

483
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,550
Okay.

484
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,990
Would you like a cup of milk tea first?

485
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,440
No milk tea today.

486
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,710
Okay.

487
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,270
I'll give you sparkling water.

488
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,390
Here, your water.

489
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:03,970
Thank you.

490
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,510
Hello,

491
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,710
the subscriber you dialed

492
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,030
is busy now.

493
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,670
Please try again later.

494
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,510
Hello, Master Zhang.

495
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,150
I just came out

496
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,350
of the cloth market you mentioned.

497
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,810
They do offer good stuff at low prices.

498
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,720
I've arranged

499
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,710
a delivery tomorrow morning.

500
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,410
Yes.

501
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,470
It's okay.

502
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,230
Okay. See you tomorrow.

503
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,260
Hello, Wu. What's wrong?

504
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,140
Okay. I got it.

505
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,010
I'll be right there.

506
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,640
Hello,

507
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,950
the subscriber you dialed

508
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,270
is busy now.

Please try again later.

510
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,380
[Teng Yue Shoes]

511
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:20,710
Come in.

512
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,320
You scared me.

513
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,590
What happened?

514
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,870
Half an hour ago,

515
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,910
a tricycle went in.

516
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,240
Where is Dacheng?

517
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,630
He's on night patrol.

518
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:49,940
Come again.

519
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,470
Bye.

520
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,550
Thank you.

521
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,400
Check, please.

522
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,330
Okay. Wait a moment.

523
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,380
Stop.

524
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,080
That was loud.

525
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,350
He can't get out.

526
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,390
I have the key.

527
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,710
Boss will be here soon.

528
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:34,920
See that?

529
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,880
Mr. Liu.

530
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,240
It's so late.

531
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,870
Are you going out?

532
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,100
Well,

533
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,320
they're garbage in the factory.

534
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,540
I have nothing to do tonight

535
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,550
and am taking them out.

536
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,870
Garbage?

537
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,470
What garbage

538
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,720
is worth so much trouble?

539
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,990
-Don't bother about that.
-Let me see.

540
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,870
No, no, no.

541
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,240
What are you doing?

542
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,710
What are you doing?

543
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,550
You may…

544
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,460
Show us.

545
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,230
They're just garbage.

546
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,950
Don't get your hands dirty.

547
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:11,770
Garbage?

548
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,580
You're acting like they're treasures.

549
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,270
No.

550
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,630
They're really garbage.

551
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,750
I'm afraid you'll get your hands dirty

552
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,550
so I stopped you.

553
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,630
What if I insist on checking?

554
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,230
Ms. Jiang.

555
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,150
There's nothing to check on.

556
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,430
I don't want you to check.

557
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,670
Go back.

558
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:31,750
We'll see ourselves out.

559
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,920
This is illegal!

560
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,020
Do you know that?

561
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,520
Ms. Jiang.

562
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,380
Life is hard for everyone.

563
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,210
Just turn a blind eye

564
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,250
and it'll be over.

565
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,020
It's the best for everyone, isn't it?

566
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,940
Don't do this.

567
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:53,950
Wu.

568
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:54,870
Check the tricycle.

569
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:55,890
Don't move.

570
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,660
Go away!

571
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,630
Stop him. Come on.

572
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,820
I know you're untrustworthy.

573
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,710
But I didn't expect you

574
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,920
to be so bold.

575
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,380
I'd like to know

576
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,460
how many raw materials

577
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,390
you're stealing from the factory.

578
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,720
Get your hands off me.

579
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,240
You have to leave

580
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,310
these things here tonight.

581
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,390
Otherwise, you can't go out.

582
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,190
Don't touch her.

583
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,740
What are you doing?

584
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,710
Hurry up.

585
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,430
I won't let you go.

586
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,270
Here.

587
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,340
How could you?

588
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:15,750
Ms. Jiang.

589
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,000
You're stealing from the factory.

590
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,990
Get your hands off me!

591
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,430
Shut up.

592
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,390
Go back. Go back.

593
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,220
No.

594
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,000
Don't move.

595
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,030
Run!

596
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,120
He's filming us.

597
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,710
Hurry.

598
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,350
Liu Jun!

599
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,810
Run! Keep running!

600
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,510
I'm filming it.

601
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,470
If I call the police now,

602
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,700
the police will find you soon.

603
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,630
Keep running.

604
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,980
Why would I run?

605
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,860
Let him go.

606
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,860
Run. Go ahead and run.

607
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,920
Stop filming.

608
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,340
Stop filming.

609
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,870
It's okay. Keep running. Don't stop.

610
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,630
I'm not a celebrity.

611
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,270
Why are you filming me?

612
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:05,960
Stop filming.

613
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,990
Ms. Jiang.

614
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,520
Let me explain.

615
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,750
There's nothing to explain.

616
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,610
We caught you in the act.

617
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,300
With this video,

618
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,190
you'll do at least a year

619
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,150
in prison.

620
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,150
I'll call the police now.

621
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:18,750
Hold on.

622
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,710
Hold on. Hold on.

623
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,490
Ms. Jiang.

624
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,790
Let me explain.

625
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:24,550
Thank you.

626
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,630
Come again.

627
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:25,920
Okay.

628
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,430
If you like the food,

629
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,190
leave us a good review.

630
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,870
Thank you.

631
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,670
When waiting for a girl,

632
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,470
you need to be patient.

633
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,510
Don't worry.

634
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,950
We close at 11.

635
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,640
Give me a glass of milk tea.

636
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,630
A large glass.

637
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,580
Double sugar.

638
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,270
Okay.

639
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,390
Zhong.

640
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:51,990
Milk tea.

641
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,630
Double sugar.

642
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,140
Okay.

643
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,320
I've never

644
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,190
done this before.

645
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,670
This is the first time.

646
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,500
My family is barely

647
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,670
getting by.

648
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,440
My son

649
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,510
has cerebral palsy.

650
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,270
I need to look after him.

651
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:11,870
I'm the only

652
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,510
breadwinner in my family.

653
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,710
My master knows

654
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,720
my situation.

655
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,270
You can ask him.

656
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,080
I'm not lying.

657
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:17,950
Really.

658
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,550
I've been working in this factory

659
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,470
for 20 years.

660
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,470
I've done a lot for it.

661
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,710
I beg you.

662
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,030
Please spare me this time.

663
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:25,930
Please let me go.

664
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,820
I can let you go,

665
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,680
but you can't work at Teng Yue anymore.

666
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,630
Leave here by tomorrow.

667
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,630
Learn your lesson.

668
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:43,880
Okay.

669
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,750
Thank you.

670
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,140
Thank you.

671
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
I'll leave tonight.

672
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:48,950
I'll leave tonight.

673
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,510
Thank you.

674
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,600
Thank you.

675
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,110
Thank you.

676
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,420
Thank you, guys.

677
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,080
Don't mention it.

678
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,040
You're welcome.

679
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,670
But why did you

680
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,510
let them off so easily?

681
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,470
The old me

682
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,880
wouldn't have let them off.

683
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,390
But…

684
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,630
Forget it.

685
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,940
Fine. You have the final say.

686
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,440
We've waited here for days

687
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,840
and the effort is worth it.

688
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,600
We finally flushed out those vermin.

689
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,450
Jiang Hu.

690
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:35,900
Well,

691
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,710
we've done a great job.

692
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,030
Can we get a reward?

693
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,560
Let's go.

694
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,720
I'll buy you kebabs.

695
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,990
Oh, no.

696
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:44,790
What's wrong?

697
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,430
I was supposed to have dinner with Xu Si.

698
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,230
I completely forgot about it.

699
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,910
It's fine.

700
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,720
It's not a big deal.

701
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,430
No.

702
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,790
Compared to Liu Jun, Xu Si

703
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,870
is much harder to deal with.

704
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,150
If he gets angry,

705
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,230
he'll give me a much harder time

706
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,370
than Liu Jun did.

707
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:58,670
I mean it.

708
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,390
I'm doomed.

709
00:26:59,390 --> 00:26:59,960
Okay.

710
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,650
Calm down.

711
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,750
Go to meet

712
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,790
the check-signer.

713
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,190
Okay.

714
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,230
Leave here to us.

715
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,030
I'm leaving then.

716
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,870
I can give you a ride.

717
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,270
It's okay.

718
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:07,830
I've booked a taxi.

719
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:08,670
I'm leaving.

720
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,070
Okay.

721
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:09,950
We'll have Western food tomorrow.

722
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,950
I'm leaving.

723
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,210
Bye. Bye.

724
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:15,790
Bye.

725
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:16,990
Okay.

726
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,580
Let's push this back.

727
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,830
After pushing it back, we'll leave.

728
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,470
Okay.

729
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:20,990
Let's go eat.

730
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,710
Here we go.

731
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,150
Are you working overtime?

732
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,120
Come on.

733
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:38,750
Give us a hand

734
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,710
to push this back.

735
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,720
Okay.

736
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,310
Let's go.

737
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,160
[Bo's]

738
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,250
I don't want any explanations.

739
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,230
Don't you have

740
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,470
anything to say to me?

741
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,680
You said no explanations.

742
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,230
I didn't ask you to keep silent.

743
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:58,910
Then,

744
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,650
have you had dinner?

745
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,870
Boss.

746
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,650
Here is your food.

747
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,280
I waited for you for so long

748
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,740
yet this is what you're treating me to?

749
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,150
I see.

750
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,390
A generous

751
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,710
and forgiving boss like you

752
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,310
deserves food

753
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,030
that's made especially for you.

754
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,120
No problem.

755
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,710
Wait a moment.

756
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,350
Look.

757
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,640
I've asked the clerk

758
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,740
to heat this pineapple bun.

759
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:01,380
It's warm and crispy.

760
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,950
Then, I'll put…

761
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,710
A sausage in it.

762
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,530
Together with a delicious

763
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,780
and chewy crab bar.

764
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,460
Don't underestimate the crab bar.

765
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,710
Except for its high price,

766
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,030
it's perfect.

767
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,630
At last, some salad dressing.

768
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,820
Done.

769
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,150
This is a luxurious, limited edition

770
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,730
crab bar salad hamburger.

771
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,060
Try it.

772
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,960
Just one bite.

773
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,600
I promise, after you try it,

774
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,060
you can't get enough of it.

775
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,470
Fine. One more piece of ham.

776
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,230
With one piece of ham,

777
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,470
it'll be even more delicious.

778
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,930
Here, try it.

779
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:06,790
No.

780
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,860
Do me a favor, Boss.

781
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,840
I'm begging you.

782
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,990
Please.

783
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,310
Please.

784
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,870
Stop.

785
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,420
Begging doesn't suit you.

786
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,640
Okay.

787
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,030
I also have your favorite milk tea.

788
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,310
No instant mix, right?

789
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,270
Okay. I got it.

790
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,790
I have a new recipe.

791
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,040
Then I'll add

792
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,790
a smooth and sexy pudding.

793
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,170
This is embarrassing.

794
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,310
Done.

795
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,780
This is the first cup of milk tea

796
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,130
I made in my life.

797
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:26,990
Although

798
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,370
it's not as good as Bo's milk tea,

799
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:28,870
I prepared it

800
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,030
especially for you.

801
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,870
Hold on, hold on.

802
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:31,710
Please enjoy.

803
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,570
Don't move.

804
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,860
How did you hurt your hand?

805
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,070
It's fine.

806
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,240
I got hurt by accident

807
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,790
when I was solving some dispute.

808
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,550
Drink it.

809
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,540
What dispute?

810
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,860
When you visited the factory last time,

811
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,230
you saw a dispute erupt.

812
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,070
Tonight,

813
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,390
I solved it.

814
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,440
Wait for me here.

815
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:02,880
I want one box of it.

816
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,840
Okay. Thank you.

817
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,710
I'm fine.

818
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,580
Small cuts like this heal quickly.

819
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,590
Give me your hand.

820
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,780
I can do it myself.

821
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,190
Don't move.

822
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,730
Why were you so careless?

823
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,350
Thank you.

824
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:33,989
Drink it.

825
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,230
Let me try it.

826
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,280
How's it?

827
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,990
Something is burning over there.

828
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,190
There's a fire!

829
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,000
Over there.

830
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,800
Over there. The trashcan.

831
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:13,910
Fire!

832
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,390
Hurry up!

833
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:14,990
Hurry! Put out the fire!

834
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,570
We need water.

835
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,530
Go get some water.

836
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,590
Hurry.

837
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:42,790
Hurry up.

838
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,590
Go, go, go.

839
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,220
Xu Si.

840
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,580
Your dad and your uncle,

841
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,800
are they still inside?

842
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,900
Say something.

843
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,630
Xu Si.

844
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,240
Save the people inside.

845
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:04,890
Are you okay?

846
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,020
What's wrong?

847
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,920
I'm fine.

848
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,800
I just remembered

849
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,790
some bad memories.

850
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,170
You're afraid of fire?

851
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,500
When you were young,

852
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,520
did you go to play in the factory a lot?

853
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,370
Me too.

854
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,960
When I was young,

855
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,100
my dad and my uncle

856
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,400
ran a cup factory together.

857
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,550
A cup factory?

858
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,100
The one you mentioned once?

859
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,040
Have you seen a factory on fire?

860
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,250
No.

861
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,160
My dad set strict rules for his factories.

862
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,900
As far as I can recall,

863
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,790
there was no incident

864
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,300
in any of Free Unicorn's factories.

865
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,750
When I was five years old,

866
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,930
there was a big fire in the factory.

867
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,830
That day,

868
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,640
I was playing in the factory

869
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,050
and witnessed it

870
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,320
catch on fire.

871
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,140
My dad

872
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,230
and my uncle

873
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,230
were trapped in the workshop.

874
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,490
Neither of them made it out.

875
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:33,900
It's all in the past.

876
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,240
Some bad things

877
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,120
can never be forgotten,

878
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:42,850
but beautiful things

879
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:43,750
will happen

880
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:44,530
to alleviate the pain.

881
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:13,130
[Ziyouqi Group]

882
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:15,990
Free Unicorn

883
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,760
has the best proposal

884
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,310
among all the companies that reached out to us

885
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,880
after the event at Lidu.

886
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,280
They're also willing

887
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,430
to invest in marketing.

888
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,420
Of course, they offer a good price as well.

889
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,490
So…

890
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,250
I'll communicate with them

891
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,110
like a picky client.

892
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,770
As an influencer,

893
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:33,930
you are

894
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,320
much more professional than before.

895
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,380
Let's go.

896
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,790
Mr. Zhang is busy with work.

897
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,320
Today,

898
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,830
we'll talk with you on behalf of him.

899
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,530
We were there

900
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,180
during the whole marketing campaign

901
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:52,160
where you painted on partition walls at Lidu.

902
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,020
We also saw Miss Xiang's work

903
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,860
which won her a prize in the St. Laurent Design Competition.

904
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,270
You have great potential.

905
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,420
However…

906
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,090
Please tell us what you think.

907
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,530
I'll be frank then.

908
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,720
I think

909
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,030
there should be more vision.

910
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,670
I'm talking about Ms. Xiang's works.

911
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,460
All your freehand paintings

912
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,780
and designs

913
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,080
have a lack of vision.

914
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,270
Vision is important.

915
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,950
It can help you improve yourself

916
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,610
and bring your aesthetic sense

917
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,390
to a higher level.

918
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,770
Then what do you think

919
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,440
we should do to have more vision?

920
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,780
You have to admit

921
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,940
that Italian people

922
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,240
are great at designing

923
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:49,920
and marketing.

924
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:51,870
These are their new releases

925
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:52,740
next year.

926
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,970
Those geometric patterns

927
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,850
look incredible.

928
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,180
They

929
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,700
used freehand paintings for advertising too.

930
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,340
If they hadn't used

931
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,790
freehand paintings,

932
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,590
you wouldn't have invited me, would you?

933
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,820
Ms. Xiang, you're smart.

934
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,250
You're not just any influencer.

935
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:19,660
I heard you have a design degree

936
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,360
and worked in a big company once.

937
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,390
You must

938
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,270
be conceited.

939
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,800
You won't easily admit

940
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,340
that your taste is pedestrian.

941
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,270
But

942
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,030
learning from others humbly

943
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,390
is the foundation

944
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,470
of our collaboration this time.

945
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:36,990
Learning?

946
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,390
Are you saying

947
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,410
you want me

948
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,100
to steal the designs of foreign artists?

949
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:43,540
No.

950
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,920
It's borrowing from them

951
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:49,930
as an act of homage.
