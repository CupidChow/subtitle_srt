5
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:39,910
Many things

6
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,750
don't depend on

7
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,830
their compatibility with me,

8
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,740
but my desire.

9
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,670
So?

10
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,560
I want to rent Teng Yue's land.

11
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,259
You're really

12
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,630
surprising me again and again today.

13
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,830
About K32's price,

14
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,390
you've yet to reach an agreement with Yuanfeng, right?

15
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,580
Or

16
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,170
their funds are limited

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,220
and they need a middleman?

18
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,919
I think it won't take long.

19
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,200
Why don't you take advantage of this time difference

20
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,340
and rent Teng Yue to me?

21
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,670
You can even earn some rent.

22
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,750
I doubt Teng Yue's rent for a year

23
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,110
is within the scope of funds

24
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,010
that you can mobilize.

25
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,150
Yes.

26
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,670
I don't have the money right now.

27
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,940
But as long as you rent Teng Yue

28
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,590
to me,

29
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,790
Teng Yue can

30
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,950
resume production.

31
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,110
One year.

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,920
Give me one year.

33
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,550
I'll pay you back the rent with interest

34
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,590
according to the bank's financial product

35
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:38,870
with the highest

36
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,510
interest rate.

37
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,570
Jiang Hu.

38
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,310
Is there

39
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,930
a word written on my forehead?

40
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,590
"Pushover"?

41
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,160
So you understand.

42
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,950
I do.

43
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,270
Anyone can be a pushover.

44
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,510
But it's impossible for you, Xu Si,

45
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,510
to be a pushover.

46
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,230
I beg you.

47
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,950
Please... Please don't say

48
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,390
and do something like this.

49
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,400
This doesn't suit our relationship dynamic.

50
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,790
Relationship dynamic?

51
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,110
What do you mean?

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,310
Like how you scolded me.

53
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,680
I can be despicable,

54
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,890
but you can't be easy.

55
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,900

The things you're doing now,

58

whether it be following me

59
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,660
or trying to run Teng Yue,

60
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,270
do not suit you.

61
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,670
You don't trust me?

62

Xu Si.

63
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,150
I'm discussing this

64
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,540
seriously with you.

65
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,650
I will keep my promise.

66
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,550
Also, Teng Yue's situation is not as bad

67
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,340
as you think.

68
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,350
Teng Yue was a national sports shoes brand

69
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,550
that ranked first in terms of sales

70
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,670
throughout the entire 80s.

71
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,070
As you said,

72
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,730
that was during the 80s of the last millennium.

74
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,850
I'm also

75
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,470
seriously and sincerely suggesting that you...

cancel your C Club membership.

77
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,659
You can get back

78
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,200
a considerable amount of the membership fee.

79
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,610
This is a goal that's easier to achieve.

80
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,570
Think about it calmly.

81
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,909
Don't come to me again.

went for his meeting today?

Sorry, I don't know.

Thank you.

What were you talking about? Why did you thank her?

108
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,610
You told her?

109
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,230
Who told you to tell her

110
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,150
that Mr. Xu went to TT Media?

111
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,310
What about TT Media?

112
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,480
You said it. I didn't say anything.

113
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,050
Please take a seat.

You've reached your destination.

116
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,500

117
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,659
when I

118

hired

119
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,659
such a precious car-show model.

120
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,940
I've been waiting for you here

121
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,850
for a whole day.

122
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,070
Ms. Jiang.

123
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,500
Since you gave up your high heels

124
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,669
and started wearing sneakers,

125
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:44,670
your height is gone.

126
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,790
Your sense of humor

127
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,140
also disappeared without a trace.

128
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,130
Don't be sarcastic.

129
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,140
I really didn't expect

130
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,670
you to actually come all the way to this place.

131
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,170
All right, Ms. Jiang.

132
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,580
Itâ€™s cold.

133
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,780
Go back and rest early.

Xu Si.

135
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,120
I really want to rent the factory building.

136
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,380
You're really telling a huge joke.

137
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,300
I've been working all day.

138
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,060
I'm too tired.

139
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
It's fine. How about this?

140
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,380
Tomorrow morning,

141
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,830
I'll look for you at your company early in the morning.

142
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,300
I just need 15 minutes.

143
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,110
Okay?

144
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,440
Tomorrow,

145
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,670
I'm going somewhere to have a full day's meeting.

146
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,020
Well,

147
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,300
then when are you free?

148
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,850
This meeting

149
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,030
will last

150
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,670
for days.

151
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,090
I'll wait for you in the company tomorrow.

152
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,960
Until you're willing

153
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,080
to discuss business with me.

154
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,550
You and Jiang Hu must have known each other before.

155
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,070
We were

156
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,140
classmates in middle school and high school.

157
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,270
But you two

158
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,420
don't seem close.

159
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,090
I don't quite get along with her.

160
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,660
I heard that

161
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,570
she learned French

162
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,790
in just half a year.

163
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,180
Is that true?

164
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,940
That's nothing.

165
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,780
In the past,

166
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,440
in order to finish her handicraft class assignment,

167
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,050
she didn't let anyone help her.

168
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,500
In the end, her hands were pricked so much that they looked like sieves

169
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,710
and even got inflamed

170
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,510
with blood blisters.

171
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,550
It took a long time to recover.

172
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
She's harsh on herself.

173
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,290
That's her style.

174
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,030
You don't have a close relationship

175
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,760

that Free Unicorn is not qualified

It must be those onlookers.

349
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,630
You've really taken everything into consideration.

350
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,610
How dare I not take everything into consideration

351
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,620
when I'm

352
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,570
discussing business

353
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,540
with Boss Xu?

354
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,520
If I disagree,

355
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,170
you will upload these videos

356
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,230
online.

357
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,310
That way,

358
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,720
my reputation will be damaged.

359
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,710
Once my reputation is damaged,

360
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,640
Baoxing's reputation

361
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,740
will also be damaged.

362
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,620
It will also affect

363
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,290
other projects in Baoxing Investment.

364
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,100
You created

365
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,050
a very dramatic situation

366
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,240
where one move triggers a full-blown crisis.

367
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,690
You are waiting for me to walk into the PR nightmare.

368
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,450
Jiang Hu.

369
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:11,770
No.

370
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,130
Ms. Jiang.

371
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,700
You sure are unscrupulous.

372
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,650
I told you

373
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,180
that I have no choice.

374
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,560
Without a choice,

375
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,900
I have only one way.

376
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,690
Just post it online if you want.

377
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,750
You don't care?

378
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,910
Is one video is enough?

379
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,850
There are other selfies

380
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,620
in my phone.

381
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,350
There are many selfies

382
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,210
of my good figure.

383
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,450
Didn't you add me on WeChat?

384
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,700
I'll send them all to you later.

385
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,570
With a two-pronged approach,

386
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,750
it's easier to become famous.

387
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,020
You make me feel

388
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,590
like my threat is a joke.

389
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,070
You're half right.

390
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,610
I really hate

391
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,580
being threatened indeed.

392
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,470
And once I compromise once,

393
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,930
it will become a habit.

394
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,770
As for the other half...

395
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,340
I admit

396
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,990
you are a smart person,

397
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,990
but your method is too foolish.

398
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,290
The land Teng Yue's at currently

399
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,920
costs over 1.5 million per year for rent.

400
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,750
It'll cost around three million for two years.

401
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,930
But you need to pay three years' worth of rent.

402
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,830
Why?

403
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,170
For factory buildings,

404
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,410
it's an industry rule to pay a year's rent in advance.

405
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,210
Why are you willing

406
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,530
to return to the negotiation table?

407
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,700
I hate being threatened,

408
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,300
but obviously,

409
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,500
I still have the right to take the initiative.

410
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:53,850
Xu Si.

411
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,570
I don't care

412
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,820
what your reason is,

413
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,820
but you know

414
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,970
my difficulties.

415
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,450
At this point,

416
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,620
bringing such conditions up

417
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,210
is really pointless.

418
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,450
For the payment, I'm willing to

419
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,490
pay you according to the highest interest rate

420
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,750
of the financial product among the four major banks.

421
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,340
I'll even double it. I promise you.

422
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,060
As long as you allow me to pay at the end of the year.

423
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,300
We can state everything

424
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,540
in the contract.

425
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:16,930
You're being a rogue

426
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,060
by discussing business like this.

427
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,780
That's because I'm desperate.

428
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,430
What if I don't want to?

429
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,300
I'm begging you.

430
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,520
Fine.

431
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,090
Although

432
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,470
it's not an high-interest loan...

433
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,470
Based on your empty words,

434
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,530
I can't trust that I can get the money back

435
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,980
from Teng Yue under your management

436
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,690
in one to two years.

437
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,520
I need evidence

438
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,710
to prove that you are reliable.

439
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,850
Then tell me,

440
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,390
what should I do

441
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,240
to make you confident in me?

442
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:11,810
Give me

443
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,210
a proposal about reviving Teng Yue.

444
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,440
Then we can discuss it again.

445
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,370
Are you talking about

446
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,250
a serious discussion?

447
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,090
Neither of us will play tricks this time.

448
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,380
Let's discuss seriously.

449
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,050
Your makeup skills were good,

450
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,170
especially your speed.

451
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:56,950
Come on.

452
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,660
I really didn't expect

453
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,780
you to agree to it.

454
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,000
This is not like you.

455
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,460
You've never been threatened.

456
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
There are hundreds of reasons

457
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,770
to reject her.

458
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,180
Jiang Hu's unyielding perseverance

459
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,290
and adventurous spirit

460
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,850
must have been inherited from Jiang Qisheng.

461
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,730
What do you mean? I donâ€™t understand.

462
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,430
Give her a chance

463
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,260
to be utterly convinced to admit defeat.

464
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,810
Are you Zhaoyang?

465
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:43,840
Yes.

466
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,690
You are...

467
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:46,530
We don't know each other.

468
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,170
But I've seen

469
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,250
the videos you've filmed.

470
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,610
I think they're so stylish.

471
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,920
Even better than advertisements.

472
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,170
I watch every episode.

473
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,220
Thank you.

474
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:53,810
By the way,

475
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,690
I even specially bought

476
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,990
the bag you hand-painted.

477
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,170
But I think I'll have to starve

478
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,800
for this month.

479
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,940
Thank you.

480
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,770
But I have to go to work.

481
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:02,530
It's okay.

482
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,610
I just think

483
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,250
I'm really lucky

484
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,610
to run into you.

485
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,450
I can brag to my friends

486
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,810
for a month.

487
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,070
You're really great.

488
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:09,370
By the way,

489
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,010
when will you

490
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:10,730
release new works?

491
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,370
Hello, who are you looking for?

492
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,260
It's okay.

493
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,530
Zhaoyang, all the best.

494
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,010
I will follow up

495
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,290
with your new work.

496
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,050
I'll keep paying attention to you.

497
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,610
Bye.

498
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,830
-Thank you.
-Work hard.

499
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:19,890
Bye bye.

500
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,120
Come on, Zhaoyang!

501
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,860
Are we exaggerating?

502
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,520
In just a few days,

503
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,340
Zhaoyang's follower count

504
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,670
has exploded to 1 million.

505
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,150
It's all thanks to Ms. Song,

506
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,490
that the brands recognize

507
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,290
Zhaoyang's videos.

508
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,800
Mainly, the direction of Zhaoyang's videos

509
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,730
is very clear.

510
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,570
Zhaoyang.

511
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,250
I told you you wouldn't go wrong if you followed my instructions.

512
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,530
Thank you, Ms. Song.

513
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,820
What's the situation of the brands

514
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,770
working with Zhaoyang's livestreams?

515
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,370
As of now, 18 brands have already

516
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,710
contacted us.

517
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,530
Among them,

518
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,570
three cosmetics brands

519
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:52,610
are our regular customers.

520
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,660
These are the WeChat Business brands

521
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,660
that frequently worked with Tao Xiaoying and Nan, right?

522
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,530
Yes.

523
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,530
They are very sincere

524
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,770
in supporting our newcomer.

525
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,690
Their brand styles

526
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,300
are not suitable for Zhaoyang's direction.

527
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,840
These three are famous local brands.

528
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,370
But the quotation is very ordinary.

At this stage,

531
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,570
what's important is the partner,

532
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,530
not the price.

533
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,530
We need to emphasize the correlation

534
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,090
between her style and the brand's style.

535

Lidu Department Store?

536
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:34,570
I choose Lidu.

537
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:38,450
What's the reason?

538
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,820
The reason is simple.

539
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,890
The direction of Zhaoyang's videos is very clear.

540
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,060
The brand style that was revealed

541
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,140
is also very consistent.

542
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,690
After being recognized by the brand,

543
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,380
our transformation will be very effective.

544
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,290
It fits Lidu's direction of rebranding

545
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,170
into a young and casual brand.

546
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,100
Besides, judging from the video's

547
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,360
communication dimension,

548
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:56,930
TT Media is investing

549
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,370
all their resources in her videos

550
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,160
to promote her.

551
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,700
If we work with her,

552
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:01,890
it'll be like working with

553
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,000
more than half of the influencers

554
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,250
of TT Media.

555
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,170
But TT Media

556
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,290
hasn't replied us yet.

557
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,230
Don't worry.

00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,330
They will agree.

559
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:26,890
Let's choose Lidu.

560
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,280
Lidu's performance has been poor these two years

561
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,050
and has closed down

562
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,120
two or three stores.

563
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,180
Have you been to Lidu recently?

564
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,250
Lidu's investment structure is too complicated

565
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,240
and there's nothing special.

566
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,090
Every time I went there,

567
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,410
I couldn't find anything I wanted to buy

568
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,770
nor did I buy anything.

569
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,790
Three months ago,

570
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,810
Lidu transferred over a vice president in charge of

571
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,730
market management and investment

572
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,880
from their Hong Kong headquarters.

573
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,510
The first thing he did after taking charge of Lidu

574
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,380
was to adjust the investment structure

575
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,110
to attract the currently popular

576
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,120
local and foreign trendy brands.

577
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,670
I went there yesterday.

578
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,140
I thought I went to the wrong place.

579
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,690
I didn't expect so many people there

580
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,570
after renovation.

581
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,090
Yes.

582
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,330
This should just be the prelude of Lidu.

583
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,929
Working with Lidu, Xiang Zhaoyang

584
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:12,850
can indirectly

585
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,810
be correlated with

586
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,929
Lidu's brand.

587
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:15,810
It's a kind of effect

588
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,360
where one plus one is greater than two.

589
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,040
Which other brand can achieve this?

590
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,969
Mr. Xu.

591
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,250

or to reunite?

593
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,420
What do you mean?

594
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,770
Why did you constantly

595
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,170
pick on me just now?

596
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,170
I don't think

597
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,290
I'm that annoying.

598
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,639

600
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,870

601

your mistakes at work.

603

00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,820
be in a relationship.

607

Can't you treat me

Ten years ago,

688
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,900
Teng Yue shoes

689
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,120
â™«Riding the wind and flying highâ™«

690
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,700
represented my entire youth.

691
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,900
â™«Growing recklesslyâ™«

692
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:19,660
â™«A little wishâ™«

693
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,890
â™«Even if we're surrounded by dangersâ™«

694
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,380
â™«Never compromise or retreatâ™«

695
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,180
â™«I didn't fulfill my wishâ™«

696
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,340
â™«I've been wandering in a dreamâ™«

697
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,390
â™«The faith guides meâ™«

698
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,230
â™«No one can stop meâ™«

699
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,360
â™«I shout, whether noisily or lonelyâ™«

700
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,710
â™«I keep going without hesitationâ™«

701
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,560
â™«The faith guides meâ™«

702
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,640
â™«The victory is waving at meâ™«

703
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:54,340
â™«Protect your true selfâ™«

704
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,770
We have a planning meeting

705
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,880
with the executives of Lidu today.

706
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:00,730
We'll meet at 10 a.m.

707
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,010
at the entrance of Lidu.

708
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:05,840
Sure.

709
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,950
Are you busy?

710
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,850
What would you like today?

711
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,070
How is the business?

712
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,080
Not bad.

713
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,400
We didn't get enough noodles yesterday.

714
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,300
I gave you a ton of noodles

715
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,540
yesterday.

716
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,680
I'm not

717
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,510
as clever in doing business as you.

718
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,040
Well...

719
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,000
By the way,

720
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,780
the slaughterhouse told me to raise the price tomorrow.

721
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,930
Raise the price?

722
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,280
Raise the price.

723
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,990
Don't, Liu.

724
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,570
How can you raise the price?

725
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,850
It's not up to me.

726
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,160
Right now, the price of pork belly

727
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,170
per 500 grams is spiking.

728
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,600
I can't afford the cost.

729
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,050
Don't raise the price.

730
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,440
Don't cry about being poor.

731
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,000
I know you well.

732
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,250
I don't make any money.

733
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,550
I really don't make any money.

734
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,720
Forget it.

735
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,760
Pick one for me.

736
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,220
This one is good.

737
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,340
Look. Is it okay?

738
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,290
Sure.

739
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,090
Okay.

740
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:20,810
I'll weigh it for you.

741
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,340
Okay.

742
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,940
I've tidied it up for you.

743
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,600
Just make do with it.

744
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,970
Tidy up a bit.

745
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,420
Well,

746
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,860
you won't stay here for long anyway.

747
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,410
How little faith do you have

748
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,470
in your niece?

749
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,990
No, no, no.

750
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:01,490
Well,

751
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,550
you know what kind of situation

752
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,650
Teng Yue is in now.

753
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,710
Even if you successfully negotiate

754
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,650
the deal about the land,

755
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,570
how much is the rent of one year

756
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,770
that Xu Si is asking for?

757
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,000
Can you get the money?

758
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,610
As long as he gives me a chance.

759
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,760
In the past, Teng Yue's

760
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,040
OEM business

761
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,650
was provided by Free Unicorn.

762
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,180
Now, it's gone.

763
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,510
It's gone.

764
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,620
There's nothing left.

765
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,380
In addition, right now, there are dozens of people

766
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,280
in our factory

767
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,070
whose salaries need to be paid every month.

768
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:33,730
Also,

769
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,640
the factory's rent for one year cost millions.

770
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,260
Only costs and no profits.

771
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,250
This is not a chance.

772
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,180
This is a pit.

773
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,010
An endless pit.
