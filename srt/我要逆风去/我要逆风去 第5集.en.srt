Boss.

Jindian Industry

00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,030
has sent people to view the cup factory.

8
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,979
They said they'd have

9
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,390
their quotation calculated within this week

10
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,120
and give it to us.

11
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,720
One more thing.

12
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,470
Have you told your mom about this?

13
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,990
This doesn't concern you.

14
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,790
Okay.

15
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,180
This way.

16
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,990
What a pity.

17
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,120
No, it's not.

18
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,300
Everything is here.

19
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,500
Help yourselves.

20
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,210
Gosh, Jiang Hu.

21
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,600
You've only got

22
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,220
these few pairs of shoes left.

23
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,950
Then why are you selling them?

24
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,240
They're not even enough for you to wear.

25
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,310
You are so miserable now.

26
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:33,670
We feel so bad for you.

27
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,620
Exactly.

28
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,990
This pair it is.

29
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,829
Wrap it up for me.

30
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,390
Is 3,000 enough?

31
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,150
I'll transfer it to you on WeChat.

32
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,310
3000?

33
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,070
3000 isn't

34
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,400
even a fraction of the cost of this pair of shoes.

35
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Ms. Jiang.

36
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,270
I know the market price better than you.

37
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,410
I won't offer you more money.

38
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,250
If you don't believe me, try sell it on Xianyu yourself.

39
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,620
I want this pair.

40
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,420
That pair...

41
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,950
I don't feel like selling that pair.

42
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,800
Can you pick something else?

43
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,790
If you don't want to sell,

44
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,950
then why did you ask me here?

45
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,220
Are you messing with me?

46
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,020
No.

47
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,830
That pair of shoes

48
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,170
was customized for me

49
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,970
by my dad and the designer of Free Unicorn

50
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,210
when I was 18.

51
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,590
That's the only pair in the world.

52
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,160
But this pair is exactly what I want.

53
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,470
I won't bargain with you

54
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,350
like her.

55
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,780
I offer you 10,000 for this pair.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,680
Jiang Hu.

57
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,140
The laces of this pair of shoes are so hard to tie.

58
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,550
Come and show me

59
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,650
how you tie them.

60
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,590
Come tie them for me.

61
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,700
Either

62
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,640
you tie my shoelaces,

63
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:27,930
or

64
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,520
I won't buy anything.

65
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,160
They won't, either.

66
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,310
Wang Lan.

67
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,710
We all used to be good friends.

68
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,040
You...

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,880
Where did your courage

70
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,030
to slap Wenshan on the auction

71
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,909
go?

72
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:29,740
[1,000 square meters. Super delicate cleaning from inside to outside.]

73
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:41,950
You know what?

74
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,140
In this era,

75
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,650
looks are very important.

76
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,400
Boss.

77
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,990
Do you want some?

78
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,050
Here.

79
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,680
You're here.

80
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,880
Early this morning,

81
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,570
we saw your luggage was here,

82
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,450
but you were not.

83
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,810
I knew you must have come.

84
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,250
We

85
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,790
cleaned up the upstairs room for you.

86
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,230
We also cleaned up

87
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,300
the bathroom for you.

88
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,080
Why don't you go take a look?

89
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,600
Okay.

90
00:10:59,010 --> 00:10:59,970
Come on.

91
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,590
Please.

92
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,830
Come here.

93
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:06,870
Come here.

94
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,410
Check it out.

95
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,170
I'll ask my son

96
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,410
to come install a rain shower this afternoon,

97
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,330
and it'll be fully-equipped.

98
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,880
One more thing.

99
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,610
This is the key to the bathroom.

100
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,700
Here, take it.

101
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,720
This is the only one.

102
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:27,810
From now on,

103
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,640
this place will be solely yours.

104
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,810
If you need anything in the future,

105
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,760
or if you need help with cleaning,

106
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:34,890
just let us know.

107
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,650
You're more than welcome.

108
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,470
We don't know

109
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,900
how much longer we can stay.

110
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,610
But as long as we're here,

111
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,370
we'll take good care of you

112
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,170
for your grandpa and your mom.

113
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,190
Yes.

114
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,870
Thank you.

115
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,080
Let's go see upstairs.

116
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:54,360
Okay.

117
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,290
Let's go.

118
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,080
Come on.

119
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:06,860
Look.

120
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,570
Look, the condition is just like this.

121
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,090
Sorry you'll have to cope with it.

122
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:18,970
Alright.

123
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,010
Take a rest.

124
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,840
We'll get back to work downstairs.

125
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:23,690
Let me know if you need anything.

126
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,410
Let us know.

127
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:26,510
We're leaving.

128
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,290
Let's go.

129
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:28,770
Okay.

130
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:29,760
See you.

131
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,080
Let's go.

132
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,080
Boss.

133
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,500
Boss, come here.

134
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,010
Come here.

135
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,630
Boss, here.

136
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,300
Come on.

137
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,350
I'll live here with you from now on.

138
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,600
Let's get along.

139
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,070
Auntie, why are you here?

140
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,990
You took people to view the factory?

141
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,490
You know

142
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,930
that factory is your mom's life.

143
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,590
Given my mom's condition,

144
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,600
her life will be at risk

145
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,610
if she keeps on working in the factory.

146
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,950
You know that

147
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,150
she takes money from home every month

148
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,020
to support the factory.

149
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,420
Do you think

150
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,190
she should keep going?

151
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,240
Don't tell me

152
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,230
you don't know why.

153
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,730
Speak of the devil.

154
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,770
Hello, Mom.

155
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,970
Okay. Got it.

156
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,080
Okay.

157
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,240
Moping.

158
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:25,380
Mom.

159
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,360
Stand right there.

160
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,130
Why don't we sit down and talk?

161
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,260
You can come and sit.

162
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,730
Let him stand.

163
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,920
Tell me.

164
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,200
Let me ask you.

165
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,970
Do you know you're wrong?

166
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,400
Mom.

167
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,430
Do you know

168
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,610
why I studied finance?

169
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,270
Of course we know.

170
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
To help enterprises with financial tools.

171
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,150
No.

172
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,050
The purpose of finance

173
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:51,710
is never

174
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,750
to facilitate the development of enterprises.

175
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,150
This kid...

176
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,410
Let him finish.

177
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,680
The purpose of finance

178
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,710
is to let those inefficient enterprises

179
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,810
clear out and go bankrupt themselves.

180
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,390
I always bear this purpose

181
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,240
in mind

182
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,430
whether when I did mergers and acquisitions before

183
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,150
or work in Baoxing now.

184
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,150
If your dad

185
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,050
knew what you just said...

186
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,520
If my dad knew what I just said,

187
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,220
he would agree with me.

188
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,220
Survival of the fittest.

189
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,910
Let what needs to end end.

190
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:17,770
In this way,

191
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,850
we can not only avoid tragedies from happening,

192
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,570
but also get a win-win.

193
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,210
What did you say?

194
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,840
Repeat

195
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,780
what you just said.

196
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,440
Stop it.

197
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,740
If you agreed to the merger back then,

198
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,290
Xufeng would have got the funds

199
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,820
for equipment upgrade.

200
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,240
That fire caused by

201
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:33,970
equipment aging

202
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,010
wouldn't have happened.

203
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,310
You can't say that.

204
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,010
You...

205
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,020
Moping. Moping.

206
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,780
You're still blaming me?

207
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,340
I'm not blaming you.

208
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,530
But I won't change my mind about

209
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,730
what I believe is right, either.

210
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,010
Get out of here!

211
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,140
Calm down.

212
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:48,570
Moping.

213
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,010
Come on.

214
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,290
Sit down.

215
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:49,970
All right.

216
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,030
Moping.

217
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,580
Come on.

218
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:52,980
Sit down.

219
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,400
He's just a kid. Don't let him rattle your cage.

220
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,100
I'm so pissed.

221
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,790
Listen to what he said.

222
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,370
Are you planning to live here?

223
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,280
Why do you want to see me?

224
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,300
This is my last job

225
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,320
as the CFO of Free Unicorn.

226
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,030
This is a ledger

227
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,290
your father left me.

228
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,850
It records the money he lent

229
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,800
to his friends in private.

230
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,200
Not counting the interest,

231
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,960
the total amount

232
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,110
should be more than 5 million.

233
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,430
It can temporarily relieve

234
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,770
the financial pressure of factory renting of you.

235
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,050
Go have a try.

236
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,650
Where're the IOUs?

237
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,760
If there were IOUs,

238
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,370
I wouldn't have said "have a try".

239
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,650
Mr. Ye is still in a meeting.

240
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,290
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,280
Okay, thank you.

242
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,000
I've never borrowed money

243
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,300
from your dad.

244
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,010
Where are you?

245
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,210
Let's meet.

246
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,400
Where do you want me to wait for you?

247
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,770
How did you get in?

248
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,290
Didn't I tell you

249
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,730
to wait for me at the lobby cafe?

250
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,880
I have a membership card here.

251
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,330
Besides, I don't have

252
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,350
that much time to wait for you.

253
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,480
Go ahead.

254
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,610
Give me 10 more days.

255
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,600
Okay.

256
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,050
Are you planning to rent a factory

257
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,980
and keep Teng Yue's business going?

258
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,360
It's none of your business.

259
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
It seems that you still don't understand

260
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:45,810
what problems you're facing

261
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,010
after taking over Teng Yue.

262
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,960
Teng Yue has basically paid off all its debts

263
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,540
through auction.

264
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,150
Only dozens of workers

265
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,980
and 20,000 pairs of

266
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,450
unsold shoes are left.

267
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,270
You know it pretty well.

268
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,160
Making an investment is like taking a flight.

269
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,360
No matter how high you fly,

270
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,520
or how passionate you are,

271
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,090
the most important thing is to land safely.

272
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
If you want to get out of

273
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,540
your current plight as soon as possible,

274
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,130
there are two ways.

275
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,250
One,

276
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,880
sell Teng Yue to someone else.

277
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,370
I can help you with this.

278
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:22,460
Perhaps

279
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,070
you can also make a small profit out of it.

280
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:25,570
Xu Si.

281
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,840
Do you think I have so much time

282
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,090
that I just sell what I bought?

283
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:28,910
Do you think I'm joking around?

284
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,200
The second way

285
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,970
is to fire all the workers

286
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,410
and keep the label.

287
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,720
Find an OEM factory.

288
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,050
The only thing you'll need is an office.

289
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,290
They've worked for Teng Yue

290
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,620
for 30 to 40 years.

291
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,810
I can't do that.

292
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,240
Won't it be like if Zhang Wenshan took over Teng Yue...

293
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,540
No OEM factory

294
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,960
is willing to take over the workers together with the label.

295
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,940
I've never thought about finding an OEM factory.

296
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,580
But the problem is that you have neither money

297
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,480
nor a factory.

298
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,450
Even if I give you more time,

299
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,810
you'll still be sleeping on the streets

300
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,050
in 10 days.

301
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,060
I said it's none of your business.

302
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,130
I will take care of

303
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,000
Teng Yue's affairs.

304
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,060
Jiang Hu.

305
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,490
I'm only telling you this

306
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,530
because I treat you as a friend.

307
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,210
But it seems

308
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,580
it doesn't really concern you

309
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,770
whether

310
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,080
this dilapidated spaceship you're driving

311
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,350
named Teng Yue

312
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,030
will land

313
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,790
or crash.

314
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,840
Jiang Hu wants to continue Teng Yue's factory business,

315
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,320
and she wants to take the old workers along?

316
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:16,730
Oh my god.

317
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,490
She's digging her own grave.

318
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,600
This is a suicide attempt of entrepreneurship.

319
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,260
Go settle the case of Teng Yue

320
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,730
in 10 days.

321
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,570
Boss. Boss.

[Xixingji]

324
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,240
Boss.

325
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,120
Take a look.

326
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,600
What do you think of

327
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,290
these selling points for our future?

328
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,740
Boss.

329
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:41,810
That...

330
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,730
That...

331
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,490
That person is here to pay you back.

332
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:49,770
I've reconciled

333
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,130
all the accounts.

334
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:52,920
What about the money?

335
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,050
Did you bring it?

336
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,810
I have no money now.

337
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,860
Are you kidding me?

338
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,330
How could you

339
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,680
welch on your debts so blatantly?

340
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,290
My dad lent some money

341
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,600
in private before.

342
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,560
If you can get it back for me,

343
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,640
no matter how much,

344
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,250
I'll use it to repay

345
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,050
your friends first.

346
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,780
Do I look like an idiot?

347
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,110
You owe my friends money,

348
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,160
and you want me to work for you?

349
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,490
This is the only way

350
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,410
you can get your arrears back from Teng Yue.

351
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,290
Are you threatening me?

352
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,060
I'd say it's a negotiation.

353
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,650
You think

354
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,590
there's nothing I can do to you,

355
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,110
right?

356
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,010
I'm just telling you.

357
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,870
This is the best way.

358
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,920
Think about it yourself.

359
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:41,880
Will you keep your promise?

360
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,240
What do you think?

361
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,570
Then it's a deal.

362
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,680
Repay my friends first

363
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,930
with the money I collect.

364
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,290
Deal.

365
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,400
There're no eternal enemies,

366
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,730
nor eternal friends.

367
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,370
What matters

368
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,550
is to be evenly matched.

369
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,570
If you don't learn how to kill two birds with one stone,

370
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,700
how can you dominate the martial world?

371
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,850
Get to the point.

372
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,720
Jiang Hu is really something.

373
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,090
She actually used our boss as a tool.

374
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,890
As the saying goes,

375
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,940
when Boss steps in,

376
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,770
he's old but vigorous,

377
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,520
old but strong,

378
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,210
and old...

379
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,160
But mature.

380
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,510
[Wu, Yang Jian's good friend]

381
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,250
If Boss hears what you say,

382
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,710
he'll beat you up and you'll be old and sick.

383
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,250
You're both oversimplifying it.

384
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,510
Are you questioning me?

385
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,790
I'm not questioning you.

386
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,770
So you're questioning me? Why?

387
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,760
I'm not questioning you either.

388
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,700
I'm questioning those people.

389
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,300
Nowadays,

390
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,410
those who owe money have the upper hand.

391
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,280
Don't you think so?

392
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,660
Since they managed to gain the upper hand,

393
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,320
they must have something up their sleeve.

394
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,360
In my opinion,

395
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,930
it can be summarized

396
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:11,800
into four words.

397
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,810
Lend me some money?

398
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,240
No shame at all!

399
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,230
Since I used to be your father's friend,

400
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,360
I'll give you 50% off

401
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,310
when you come to dine here.

402
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,810
What my dad gave you back then

403
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,660
was not a Free Unicorn discount card,

404
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,790
but 100,000 yuan

405
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,570
in cash.

406
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:30,650
And he didn't even ask you for an IOU

407
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,610
since he didn't want you to lose face.

408
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,430
No matter what you say,

409
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,690
I have no money.

410
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,270
So your friendship was fake?

411
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,960
You're making it easy for me.

412
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:41,860
Let's see.

413
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,730
Where should I hang it?

414
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,560
What are you doing?

415
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,220
Let's hang it here.

416
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,300
What are you doing?

417
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,370
Put it away.

418
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,630
Put it away.

419
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,050
Don't mess around here.

420
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,780
You're scaring my customers away.

421
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,760
Then shut it down.

422
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,890
If it weren't Mr. Jiang

423
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,730
who lent you money back then,

424
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,420
your restaurant should have shut down at that time.

425
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,130
I'm very happy that

426
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:00,770
you think of me

427
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,090
when you're in trouble.

428
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,060
For real.

429
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,380
You're giving me an opportunity

430
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,850
to repay your father.

431
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,030
Liu.

432
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:09,590
Yes.

433
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,080
Come here.

434
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,120
Mr. Wang.

435
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,020
You're a man of your word.

436
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,770
Call me uncle.

437
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,880
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

438
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,410
Withdraw all the money from my account

439
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,530
and give it to my niece.

440
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,200
After paying the bank loan interest yesterday,

441
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:25,900
there's only

442
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,320
8,600 yuan left on the account.

443
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,160
Look.

444
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,880
How could a person be like that?

445
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,200
If they push me too far,

446
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,410
I'll bring people here every day

447
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,280
and have a good talk about life and dreams

448
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,570
with their boss.

449
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,940
Can't you say something useful?

450
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,700
Can't you be more decent?

451
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,650
What's the use of being decent?

452
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,400
Haven't you had enough of their indifference these days?

453
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,860
I'm sorry.

454
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,190
I didn't expect you know how to apologize.

455
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,850
I only feel sorry after I apologize.

456
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,290
I didn't expect

457
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,570
you're serious about this, either.

458
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,010
About what?

459
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,790
I thought

460
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,830
you were

461
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,020
just sadfishing

462
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,070
under the guise of debt collection.

463
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,780
You must be happy,

464
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,850
seeing my sadness is real.

465
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,770
What surprised me the most is that

466
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,900
you, a pampered young lady,

467
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,530
would have your heels broken

468
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,960
to pay us back.

469
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,500
I really can't handle debt collection.

470
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,470
I just can't.

471
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,140
It's okay.

472
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,070
Leave it to me.

473
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,520
Isn't there a biggest debt left?

474
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,250
That person has been hiding from you for days.

475
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,790
I'm sure I can get it back.

476
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:16,810
Yang.

477
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,290
What's going on?

478
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,960
Yang?

479
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,500
I've never heard you call me that.

480
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,290
Get to the point.

481
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:23,800
Here's the thing.

482
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,200
C Club

483
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,010
is around the corner ahead.

484
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,130
The person we're looking for

485
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,890
is in there right now,

486
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:28,810
having dinner with someone.

487
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,060
What do you mean?

488
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,730
Are you going to C Club

489
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,430
to collect the debt?

490
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,500
It doesn't seem appropriate.

491
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,790
What's inappropriate about that?

492
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,740
You don't understand.

493
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,790
It's exactly because he's in this kind of place

494
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,440
that it'll be easier

495
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:41,960
for us

496
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,050
to put him on the spot.

497
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,220
At worst,

498
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,810
I'll be able to collect the interest for you.

499
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:48,810
Okay.

500
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:49,810
Let's go.

501
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,570
Wait.

502
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,490
There's one problem.

503
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,290
C Club

504
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,650
is a members-only club.

505
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,650
I have an idea.

506
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,640
Let's go in

507
00:30:58,930 --> 00:30:59,770
through the back door...

508
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,450
I'm a member.

509
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,280
Let's go.

510
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,330
So it's not a problem.

511
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:09,770
This way, please.

512
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,610
What is

513
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,570
the most expensive wine here?

514
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,590
La Romanee Conti.

515
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,490
What's that?

516
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,230
How much is a bottle?

517
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,490
About 100,000 yuan.

518
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:27,750
Waiter.

519
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,480
The one she said, Conti whatever.

520
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,640
La Romanee Conti.

521
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:30,890
Yes.

522
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:31,530
That wine.

523
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,770
Get 10 bottles delivered to the private room.

524
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,090
We didn't order much this month.

525
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:35,880
Each table can only

526
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,840
order one bottle today.

527
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,610
Okay.

528
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,370
Then one bottle it is.

529
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,700
As of last quarter,

530
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,170
the growth of users...

531
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,750
Who are you?

532
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,430
Why did you barge in without knocking?

533
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:58,890
Which one is him?

534
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,110
Mr. Li, right?

535
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:08,950
You've not only aged,

536
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,780
but also lost your memory.

537
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:10,850
Look who this is.

538
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,580
Don't you recognize her?

539
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,000
Your creditor, Jiang Qisheng.

540
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,800
Let me help you recall it.

541
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:17,420
Come on.

542
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,170
Cheers.

543
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:19,860
Come on.

544
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,640
Make a wish.

545
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,750
Let me sing you a birthday song.

546
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,180
What wish?

547
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,610
Listen.

548
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,990
I'm going to call the police.

549
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,570
No problem.

550
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,270
Call the police then.

551
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,730
My dad Jiang Qisheng

552
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,240
lent you 3 million when he was alive.

553
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,200
It's only right to pay your debt.

554
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,450
Even if the police come,

555
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,380
I would say the same thing.

556
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:38,570
Mr. Li.

557
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,290
You started your own business.

558
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,830
You should at least have some conscience and credibility.

559
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,380
Mr. Xu.

560
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,960
I didn't expect Baoxing

561
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,820
would be interested in

562
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,590
a deadbeat start-up company like this.

563
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,290
Aren't you worried that the money you invest

564
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,480
will be gone for good?

565
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,830
What nonsense are you talking about?

566
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,730
She's slandering me.

567
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,370
I didn't expect you're still

568
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,560
so willful, Ms. Jiang.

569
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,690
What's more effective than being angry

570
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,130
is taking out the IOU.

571
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,220
Whether you go to the police

572
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,560
or pursue the legal route,

573
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,650
no one will be able to welch on it.

574
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,370
Right?

575
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,100
Yes.

576
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,850
Show me the evidence,

577
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,950
or I'll sue you for defamation.

578
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:14,570
Sir.

579
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,670
This is

580
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,730
the La Romanee Conti you ordered.

581
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,020
Give it to me.

582
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,980
Is this how you serve your customers?

583
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,570
You just let random people

584
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,770
in like that?

585
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:25,830
We'll

586
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,590
bear some loss.

587
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,610
Take this bottle of wine

588
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,010
as the interest

589
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,290
of the money you borrowed.

590
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,640
This bottle of wine was ordered by Mr. Li over there.

591
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:33,540
Let's go.

592
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:35,600
You...

593
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,600
Are you a burglar?

594
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,060
I didn't order that wine.

595
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,380
Why did you deliver the wine without asking me?

596
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,620
Let me tell you.

597
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
I'm not paying for that.

598
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,890
What kind of place is this?

599
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:48,940
There are so many rules.

600
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,290
They only allow one bottle per table.

601
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,730
If we could get 20 bottles,

602
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,580
his debt would be cleared.

603
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:53,920
I'll ask my friend

604
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,060
to write off this bottle of wine as soon as possible.

605
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,600
Take it as the interest.

606
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,940
Don't worry.

607
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,300
That Li

608
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,740
can run, but he can't hide.

609
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,790
I'll go a few more times.

610
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,420
The interest will probably be enough

611
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,410
to pay off the principal.

612
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,659
Let's go.

613
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:09,449
To my restaurant.

614
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,239
I'll buy you wontons and wine.

615
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,750
What's that saying again?

616
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,179
Have wontons with wine, and everything will be fine.

617
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,730
No, thanks.

618
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,199
I want to be alone for a while.

619
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,020
Okay.

620
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:27,810
What's wrong

621
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,600
with you?

622
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,820
What's with your service?

623
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,530
How could you just let

624
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,790
random people in?

625
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,290
I'm sorry.

626
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,500
It's the restaurant's mistake.

627
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,159
I'm really sorry.

628
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,090
I'm really sorry.

629
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,830
Sorry?

630
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,100
If this happens again,

631
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,090
I won't come anymore.

632
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,239
I'm sorry.

633
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,260
Mr. Xu, I'm sorry.

634
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,010
I'm sorry you have to see this.

635
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,580
Look.

636
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,600
There're all kinds of weird people

637
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,179
nowadays.

638
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,770
She even dared to come and blackmail me

639
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,690
without any evidence.

640
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,550
Mr. Li.

641
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,420
The financial report

642
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,610
that you provided

643
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,760
does record an investment of 3 million yuan

644
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,150
from an unknown source.

645
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:08,570
Well,

646
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,000
that money is...

647
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,240
It has nothing to do with me.

648
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,420
The Micro Dance Club project

649
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,890
is witnessing great user growth.

650
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,340
The profit model is also getting clearer gradually.

651
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,550
But

652
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,660
Baoxing also pays special attention to

653
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,180
the personal brand of the founder.

654
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,600
It's a bad thing

655
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,840
if your personal reputation

656
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,440
affects the project,

657
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,140
right?

658
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,770
Solve

659
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,640
your debt problem first.

660
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:33,950
This way, our future development

661
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,230
can be more guaranteed.

662
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:36,680
What do you think?

663
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,030
Okay.

664
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,130
Okay.

665
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,220
I have some other business to attend to.

666
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,120
See you.

667
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:46,530
Stay.

668
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,550
Mr. Xu.

669
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,110
By the way,

670
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,590
don't forget to pay the bill

671
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,290
for that wine just now.

672
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,090
[Teng Yue Shoes]

673
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,130
Master Zhang.

674
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,600
Why are you still here?

675
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,290
Well,

676
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,460
I see you've been out

677
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,410
a lot these days.

678
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:04,730
You don't have any

679
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,820
convenient means of transportation.

680
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,350
We

681
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,720
rented an electric moped for you.

682
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,600
You won't waste any time if there's something urgent,

683
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:14,570
right?

684
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,000
Here.

685
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,600
The moped

686
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,050
is parked in the yard.

687
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,260
Take it and have a look.

688
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:25,390
Take it.

689
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,560
I'll go have a look.

690
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:23,980
Boss.

691
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,100
Move.

692
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,020
Make way.

693
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,250
Go away.

694
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,410
Go away.
