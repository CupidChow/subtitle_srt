15
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,170
But now the market is...

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,680
If we can

17
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,390

18
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,990

19
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,390
and even

20
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,950

21
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,390

23
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,900

26

27
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,020
Can we

28
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,990

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,170
Director, look.

30
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,150
You...

31
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,230
You're right on the point.

32
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,829
Director.

33
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:41,590
We should have started

34
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,800
developing in this direction long ago.

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,070
Yes.

36
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,670
I don't believe

37
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,870
we can't compete with international brands.

38
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,430
Exactly.

39
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,110
Look, he took us around the factory

40
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,230
for half an hour,

41
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,230
and this is what he wanted to say.

42
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,550
Okay. Good.

43
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,510
Since we're of the same mind,

44

let's work in unity.

45

51

to transfer to my pay card?

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
It's your sales commission.

53
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,230
It can't be helped even if you think it's too little.

54
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,630
That's all I can give you.

55

I don't want it.

56

I'll transfer it to back to you right now.

57

Hey.

58

So there really are people in this world

59

who donâ€™t like money.

60
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,870
You don't want it even if I gave it to you?

61
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,390
I said I don't want it, so say no more.

62
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,360
Give it to whoever you want.

63

If you can't accept it,

64
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,440
just take it as the compensation

65
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,560
for the patent infringement

66

345
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,270
since when,

346
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,320
our thoughts and actions

347
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,780
gradually

348
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,110
unified.

349
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,130
But I didn't realize it until the end.

350
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,680
For a business to succeed,

351
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,050
dedication and sacrifice are a must.

352
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,170
Only when you dedicate

353
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,070
and sacrifice

354
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,510
will you realize

355
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,880
what should be given up

356
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,260
and what shouldn't be.

357
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,010
This is also true in relationships.

358
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,740
You two should

359
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,830
give each other some time.

360
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,680
Serve dishes for Table 5.

361
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,390
Coming.

362
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,190
Table 5.

363
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,320
What's on your mind?

364
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,110
Come on. Let's eat.

365
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,750
Miss.

366
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,200
Xu asked me to give this to you

367
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,680
if you ever came by.

368
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,310
Thank you.

369
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,720
You're welcome.

370
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,540
If you keep kicking, these shoes will be broken.

371
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,470
Don't worry. I cherish them a lot.

372
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,350
I plan to keep them as an heirloom.

373
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,520
It took me

374
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,170
a month

375
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,540
to design this pattern.

376
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,870
I hand-painted them myself.

377
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,470
This is the only pair in the world.

378
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,990
If you break them,

379
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,990
I won't have time to repaint for you.

380
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,030
Let's go.

381
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,910
You've got the inspiration?

382
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,800
The 100-year anniversary series'

383
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,400
rudiment is right here.

384
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,470
Do you want to challenge

385
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,730
a more difficult task?

386
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,200
What crazy idea did you come up with this time?

387
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,070
Teng Yue and Cloud Footwear's

388
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,000
100-year anniversary brand collaboration series.

389
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,630
No problem.

390
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,850
It's up to how much more design fee you're offering.

391
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:34,600
Who said

392
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,070
she'd hold on to Teng Yue for me,

393
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,810
and she owes a lot

394
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,580
to Teng Yue and me?

395
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,000
It's only been a few days,

396
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,500
and you started asking me for a raise.

397
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,230
It will hurt our relationship.

398
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,250
As someone who's experienced similar things,

399
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,660
I'm telling you, only when the accounts are clear

400
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,580
can a friendship last long.

401
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,570
Get in. It's freezing.

402
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,320
Thanks.

403
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,410
This time we're using Gary's fund

404
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,680
as our limited partner.

405
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,810
He didn't take this chance

406
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,070
to introduce another girl to you, did he?

407
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,860
I told him I have a son.

408
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,090
You know what? Your son

409
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,190
eats and sleeps very well,

410
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,920
and he goes to school every day.

411
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,550
You really need to work hard to make money.

412
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:28,990
Otherwise,

413
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,790
you wouldn't be able to support this bill crusher.

414
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,070
I'm trying, okay?

415
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,470
Seriously, though.

416
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,240
Jiang Hu

417
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,600
suddenly returned to Teng Yue,

418
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,730
and she's in charge of management now.

419
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,710
But she still

420
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,160
hasn't signed that contract.

421
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,560
Your aunt still has

422
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,750
that Equity Gifting Agreement.

423
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,890
So the entire Teng Yue

424
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,290
is still under your name.

425
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,080
Where are we going now?

426
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,120
To pick up my son.

427
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,620
I'm afraid if Fei raises

428
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,650
Kid for a few more days,

429
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,250
I won't be able to get it back.

430
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,110
No problem.

431
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:32,980
The sales of Cloud Footwear's online store

432
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,790
increased

433
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,949
by 30% this quarter.

434
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,370
Zhaoyang's design for

435
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,880
the two brands' 100-year anniversary collaboration

436
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
was very popular.

437
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,190
The 100,000 pairs we reserved

438
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,250
have been sold out.

439
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,610
You're so capable.

440
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,340
No wonder Yang

441
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,620
left all the work to you

442
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,469
and became an absentee landlord himself.

443
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,389
He...

444
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,730
He has more tricky problems to deal with.

445
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,659
What problem?

446
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:54,630
Blind date.

447
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,310
Xiang Zhaoyang finally

448
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,310
dumped him?

449
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,490
Great.

450
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,830
Without Yang Jian

451
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:02,880
all over her

452
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,590
all the time,

453
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,150
she can finally

454
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,500
focus on designing.

455
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,150
You wish.

456
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,600
He's here.

457
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,520
I walked here.

458
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,610
Really?

459
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,200
You live nearby?

460
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,490
Take a look.

461
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,430
This...

462
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,510
Check out this design.

463
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,160
So stylish.

464
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,790
Look.

465
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,790
How thick

466
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,030
this pillar is.

467
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,760
It represents Teng Yue's strength.

468
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,470
Teng Yue.

469
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,670
Look.

470
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,190
This place

471
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,270
is really nice.

472
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,700
Of course.

473
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,990
Don't you know whose workshop this is?

474
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,350
It's Teng Yue's.

475
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,110
Teng Yue.

476
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,230
Well,

477
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:34,990
Jiang Hu.

478
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,790
When is Cloud Footwear moving here?

479
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,640
Why does

480
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,290
Cloud Footwear have to

481
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,150
follow Teng Yue wherever we go?

482
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,350
You copycat.

483
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,330
That's not true.

484
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,710
What do you mean

485
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,750
Cloud Footwear follows Teng Yue wherever you go?

486
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,630
It's more like

487
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,820
Cloud Footwear should be

488
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,180
wherever Jiang Hu is.

489
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,080
You're being one-sided.

490
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,730
It's more like Teng Yue belongs to Jiang Hu,

491
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,780
and Jiang Hu belongs to Teng Yue.

492
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,400
Right?

493
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,050
Jiang Hu.

494
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,150
Well,

495
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,990
Cloud Footwear has to move here.

496
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,030
The decoration has already started.

497
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,640
By the way,

498
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,870
when Cloud Footwear moves here,

499
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,130
it'll be next to Teng Yue.

500
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,650
You can't

501
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,220
treat them differently.

502
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,870
I wouldn't have thought of this

503
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,910
if you didn't mention it.

504
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,100
Since you mentioned it, it occurred to me that

505
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,470
Li from Micro Dance Club

506
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,590
paid 3 million back.

507
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,210
Jiang Hu

508
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,980
didn't invest a penny of that money

509
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,780
into Teng Yue.

510
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,970
She invested it all in Cloud Footwear.

511
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,470
Jiang Hu.

512
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,550
Jiang Hu.

513
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,030
You...

514
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,100
Jiang Hu, you're favoring

515
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,840
the outsider too much.

516
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,450
You've started showing partiality to them already.

517
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,030
Uncle. Uncle.

518
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,530
Enough.

519
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,890
In my heart,

520
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,720
Teng Yue and Cloud Footwear

521
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,410
are equally important.

522
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:05,710
Good.

523
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,150
You see what having a big heart is like?

524
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,990
â™«You say the wind picks upâ™«

525
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,000
â™«I close my eyesâ™«

526
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:32,070
â™«In the airâ™«

527
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,220
â™«I smell regret and nostalgiaâ™«

528
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,960
â™«Innocent promisesâ™«

529
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,370
â™«Ups and downsâ™«

530
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,250
â™«I just wish to move onâ™«

531
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,940
â™«I know it has all endedâ™«

532
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,370
â™«Like a fulcrumâ™«

533
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,780
â™«It's making time tiltâ™«

534
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,190
â™«In flashbacksâ™«

535
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,090
Who are you?

536
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,340
â™«I see us againâ™«

537
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:06,570
â™«That adventurous summer with youâ™«

538
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,410
â™«It was not just a seasonâ™«

539
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,780
What's your name?

540
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,110
â™«The flowers in my heart bloomedâ™«

541
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,270
â™«Firm, romantic and quietâ™«

542
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,000
Little fella.

543
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:17,160
â™«They witheredâ™«

544
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,440
â™«You said in this worldâ™«

545
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,080
â™«There are cloudy days and sunny daysâ™«

546
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:24,850
Little fella.

547
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,570
â™«Your bright faceâ™«

548
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:32,520
â™«Is like a sun but it's fading awayâ™«

549
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,790
â™«Waving goodbyeâ™«

550
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,340
â™«It's not just a period of time that I say goodbye toâ™«

551
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:46,400
â™«But also my youthâ™«

552
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,790
â™«The world and Iâ™«

553
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,500
â™«Reconcile and fall in love at the momentâ™«

554
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,900
â™«Because I'm using my fingersâ™«

555
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,720
â™«To chase the wind and your smileâ™«

556
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,700
â™«When the wind reveals what I missâ™«

557
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,650
â™«When I realize this is loveâ™«

558
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,740
â™«You're already goneâ™«

559
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,960
â™«The boy who runs towards me with the windâ™«

560
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,340
â™«Just to catch upâ™«

561
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,630
â™«With meâ™«

562
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,810
â™«Why did I turn around and findâ™«

563
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:38,950
â™«Only fallen leaves are leftâ™«

564
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,410
â™«Rolling in the air aloneâ™«

565
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,390
â™«Like an unsigned letterâ™«

566
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,060
â™«Nowhere to be sent toâ™«

567
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,130
I'll ask you again.

568
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,970
â™«I have to keep writingâ™«

569
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:48,990
Go ahead.

570
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,120
â™«Slowly, affectionately, and quietlyâ™«

571
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,330
Is Teng Yue

572
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,870
â™«Writingâ™«

573
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,290
the incomparable existence in your heart?

574
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,390
â™«You said in this worldâ™«

575
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,280
Yes.

576
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:03,990
â™«There are cloudy days and sunny daysâ™«

577
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,870
If it weren't for Teng Yue,

578
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,370
â™«Your bright faceâ™«

579
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,310
â™«Is like a sun but it's fading awayâ™«

580
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,640
you wouldn't have fallen in love with me, right?

581
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:11,700
Yes.

582
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,730
â™«Waving goodbyeâ™«

583
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,260
â™«It's not just a period of time that I say goodbye toâ™«

584
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,280
If you have to choose

585
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,720
â™«But also my youthâ™«

586
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,380
between Teng Yue and me,

587
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,090
what would be your choice?

588
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:25,530
You.

589
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,690
â™«The world and Iâ™«

590
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,580
â™«Reconcile and fall in love at the momentâ™«

591
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,680
â™«Because I'm using my fingersâ™«

592
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:39,590
â™«To chase the wind and your smileâ™«

593
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,440
â™«When the wind reveals what I missâ™«

594
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,490
â™«When I realize this is loveâ™«

595
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,920
â™«You're already goneâ™«

596
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:38,560
[Rising With the Wind]

597
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:38,560
[Running against the wind. Beginning with Jiang Hu. When rising with the wind, Zhaoyang will be there for you.]
