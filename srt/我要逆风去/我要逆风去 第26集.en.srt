5
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,390
Let me introduce.

6
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,840
This is Hong Die,

7
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,520
my aunt.

8
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,539
You can call her aunt too.

9
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,190
Hello, Aunt.

10
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,770
Hello.

11
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,780
This is Jiang Hu.

12
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,830
She's my...

13
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,830
No need to introduce.

14
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,400
I know.

15
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,150
I saw it just now.

16
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,520
My girlfriend has a fever,

17
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,669
so I brought her home

18
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,759
to take care of her.

19
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,080
You have a fever?

20
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,900
You should eat more.

21
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,190
Have some of my

22
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,830
pickled vegetables.

23
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,670
You'll definitely feel much better after eating it.

24
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,130
Come on.

25
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:18,700
Eat more.

26
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,260
I queued up to buy

27
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,990
these buns.

28
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,390
They're very delicious.

29
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,140
Also, the eggs.

30
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,390
They're very nutritious.

31
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,550
Now that you're sick,

32
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,350
you should eat more.

33
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,070
You know?

34
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,230
Also, the vegetables.

35
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,260
You need to get balanced nutrition.

36
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,270
Have more vegetables.

37
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,670
Don't just eat porridge.

38
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,510
Thank you, Aunt.

39
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,940
Aunt.

40
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,430
She just has a fever.

41
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,590
You moved all the food away.

42
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,590
What should I eat?

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,560
Well.

44
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,070
There are still so many here.

45
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,600
Eat this.

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,410
Your girlfriend is sick.

47
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,240
It's a good time for you to express yourself.

48
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,390
You're only eating yourself.

49
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,360
You're not taking care of her at all.

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,240
It's okay.

51
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,170
My cold is not that serious, actually.

52
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,830
You have to take it seriously.

53
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,510
I brought a lot of ingredients here.

54
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,440
I'll make a pot of

55
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,000
Bamboo Shoot Soup with Fresh and Pickled Streaky Pork

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
for you later.

57
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,930
No need to bother.

58
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,150
I'm going back to the factory very soon.

59
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,579
Back to the factory?

60
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,390
Is that where you work?

61
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,110
Or

62
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,970
is it your own factory?

63
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,640
Yes.

64
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,110
It's my family's factory.

65
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,110
It's called Teng Yue.

66
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,590
Have you heard of it?

67
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,350
Teng Yue?

68
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,790
You held a new product launch conference online

69
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,630
the other day, right?

70
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,350
Yes.

71
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,510
No kidding.

72
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,670
I watched that livestream from beginning to end.

73
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,829
It was really creative

74
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:38,710
and full of great ideas.

75
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,840
I liked it very much.

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,150
To be honest,

77
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,510
I bought a pair of shoes myself.

78
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,550
Really?

79
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,440
Thank you so much for your support.

80
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,290
After you recover,

81
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,780
maybe you can take me

82
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,950
to your factory

83
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,829
for a visit.

84
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,570
Sure.

85
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,510
As long as you have time.

86
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,110
Anytime.

87
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,800
He hasn't told you, has he?

88
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,920
Actually, we also have a factory

89
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,910
that produces cups.

90
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,070
Xu Si's mother

91
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,480
and I are in charge of the operation.

92
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,150
We'd also really

93
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,660
like to

94
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,190
communicate more with

95
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,150
the excellent "factory second generation"

96
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,230
like you.

97
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,390
How about

98
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,910
we add each other

99
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,790
on WeChat?

100
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,589
Of course.

101
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,519
We should

102
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,110
learn more from you.

103
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,510
Okay.

104
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,610
Accept my request.

105
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,280
Added.

106
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,430
What did you just say?

107
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,310
You want to learn from me?

108
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,670
Yes.

109
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,670
If that's the case,

110
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,710
I can teach you something

111
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,350
from my practical experience throughout these years right here.

112
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,909
This guy.

113
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,930
Beware of him.

114
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,350
Didn't he tell you

115
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,610
that he's an investor?

116
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,790
He's that kind of investor

117
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,550
who specializes in

118
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,150
low-price purchase and high-price selling,

119
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,150
as well as the acquisition of

120
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,680
old enterprises in traditional industries.

121
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,110
To put it nicely,

122
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,550
he's disposing of non-performing assets.

123
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,600
But I think he's up to no good.

124
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,350
Be careful not to let him

125
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,670
sell your factory.

126
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,360
Nip it in the bud

127
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,860
so that you won't get hurt.

128
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,640
Aunt.

129
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,830
It's still early in the morning,

130
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,350
yet you've seen

131
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,660
what you should and shouldn't see,

132
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,000
and heard

133
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,180
what you should and shouldn't hear.

134
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,600
Maybe it's time for you to leave?

135
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,690
How can I cultivate my relationship with her

136
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,010
with you here?

137
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,740
Well,

138
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,920
I won't be the third wheel then.

139
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,710
It's okay.

140
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,270
How about this?

141
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,030
When you have time,

142
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,909
let Xu Si take you

143
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,040
home for dinner.

144
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,150
Xu Si's mother

145
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,909
is very good at making soups.

146
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,040
It's her specialty.

147
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:38,670
Okay.

148
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:39,760
Alright.

149
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,230
Let me see you off.

150
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,110
Okay.

151
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,110
I'm leaving then.

152
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,230
Let's text each other on WeChat.

153
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,940
Okay.

154
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,470
Bye.

155
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,470
Goodbye, Aunt.

156
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,909
Aunt.

157
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,130
Don't you feel bad

158
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,550
slandering your own nephew?

159
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,030
How is this slandering?

160
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,940
I'm just reminding you

161
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,350
to get down to business

162
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,790
and focus on your relationship.

163
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,750
Don't think about

164
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,100
useless work all day.

165
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,480
You should waste no time

166
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,570
investing a fortunetelling APP.

167
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,880
Why should I?

168
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,210
It's efficacious.

169
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,750
Look, that Orchid Cactus

170
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,870
has only been placed in your house for such a short period of time,

171
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,530
and it already got you a romantic relationship.

172
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
What does it have to do with the flower?

173
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,550
It's because your nephew is nice

174
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,350
and handsome.

175
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,150
That's also true.

176
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,380
I'm leaving.

177
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,230
Bye.

178

What are you doing?

180
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,940
Let's carry on.

181
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,390
What?

182
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,540
Carry on what we were doing just now.

183
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,659
Stop it.

184
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,510
Stop cleaning.

185
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,490
I'll ask the cleaning lady to clean it up.

186
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,500
I'm at your house.

187
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,930
I should at least pretend to love cleaning.

188
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,170
You and your aunt are really close.

189
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,980
What you see is just what it appears to be.

190
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,030
In the eyes of her and my mom,

191
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,720
I'm just an investor that

192
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,450
would do anything to succeed.

193
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,990
So

194
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,190
those who know you the best

195
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,650
are the people around you.

196
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,230
Then do you want to be

197
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,320
someone around me?

198
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:57,980
Let it be.

199
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,620
Let it be like what?

200
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,670
Like this?

201
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,870
Or like this?

202
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,360
Please enjoy.

203
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,590
Ms. Xiang.

204
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,650
Mr. Zhang has always been

205
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,909
very sincere.

206
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,720
The offer he made you

207
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,720
is based on

208
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,520
the standards

209
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,790
of Italian designers.

210
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,210
And you'll also be paid on commission.

211
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,920
What do you mean?

212
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,190
I want to thank you and Mr. Zhang for your kindness,

213
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,450
but I have no plan to resign at the moment.

214
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,440
Teng Yue is very busy right now.

215
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,950
I have to go back early.

216
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,790
Coffee is on me.

217
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,720
Be careful.

218
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,590
I didn't expect

219
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,430
Teng Yue

220
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,230
could also get popular

221
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,490
through the Internet.

222
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:46,830
Mr. Pei.

223
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,510
But we also have to work hard offline

224
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,310
to win those distributors over.

225
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,950
It's still

226
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,980
up to Jiang Hu,

227
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,110
right?

228
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,060
Is she getting better?

229
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,860
Why isn't she taking a rest here?

230
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,210
She didn't come back to the factory yesterday.

231
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,590
She called me and said

232
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,280
she was with Xu Si.

233
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,180
The two of them?

234
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,540
When did they...

235
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,910
Look.

236
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,780
Judging from your expression and reaction,

237
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,830
you also have feelings

238
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,460
for Jiang Hu?

239
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:15,950
No.

240
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,250
No.

Get your mind off it.

Let me tell you.

246
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,110
Take Xu Si as an example.

247
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,310
Even he's not that good of a match

248
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,190
for Jiang Hu.

249
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,480
Our family

250
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,130
doesn't need such genes.

251
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,590
Alright.

252
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,470
I'll leave it to you then.

253

I'll do the rounds.

254
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,990
Okay.

255
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,590
Okay.

256
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,130
Stop thinking about it.

257
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,060
Get back to work.

258
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,620
What did he mean they don't need such genes?

259
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,280
Get back to work.

260
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,150
Since Wenshan has already been born,

261
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,750
so why was Jiang Hu ever born?

262
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,490
I also didn't expect

263
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,370
Jiang Hu would be so good

264
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,640
at winning people over

265

at such a young age.

266
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,570
When Mr. Jiang was alive,

267
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,820
she wasn't like this.

268
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,410
Could her management ability

269
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,010
be inherited from her father?

270
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,590
Mr. Zhang.

271
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,590
We can't be entangled

272
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,490
with Teng Yue any longer.

273
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,130
No.

274
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,360
I still can't let it go.

275
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,810
But Jiang Hu is really hard to deal with.

276
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,270
There must be another way.

277
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,520
We must get the factory back.

278
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,630
Even if we can't,

279
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,490
we must let Teng Yue pay the price.

280
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,590
Are you sure

281
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,230
you don't need me to go with you?

282
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,110
No need.

283

Besides,

508
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,870
we need to check

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,990
There's no rush.

527
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,120
You can start later.

528
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,210
I feel uneasy if I don't start now.

529
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,270
Have some warm water.

530
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,040
It's a little bit hot.

531
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,310
Fortunately, you've got my back

532
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,770
when I was away these days.

533
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,430
[New Chinese Fashion Festival] [Project Proposal]

534
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,430
[New Chinese Fashion Festival] [Date of Exhibition: November 16]

535
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:47,750
This...

536
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,210
Why is this project proposal

537
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,170
still here?

538
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,990
I put it in.

539
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,310
If it's just an event,

540
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,170
we don't have to participate.

541
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,890
But this Chinese Fashion Festival

542
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,390
is the first large-scale joint event

543
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:01,990
of nationwide branches

544
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,760
before the opening of

545
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,720
Lidu Chinese Fashion and Culture Festival.

546
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,210
I said we're not going.

547
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,510
This is an opportunity for Teng Yue.

548
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,710
Isn't it a pity if we give it up?

549
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,680
If dad were here,

550
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,820
would he participate?

551
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,460
Of course.

552
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,580
He once said to me,

553
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,410
in the market,

554
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,660
even if you were stabbed by that person,

555
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,390
as long as your business can be developed,

556
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,250
you can still cooperate with him.

557
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,550
Gao Yi did cheat your dad before,

558
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,550
but I've done research on

559
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,950
this Chinese Fashion Festival.

560
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:31,810
It suits

561
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,190
Teng Yue's offline promotion needs

562
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,820
perfectly.

563
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,220
But Gao Yi...

564
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,570
Mr. Fang joined our livestream that day.

565
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,060
Although he joined it, he didn't place an order.

566
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,140
Do you know why?

567
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,740
He has realized

568
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,950
the scarcity of Teng Yue's new products

569
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,240
in the market.

570
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,900
But he's not 100% sure.

571
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,150
So we need to

572
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,610
give him that confidence.

573
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,730
No wonder when Zhaoyang

574
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,600
told me she met Mr. Fang,

575
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,830
she hesitated.

576
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,190
I know you can't get over

577
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,070
the fact that Gao Yi betrayed the Jiang family.

578
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,020
But this obstacle

579
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,870
is nothing compared to

580
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,310
the difficulties your father

581
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,970
had encountered in business.

582
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,360
So, can you get over it yourself?

583
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,260
You can't

584
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,010
forgive Gao Yi as well, can you?

585
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:30,890
I couldn't.

586
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,840
But now I've figured it out.

587
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,810
Given Gao Yi's ability,

588
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,230
even though Peace Loan

589
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,630
made your father fail in his investment,

590
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,620
so what?

591
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,450
Jiang Qisheng had the ability to turn it around.

592
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,230
If your father

593
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,530
hadn't had a health problem

594
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,260
and passed away all of a sudden,

595
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,380
nothing would have changed.

596
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,910
Don't underestimate your father.

597
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,700
And there's no need to take Gao Yi

598
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,700
as your father's competitor at all.

599
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,880
Promise me one thing.

600
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,470
Make the right decision

601
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,070
when you are completely

602
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,270
sober and calm.

603
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,070
This matter

604
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,690
is very important to Teng Yue.

605
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,230
Take your time.

606
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,030
Think it through and let me know.

607
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,230
Hello.

608
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,200
Do you have time?

609
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,360
Have a drink with me.

610
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,690
Yes.

611
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,450
Send me the address.

612
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,710
I'll be right there.

613
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,960
Mr. Fang.

614
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,550
Come on.

615
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,320
Have a seat.

616
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,870
Sorry to keep you waiting.

617
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,830
Sorry to

618
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,260
call you here suddenly.

619
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:34,910
Here's the thing.

620
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,910
I'm taking a flight abroad tonight.

621
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,920
I won't be back until half a month later.

622
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,440
So I can only use this time

623
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,740
to have a talk with you.

624
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,640
It's okay.

625
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,470
I also wanted

626
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,620
to see you

627
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,520
to talk about our cooperation.

628
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,630
Here's the thing.

629
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,390
I plan to open

630
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,850
a brand collection store.

631
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,170
I want to invite Teng Yue to join it.

632
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,700
I want to hear your opinion.

633
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,440
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

634
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:58,990
But

635
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,840
I have another favor to ask.

636
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:03,920
Go ahead.

637
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,310
I want a shop

638
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,640
in 4 of your

639
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,750
Xinghui Square's branches,

640
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,700
namely Beijing, Shanghai,

641
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,180
Suzhou, and Chengdu.

642
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,130
You are so well-informed.

643
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,670
I only just got

644
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,290
these four branches.

645
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,630
And you're already thinking about making use of it.

646
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,950
Learning about

647
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,710
the stores in every block,

648
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,520
every area, and every city

649
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,510
is what manufacturers should do conscientiously.

650
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,990
But I think

651
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,720
you're taking too big of a leap.

652
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,230
These four stores

653
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,670
are the most popular stores

654
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,640
in the CBDs.

655
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,270
The rent is extremely high.

656
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,310
According to my presumption,

657
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,170
only brands of Aneda's scale

658
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,880
will be able

659
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,860
to take it.

660
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,890
What I want is to take precedence.

661
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,130
The first batch of Teng Yue's offline stores

662
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,330
must be the best.

663
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,870
So you've never

664
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,820
taken Free Unicorn as your rival.

665
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,550
What you want is to compete with Aneda one-on-one.

666
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,710
Since you're Teng Yue's

667
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,020
first-class agent,

668
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,430
I can sell

669
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,070
all the shoes to you

670
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,310
at ex-factory price.

671
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,610
I won't add a penny.

672
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,110
Aneda

673
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:14,870
could never offer you

674
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,290
such profit margin.

675
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,270
Don't you want to make profit?

676
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,590
If you let Teng Yue have these 4 shops,

677
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,750
I'll be making profit.

678
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,540
Mr. Fang.

679
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,990
Mr. Fang.

680
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,690
For a moment just now,

681
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,080
I felt like

682
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,180
the one sitting across from me

683
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,180
was your father.

684
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,140
Mr. Fang.

685
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,770
For the sake

686
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,650
of your friendship with my father for over a decade,

687
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,150
can you help me this once?

688
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:18,980
All right.

689
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:22,150
I'll ask the lawyer to draft a contract.

690
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,389
Wait for me.

691
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:24,980
After I come back,

692
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,110
let's set a good date

693
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,110
and get it signed.

694
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,989
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

695
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,930
You asked me out in the middle of the night.

696
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,790
Are you trying to get back with me?

697
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,790
You finally realized

698
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,050
how good and beautiful I am,

699
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,040
but it's too late.

700
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,810
I have a boyfriend now.

701
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,880
This is immoral.

702
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,970
I asked you out to solve my problems,

703
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,730
not to make me uncomfortable.

704
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,490
So rare.

705
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,480
You're asking me

706
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,980
to solve your problems.

707
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,980
And you're even drinking.

708
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,400
That problem must be pretty serious.

709
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,190
Go ahead.

710
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,550
I'll charge you

711
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,670
the standard consultation fee of a PR company.

712
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,910
In all honesty.

713
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:29,860
Fair and square.

714
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,830
I have a friend

715
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,770
who's in love with a girl.

716
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,870
This girl

717
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,670
used to have a crush on another guy,

718
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,190
but they never dated.

719
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,200
However, this girl

720
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,550
gave my friend

721
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,290
clothes of the brand that other guy likes

722
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,700
as a gift.

723
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,930
So what do you think

724
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,060
this girl means?

725
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,020
You're talking about Jiang Hu, right?

726
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,150
The story

727
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,590
you made up

728
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,740
can't escape my sharp eyes.

729
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,910
Just do your

730
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,270
consultation service.

731
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,680
This is not the Discovery Channel.

732
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,000
I don't need you to reveal the mystery.

733
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,760
Sorry. Okay.

734
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,220
Well...

735
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,920
Jiang Hu...

736
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,660
What's her type like?

737
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,320
Not as good as me anyway.

738
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,400
You are so confident.

739
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,470
So why are you worried that

740
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,200
she still has feelings for him?

741
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,170
Everyone has a past.

742
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,780
Aren't you the same?

743
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,190
Maybe the brand

744
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,350
is just a coincidence.

745
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,860
What matters is the present.

746
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,580
Whoever is with her now

747
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,960
is the final winner.

748
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,920
That makes sense.

749
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,000
And maybe...

750
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,190
Maybe what?

751
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,210
Maybe Ms. Jiang

752
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,240
just likes that brand's clothes.

753
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,880
And she gifted everyone

754
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,850
that she friend-zoned clothes of that brand.

755
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,520
Didn't you ask those around her

756
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,450
if they've received the same gift?

757
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,410
You just want to watch the world burn, don't you?

758
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,640
Although it's a pity,

759
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,990
you've never been like this

760
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,190
back when

761
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,270
we were dating.

762
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,510
Well,

763
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,140
a villain like you will get what's coming to you.

764
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,990
I really want to

765
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,470
make a toast to Ms. Jiang.

766
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:17,990
Hello.

767
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,470
I'd like the same drink as him.

768
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,070
Thank you.

769
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,750
It's so late. Why are you still out here?

770
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,610
I'm waiting for you.

771
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,050
Waiting for me?

772
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,210
I went to see Gao Yi

773
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,060
today.

774
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,110
He said...

775
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:57,950
I've settled the deal

776
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,750
with Fang Yuan Trading Company.

777
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:00,790
Fang agreed

778
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,510
to let us rent

779
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,590
the best four Xinghui Square's shops

780
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,250
as Teng Yue's flagship shops.

781
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,370
Whatever Fang Yuan Trading Company

782
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,690
offers us,

783
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,990
we can get more

784
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:09,900
from Lidu.

785
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,590
Gao Yi told me today that

786
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,280
he has convinced Shangchun Art Project

787
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,670
to cooperate with Teng Yue

788
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,790
and open a joint shop at the Chinese Fashion and Culture Festival.

789
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,340
As long as Teng Yue's plan

790
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,310
can pass Lidu's project review,

791
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,420
I think

792
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,990
our overall sales at the Chinese Fashion Festival

793
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,100
won't be bad.

794
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,310
With Fang Yuan Trading Company,

795
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,840
we don't need Lidu anymore.

796
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,990
With Lidu,

797
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,950
we also don't need

798
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,910
to cooperate with Fang Yuan Trading Company.

799
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,470
Why are you

800
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,600
so against Fang Yuan Trading Company?

801
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,540
In terms of business,

802
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,400
the future plan of Lidu

803
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,450
is better for Teng Yue's development.

804
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,440
Besides, their positioning of Chinese fashion

805
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,330
this time

806
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,520
is also more suitable for

807
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,450
our brand image.

808
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:50,990
In terms of personal reasons,

809
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:51,830
we have been friends

810
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,930
with Gao Yi for over ten years.

811
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,920
Besides, he has always wanted to help us.

812
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,020
Xiang Zhaoyang.

813
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,840
Don't be so naive, Okay?

814
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,520
All that Gao Yi does

815
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,470
is not for you

816
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,470
or me,

817
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,080
but for himself.

818
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,710
It's to make up for his guilt.

819
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,150
What exactly happened

820
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,510
between you and Gao Yi?

821
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,890
You just need to know

822
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,730
what you see and hear

823
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,140
is not all the facts.

824
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,780
I have my own reasons.

825
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,270
Can't you

826
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,460
just seek peace

827
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,910
and let go of the past?

828
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,470
Why should I forgive him?

829
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:24,840
Why should I give him a chance

830
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,040
to forgive himself?

831
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,160
Fine.

832
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,400
Leaving aside Gao Yi

833
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,470
and Lidu,

834
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,030
you can cooperate with anyone you want,

835
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,960
except Fang Yuan Trading Company.

836
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,510
Why not?

837
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,360
If you cooperate with Fang Yuan Trading Company,

838
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,880
I'll leave Teng Yue.

839
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,480
Don't you think

840
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,150
you are

841
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,610
just being unreasonable?

842
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,950
You won't be

843
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,510
designing

844
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:57,170
-only for Fang.
-Because he doesn't deserve it.

845
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,050
He'll only defile my works.

846
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,960
You really have double standards.

847
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,400
Didn't you just ask me

848
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,630
to seek peace?

849
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:06,550
And now you're...

850
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,150
It's because he molested me!

851
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,460
Forget it.

852
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,370
Make your choice.
