5
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,630
Teng Yue hasn't launched

6
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,690
any new design yet.

7
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,750
We are still relying on

8
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,550
the old design in different shoelace colors.

9
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,620
Our distribution channels are also limited to

10
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,759
online stores, community supermarkets,

11
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,300
and group buying.

12
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,450
We aren't able to withstand

13
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,550
the pressure caused by the price rise at all.

14
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,009
We can only try to find a way

15
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,320
to control costs as much as possible

16
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,620
at the current stage.

17
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,600
Let's change the raw materials then.

18
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,120
Rubber,

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,440
lace holes, insoles,

20
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,220
and canvas.

21
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,740
I know a few factories that produce these.

22
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,340
The outcome will be the same,

23
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,370
but the cost can be reduced

24
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,750
by 5%.

25
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,230
But the old suppliers

26
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,040
are more reliable, right?

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,370
After all, we've worked with them for so many years.

28
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,900
We can try to talk them down.

29
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,820
Given the current situation,

30
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,160
who would still care about their history with us?

31
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:34,900
Mr. Pei.

32
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,160
Are you sure you can talk them down?

33
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,930
If there's no increase in quantity,

34
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,930
who would want to negotiate with us?

35
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:45,829
How about

36
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,500
you go talk to them?

37
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,350
It's okay if you don't want a new supplier.

38
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,350
But if we want to reduce the cost,

39
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,360
as the production director,

40
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,390
I can't think of any other solution.

41
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,550
Nowadays, technology is

42
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,410
changing and evolving very fast.

43
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,130
We may as well give it a try.

44
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,560
Are the qualifications of those factories

45
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,020
and the quality of their products reliable?

46
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,770
Of course.

47
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,980
Think about it.

48
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,430
How can I do harm to our own factory?

49
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,210
Okay.

50
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,860
Let's do it then.

51
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,790
Go contact them.

52
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,040
Okay.

53
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,470
Master Zhang.

54
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,350
Technology is your specialty.

55
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,079
Strictly control the quality.

56
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,470
No problem.

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,320
Do you have anything else to say, Uncle?

58
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,550
No.

59
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,970
Okay, that's all for today then.

60
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,030
Wait.

61
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,270
I have something to talk to you later.

62
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,710
We need to make a decision on the designer as soon as possible.

63
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,710
I gave you a batch of resumes before.

64
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,410
Do you like any of them?

65
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,940
They're all good,

66
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,680
but they are not suitable for Teng Yue.

67
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,360
What kind of designer

68
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,370
do you want then?

69
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,230
He should have his own

70
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,890
concept and style of design.

71
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,390
But more importantly,

72
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,270
his works should bear

73
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,770
similarities to Teng Yue's essence.

74
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,920
Besides,

75
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,490
he should know Teng Yue's history very well.

76
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,860
Do you already have someone in mind?

77
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,880
Xiang Zhaoyang.

78
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,440
She's a KOL who got viral for

79
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,640
freehand painting.

80
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,670
I've been observing her for a long time.

81
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,530
She's been doing on-site freehand painting

82
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,020
in Lidu these days.

83
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,970
What she's been drawing is Teng Yue's shoes.

84
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,430
Her style is what I want.

85
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,230
She also won the St. Laurent Design Competition

86
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,960
for her design in Aneda before.

87
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,130
That design is very interesting.

88
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,920
I know her.

89
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,590
But I heard that

90
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,030
she signed a two-year non-compete agreement

91
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,570
with Aneda

92
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,180
for taking on

93
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,730
a commercial project of Free Unicorn before.

94
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,430
Ms. Yue.

95
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,370
I finally know

96
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,430
how it feels

97
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,030
to shoot myself in the foot.

98
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,660
It's okay.

99
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,930
You can do it.

100
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,909
I didn't expect

101
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,560
Mr. Gao Yi of Lidu Department Store

102
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,590
is also good at marketing.

103
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,990
He came up with the creative idea of

104
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,070
letting the citizens draw freely on the white fencing shade cloth

105
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,090
used in the second-phase redecoration of the store,

106
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,150
and combined it with

107
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,700
Zhaoyang's 3-day on-site freehand painting livestream.

108
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,610
All the brands in the store

109
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,150
are included in the painting.

110
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,940
It's so well planned and popular.

111
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,150
How's the data?

112
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,910
There are more than

113
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,550
5,000 videos

114
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,260
under the keyword "Lidu Department Store."

115
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,290
A journalist from Morning News

116
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,420
just went there to shoot some footage.

117
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,290
Judging by the current trend

118
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,500
of data increase,

119
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,590
when she posts the video herself later,

120
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,130
she'll definitely get over a million likes.

121
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,560
You did well this time.

122
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,570
It's not easy

123
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,200
to get your compliment, Mr. Xu.

124
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,060
I'm hanging up.

125
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,900
My boss is driving for me.

126
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,550
Why do I feel like

127
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,950
I'll have to resign tomorrow?

128
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,430
I've already driven

129
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,630
over 100 kilometers.

130
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,330
Where's your resignation report?

131
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,909
I'm here

132
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,060
to do the program research

133
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,200
on new energy vehicles

134
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,230
on behalf of Joey, okay?

135
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,230
I'm very serious.

136
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,659
But what about your original job?

137
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,380
How's Teng Yue doing recently?

138
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,020
Very bad, I'm afraid.

139
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,720
The sales went back down

140
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,850
to earth overnight.

141
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,250
Ms. Jiang

142
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,610
came up with a new idea.

143
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,460
She launched

144
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,430
a new series of colored shoelaces.

145
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,500
It's said to be a transition

146
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,430
before new products are launched.

147
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,790
[Teng Yue]

148
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,740
Liu.

149
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,190
I've got you a job.

150
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,680
I went through a great amount of trouble

151
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,610
to get this order for your factory.

152
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,990
You get me.

153
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,680
Fixed price.

154
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,930
Don't you go back on your word.

155
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,460
Okay.

156
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,350
I'm hanging up.

157
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,220
This is the schedule

158
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,140
for this week.

159
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,040
Oh right, one more thing.

160
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,350
Alan from FW

161
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,790
asked me

162
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,880
about your opinions

163
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,610
on their

164
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,570
creative ideas.

165
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,680
They are waiting for your reply.

166
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,040
What matters now

167
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,680
is not

168
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,280
how we feel about their plan.

169
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,580
Has Teng Yue handed in their financial report?

170
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,300
Yes.

171
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,070
I called them,

172
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,930
and they handed it in immediately.

173
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,090
Let me tell you.

174
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,110
This time, Ms. Jiang

175
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,990
must have done

176
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,160
everything she can.

177
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,630
The payment of Free Unicorn's order

178
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:30,990
has been transferred

179
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,100
to Teng Yue's account.

180
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,120
But there's one problem.

181
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
The profit is too low.

182
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,450
I'm sure Zhang Wenshan

183
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,400
is no philanthropist.

184
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,590
I hope Jiang Hu

185
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,520
can make the best use of this money.

186
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,910
By the way,

187
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,720
what's her work schedule like

188
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,000
these days?

189
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,030
Don't get me started.

190
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,060
This is the first time

191
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,820
we've asked

192
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,940
a founder

193
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,350
to submit her itinerary.

194
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,110
When I told her about this,

195
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,880
she asked me

196
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,910
who I am to ask about her itinerary.

197
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,620
I knew

198
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,100
she would react like that.

199
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,930
But even though she questioned me,

200
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,460
she handed it in as ordered.

201
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,840
Over the past couple of days,

202
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,460
she's been doing market research.

203
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,280
From 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., 7 days a week, no days off.

204
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,550
She's been working too hard.

205
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,200
This is what starting a business should be like.

206
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,060
How can she win without fighting?

207
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,560
Bravo!

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,600
Bravo!

209
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,870
Lord Zhaoyang!

210
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,870
Bravo!

211
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,000
It's so beautiful.

212
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,210
Jiang Hu is here.

213
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,250
Why didn't she

214
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,880
come over to say hello to you?

215
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,570
You didn't, either.

216
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,350
What happened?

217
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,640
Why is it so weird

218
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,730
between you two?

219
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,180
Thank you for your hard work over the past three days.

220
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,110
I'll introduce you to some brands.

221
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,180
They're grateful that

222
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,570
you included them in the painting.

223
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,900
They want to talk to you.

224
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,360
Okay.

225
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,050
Let's go.

226
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,790
Okay.

227
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,880
Me first.

228
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,470
This way.

229
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,720
Look here.

230
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,600
Jiang Hu.

231
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,550
Are you here

232
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,430
specially to visit Free Unicorn?

233
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,430
It's all in your head.

234
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,780
I was just passing by.

235
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,370
We were friends for so many years.

236
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,570
I know you well, okay?

237
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,110
You're worried that

238
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,170
Wenshan can't run Free Unicorn well.

239
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,960
Don't worry.

240
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,470
I heard from Wenshan that

241
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,130
Free Unicorn

242
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,370
is doing very well.

243
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:28,960
By the way,

244
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,640
the new product launch show is around the corner.

245
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,900
Make sure to come and support us if you have time.

246
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,730
I'll show you

247
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,300
a brand new Free Unicorn.

248
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,140
If time permits.

249
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:41,960
Since we met,

250
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,480
let's go

251
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,680
for afternoon tea.

252
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
Alice.

253
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,680
That's inconsiderate of you.

254
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,990
Jiang Hu is a factory girl

255
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,670
who lives in the factory now.

256
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,220
How could she possibly have time

257
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,880
to have afternoon tea with us?

258
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,160
Am I right, Jiang Hu?

259
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,920
Since you know I'm busy,

260
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,420
please move aside.

261
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,190
You're in my way.

262
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,190
My shoelaces are loose again, Jiang Hu.

263
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,630
Tie them for me.

264
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,490
Show me again.

265
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,600
Do you want me to get some 502 Super Glue

266
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,330
to stick the shoes on your feet?

267
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,130
Do you like

268
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,290
wearing other people's shoes so much?

269
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,670
Coming right up.

270
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,150
It's done.

271
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,760
Here.

272
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,820
Try it.

273
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,640
It's done?

274
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,110
Well...

275
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,410
The appearance of it

276
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,620
is not very good.

277
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,490
As long as

278
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,970
it tastes good.

279
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,990
Try it.

280
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,350
How is it?

281
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,130
Not bad.

282
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,580
It's cooked.

283
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,620
Didn't you say it doesn't taste good?

284
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,380
Why do you keep eating?

285
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,430
It's called listening to others' advice.

286
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,300
Besides,

287
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,270
it's rare for you to cook fish for me.

288
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,400
Of course I should show you my support.

289
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,780
I'm your number one fan.

290
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,900
I plan to become a shareholder of Xufeng.

291
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,390
Really?

292
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,840
As long as you are willing,

293
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,070
I can hand the entire factory

294
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,050
over to you.

295
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,590
What shareholder?

296
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,640
Let's eat.

297
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,070
I'm an investor.

298
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,360
I'm only in charge of funding,

299
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,920
not the actual operation of the enterprises.

300
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:52,610
Fine.

301
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,700
I know

302
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,310
you're worried that

303
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,580
you won't be able to pay the year-end bonuses.

304
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,190
As long as the year-end bonuses are guaranteed,

305
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,010
you'll go to the hospital

306
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,550
and recuperate, right?

307
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,990
You're not buying shares.

308
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,270
It's more like charity, to some extent.

309
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,390
Mom.

310
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,150
Aunt and I are worried about you.

311
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:27,830
I don't want

312
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,870
your money.

313
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,710
My factory made it through

314
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,310
several decades like this.

315
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,390
I know

316
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,140
my own condition better than anyone.

317
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,940
You don't have to worry about me.

318
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,400
Give me some more time.

319
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,770
After I'm done with my work for this while,

320
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,120
I'll go see a doctor.

321
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,710
Right.

322
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
After this while,

323
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,320
there will be a next while.

324
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,800
I know you too well.

325
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,370
If you keep stalling,

326
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,180
even small problems will become big problems.

327
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,870
I know my condition the best.

328
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,620
Besides,

329
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,850
I'm in charge of my own business.

330
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,390
It's fine if you don't want my money.

331
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,230
I'll find you

332
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,630
a professional manager.

333
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,650
I'll send you the information

334
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,260
as soon as I find a suitable one.

335
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,990
Those professional managers.

336
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,510
Those I like

337
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,910
ask for too high of a salary.

338
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,660
Those who don't mind working in small enterprises

339
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,740
know nothing.

340
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,200
I have to teach them everything from the start.

341
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,870
Forget it.

342
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,630
So nothing works.

343
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,740
What works for you, exactly?

344
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,790
I've told you.

345
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,020
After selling the inventory,

346
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,170
I'll go see a doctor.

347
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,390
After selling the inventory, I'll go see a doctor.

348
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,190
After selling the inventory, I'll go see a doctor.

349
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,380
Let's eat.

350
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,630
Song Zhi.

351
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,650
Is Anna livestreaming tomorrow?

352
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,080
Okay.

353
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,060
I'll send you

354
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,010
the information of a few products.

355
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,380
Okay.

356
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,400
I owe you one.

357
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:05,660
Bye.

358
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,430
After selling the inventory,

359
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,829
you'll go to see a doctor.

360
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Dip it in vinegar.

361
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,090
It's delicious.

362
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,440
Zhaoyang.

363
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,620
What do you want to have?

364
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,020
Order whatever you like.

365
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,750
I've never been to this restaurant.

366
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,390
Why don't you order for me?

367
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,280
Okay.

368
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,070
Cold Pea Sprouts in Sauce.

369
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,550
Okay.

370
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,640
How about Stewed Pork Cubes and Tofu Skin in Brown Sauce?

371
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,280
Sure.

372
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,310
Get that.

373
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,190
How about

374
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,210
Steamed Sea Bass?

375
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,220
Sure.

376
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,180
Okay.

377
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,830
Gao Yi.

378
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,060
It's just the two of us.

379
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,910
You don't have to

380
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,840
order that much.

381
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,940
I'll add a dessert then.

382
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,440
Strawberry cheesecake, please.

383
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,040
Thank you.

384
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,500
How do you know

385
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,080
I like strawberry cake?

386
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,480
I heard it from Jiang Hu before.

387
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,470
When you went to learn farming in Qingpu

388
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,840
during senior high,

389
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,870
she fought with you for strawberry cake.

390
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,470
You two have

391
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,730
quite similar tastes.

392
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,630
Yes.

393
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,220
Our preferences

394
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,810
are indeed quite similar.

395
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,400
We both like strawberries,

396
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,950
we like the same songs,

397
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,620
and we both like...

398
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,630
Have some tea.

399
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,610
Thank you.

400
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,070
What do you think about

401
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,780
today's event?

402
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,990
It's my first time

403
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,520
doing such a long painting.

404
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,080
I forgot to congratulate you.

405
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,110
Your design

406
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,280
won the Silver Award at St. Laurent Design Competition.

407
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,620
You saw my design?

408
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,380
Aneda is also a brand

409
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,200
in our department store.

410
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,470
It's been KEL's OEM

411
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,430
for 30 years.

412
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,470
But their design style

413
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,020
is greatly influenced

414
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,140
by the style of European and American sneakers.

415
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,460
I think you are very good at

416
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,250
using Chinese-style design elements.

417
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,900
It doesn't really match

418
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,250
their brand style.

419
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,100
You think so too?

420
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,630
Actually,

421
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,370
I do feel sorry about

422
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,970
your resignation from Aneda.

423
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,790
But don't blame Jiang Hu for this.

424
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,550
She does have a

425
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,950
rather flamboyant personality.

426
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,030
And she does tend

427
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,470
to go out of line from time to time.

428
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,070
But she never means any harm.

429
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,820
Back then,

430
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,320
I did blame her for a while.

431
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,770
But

432
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,000
after what happened

433
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,290
to her family,

434
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,570
I also think

435
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,630
there's no need

436
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,830
to blame her anymore.

437
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,040
Things are quite difficult for her now.

438
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,910
She finally managed to rent the factory

439
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,040
from the investors,

440
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,860
but at the cost of equity swap.

441
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,290
To make it worse,

442
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,950
she's facing the risk

443
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,000
of everything being taken away from her

444
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,040
all the time.

445
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,590
So Baoxing's investors

446
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,250
put a lot of pressure on her?

447
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,030
Didn't Jiang Hu tell you?

448
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,390
Hello.

449
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,630
The Steamed Sea Bass,

450
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,400
Stewed Pork Cubes and Tofu Skin in Brown Sauce,

451
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,370
Cold Pea Sprouts in Sauce,

452
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,560
and strawberry cheesecake you ordered.

453
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,360
Please enjoy.

454
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,840
You're back.

455
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,000
You must be hungry.

456
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,510
Wash your hands and eat.

457
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,230
So many dishes.

458
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,000
I have a date today. I'm not having dinner at home.

459
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,370
What a waste.

460
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,590
Even if you won't come back to eat,

461
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,740
Zhaoyang will.

462
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,950
She's not coming back.

463
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,810
She's on a date.

464
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,040
A date?

465
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,560
With whom?

466
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,010
You know her.

467
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,540
If she doesn't want to tell,

468
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,220
no one can figure it out.

469
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:58,850
But

470
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,450
since I have many years of

471
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,440
romantic experience,

472
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,190
I can tell at a glance.

473
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,080
She must be in love.

474
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,110
Look what she's been like recently.

475
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,790
The way she's been dressing up.

476
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,680
She must like

477
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,230
that guy very much.

478
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,020
Jian, tell me.

479
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,340
What kind of man

480
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,050
can she like so much?

481
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,800
You know,

482
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,070
Zhaoyang

483
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,870
suffered a lot growing up

484
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,960
by my side.

485
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,070
I just hope

486
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,100
she can find

487
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,280
a decent man

488
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,000
and live a decent life.

489
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,030
Don't choose a wrong guy

490
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,820
like me.

491
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,040
This is called a bad investment, right?

492
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,230
So many dishes.

493
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,960
What a waste.

494
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,350
Hello?

495
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,660
What are you doing?

496
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,040
You work so hard.

497
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,340
Take care of yourself.

498
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,690
I know you must be tired.

499
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,520
So I specially

500
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,560
made late-night snacks for you.

501
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,010
I made stewed pork cubes,

502
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,260
pea sprouts, and fish.

503
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,990
Oh really?

504
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,370
You'll come very soon, right?

505
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:27,870
Okay.

506
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,890
I'll wait for you.

507
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,000
Also,

508
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,970
we can talk about your investment.

509
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,200
Bye.

510
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,990
Jian.

511
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,830
Well.

512
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,190
Is there anything else you need to do?

513
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,910
I'll leave then.

514
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,600
How about...

515
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,190
No, no, no.

516
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:52,850
I'm not kicking you out.

517
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,180
Why don't you have some?

518
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,830
No, thanks.

519
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,830
You guys eat.

520
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,130
Thank you.

521
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:58,830
You're welcome.

522

Hello?

557
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,590
Have you adapted to it, living in the factory?

558
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,180
Gao Yi.

559
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,230
You don't have

561
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,580
Next week,

562
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,390
Lidu will hold an event

563
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,790
of Sports Festival Fair.

564
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,840
I'll give you the contact information

565
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,750
of the director of our Marketing Department.

566
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,320
We reserved

567

a booth for you.

The rent is not high,

569

and we can help you

570
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,250
publicize and promote your brand.

571
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:56,850
No need.

572

Don't rush to give me an answer.

There's nothing to answer.

574

Jiang Hu, now is not the time

575
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,070
to act on impulse.

576
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,070
Judging from Teng Yue's current situation,

577
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,860
you should learn

578
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,320
more about the market environment,

579
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,240
consumer groups,

580
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,600
and sales channels.

581
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,560
This is a very good opportunity.

582
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,920

You plotted and schemed

587
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,620
to lure my dad into a scam

588
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,240
and destroyed Free Unicorn.

589
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,120
Don't you just want

590
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,530
to see the Jiang family fall off the cliff

591
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,680
and never be able to get up?

592
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,040
Now you tell me you want to help me save Teng Yue?

593
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,200
Do I look like a fool to you,

594
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,700
or do you think

595
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,100
it's cool to have multiple personalities?

596
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,260
Yes.

597
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,550
You're right.

598
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,990
I'd be more than happy

599
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,450
if someone can help me now.

to explain the reason to you again?

I'm still standing here and talking to you

610

is that I'm restraining myself.

612
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,660
you'll never show your face again

-Let me see you off.

694
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,480
Thank you, Ms. Yue.

695
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:35,890
Thank you.

696
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,530
♫Come back when the sea becomes calm again♫

697
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,990
♫Come back when the swallows crow♫

698
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,460
♫When the flowers on the riverbank bloom♫

699
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,500
♫Don't be so honest if you want to leave♫

700
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,220
♫You don't have to♫

701
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:23,270
♫Find excuses to cover it up anymore♫

702
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,990
♫You who are afraid of busy crowds♫

703
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,480
♫You who love to push yourself too hard♫

704
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,010
♫I'll find an excuse♫

705
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,400
It's still "Rising with the wind".

706
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,770
♫To wait for you to come back♫

707
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,310
♫I want to♫

708
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:44,770
♫Protect you from the wind and sand in the rainstorm♫

709
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,740
♫I want to become♫

710
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,760
♫A torch that lights your night up♫

711
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,700
♫May all the nice things in the world♫

712
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,690
Gao Yi.

713
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,910
♫Come to you♫

714
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,850
♫But only for you♫

715
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,500
♫While I♫

716
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,530
♫Can walk away♫

717
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:17,940
♫Come back when the sea becomes calm again♫

718
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,180
♫Come back when the swallows crow♫

719
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,810
♫When the flowers on the riverbank bloom♫

720
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,180
♫There's no easy way to say goodbye♫

721
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,570
♫I don't have to♫

722
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,970
♫Find excuses to let go anymore♫

723
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,430
♫You who shine in the crowd♫

724
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,800
♫You who pretend to be strong♫

725
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,560
♫I'm still behind you♫

726
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:52,700
♫Waiting for you to come back♫

727
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,820
♫Because of you♫

728
00:38:54,850 --> 00:39:00,390
♫Protect you from the wind and sand in the rainstorm♫

729
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,240
Why does it feel different all of a sudden?

730
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,330
♫I want to become♫

731
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:06,230
♫A torch that lights your night up♫

732
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,970
♫May all the nice things in the world♫

733
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,690
♫Come to you♫

734
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:17,910
♫I want to become the novelist♫

735
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,030
♫Of your love story♫

736
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,150
♫I want to♫

737
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:27,660
♫Write you a poem and a fairy tale♫

738
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,440
♫Where the land is criss-crossed♫

739
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,240
♫With green grass and flowers♫

740
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:38,250
♫The view on the mountain top is as beautiful as you♫

741
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,670
♫I don't know how to describe it♫

742
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,670
♫But it's just like you♫

743
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,440
♫Like you, while you are♫

744
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,240
♫So different and unique♫

745
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,630
Jiang Hu.

746
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,740
You're awake.

747
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,200
I prepared some new toiletries

748
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,200
for you

749
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,260
in the bathroom.

750
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,290
Sorry, Ms. Yue.

751
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,640
Sorry that you had to pick me up

752
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,060
last night.

753
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,730
You don't remember?

754
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,010
I've been under a lot of pressure lately.

755
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,600
Maybe I drank too much.

756
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,310
I blacked out.

757
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,460
Don't drink so much in the future.

758
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,600
You can exercise if you feel stressed.

759
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,100
Breakfast is ready.

760
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,100
Come down and eat.

761
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,270
A Four.

762
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,550
A Five.

763
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,190
A Ten.

764
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,110
Your turn.

765
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:27,840
Ace.

766
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,390
It's your turn. Hurry up.

767
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,550
Hurry up.

768
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,150
Do you want to follow or not?

769
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,280
Why are you playing?

770
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,340
Why are you playing cards?
