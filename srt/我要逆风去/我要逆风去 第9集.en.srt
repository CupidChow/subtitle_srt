00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,110
Today is a nice day.

178
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,710
Let's have a game first.

179
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,590
Okay.

180
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,990
Up to you, Sir.

181
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,490
Then...

182
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,130
Chess it is.

183
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,490
Are you planning

184
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:36,910
to establish an M&A fund

185
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,150
with Jingyang?

186
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,210
One plus one is greater than two.

187
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,070
We and Jingyang

188
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,910
can complement each other in many aspects.

189
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,970
I believe Aneda will understand that

190
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,240
we and Jingyang

191
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,100
are the best options for now.

192
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,410
Although it's not what I want,

193
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,190
sharing profits with others,

194
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,230
I believe in

195
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,960
your professionalism in this.

196
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,600
You're even so good at chess.

197
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,260
I have nothing to worry about.

198
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,630
Just have at it.

199
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,830
The advertisements in the atrium here

200
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,110
need to be adjusted.

201
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,590
The placement over there

202
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,050
also needs to be adjusted.

203
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,060
I'm sorry.

204
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:40,920
I'm sorry.

205
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,540
It's okay.

206
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,050
The top host of TT Media,

207
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,590
Nan,

208
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,720
stalked the new host signed by TT Media, took candid photos of her,

209
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
and paid online haters to smear her.

210
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,440
I didn't expect

211
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,930
it turns out to be

212
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
your company's internal friction.

213
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,450
I can't believe

214
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,109
you got the surveillance footage of our office.

215

[Jiang Hu]

216
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,640
Hanging up on me?

217
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,800
How ridiculous!

218
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,720
I just want to remind you that

219
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,100
the internal management of your company

220
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,130
is going out of control.

221
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,640
This shouldn't happen

222
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,800
in a top influencer marketing agency.

223
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
I will fix

224
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,450
the relationship between Nan and Zhaoyang.

225
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,290
As for Nan,

226
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,510
what's your opinion on his punishment?

227
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,370
I'll leave it to your discretion.

228
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,030
After all,

229
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,620
there's currently no host in TT Media

230
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,750
who has a better performance than Nan.

231
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,220
I thought...

232
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
You thought what?

233
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,910
I thought the rumor Nan started was true.

234
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,610
We've known each other for so many years,

235
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,410
but you still don't know me well.

236
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,130
Now I do.

237
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,710
As long as it's about work,

238
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,930
no one is human to you.

239
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,130
They're all tools.

240
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,610
As expected from you, Xu Si.

241
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,240
I'm leaving.

242
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,190
You told me off

243
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,300
this early in the morning.

244
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,430
I need to cool off.

245
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:53,930
Hello?

246
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,670
What's up?

247
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,570
I dirtied your clothes

248
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,050
at C Club last time, right?

249
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
I bought a new one to make it up to you.

250
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,250
Today?

251
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,310
I'll text you where and when.

252
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,240
See you tonight.

253
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:10,950
Hello?

254
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,670
Hello?

255
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,080
See you tonight?

256
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,550

[Bo's Ginger Chicken]

259
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,150
Have a seat.

260
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,560
What do you want to eat?

261
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,410
Take a look at the menu yourself.

262
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,060
You read it right.

263
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,510
The average cost here is 50 to 60 yuan per capita.

264
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,270
This doesn't match

265
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,570
your usual lavish lifestyle.

266
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,440
You're saving money for me?

267
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,750
This place is my choice,

268
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,880
so this meal is on me.

269
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,890
You're not trying

270
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,740
to make an issue of it

271
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,640
and mock me again, are you?

272
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,190
If I don't take the opportunity of this meal

273
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,670
to play some tricks,

274
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,550

275

So, as usual, Ginger Chicken,

281

Steamed Sea Bass with Plums,

282
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,930
and Eggplant Stew?

283
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,670
Miss, would you like to order something else?

284
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,730
Chinese Kale with Black Bean Sauce,

Okay. Okay.

You're too thin. You should eat more.

291
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,150
How about

292
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,380
some Honey Lemon Tea?

293
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,200
Hong Kong-style Milk Tea, large, double sugar.

294
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,460
Something went wrong?

295
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,470
Don't worry.

296
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,180
After drinking the milk tea, your worries will be gone.

297
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,250
Hong Kong-style Milk Tea is our specialty.

298
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,380
Do you want to try it?

299
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:10,960
No.

300
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,060
I'll have lemonade.

301
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,390
I don't rely on sugar to relieve my stress.

302
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,060
Got it.

303
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,660
It's good for your health.

304
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,720
Take your time.

305
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,800
It seems

306
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,220
you're not in a good mood.

307
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,990
Is it because of that rumor online?

308
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,660
Don't ask about things that don't concern you.

309
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,420
I won't vent my anger on you,

310
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,470
and I won't make any issue of it.

311

Why are you smiling?

312
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,770
It seems that the rumor online

313
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,550
did cause big trouble

314
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,030
to your work.

315
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,320
Why are you so sure?

316
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,220
Couldn't it be for personal matters?

317
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,880
You're neither

318
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,230
Xiang Zhaoyang's type,

319
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,430
nor the type of person

320
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,170
who'd be troubled by

321
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,500
some private scandals.

322
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,990
You know me well, Ms. Jiang.

323
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,400
After all,

324
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,950
we've had so many weird interactions, right?

325
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,910
Didn't you say

326
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,410
you have clothes for me

327
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,940
when you asked me out today?

328
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,560
Is this it?

329
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,210
Yes.

330
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:29,930
Right.

331
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,280
Here you are.

332
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,300
Gifts should be able to blind the eyes,

333
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,720
but I'm an exception.

334
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,270
Even though you gave me a gift today,

335
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,670
the "military writ" of selling 20,000 pairs of shoes a month

336
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,630
is still valid.

337
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,130
I won't go easy on you.

338
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,240
What are you talking about?

339
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,990
This is just my compensation

340
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,670
for offending you last time, okay?

341
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,990
And to say thank you, Mr. Investor,

342
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,300
for taking some time off

343
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,630
your busy schedule to have dinner with me.

344
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,460
It must have cost you dearly.

345
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,990
How do you know my size?

346
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,840
I grew up in Free Unicorn.

347
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,710
Estimating the size of clothes

348
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,040
is my professionalism.

349
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,080
I thought...

350
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,870
What?

351
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,710
Don't make random assumptions.

352
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,510
Don't doubt

353
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,760
my professionalism in this business.

354
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,680
I will definitely make Teng Yue

355
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,340
rise again.

356
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,080
All you want to talk about is Teng Yue.

357
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,680
Thank you.

358
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:36,880
Try it.

359
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,470
I don't want to talk about work today.

Thank you.

00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,230
I'm off.

363
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,420
When did you get another moped?

364
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,900
I didn't charge mine.

365
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,230
This is Qin's moped.

366
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,200
54%.

367
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,890
Give me a ride to the parking lot.

368
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,570
Where's your car?

369
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,290
At that hour,

370
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,840
do you think four wheels could be faster than subway?

371
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,070
I came by subway.

372
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,150
I'll get a taxi for you.

373
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,500
It's hard to get a taxi at this hour.

374
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,700
I don't want to wait.

375
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,040
There're shared bikes over there.

376
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,710
A competitor invested in these.

377
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,040
I didn't install the App.

378
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,690
Why are you so troublesome?

379
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,640
It's just I've never given anyone a ride on my moped before.

380
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,680
Even if you dare to come,

381
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,950
I dare not take you.

382
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,520
There's always a first time for everything.

383
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,380
I'm not afraid.

384
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,280
Let's go.

385
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,760
Get down.

386
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,210
No.

387
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,300
I'll get you a helmet.

388
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,480
You ride it pretty well.

389
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,330
I'm on racer level, okay?

390
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,390
A financial elite like you

391
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,750
asked a girl to give you a ride home on a moped.

392
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,880
Aren't you afraid you'd be laughed at?

393
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,960
Shut up.

394
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,320
When you got drunk last time,

395
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,650
you tormented me, okay?

396
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,300
You're so vengeful.

397
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,990
Ride properly.

398
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,410
I just complimented you.

399
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,350
Aren't you on racer level?

400
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,780
I did it on purpose.

401
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,010
You're pretty good at riding.

402
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,800
It won't happen next time.

403
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,850
Are you leaving without saying goodbye to me?

404
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,930
Goodbye.

405
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,830
Be careful.

406
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,990
I tried it on.

407
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,510
It fits me well.

408
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,470
Not bad.

409
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,010
Especially the cufflinks.

410
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,180
By the way,

411
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,870
did you also treat

412
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,950
your former bosses with so much care?

413
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,340
I tried it on.

414
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,810
It fits me well. Not bad.

415
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,370
Especially the cufflinks.

did you also treat

your former bosses with so much care?

419
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,030
I never had a boss before.

420
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,830
Then I'm honored to be the first boss

421
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,910
to teach you how to butter someone up.

422

Thank you

423
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,110

You're still working at this hour?

I have something to ask you, Ms. Jiang.

429
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,730
That Mr. Du,

Du Wenhua.

431
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,090
Have you tried to contact him?

432
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,610
I called him.

433
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,750
He said

434
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,670
he wouldn't sell Teng Yue's shoes anymore.

435

The Du family

436
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,230
used to be a distributor in the wood and soil business 30 years ago.

437
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,400
They were the biggest distributor

If they're this good,

448
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,790
logically speaking,

449
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,080
they should still be

450
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,240
one of the top distributors in the industry.

451
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,840
How did they end up like this?

Back then,

453
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,430
we were also one of the top brands

who's behind this, right?

But I can't.

476
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,600
Our company has asked the website

477
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,660
to delete those malicious comments.

the result is good.

Take a look when you have time.

In the next stage,

493
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,240
the focus of the company

494
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,400
will completely be tilted towards you.

495
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,500
The budget made for you

496
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,880
is also the highest in the company.

497

We'll promote you to the top level

as soon as possible.

499
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,920
So our company plans

500
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,330
to turn a blind eye to it

501
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,800
and just move on?

502
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,880
If you still can't get over it,

503
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,570
I can make it up to you

504
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,460
in another way.

505
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,800
No need.

506
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,020
Since the company has expressed

507
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,820
its attitude,

508
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,290
I know

509
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,520
what I should do.

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,170
Xiang Zhaoyang.

511
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,780
Don't do anything rash.

512
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,250
Different makeup bases require

513
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,150
different makeup removal tools.

514
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,820
If you want to hold on to your position

515
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,900
as the No.1 host of TT Media,

516

00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,710
during your livestream.

522
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:23,880
Good.

523
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,720
Keep going.

524
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:27,550
Good.

525
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,560
Be careful.

526
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,750
Be neat.

527
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,950
Pay attention to your steps.

528
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,870
One, two, three, four.

529
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,310
Good.

530
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,600
Five, six, seven, eight.

531
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,580
Qin.

532
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,990
Watch your steps.

533
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,450
Okay.

534
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,430
Good.

535
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:11,870
Good.

536
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:20,940
Good.

537
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,290
Keep going.

538
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:25,620
Great!

539
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:29,600
They are all wearing Teng Yue's shoes.

540
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,190
That old man Du

541
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,409
is really something.

542
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,889
He's good at choreography,

543
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:37,800
and he's smart.

544
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,280
Look.

545
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,500
We're all in uniform clothing.

546
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,050
Good.

547
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,370
Excuse me.

548
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,640
Make way.

549
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,250
Excuse me.

550
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,400
Watch out.

551
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,060
A truck's coming through.

552
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,520
Come on.

553
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,800
Make way.

554
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,010
Please.

555
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,620
Stand a bit aside.

556
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,250
A truck's coming through.

557
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,590
Make way please.

558
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,430
Thank you.

559
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,430
Come on.

560
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,390
All right, come here first, Madam.

561
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,350
Come here.

562
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,280
Move to the side.

563
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,510
Get ready to take

564
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,800
the things we need down.

565
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,400
It's okay.

566
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,590
Du Wenhua.

567
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,280
Why are you here again?

568
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:26,980
What?

569
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,540
This is not your backyard.

570
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,260
What? Are you kicking us out again?

571
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,260
Get off my back.

572
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,770
[Song Jiali, shoes and clothes distributor]

573
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,280
Go away.

574
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,270
I'm sorry.

575
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,150
Come on.

576
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,420
Take care.

577
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,580
Let's go over there.

578
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,890
What's this about?

579
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,240
Let's go.

580
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,010
It's okay. Let's go.

581
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,240
Let's come again tomorrow.

582
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,440
They're bullying us.

583
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,030
Exactly.

584
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,830
Du.

585
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,240
After all, their team

586
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,410
is going to attend the competition.

587
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,010
You can't compete with them.

588
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,910
Besides, they even have a truck.

589
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,860
Their speakers

590
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,400
are also much better than yours,

591
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,770
which is about to be broken.

592
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,020
You're not professional.

593
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,410
It's okay. I know what to do.

594
00:35:59,410 --> 00:35:59,920
Let's go.

595
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,690
That's all for today.

596
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,350
Let's come again tomorrow.

597
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,550
Music start.

598
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,900
That's all for today.

599
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,780
Let's go.

600
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,490
Start.

601
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,870
One, two, three, four.

602
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,120
Good.

603
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,880
Come on.

604
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,030
Left, right. Left, right.

605
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,030
Hands up.

606
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,060
Right.

607
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,360
Smile.

608
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,840
Show your energy.

609
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,660
Great.

610
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,220
Qin.

611
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,840
Something's not right with you today.

612
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,680
What's wrong?

613
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,940
Your couldn't get your tempo right.

614
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,370
Can you blame me for this?

615
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,700
It's all your fault.

616
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Why is it my fault?

617
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,900
You asked us all

618
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,520
to wear the shoes you bought.

619
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,850
A pair only costs 30 yuan.

620
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,300
How good can the quality possibly be?

621
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,560
Look at my feet.

622
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,250
They've been swollen for a week.

623
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,560
How can I possibly get the tempo right?

624
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,290
Look.

625
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,740
It still hurts.

626
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,090
Exchange my shoes for another pair.

627
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,430
As long as the shoes are not damaged,

628
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,890
you can exchange them within 7 days.

629
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,990
But it's been 14 days. You can't exchange them now.

630
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,650
Let me see what the problem is.

631
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,750
Qin.

632
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,600
Your feet are different-sized.

633
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,440
You can't blame it on the shoes.

634
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,600
This is an old brand.

635
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,600
The quality is very good.

636
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,320
For real.

637
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,700
Your feet are different-sized.

638
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,030
-How about this?
-What?

639
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,970
You just squatted and took a look,

640
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,580
and suddenly it's my problem?

641
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,500
Of course.

642
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,900
I've been selling shoes for half of my life.

643
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,870
I can tell

644
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,670
whose feet are different-sized at a glance.

645
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,530
How about this?

646
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:38,900
Give me 18 yuan.

647
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,170
Your left foot is size 37,

648
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,480
and your right foot may be size 37.5,

649
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,550
or even 38.

650
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,440
I'll give you a pair of different-sized shoes.

651
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,580
I'll only charge you for 18 yuan,

652
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,330
and your problem will be gone.

653
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,990
It won't hurt, wearing these.

654
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,790
Du.

655
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,530
My feet hurt too.

656
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,820
Could it also be my feet are different-sized?

657
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,680
It's possible.

658
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,260
Don't be nervous.

659
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,830
It's normal to have different-sized feet.

660
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,430
Basically, everyone has it.

661
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,260
You won't feel it when you walk normally every day,

662
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,120
only during strenuous exercise.

663
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,980
If you need it,

664
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,200
I'll give every one of you a new pair.

665
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,880
It's definitely comfortable to wear.

666
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,210
Then give us a discount.

667
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:11,870
Yes.

668
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:12,720
Make it cheaper.

669
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,240
We can only wear those

670
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,960
for square dances,

671
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,790
not in any other occasion.

672
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,740
These shoes are only 39 yuan per pair.

673
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,380
How much does a cup of Starbucks

674
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,980
cost our grandchildren?

675
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,790
How about this?

676
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,800
You each hand in 13 yuan,

677
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,040
and I'll give each of you a pair of different-sized shoes.

678
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,560
And 3 yuan more

679
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,480
for loafer shoelaces.

680
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,510
One pair for each.

681
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,630
You won't need to tie your shoelaces anymore.

682
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,290
How's that?

683
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,510
Great.

684
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,810
You can exchange it within a month

685
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,720
if there's any problem.

686
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,550
Okay, okay.

687
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,370
I'll take one.

688
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,890
Do you want to buy shoes, Miss?

689
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,910
So you're an insurance agent.

690
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:23,650
Listen.

691
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,990
I have social security.

692
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,850
I don't need it.

693
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,190
Besides, I don't take health supplements.

694
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:28,790
I'm even healthier

695
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,050
than you young people.

696
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,760
I don't need

697
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,090
credit cards or anything like that.

698
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,150
Stop following me.

699
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,760
Mr. Du.

700
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,890
Hello, Mr. Du.

701
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,390
I'm from Teng Yue.

702
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,120
I brought you some coffee

703
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,960
as a gift to our old distributor.

704
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,070
Santa Ines?

705
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,210
Fifty dollars per pound.

706
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,940
Teng Yue never spends this much

707
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,340
on customer rewards.

708
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,250
Mr. Du, you're our regular guest.

709
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,510
You know how good the imported goods are.

710
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:04,240
Don't let such good stuff go to waste.

711
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,080
As for you...

712
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,650
Go back.

713
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,300
After selling this batch of goods,

714
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:09,960
I will never

715
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,490
stock your products again.

716
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,210
Mr. Du.

717
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,750
Mr. Du.

718
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,980
I hope you can help us

719
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,630
to expand other distribution channels.

720
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,120
I saw you selling different-sized shoes just now.

721
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,860
I think it's a great idea.

722
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,540
No wonder my dad always said

723
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,510
you know how to sell shoes.

724
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,370
Who is your dad?

725
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,620
Jiang Qisheng.

726
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,290
Jiang Qisheng would talk about me?

727
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,280
Are you Jiang Hu?

728
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,350
You're just like your dad.

729
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,850
You can make up stories even without drafts.

730
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,640
It's true.

731
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,180
Mr. Du, don't you doubt it.

732
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,240
Let me help you with the speaker...

733
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,390
Jiang Qisheng.

734
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,650
We stopped talking to each other

735
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,670
over 10 years ago.

736
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:59,270
There's no reason for us to get back in touch now.

737
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,230
It's okay.

738
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,130
We can start over.

739
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,370
If you need anything

740
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,300
in the future,

741
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,780
you can call me anytime.

742
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,330
I will do my best to help you.

743
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,580
Do your best?

744
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:47,340
[Changle Restaurant]

745
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,140
I've asked.

746
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,630
This is the established

747
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,510
coaxial speaker called Tannoy Stirling

748
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,260
sold in Hong Kong in the 90s.

749
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,210
No one we know knows how to fix it.

750
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,030
The limos

751
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,880
of San's wedding company

752
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,230
are all occupied for Wedding Expo.

753
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,680
The exhibition will only be over in 5 days.

754
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,840
Ke's car service and retail store

755
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,380
is under close watch by the brand.

756
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,970
There are 24-hour surveillance cameras in the store.

757
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:07,830
There's no way.

758
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Does the car have to be so expensive?

759
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,050
It's just for square dances.

760
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,940
As long as it can play music, right?

761
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,120
Why does he have to make it

762
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,990
like a concert?

763
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,860
I didn't expect

764
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,510
Mr. Du would propose

765
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,280
such a ridiculous request either.

766
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,950
He asked me to repair his speaker

767
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,480
and rent a limo for him.

768
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,000
It's making my head hurt.

769
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,650
Is Mr. Du really that good?

770
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,250
He really is good at

771
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,530
selling shoes.

772
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,890
He has a lot of channels.

773
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:40,980
If I can get him,

774
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,310
I can get the investors.
