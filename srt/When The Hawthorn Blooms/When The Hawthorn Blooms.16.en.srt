00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,280
Great writer

2
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,840
Publishing an article is such a big deal

3
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,039
You didn't let out a single hint

4
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,240
Shouldn't we celebrate a little?

5
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,240
Meinuo

6
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,200
I still have to prepare my lessons

7
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:00,920
Sigh

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,719
You're really a hardworking ox

9
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,319
Hey

10
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,079
The color of your clothes

11
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,560
is really nice

12
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,599
I get it now

13
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,760
It seems

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,040
someone is already waiting to share your happiness

15
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,920
Then I won't disturb you

16
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:17,680
Newspaper

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,439
Here, it's for you

18
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,800
Hey

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,759
Comrade

20
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,360
Hello, comrade

21
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,840
Have you seen Lao San?

22
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,159
Who?

23
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,360
Sun Jianxin

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,560
From the exploration team

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,360
Oh

26
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,319
Him?

27
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,080
The doctor advised him to stay a few more days

28
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
But he insisted on leaving

29
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,560
He went back to the exploration team

30
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,319
I don't know after that

31
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,360
But he did leave a letter

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,439
He said if he saw

33
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,639
a girl in red clothes come looking for him

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,919
to give her the letter

35
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,280
Jingqiu

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,319
I'm sorry I don't have the courage

37
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,680
to say these things to you face to face.

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,840
I can only write a letter.

39
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,360
I hope you can forgive my weakness.

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,479
Sun Jianxin

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,520
Yes.

42
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,199
I originally asked him to get more tests done.

43
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,719
Looking at his condition,

44
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,199
it's not just a common cold.

45
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,759
But now,

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,479
we still don't know what illness it is.

47
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
During this period,

48
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,680
my father's health has been very bad.

49
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,759
He wants me to return to his side.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,919
So he has already found a job for me.

51
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,280
Having spent that happy time with you,

52
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,439
I have no regrets.

53
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,159
As for our one-year promise,

54
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,039
it seems I can't keep my word.

55
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,919
Romantic feelings

56
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,039
ultimately can't compare to higher callings.

57
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,560
However you want to blame me,

58
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,120
just blame me.

59
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,919
It's all my fault.

60
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,879
All the best.

61
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,599
Goodbye.

62
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,039
Jingqiu

63
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,039
Where is Lao San?

64
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,759
Lao San

65
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,240
He was transferred, didn't you know?

66
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,879
Jingqiu

67
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,080
You

68
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,040
What's wrong with you?

69
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,639
Why do you look so pale?

70
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,720
Danniang

71
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,879
Tell me

72
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,120
Did Lao San really go to the art troupe?

73
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,160
Yes

74
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,680
Then take me to see him

75
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,040
He went to the provincial art troupe

76
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,680
It's in the province, really far away

77
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,319
It takes a whole day and night by bus

78
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,639
Then I'll go to the province to see him

79
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,079
He

80
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,600
He hasn't reported in yet

81
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,279
You won't see him even if you go

82
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,519
He's still here

83
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,279
Jingqiu

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,480
I know you're very upset

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
But you shouldn't think about him anymore

86
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,000
Hey

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,480
Jingqiu

88
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,040
You're running around with a high fever

89
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,079
If you came any later

90
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,439
You would have gotten pneumonia

91
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,519
Be more careful from now on

92
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,920
Meinuo

93
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,360
I think

94
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,839
Maybe he has some serious illness

95
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,480
And is avoiding me on purpose

96
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,959
So I won't be sad

97
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,160
Jingqiu

98
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,680
Stop making excuses for him

99
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,160
You've read too many novels

100
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,680
There aren't that many terminal illnesses

101
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,120
He just got bored

102
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,519
And doesn't want to take responsibility

103
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,720
You'd better forget about him

104
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,800
The sooner the better

105
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,399
Who are you looking for?

106
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,800
I'm looking for Sun Jianxin.

107
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,079
He's my friend.

108
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,639
Please let me in.

109
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,519
Sorry.

110
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,319
You can't go in.

111
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,399
He's the commander's son.

112
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,160
Sorry.

113
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,040
I haven't heard of that.

114
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,720
Even if he is,

115
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,360
I still don't have the authority to let you in.

116
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,399
Then...

117
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,120
Can I wait here, then?

118
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,839
You must be Jingqiu.

119
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:20,759
Yes.

120
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm Sun Jianxin's father.

121
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,519
Everything Jianxin said is true.

122
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,519
I was the one who had him transferred.

123
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,879
A suitable marriage will be arranged for him later.

124
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,519
Don't come looking for Jianxin again.

125
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,879
I understand, Uncle Sun.

126
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,680
I won't come to see him again.

127
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,240
I was just worried he was sick before.

128
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,439
He kept it from me.

129
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,639
Now I know.

130
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,040
As long as he's okay, that's enough.

131
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,879
Jianxin asked me to give this to you.

132
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,519
Jianxin

133
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,759
Uncle Sun has already found the best doctor for you.

134
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,319
Don't worry.

135
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,360
Your illness can definitely be cured.

136
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,079
Jingqiu

137
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,959
Eat something.

138
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,040
Even if you feel terrible inside,

139
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,480
you still need to eat.

140
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,680
This hurdle

141
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,279
we have to get through it.

142
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,120
Jingqiu

143
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,560
If you keep being like this,

144
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,160
Mom will be even more worried.

145
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,519
Jingqiu

146
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,319
I saw Lao San.

147
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,279
How could he not be here?

148
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Still not here.

149
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,080
Let's go check over there.

150
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,120
I just saw Lao San here.

151
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,600
He must still be in the hospital.

152
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,759
It's okay, Meinuo.

153
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:46,960
Maybe

154
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,559
he's already left.

155
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,559
Jingqiu

156
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,039
It's getting late.

157
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
I'm going to class now.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,799
Jingqiu

159
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,240
Red beans grow in the south.

160
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,399
Red beans grow in the south.

161
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,600
In spring, a few branches sprout.

162
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:07,440
In spring, a few branches sprout.

163
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,679
Everyone, continue.

164
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,639
I hope you pick many.

165
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,120
These are the most sentimental things.

166
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:32,759
Be careful.

167
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,120
Are you okay, Sister Jingqiu?

168
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,240
Zhang Yi

169
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,679
Stop being so busy.

170
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,840
Why did you come back so suddenly?

171
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,759
The army sent me here on an assignment.

172
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,200
I came by to see you as well.

173
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,360
About what happened between me and Lao San,

174
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,159
Dan Niang must have told you, right?

175
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,519
Sister Jingqiu,

176
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,159
you must take care of your health.

177
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,120
I'm fine.

178
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,519
Don't worry.

179
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,919
Jingqiu,

180
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,159
the scrap paper you said you'd give me yesterday,

181
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,919
do you still have it?

182
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,120
Okay.

183
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,240
I'll go get it for you.

184
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,960
I can use it to start a fire.

185
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,320
Auntie,

186
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,320
also,

187
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,720
Sister Jingqiu,

188
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,039
Sister Jingqiu,

189
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,639
Sister Jingqiu,

190
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,559
Sister Jingqiu,

191
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,639
Let go.

192
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,440
Sister Jingqiu,

193
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,320
Lao San

194
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,080
He has leukemia.
