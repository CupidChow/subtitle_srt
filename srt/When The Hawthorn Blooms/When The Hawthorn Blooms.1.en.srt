1
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,799
This story takes place in the early spring of 1974.

2
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,280
At that time,

3
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,719
I was chosen by the school

4
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,640
to go to Xicunping to write the village history.

5
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,119
I lived and ate in the village.

6
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:54,759
It was there

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,320
because of three steamed buns

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,079
that I met Lao San.

9
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,119
At the time, I didn't know

10
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,880
that this chance encounter would completely change my life.

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,480
My stomach is almost empty from hunger.

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,799
The person delivering food hasn't arrived yet.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,359
How can anyone work like this?

14
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,280
Everyone, let's work harder.

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,400
Let's try to exceed our quota.

16
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,480
Okay.

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
22

18
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,959
23

19
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,400
24

20
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,319
25

21
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,439
Oh no.

22
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,959
I'm definitely going to be late this time.

23
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,800
Here you go.

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,639
Thank you.

25
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,879
Let me help you.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,560
No need.

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,199
Jingqiu

28
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,280
The village is trying to improve everyone's lives

29
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,719
and finally managed to make us a meal of steamed buns.

30
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,439
But three buns are missing.

31
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,240
Just look at this.

32
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,960
At first, it was because your writing was good

33
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,479
that we made an exception

34
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,680
and let you join us to write the village history.

35
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,159
Based on your family's background,

36
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,759
you wouldn't have been chosen.

37
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,319
But look at you now.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
You value your personal pen

39
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280
more than the collective's steamed buns.

40
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,520
But without a personal pen,

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
that's wrong.

42
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,879
How am I supposed to write articles?

43
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,919
You must conduct a strict self-criticism.

44
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,360
I'm sorry, Teacher Luo.

45
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,039
I hope you and the classmates can forgive me.

46
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,400
Forget it.

47
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,479
Let's share our two buns with everyone.

48
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,680
So that everyone can have some.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,039
This can't happen again.

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,319
On the way, I only met one stranger.

51
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,319
He must be the one who took the buns.

52
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:54,919
But

53
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,759
I don't even know who he is.

54
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,439
Grandma

55
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,439
Third Uncle is back from his business trip.

56
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,960
I want to go to the exploration team

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,479
and bring him back for dinner.

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,919
Exploration team?

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,000
Sigh

60
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,680
It's the geological survey team nearby.

61
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,000
What exploration team?

62
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,560
Yes,

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,920
the geological survey team.

64
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,079
Auntie

65
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,439
How about I go instead?

66
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,560
Look!

67
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,319
Hello.

68
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,000
Are you from the exploration team?

69
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,319
Uh, yes, yes.

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,480
Who are you looking for?

71
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,959
I'm looking for...

72
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,920
Lao San, who stays at Auntie's place.

73
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,240
Oh, you're looking for Lao San.

74
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,879
Lao San!

75
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,519
He's over there.

76
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:46,920
Over there.

77
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,279
Thank you.

78
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,560
You're welcome, you're welcome.

79
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,879
Once we find Lao San,

80
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,959
maybe he can help us look.

81
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,879
This person must be in the exploration team.

82
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,360
He’s the third brother.

83
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,000
Could it be that he stole the buns?

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,720
You’re the new writer, right?

85
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,639
I’m not a writer.

86
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,399
I’m just a student.

87
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,120
Do you need something from me?

88
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,040
Um...

89
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,480
Auntie is calling you home for dinner.

90
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,199
That’s all?

91
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,720
Yeah.

92
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,720
Got it.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,800
Thank you.

94
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,199
Pretending not to know me.

95
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,439
Feeling guilty.

96
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,920
Hey, where are you going?

97
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,120
Aren’t you going to eat?

98
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,800
This afternoon,

99
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,759
were you on the village path

100
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,959
and did you run into me?

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,920
You’re asking me?

102
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,759
Your memory can’t be that bad, right?

103
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,120
My pen

104
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,000
fell down the slope.

105
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,199
You helped me pick it up.

106
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
You still remember, right?

107
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,240
Of course I remember.

108
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,399
About the pen.

109
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,879
Thank you for that.

110
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,120
But...

111
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,480
Did you take my three buns?

112
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,720
I thought you were here to repay a favor.

113
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,639
Turns out you’re here to catch a thief.

114
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,319
No way.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,360
We can’t let him get away with it.

116
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,360
I said it wasn’t me.

117
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,879
Do you believe me?

118
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,600
But today,

119
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,199
I only ran into you.

120
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,639
See?

121
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,439
You’ve already decided I took it.

122
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,720
Is there any point in explaining?

123
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,240
You really know how to argue even when you’re in the wrong.

124
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,360
Even if we have to go to court, we should eat first.

125
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,199
Let’s go.

126
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,079
The food is ready.

127
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,160
Do you miss your third uncle?

128
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,519
Huanhuan

129
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,560
I do.

130
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,879
Are you craving food again?

131
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,519
Oh dear.

132
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,040
Come down, come down quickly.

133
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,839
Hello, Auntie.

134
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,759
Come here.

135
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,079
Qiu, girl.

136
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,600
Look.

137
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,360
It's so hectic at noon.

138
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,000
I only realized after you left

139
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,920
that Huanhuan

140
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,240
secretly hid three steamed buns.

141
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,800
How about

142
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,399
I go with you

143
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,920
to explain to Teacher Luo?

144
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,399
Otherwise, you'll get scolded.

145
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,680
What should we do?

146
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,199
These are for my third uncle

147
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,360
and Aunt Jing.

148
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,079
It's okay, Auntie.

149
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,439
Teacher Luo also said

150
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,439
we often trouble you in the village.

151
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,240
This is our way of thanking you.

152
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,399
Please don't be so polite.

153
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:33,800
Come, Huanhuan.

154
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,000
Yes.

155
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,759
Look at this child.

156
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,160
Sorry for the trouble.

157
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,079
Not at all, Auntie.

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,279
Come.

159
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,360
Let's eat.

160
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,560
For me?

161
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,360
Auntie asked me to bring you a bowl of water.

162
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,319
Thank you.

163
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,279
Auntie hasn't already brought you water, has she?

164
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,959
If I'd known, I would have thought of another excuse.

165
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,240
Let me formally introduce myself.

166
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,360
Sun Jianxin.

167
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,319
Just call me Lao San.

168
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,079
My name is He Jingqiu.

169
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,240
Sorry.

170
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
About what happened before—

171
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,039
I misunderstood you.

172
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,080
There's nothing to apologize for.

173
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,440
Thanks to you,

174
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,320
Auntie and Huanhuan

175
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,759
also got to eat white steamed buns.

176
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,399
I saw your classmates

177
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,519
all went to listen to the village elders

178
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
tell the story of the hawthorn tree.

179
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,000
Why didn't you go?

180
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,200
Dongmei said

181
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,440
we're going tomorrow.

182
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,080
Waiting for you to go over.

183
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
They've all left.

184
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,480
What do you want to hear?

185
00:08:58,759 --> 00:08:59,559
Let me tell you.

186
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,559
This hawthorn tree

187
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,440
really does bloom with red flowers.

188
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,320
Because

189
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,080
it's stained red by the blood of heroes.

190
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,679
That's why it's also called the Hero Tree.

191
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,000
I've stayed in Xicunping for so long.

192
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,080
Every legend

193
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
I know them all clearly.

194
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,080
Then have you seen it bloom?

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,080
In another two months,

196
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
it will bloom.

197
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,960
Two months?

198
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,120
But our field trip

199
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,960
won't last that long.

200
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,639
Don't you already know

201
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,799
that its flowers are red?

202
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,600
But I haven't seen it yet.

203
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,960
What does that matter?

204
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,879
You can still write

205
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,399
that its flowers are red.

206
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,639
That's not the same.

207
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,320
Seeing is believing.

208
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,960
If I haven't seen it,

209
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,559
I can't write it that way.

210
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,039
That's really strange.

211
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,759
Even though he's a survey team member,

212
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,320
he seems

213
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,600
to have a petty bourgeois air about him.

214
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,200
Help me hold this.

215
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,159
It's so beautiful.

216
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,600
You...

217
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,360
Do you really not remember me?
