1
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,359
I want to emphasize this again.

2
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,920
This competition

3
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,640
is between us and several top sports schools in the city.

4
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,920
It's the first table tennis league we've held together.

5
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,799
The leaders of all the schools attach great importance to it.

6
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,200
We need to show the spirit of our school.

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,640
And our determination.

8
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,319
There are no small matters on the field.

9
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,159
Whether it's technique

10
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,959
or competition attire,

11
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,719
even the smallest details

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,400
must be strictly checked.

13
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,159
From now on,

14
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,239
we need to tighten up.

15
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,159
Prepare actively for the competition.

16
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:21,959
Coach, let's begin.

17
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,480
Alright.

18
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,239
Jingqiu

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,120
About the team uniform

20
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,719
Have I emphasized this before?

21
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,159
Sorry, Teacher Luo

22
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,879
I haven't saved enough money

23
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,359
I understand you have difficulties

24
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,719
But that's not

25
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,719
Just a casual competition between classes in the school

26
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,560
The team uniform is for morale

27
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,560
And team spirit

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,760
It's something everyone should see

29
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:53,200
If you don't wear it, you ruin the team

30
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,519
Is that the right thing to do?

31
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,959
When facing difficulties

32
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,359
You should find ways to solve them

33
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,519
How about this, Teacher Luo

34
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,480
What if we do this

35
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,879
You lend me the money first

36
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll go buy a set

37
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,680
After the competition

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,599
I'll work and earn the money

39
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,520
And pay you back right away

40
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,240
Uh

41
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,599
I'll give you time to sort it out

42
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,080
But

43
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,319
During the official competition

44
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,319
You must wear the team uniform

45
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,479
Okay

46
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:22,960
Jingqiu

47
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,719
Come out for a moment

48
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,759
You're about to compete

49
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,319
You don't have a uniform, do you?

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,120
Take this first

51
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,479
Go buy a set

52
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,120
Mom

53
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,360
No need

54
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,319
Let's pay off our debt first

55
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,120
Otherwise, if we owe people

56
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,000
We'll always feel uneasy

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,960
Mom

58
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,919
What are you doing?

59
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,919
I'm going to the competition this time

60
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,879
I'm aiming to win the championship

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,159
You should be happy for me

62
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,560
Besides

63
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,639
This competition is about

64
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,360
who plays the best, isn't it?

65
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,639
It's not about who has the best-looking clothes

66
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,919
It's all just formalities

67
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,599
You really dare to say anything

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,919
Mom

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm leaving

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,039
Comrade Jingqiu

71
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,360
Greetings as I start this letter

72
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,599
After much hesitation

73
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,520
I've decided to clarify the facts to you in this letter

74
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
About the fiancée matter

75
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,280
It's truly a misunderstanding

76
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,960
Dannian is the orphan of my father's comrade

77
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,199
My father cared for her deeply

78
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,159
He treated her as his own child

79
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,840
Dannian has been sensitive and willful since childhood

80
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,240
She often talks about being a fiancée

81
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,120
But there is absolutely nothing romantic between us

82
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,360
I just take it as childish talk

83
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,319
I didn't expect that because of this

84
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,680
it would cause misunderstanding and confusion for others

85
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,080
I sincerely apologize

86
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,400
I'm sending you a jersey

87
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,960
to help you out in this urgent situation

88
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,120
I hope you'll accept it

89
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,160
Old Third

90
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,920
Reporting

91
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,199
Let's go, let's go

92
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,639
Come on, let's go

93
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,800
It's still early

94
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,000
Let's practice a bit more

95
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,199
Let's do it tomorrow

96
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:38,439
Let's go

97
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
I'll practice with you.

98
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,360
Let's go.

99
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,720
Come on.

100
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,279
Lower your center of gravity.

101
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:13,160
Come on.

102
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,399
Get moving.

103
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:17,360
Okay.

104
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,240
You can do it.

105
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,879
Keep your balance steadier.

106
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,879
Fast, accurate, and decisive.

107
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:38,879
Who is it?

108
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,759
The door's closed.

109
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,120
What's that noise?

110
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,480
That jersey fits you well.

111
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,519
I'll pay you back once I've saved enough money.

112
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,399
The game is important.

113
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,399
Let's talk about the rest later.

114
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,160
What I wrote in the letter

115
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,399
is all true.

116
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,480
Say no more.

117
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,800
Right now, I just want to

118
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,240
focus on preparing for the game.

119
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,800
Then these next few days,

120
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,079
I'll come practice with you every day.

121
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,680
Then don't be late.

122
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,680
Nice shot.

123
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,519
Team No. 8 Middle School.

124
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,839
He Jingqiu.

125
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,160
Successfully advances.

126
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,240
Teacher Luo.

127
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,079
Hey.

128
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:58,879
Why

129
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,199
don't you invite me in to sit for a while?

130
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,040
Please, please, come in.

131
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,240
After you.

132
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:04,920
Please have a seat.

133
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,120
Have some water.

134
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,199
Teacher Luo, please sit down.

135
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:17,639
Alright.

136
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,000
Mr. Luo, don't be nervous.

137
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,000
I

138
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,480
just wanted to have a casual chat with you.

139
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,439
First of all,

140
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,839
congratulations to you.

141
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,759
It seems that in this competition

142
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,759
your school, No. 8 High, is sure to win.

143
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,320
Oh, no,

144
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,159
I wouldn't dare say that.

145
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,759
You're giving us too much credit.

146
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,159
No. 2 High truly lives up to its reputation.

147
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,120
The championship definitely belongs to No. 2 High.

148
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,240
Winning or losing

149
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,320
isn't decided in a moment.

150
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,679
We should always consider the bigger picture.

151
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,879
Right now,

152
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,120
No. 2 High is at a critical point for evaluation.

153
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,080
At this time,

154
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,320
any honor

155
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,759
on the scale of evaluation

156
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,639
will carry

157
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,200
a lot of weight.

158
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,919
So you see,

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,159
I'm shamelessly

160
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,120
coming to ask for your help.

161
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,559
It seems

162
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm the one troubling you.

163
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,200
It's no trouble at all.

164
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,679
The finals are starting now.

165
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,639
No. 2 High School team,

166
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,639
Wu Danniang,

167
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,279
versus

168
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,759
No. 8 High School team,

169
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,240
He Jingqiu.

170
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,639
Jingqiu,

171
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,919
what you promised

172
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,200
you can't go back on it.

173
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,440
Look at their background.

174
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,080
You and I

175
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,279
can't afford to offend them.

176
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,799
Does my hard work really mean nothing?

177
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,320
Do I not even have the right to fight for myself?

178
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,120
Jingqiu

179
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,399
You need to see the bigger picture.

180
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,960
With your abilities,

181
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,919
can you really guarantee

182
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,360
that you'll win the championship for sure?

183
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,879
The school is facing difficulties.

184
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,519
Doing this

185
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,799
is also for the sake of unity.

186
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,799
In the future,

187
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,480
you might also stay at the school.

188
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,360
If you want to win the competition,

189
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,679
do it with your own strength.

190
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,279
Why should I lose on purpose?
