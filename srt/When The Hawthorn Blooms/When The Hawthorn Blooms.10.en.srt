1
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,880
Brother Changlin

2
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,119
Why are you here?

3
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,679
And you brought me so many things.

4
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh.

5
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,840
My mom said you could use them.

6
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,759
She really misses you.

7
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,560
Huanhuan misses you too.

8
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,479
Me too.

9
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,599
Oh.

10
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,400
I almost forgot.

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,400
Third Brother asked me to give this to you.

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,439
Brother Changlin

13
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,359
Third Brother

14
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,319
How is he?

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,040
He’s really busy.

16
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,439
The exploration team is always climbing up and down.

17
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,599
He works from dawn till dusk without any rest.

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,359
He’s gotten thinner.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,799
Jingqiu

20
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,760
I wasn’t going to say this.

21
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
Before I left,

22
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,200
Third Brother said

23
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,200
the hawthorn trees will bloom soon.

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,319
You can go back and see them.

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,760
Comrade

26
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,000
Is Third Brother here?

27
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,080
He’s over there.

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,479
Thank you.

29
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,319
If you ask me,

30
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,479
Third Brother is quite a strange person.

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,879
His family is obviously well-off,

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,240
yet he insists on coming out to this remote place.

33
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,639
And he works the hardest, too.

34
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,039
I also heard

35
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
he recently had a falling out with his family.

36
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,039
Now,

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,400
he refuses to take money from home.

38
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,080
Life suddenly became tight for him.

39
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:10,120
He even has to save up for manuscript paper and ink.

40
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,960
He really is educated,

41
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,280
he's different from the rest.

42
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,120
I'll go wake Third Brother up.

43
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,039
Hey, don't go.

44
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,240
Don't wake him.

45
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,759
Let him sleep a bit longer.

46
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:34,879
Oh,

47
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,759
you're awake.

48
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,120
Did you wash my clothes?

49
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,280
I...

50
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,879
Jingqiu washed them.

51
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,560
Jingqiu?

52
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:43,639
She was here.

53
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,879
Why didn't you wake me up?

54
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,000
She wouldn't let me.

55
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,759
She said to let you sleep a bit longer.

56
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,680
The moment I saw the flower bud,

57
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,600
it felt like I

58
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,079
could see our future.

59
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,600
Writing

60
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,959
is not just an observation of the external world

61
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,360
but also a reflection on the inner world

62
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,319
During my writing process

63
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,800
I often reflect on my own emotions

64
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,639
Jingqiu

65
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,759
You guys line up first.

66
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,000
Jingqiu

67
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,519
Why are you here?

68
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,120
Is something wrong?

69
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,600
Today

70
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,480
Isn't there a speech today?

71
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,120
A speech?

72
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,439
I don't know.

73
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,160
Maybe you remembered it wrong.

74
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,040
Your outfit

75
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,079
looks pretty nice.

76
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,800
It's obvious you prepared it specially.

77
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,800
Your school is putting on a play.

78
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,480
Why are you doing it at our school?

79
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,639
Is that not okay?

80
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,319
Sigh.

81
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,000
Jingqiu.

82
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,920
Teacher Luo.

83
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,399
What's going on here?

84
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,079
This is my mistake.

85
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,680
I forgot to inform you.

86
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,920
As for their school,

87
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,319
their theater is being renovated.

88
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,839
They're also in a hurry.

89
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,920
So,

90
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,160
they borrowed our auditorium.

91
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,519
Let them use it for now.

92
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,279
So the speech is canceled?

93
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,480
Well,

94
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,319
we

95
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:01,959
will reschedule it.

96
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:02,839
Alright.

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,600
Teacher Luo.

98
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:04,920
Yes?

99
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,399
Our school attaches great importance to this play.

100
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,639
Because we're going to participate in the provincial tour.

101
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,399
So for the next two or three months,

102
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,879
we'll be troubling you.

103
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,319
Oh,

104
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:14,759
it's no trouble.

105
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,360
Not at all.

106
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,279
The school leaders have already given instructions.

107
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,839
We'll fully cooperate.

108
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,199
Teacher Luo

109
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,959
Here at your place

110
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,000
Is it very easy to participate in the speech contest?

111
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,439
Can anyone join?

112
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,759
By doing this

113
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,120
are you happy?

114
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,399
Jingqiu

115
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,120
Jingqiu

116
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,440
Hey, you all line up first.

117
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,399
Jingqiu

118
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,480
Of course I'm happy.

119
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,679
Jingqiu

120
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:48,799
Jingqiu

121
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,000
Stop right there.

122
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,759
Don't be so stubborn.

123
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,159
You say I'm stubborn,

124
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,879
but is this fair to me?

125
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,799
You're overestimating yourself.

126
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,720
Even the school leaders have to give her some leeway.

127
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,120
What can I do about it?

128
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,879
There's not that much fairness in the world.

129
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,360
If you ask me,

130
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,399
just lower your head

131
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:08,799
and apologize.

132
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:09,960
Otherwise,

133
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
your chances of staying at the school

134
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,159
will be very slim in the future.

135
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,159
It's just staying at the school, isn't it?

136
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,000
Teacher Luo

137
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,600
I don't want it anymore.

138
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,279
Just now,

139
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,159
It shouldn't have been like that, right?

140
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:27,759
I think

141
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,960
I really think so.

142
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,039
You have to act like this.

143
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,519
No,

144
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,480
The mood wasn't right at that moment.

145
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,679
How was it not right?

146
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,879
You have to act this way.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,639
How is that possible?

148
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,399
I think you're right.

149
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,039
With him like that,

150
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,080
how can that work?

151
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,879
Dan Niang,

152
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,240
Hey.

153
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,120
Jianxin,

154
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,559
Why did you come over?

155
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,720
Today, here—

156
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,360
Isn't there a literature speech today?

157
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,559
Huh?

158
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,720
A speech?

159
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,399
I didn't know.

160
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,120
Jianxin,

161
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,840
Jianxin.

162
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:14,159
I used to think you were just willful and childish.

163
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,360
I really didn't expect you could do something so

164
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,879
malicious.

165
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,159
I...

166
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,399
I just acted on impulse.

167
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,759
It's not as serious as you say, is it?

168
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,679
You acted on impulse?

169
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,480
This so-called impulse of yours

170
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,519
can bring to other people's lives

171
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,759
what kind of harm?

172
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,799
Do you know that?

173
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,360
Just to make yourself happy,

174
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,120
you think you can trample on others' dignity at will,

175
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,240
and sacrifice their hard work?

176
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,399
Who gave you this right and sense of superiority?

177
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,240
I...

178
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,039
I didn't.

179
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,159
I don't know this kind of Dan Niang.

180
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,200
Jianxin.

181
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:50,600
Dan Niang.

182
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,559
Are we still rehearsing?

183
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,279
Everyone, shut up.

184
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,799
Let's break up, let's break up.

185
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,000
Let's go.

186
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,639
Do some physical work

187
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,000
Work up a sweat

188
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,759
Feels much better

189
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,559
Jingqiu

190
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,080
I'm sorry

191
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,639
About Dan Niang

192
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,960
In the end, it was because of me

193
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,159
I just feel it's unfair

194
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,679
What others can do with a little effort

195
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,240
I have to put in ten times as much

196
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,159
Even a hundred times

197
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,360
But with just a gust of wind

198
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,120
Everything is gone

199
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,799
But it's okay

200
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,159
In this world

201
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,360
Things were never meant to be fair

202
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,600
I'll just do what I should

203
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,200
As for the rest

204
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,919
Leave it to fate

205
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,639
About the speech

206
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,159
I'll

207
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,159
try to think of a solution

208
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,639
Then what about you staying at the school?

209
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,240
Staying at the school

210
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,799
Teacher Luo

211
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,000
is using my staying at the school

212
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,120
to constantly pressure me

213
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,080
and tie me down

214
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,600
It's like he's put a curse on me

215
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,679
I don't want to have hope anymore
