1
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,840
I'm not going to work at the factory anymore.

2
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,479
Jingqiu,

3
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,039
Big Brother,

4
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,719
I'm truly doing this for your own good.

5
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,799
You're just a young girl,

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,840
spending every day with a bunch of stinky men,

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,880
doing hard labor.

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,880
It pains me to see you like this.

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,679
Come here, come here.

10
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,359
Let me give you a hug.

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,119
Let Big Brother hug you.

12
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,119
Let go of me!

13
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:04,680
Let go of me!

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,599
Don't move.

15
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:06,200
Why are you moving?

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,760
Don't touch me!

17
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,480
Don't move.

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,079
You're just a little girl.

19
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:09,879
With your small frame,

20
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:10,680
let me take care of you.

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,159
Let go!

22
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,239
You actually like this.

23
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,319
You're a pervert!

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,359
Don't come any closer!

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,799
Don't come any closer!

26
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,159
What are you doing?

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,920
If you jump from here,

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,200
you'll break your arms and legs.

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,400
You'll have to pay for your own medicine,

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,840
by working odd jobs for months.

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,200
Be good.

32
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,159
Come down.

33
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:31,480
Be good.

34
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,840
I'm going to report you to the factory manager!

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,719
Sue me.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
How are you going to sue me?

37
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,680
Sue me.

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,560
What are you going to sue me for?

39
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Who saw it?

40
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,200
You little girl,

41
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,400
you're pretty cunning, aren't you?

42
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,760
Just to get more work,

43
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,480
you shamelessly tried to seduce me.

44
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,519
If this gets out,

45
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,719
I'd be embarrassed for you.

46
00:01:59,239 --> 00:01:59,719
Come down.

47
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,040
Come down, come down.

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,519
Don't come any closer.

49
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,120
Come down, come down.

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,319
Don't come any closer.

51
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,159
You...

52
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,919
You're out so late today.

53
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,080
There was a lot of work today.

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,759
Oh.

55
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,479
Let's go.

56
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,680
There’s no one by the river at this hour.

57
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,759
It’s the best time to swim.

58
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,319
Hey.

59
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,719
I’m not going swimming today.

60
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,639
What happened to your arm?

61
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,639
While I was working,

62
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,719
I got a little hurt.

63
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,159
It’s nothing.

64
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,879
Let me take you to the hospital to get it bandaged.

65
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,840
It’s just a scrape.

66
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,960
No need to go to the hospital.

67
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,479
I’m a bit tired today.

68
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,560
I’ll head home first.

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,719
Jingqiu.

70
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,159
Are you hiding something from me?

71
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,560
Really, I’m not.

72
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,800
It’s just that there weren’t many people today.

73
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,719
I wanted to do more work.

74
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,199
And earn a bit more money.

75
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,400
It’s my own fault for being greedy.

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,360
Not eating again,

77
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,080
and always trying to do more work.

78
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,719
Our great writer really makes people worry.

79
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
What do you know?

80
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,560
This is called experiencing life.

81
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,319
With life,

82
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,680
comes art.

83
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,479
Men are all no good.

84
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,400
No way.

85
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,800
We can't just let ourselves be bullied.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,719
We have to confront him and make things clear.

87
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,960
That lousy man.

88
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,560
Isn't he just a foreman?

89
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,479
He's just a petty underling.

90
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,120
He's unbelievably bold.

91
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,000
He bullies people in broad daylight.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,520
Let's go.

93
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,919
Let's go see the factory director.

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,680
Jingqiu.

95
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,520
Don't be afraid.

96
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,759
If the director doesn't handle it,

97
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,759
the police will.

98
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,360
I'm going to report you to the factory director.

99
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
Report me?

100
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,439
What are you going to report me for?

101
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,599
Who saw it?

102
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,319
You're just a young girl,

103
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,439
but you're pretty cunning.

104
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,240
Just to get more work,

105
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,439
you shamelessly tried to seduce me.

106
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,519
If this gets out,

107
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,800
I'd be embarrassed for you.

108
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,240
Think about it carefully.

109
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,480
If your mother hears about this,

110
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,519
won't she

111
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,480
be so angry something bad might happen to her?

112
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,720
Right?

113
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,120
Sigh.

114
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,680
You say one thing about him,

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,160
he bites back at you.

116
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,319
It's just words against words.

117
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,720
No one can win the argument.

118
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,720
But if it spreads,

119
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,240
it'll mostly be blamed on the girl.

120
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
He'll definitely

121
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,000
brag and spread rumors in front of others.

122
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,480
As nasty as possible,

123
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,680
as nasty as it can get.

124
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,519
Yesterday I heard

125
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,160
Old Wan got beaten up by someone.

126
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,720
I thought it was just a rumor.

127
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,879
But I didn't expect it to be true.

128
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,160
It should be true.

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:07,759
Yeah.

130
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,160
I heard about it too.

131
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:09,959
They say,

132
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,079
he was beaten up pretty badly.

133
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,800
Really?

134
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,560
Do you know He Jingqiu?

135
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,480
Why did you hit him?

136
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,240
He was drunk.

137
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,600
I've been annoyed with him for a while.

138
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,959
He was slandering me.

139
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Who told you to do it?

140
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,120
No one.

141
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,600
No one told me to.

142
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,879
Do you know the consequences of hitting someone?

143
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,759
I know.

144
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,959
I take full responsibility for what I did.

145
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,600
He played the victim first.

146
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,439
But what he did

147
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,759
deserved a beating.

148
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,680
He wasn't being honest.

149
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,759
I'd hit him again.

150
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,959
Do you know Jingqiu?

151
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,600
This has nothing to do with her.

152
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,920
This has nothing to do with her.

153
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,879
You are still young.

154
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,720
This could be a minor or a serious matter.

155
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,879
If it goes on your record,

156
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,079
it will have a big impact on both of them.

157
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,879
We need to understand the situation

158
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,120
so we can help you.

159
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,399
Tell us.

160
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,160
Comrade.

161
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,120
Officer.

162
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,600
Last night, Zhang Yi

163
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,920
went to the movies with me.

164
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,160
He definitely didn't get into a fight.

165
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,879
You

166
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,160
Who's in charge here?

167
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,079
Say something.

168
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,920
Over there.

169
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,240
Zhang Yi

170
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,279
You

171
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,120
Are you okay?

172
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,120
I'm fine.

173
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:32,879
Shh.

174
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,720
Jianxin

175
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,480
We've got the situation figured out.

176
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,959
Wanchangsheng made a mistake.

177
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,959
He was in the wrong first.

178
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
No serious injuries.

179
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,560
Agreed to settle.

180
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,560
You guys

181
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,920
were trying to help a friend.

182
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,680
Your intentions were good.

183
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,879
But your method was wrong.

184
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,720
Since it's your first offense,

185
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,120
I won't pursue it further.

186
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,040
Hey.

187
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,560
Remember this.

188
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,319
Don't let it happen again.

189
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,319
Okay.

190
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,360
Let's go.

191
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,959
You scared me to death.

192
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,439
Thank you.

193
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,160
How did you guys find out?

194
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,079
About the injury you got at the factory,

195
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,639
I went over there to ask around.

196
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,000
Then I heard

197
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,680
him bragging to someone over there.

198
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
That's when I figured it out.

199
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,680
A young guy told me about it.

200
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,000
When he was passing by the warehouse,

201
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,399
he heard people talking inside.

202
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,839
He even heard your name.

203
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,959
Later on,

204
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,639
only that kid Wanchangsheng came out alone.

205
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,319
I thought it was a bit strange.

206
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,480
So I...

207
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,480
Thank you all.

208
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,879
But you must never do this again.

209
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,319
You could get yourselves into trouble.

210
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,879
Got it.

211
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,439
No, Jingqiu.

212
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,000
This is nothing.

213
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,839
Back when I was hanging out on the streets,

214
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,759
things got much rougher than this.

215
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,680
Way more ruthless.

216
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,720
Ruthless, huh?

217
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,839
You, ruthless?

218
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,600
You're just bragging.

219
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,120
You still think you're some kind of thug?

220
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,879
Can you think about the consequences before you act?

221
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,480
The boss is right.

222
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll go back and oil my brain a bit.

223
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,480
So I can get my brain working.

224
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,120
Jingqiu

225
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,120
We were a bit impulsive this time.

226
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,839
But you have to promise us something too.

227
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,120
Next time something happens,

228
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,439
don’t shoulder it all by yourself.

229
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:09,959
That's right.

230
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,199
Jingqiu, sis,

231
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,319
Don’t you know what kind of person I am?

232
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,160
If anything comes up, don’t be polite with me.

233
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,160
When it comes down to it this time,

234
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,519
I still blame myself.

235
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,040
I trusted his words too easily.

236
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,720
That’s what caused all this trouble.

237
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,199
How can you blame yourself for that?

238
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,120
He clearly took advantage of your weakness.

239
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,079
He set you up.

240
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,600
That old fox.

241
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,680
If you ask me,

242
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,399
you’re a girl,

243
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,600
why insist on working in a factory?

244
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,879
Wouldn’t it be better to stay at school?

245
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,000
Look at you.

246
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,320
Easy for you to say when you’re not in my shoes.

247
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,639
My sister Jingqiu is so outstanding,

248
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,320
if she could have stayed at school, she would have done it already.

249
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,960
What do you know?

250
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,039
Jingqiu,

251
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,559
I know you’ve always wanted to stay at school.

252
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,519
Our No. 2 High School has already started the selection process.

253
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,399
You just need to fill out a form to participate.

254
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,360
Hasn’t your No. 8 High School started yet?

255
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,200
Look at my memory.

256
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,879
There’s just been too much going on lately.

257
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,879
I’ve been so busy I forgot.

258
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,159
Actually, I’ve been ready for a while.

259
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,759
Thank you, Teacher Luo.

260
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,840
But,

261
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,039
this is our school's

262
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,519
first time holding this kind of selection.

263
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,120
There are many applicants,

264
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,480
but that's just for appearances.

265
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,519
To make it lively.

266
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,679
Not everyone who applies

267
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,919
will be approved.

268
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,159
Even if you get approved,

269
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,440
the competition

270
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,960
is still very fierce.

271
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
You get to do a trial lecture.

272
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,000
But Teacher Luo said

273
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,159
the competition is intense.

274
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,279
That doesn't worry me.

275
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,200
That Teacher Luo

276
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,840
is always finding ways to use you.

277
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,159
I'm worried you'll be taken advantage of.

278
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,399
Sometimes,

279
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,720
having value to others

280
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,399
is the only way to survive.

281
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,080
I'm already used to it.

282
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,480
Maybe

283
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,279
I'll have to wait until I succeed in the trial lecture

284
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,120
and officially stay at the school

285
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,440
before I can stop being manipulated by him.

286
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,399
I've taken a crucial step in a long journey.

287
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,679
Should we celebrate?
