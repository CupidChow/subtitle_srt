1
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:44,479
Little grudge girl

2
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,479
Little grudge girl, come out here!

3
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:52,920
Where are you?

4
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,520
You run away whenever something happens, huh?

5
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:01,920
Come out here!

6
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,959
Zhang Yi, what are you doing?

7
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:08,879
Hey!

8
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:09,560
Hey!

9
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,280
Hey!

10
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,640
You—

11
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,280
You—

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,159
You pervert!

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,879
Me?

14
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,959
You—

15
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,000
Taking advantage of me!

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,159
I'm taking advantage of you?

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,359
You're dressed like a ghost in the middle of the night!

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
I'm taking advantage of you?

19
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,400
Me—

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,519
My makeup just got smudged.

21
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,480
What do you know?

22
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,599
Why are you acting so arrogant?

23
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:31,840
I came here today

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,280
to get an explanation for Sister Jingqiu.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,680
Let me tell you, little grudge girl—

26
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,280
You—

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,319
Why are all of you

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,079
taking Jingqiu's side?

29
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,760
What's so great about her anyway?

30
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,280
Hey.

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,599
Don't cry.

32
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,439
If someone sees this,

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,480
they'll think I'm bullying you.

34
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,439
Aren't you just here to accuse me?

35
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Yeah, I guess so.

36
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,799
Say whatever you want to me.

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,400
Jianxin is already mad at me anyway.

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,479
One more person doesn't make a difference.

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
I'm the bad guy.

40
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,199
I'm a jerk.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,560
Are you satisfied now?

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,319
Danniang.

43
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,680
Danniang, right?

44
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,479
Stop crying.

45
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,759
About what you did,

46
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,960
you really

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,280
went too far.

48
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,680
It wasn't right.

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,560
But if you can admit your mistake and change,

50
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,439
there's still hope.

51
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,680
Even though you have a lot of flaws,

52
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
and some are pretty serious,

53
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,120
but

54
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,680
you also have many good qualities.

55
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,360
For example,

56
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
you go to a good school.

57
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,280
No. 2 High School is so famous.

58
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,240
And also,

59
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,280
you're good at sports.

60
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,599
You're a champion.

61
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,560
And

62
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,599
you're good-looking too.

63
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,840
In a crowd,

64
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,439
you stand out right away.

65
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,000
And you have a good heart.

66
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,960
Otherwise,

67
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,360
you wouldn't be this upset.

68
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,000
Alright,

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,319
don't cry, don't cry.

70
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,719
So Jingqiu,

71
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,000
what kind of person is she, really?

72
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,479
All these years,

73
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,960
Jingqiu has been studying and working at the same time.

74
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,639
She gets bullied outside and doesn't even mention it.

75
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,919
At home, she still has to take care of Teacher Wang.

76
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,960
It's really tough for her.

77
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,360
As for me,

78
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,439
I've never met my real parents since I was little.

79
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,479
So

80
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,960
I really hope

81
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,360
to have a family like Jingqiu's,

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,039
a proper home.

83
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,680
After my dad passed away,

84
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,120
I felt like the world was too harsh to me.

85
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,439
It was just too unfair.

86
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,919
Before my dad left,

87
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,199
he took me to see Uncle Sun.

88
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,040
Uncle Sun was really very kind to me.

89
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,160
But deep down, I felt

90
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,920
that when others were good to me,

91
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,959
it was something I deserved.

92
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,560
It was what fate owed me.

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,879
Jianxin was also especially good to me.

94
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,079
Jingqiu,

95
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,240
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:42,839
Oh.

97
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,920
It wasn't the two of them who forced me.

98
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,399
I truly felt

99
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,000
that I went too far.

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,920
I was too immature.

101
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,600
So I wanted to apologize to you.

102
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,639
I believe you.

103
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:56,800
Come on.

104
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,040
Today is worth celebrating.

105
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,199
Jianxin,

106
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,600
That day, I...

107
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,839
I...

108
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,759
Thank you, Jianxin.

109
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,360
This place is really beautiful.

110
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,079
Let me tell you all,

111
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,040
there are so many fish in this lake.

112
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,240
You can scoop up four or five at a time.

113
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,639
What are you laughing at?

114
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,639
Ouch.

115
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,319
Slow down.

116
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,079
Come on, come on.

117
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,720
Let me, let me.

118
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,720
Take it easy, take it easy.

119
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,360
Ouch, Jingqiu.

120
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,160
Here, put it down.

121
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,920
I'll do it.

122
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,079
Jingqiu, let me tell you.

123
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:29,079
Why do you work like you're risking your life?

124
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,279
I'm fine.

125
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,600
It's just that

126
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,480
I missed mealtime and forgot to eat.

127
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,319
You...

128
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,399
Wait here.

129
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,279
Here.

130
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,720
Here.

131
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,600
Take it.

132
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,519
Take it.

133
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
You do such heavy work,

134
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,920
if you don't fill your stomach,

135
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,839
if something happens,

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,920
I can't take responsibility.

137
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,279
Thank you, Brother Wan.

138
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,040
It's nothing.

139
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:52,800
Oh.

140
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,399
By the way,

141
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,040
Jingqiu,

142
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,480
do you want

143
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
to earn more wages?

144
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,839
Yes, I do.

145
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,079
But I...

146
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,040
You must keep this news a secret.

147
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,399
At the factory,

148
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,680
there's an opening for a full-time worker.

149
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,600
Really?

150
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,360
Yes.

151
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,600
Then...

152
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,360
Can I apply?

153
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,600
You,

154
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,319
you work efficiently,

155
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,279
and you're hardworking.

156
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,040
Not like those temp workers

157
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,959
who all day long

158
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,920
just try to slack off.

159
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:23,839
All this,

160
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,240
I've noticed.

161
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,759
Don't worry.

162
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,120
This position

163
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,000
should be yours.

164
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,279
Thank you, Brother Wan.

165
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,000
No problem.

166
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,240
Well then,

167
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:35,720
I

168
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,240
how can I apply?

169
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,040
I'm a bit busy today.

170
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,279
Let's talk about it in detail tomorrow.

171
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,480
Hurry up and eat.

172
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,439
Eat first, then get back to work.

173
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,120
Alright.

174
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,839
Mm.

175
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,399
Hey, let me take a look.

176
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,480
Are you on the list?

177
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,480
Dongmei,

178
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,480
you're on it!

179
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,920
They say there will be more spots to stay at school this year.

180
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
But why is there still no news?

181
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,680
I heard that those who got the "Three Good Student" award in previous years

182
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,439
have a better chance of staying.

183
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,360
This year, you'll definitely make it.

184
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,639
Hey,

185
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,000
we don't really know.

186
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,279
But some people

187
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:21,879
have been running errands for Teacher Luo all the time,

188
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,040
yet they didn't even get the "Three Good Student" award.

189
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,319
Not even that.

190
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,160
Exactly.

191
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,319
I guess

192
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
staying at school

193
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,759
is probably not going to happen either.

194
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,240
You really don't need to worry.

195
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,039
I've already let it go.

196
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,320
Besides,

197
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,399
even if I did everything Mr. Luo said,

198
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,279
in the end,

199
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
I still might not be able to stay at the school.

200
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,559
So in the future,

201
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,919
do you have any plans?

202
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,519
I'll work part-time to earn money

203
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,159
while writing articles.

204
00:08:59,159 --> 00:08:59,919
I'll submit them

205
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,519
to big newspapers,

206
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,320
small newspapers,

207
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,320
major magazines,

208
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,039
and minor magazines.

209
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,679
I'll submit to all of them.

210
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,240
As long as there's a glimmer of hope,

211
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,799
I'll keep writing forever.

212
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,559
Manuscript paper

213
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,360
and ink—

214
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,120
I've got plenty of both.

215
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,759
When you become a famous writer,

216
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,120
just don't forget about me.

217
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,840
Distinguished leaders,

218
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,440
colleagues,

219
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,279
today,

220
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,080
I am honored to be here

221
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,080
to receive this honor.

222
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,399
I sincerely want to thank someone.

223
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,679
You skipped a meal again, didn't you?

224
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,720
Today's shift didn't work out.

225
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,840
I didn't have time to eat.

226
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,799
No matter what happens in the future,

227
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,879
make sure you eat first

228
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,279
before doing anything else.

229
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,279
Okay.

230
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,279
Jingqiu

231
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,360
You're here.

232
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,679
When you start working at the factory,

233
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,759
you'll be doing this job.

234
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,799
This inventory checking

235
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,519
requires attention to detail.

236
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,000
It's perfect work for a girl.

237
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,240
It's much better than doing odd jobs.

238
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,480
Not only is the pay higher,

239
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,639
there are also benefits.

240
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Thank you, Brother Wan.

241
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,240
Here.

242
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,519
Take this.

243
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,320
Get familiar with it.

244
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:07,759
Come.

245
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,279
This way.

246
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,759
Keep going, keep going.

247
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,679
Jingqiu,

248
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,919
when checking inventory,

249
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,720
you have to go item by item.

250
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,679
Make sure everything is clear.

251
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,919
You can't have one more or one less.

252
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,000
You need to keep track in your mind.

253
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,639
There are some tricks to this.

254
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,600
I'll teach you later.

255
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,639
Hey, don't move.

256
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,759
I'm just checking

257
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,919
if you've trimmed your nails.

258
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,200
Brother Wan,

259
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,759
I never let my nails grow.

260
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,399
Oh,

261
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,000
I didn't notice.

262
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,360
Your hands

263
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,600
do so much work,

264
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,840
yet they're still so soft and delicate.

265
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,879
Oh,

266
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,960
Jingqiu,

267
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,480
I'm just looking out for you.

268
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,360
Can't I even touch your hand?

269
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,519
I'm not going to work at the factory.
