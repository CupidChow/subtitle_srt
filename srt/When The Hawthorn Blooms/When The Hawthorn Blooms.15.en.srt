1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,399
This is your tuition and fees.

2
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,560
A kind uncle donated it.

3
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,960
Hurry and go pay it.

4
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,479
Thank you, Teacher Jingqiu.

5
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,679
Next month, when I come back from Xicunping,

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,359
I'll bring some local specialties for you.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,119
You're from Xicunping?

8
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes.

9
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,280
Originally,

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,719
I was supposed to go back in a couple of days.

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,679
But my family said it's raining heavily.

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,679
It's not safe.

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,600
I heard

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,480
there's an exploration team nearby

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,040
that got caught in a mudslide.

16
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,040
Many people were injured.

17
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,120
Jingqiu.

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,280
Jingqiu.

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,319
Don't stop me.

20
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:19,920
You're not allowed to go.

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,719
Jingqiu.

22
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,040
I heard on the radio

23
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,599
What did it say?

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,400
It said

25
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,680
the rain disaster in Xicunping is severe.

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,480
Many people were injured or killed.

27
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,680
The survivors

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,680
are being treated in the hospital.

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,159
Lao San

30
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,280
Jingqiu

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Are you okay?

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,680
I'm fine.

33
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,680
The doctor saw that I looked a bit tired

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,520
and suggested that I

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,479
stay in the hospital here

36
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,360
and rest for a couple of days.

37
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,000
How did you get this injury?

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
It's nothing.

39
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,039
It's just that

40
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,360
when we were moving camp

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,560
I got a minor scratch.

42
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,000
It's no big deal.

43
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,199
So careless.

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,800
But when my teammates run into trouble

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,400
I can't just

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,479
run away at the last minute, can I?

47
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,919
We still haven't

48
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,199
walked around the county town together.

49
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:15,960
Come on,

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,759
let's go take a look.

51
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:19,919
Thank you.

52
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,719
Take care.

53
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,919
Hello.

54
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,360
Can I take a look at this fabric?

55
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,360
Of course.

56
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,479
Thank you.

57
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,599
It's really pretty.

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,599
When the hawthorn tree blooms,

59
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,120
it's about this color.

60
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,199
How much is this?

61
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,879
This is thirty cents per foot.

62
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,840
How much do you want?

63
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,759
Can you measure it for her?

64
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,439
Sure.

65
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,680
Are you

66
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,319
hoping to see me in new clothes?

67
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah.

68
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,079
The hawthorn trees are blooming.

69
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,639
I'll wear my new clothes.

70
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,600
Let's go see them together.

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,360
Is that okay?

72
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,600
Sure.

73
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,800
We're almost at the station.

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,279
Jingqiu.

75
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,000
I promised your mom.

76
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,240
Now,

77
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,519
we've each broken the rules once.

78
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,720
So we're even.

79
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,399
No more next time.

80
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,879
You don't need to see me off.

81
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
Go back quickly.

82
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,399
Take care of your health.

83
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,120
It's fine.

84
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll walk you.

85
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,279
Really, you don't have to.

86
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,680
Be careful.

87
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,639
Jingqiu

88
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,920
I

89
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,240
forgot to take something.

90
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,279
Nurse Gao lives in the county town.

91
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,199
This room

92
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,079
is the one she uses when she works late or night shifts.

93
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
She rarely sleeps here.

94
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,160
The things on the bed

95
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,199
were already changed by her yesterday.

96
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,199
Everything is clean.

97
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,079
Hotels in the county town are really expensive.

98
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,480
We really have to thank her.

99
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,519
You've had a long day too.

100
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,720
Get some rest early.

101
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,120
I'll sleep on the floor.

102
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,600
Let me sleep on the floor.

103
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,480
You're the patient.

104
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,920
That won't do.

105
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,199
Why not?

106
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,800
I'm here to take care of you.

107
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,120
So I should be the one to sleep on the floor.

108
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,680
Besides,

109
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,319
if I get up at night,

110
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,920
it'll be easier to look after you.

111
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
You make me sound like I'm seventy or eighty years old.

112
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,000
If you sleep on the floor,

113
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
then I just won't sleep at all.

114
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,560
You...

115
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,639
Stay with me a little longer.

116
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,240
You've read a lot of novels, right?

117
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,120
Is it true that in every story

118
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
there's always love?

119
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:36,839
Most of them do.

120
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,240
Are the things they write about real?

121
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,399
I guess so.

122
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,439
The books say

123
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,800
when lovers kiss,

124
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,839
it's always sweet.

125
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,040
I want to try it.

126
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,439
It's bitter.

127
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,839
It smells like disinfectant.

128
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,840
Do you really have to do everything

129
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,879
that the novel describes?

130
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,799
The lovers in the novel,

131
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,919
do they all

132
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:46,240
embrace each other naked?

133
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,799
I don't really remember.

134
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
What happened next

135
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,639
wasn't written in the novel.

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,039
Do you know?

137
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,480
Yeah.

138
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,799
They were just like us,

139
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
holding each other

140
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,639
as they fell asleep.

141
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,200
When they woke up,

142
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,639
they lived a happy life.
