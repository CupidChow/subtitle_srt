1
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,119
Teacher Luo

2
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,920
The goods in the warehouse

3
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,280
must be moved today, no exceptions.

4
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,359
Otherwise, you won't be here next time.

5
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:03,960
Alright, got it.

6
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,760
Go ahead.

7
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,760
Next.

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,359
Two people, come over.

9
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,159
What's your name?

10
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,280
He Jingqiu

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,120
Jingqiu

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
You go clean up.

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,319
The men's workers' dormitory.

14
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,239
Huh?

15
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,719
Brother Wan

16
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,519
Isn't that a bit inconvenient?

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,920
You don't know the whole story.

18
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,519
Cleaning the dormitory

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,120
is easy work with good pay.

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,040
It's better than carrying heavy loads here.

21
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,439
You get exhausted and end up covered in sweat.

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,519
The key is,

23
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,680
you don't even make much money.

24
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,680
It's just today

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,319
that the person in charge of cleaning didn't show up.

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,680
If he had come,

27
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,319
this job

28
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,280
you wouldn't even have a chance to get it.

29
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,040
Oh,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,319
I'm just thinking you're a young girl,

31
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,239
it's not easy for you.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,040
Thank you, Brother Wan.

33
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,079
Go ahead.

34
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,159
Next.

35
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,439
As teachers,

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,480
we have to be responsible for our students.

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,239
This is a matter of professional ethics.

38
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,840
Give up.

39
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,159
I won't tell you

40
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,319
where Jingqiu lives.

41
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,759
Teacher Luo

42
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,199
The flash

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,479
what's going on with it?

44
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,560
Is anyone there?

45
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,719
Isn't this the men's dormitory?

46
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,919
You're a woman,

47
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,240
what are you doing here?

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,759
I'm a temporary cleaner sent here.

49
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:29,719
Hey.

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,280
Our dorm needs cleaning too.

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,759
Hey.

52
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,159
Everything should be done in order of arrival.

53
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,039
Our room needs cleaning too.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,560
I'm only responsible for the common areas.

55
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,120
This is a common area.

56
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,919
Go ahead and clean it.

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Who are you?

58
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,159
You have nothing better to do, huh?

59
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,840
Bullying a young girl.

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,199
And you too.

61
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,520
A bunch of jerks.

62
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,840
Thank you.

63
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,240
Sister Jingqiu.

64
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,439
It really is you.

65
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,719
It's me.

66
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,840
Zhang Yi.

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,839
Zhang Yi.

68
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,480
It's me.

69
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,720
No fighting.

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,000
Why did you fight with them?

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,480
They called me a wild child.

72
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,399
Let's go.

73
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,639
Go home with Teacher Wang.

74
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,120
You eat.

75
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,279
I'm full.

76
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,160
Hey, the food is here.

77
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,439
Eat more so you'll have energy.

78
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,000
Zhang Yi.

79
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:49,800
Mm.

80
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,720
If next time

81
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,120
someone calls you a wild child again,

82
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,639
just tell them

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,920
Teacher Wang is your relative.

84
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,839
Eat up.

85
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,959
If it weren't for you and Teacher Wang,

86
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,240
I really don't know

87
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,480
what kind of person I would have become.

88
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
So after you graduated from elementary school,

89
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,920
you didn't go to school anymore?

90
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm just not cut out for studying.

91
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,839
Later on,

92
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,360
I followed a few older guys

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,720
and started working in a factory.

94
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,279
In my free time, I wandered the streets

95
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,360
and got into fights everywhere.

96
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,079
Gradually, in this area,

97
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,399
I made a bit of a name for myself.

98
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,600
That's why the people in the dorm are afraid of me.

99
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,720
But don't worry, Sister Jingqiu,

100
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,720
as long as I'm around,

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,720
no one will dare bully you or Teacher Wang.

102
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,839
Jingqiu,

103
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,519
why are you here?

104
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,160
If I weren't here,

105
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,639
how would I know how fake you are?

106
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,959
You look so pure and innocent on the outside,

107
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,279
but behind the scenes, you're flirting with someone else.

108
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,759
Watch your mouth.

109
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,519
Zhang Yi,

110
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,040
are you being fair to Brother Jianxin?

111
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,279
Danniang,

112
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,279
it's not what you think.

113
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,480
You know,

114
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,240
don't blame me for telling you the truth.

115
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,680
You look just like a resentful woman.

116
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,319
Did someone just dump you?

117
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,600
Is that why you came here to vent?

118
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,439
Who are you calling a resentful woman, you thug?

119
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:01,800
Oh wow,

120
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,439
you're getting worked up.

121
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,000
Take a look in the mirror,

122
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,759
then you'll know who the real resentful woman is.

123
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,680
Say that again if you dare.

124
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,040
Do you not understand Chinese?

125
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,199
Zhang Yi

126
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,040
Let's go.

127
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,399
You don't have to pretend to be a good person here.

128
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,519
This isn't over.

129
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,680
Stop.

130
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,279
Is this letter for you?

131
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,759
Our writing of the village history was very successful this time.

132
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,879
The principal is very satisfied.

133
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,160
Look.

134
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,759
When the leadership is happy,

135
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,680
they gave me a can of tea.

136
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,480
So,

137
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,399
I think

138
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,439
we should continue this initiative.

139
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,120
Create a certain atmosphere.

140
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:05,920
A kind of

141
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,279
literary atmosphere.

142
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,959
Ah.

143
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,920
Taking credit for everyone's hard work.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,680
Jingqiu

145
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,879
You're really familiar with this.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,800
As for me,

147
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,120
I organized

148
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,560
a literary speech event.

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,199
Students who are interested

150
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,920
are invited to share their writing experiences.

151
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,279
You're included too.

152
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,800
You want me to give a speech?

153
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,639
But I don't know how to talk about writing experience.

154
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,439
Don't underestimate yourself.

155
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,519
Your writing is actually quite good.

156
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,759
The teachers think highly of you.

157
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,680
The school leaders will all attend then.

158
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,120
Seize this chance to stand out.

159
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,399
For you to stay at the school,

160
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,600
this will be very helpful.

161
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,000
Third Brother

162
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,959
Since we went to Xicunping for fieldwork,

163
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,319
it's already been a few months.

164
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,519
Have the hawthorn trees bloomed yet?

165
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,040
Don't be upset.

166
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,480
That Sun Jianxin just can't recognize talent.

167
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,160
Hey, don't talk about Jianxin like that.

168
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:22,959
Let's go.

169
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,560
Let's play ball.

170
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:23,920
Yeah.

171
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,800
Nice shot!

172
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,759
You guys...

173
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,240
Better hurry up and make me your teacher.

174
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,040
If you want to play well,

175
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,120
you need proper guidance.

176
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,039
Back in the day, my teacher

177
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,159
competed with top players from several schools.

178
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
It was simply

179
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,600
defeating strong opponents

180
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,519
and bravely winning

181
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,440
the championship,

182
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,320
and runner-up titles.

183
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
But in terms of skill,

184
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,399
on this court,

185
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,759
he was definitely one of the best.

186
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,519
Do you know who your teacher lost to?

187
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,840
Wasn't it that little grumbler?

188
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,840
You, you, you...

189
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,039
With your half-baked skills,

190
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,200
where do you get your confidence?

191
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,240
I was already being nice to you last time.

192
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,360
Don't ask for trouble.

193
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Let's have a match.

194
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,159
Amateur.

195
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,600
Nice shot!

196
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,440
Stop shouting.

197
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,759
Take it.

198
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,840
Again.

199
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,720
Brother Zhang

200
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,600
How was it?

201
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,919
It's just winning a game.

202
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,480
What's so great about that?

203
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,799
You don't act like a woman at all.

204
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,559
Hey

205
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,200
You didn't play that well.

206
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,000
But your stubbornness is just like your teacher's.

207
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,879
You're nowhere near as good as my teacher.

208
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,039
She not only plays basketball,

209
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,080
she's also a top student.

210
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,559
She even participates in school speeches.

211
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
What do you have to compare with her?

212
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,559
Exactly, exactly.

213
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,600
School speeches.

214
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,559
You're out of things to say, aren't you?
