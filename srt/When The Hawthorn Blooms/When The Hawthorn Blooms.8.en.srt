1
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,640
Brother Jianxin

2
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,480
Have some water.

3
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,599
Thank you.

4
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,640
Now,

5
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,239
No. 2 Middle School is at a

6
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,840
critical point for evaluation.

7
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,599
It seems

8
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,599
I’ll have to trouble you.

9
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,599
Thank you, teacher.

10
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,039
Jingqiu.

11
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,840
Brother Jianxin.

12
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,159
I thought

13
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,919
you came just to watch my match.

14
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,840
I didn't expect

15
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,639
you two also know each other.

16
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,680
Yes.

17
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,599
We know each other.

18
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,240
Then let's get to know each other too.

19
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,240
Hello.

20
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,240
My name is Danniang.

21
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,879
I'm Brother Jianxin's fiancée.

22
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,120
Danniang.

23
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,199
You're being mischievous again.

24
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,680
Hello.

25
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,479
Brother Jianxin is shy.

26
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,520
He never lets me mention it in front of others.

27
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,800
But

28
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,840
I think I've seen you at Xicunping.

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,439
I didn't expect

30
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,680
you two also know each other.

31
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,039
What a coincidence.

32
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,199
Congratulations on winning the match.

33
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,400
I have something else to do.

34
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,759
Wait a moment.

35
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,280
That last shot was a pity.

36
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,280
I guess you're not convinced either.

37
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,879
Let's have another match in private.

38
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,000
I'll make you lose fair and square.

39
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,039
No need.

40
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,680
A bet is a bet.

41
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,079
Alright.

42
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,360
About your own abilities

43
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,800
It's right not to have any illusions.

44
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,240
So I advise you

45
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,079
not to have any illusions about Jianxin either.

46
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,279
Danniang,

47
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,720
I don't need this anymore.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll give it to you.

49
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:29,920
This way,

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,720
it will also remind you

51
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,000
how you lost to me.

52
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,720
Danniang, that's enough.

53
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,079
Thank you.

54
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,600
Even though I didn't win the championship,

55
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,199
as long as Mom can wear new shoes,

56
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,879
it's okay if I have to suffer a little.

57
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,839
Teacher Luo talked to me.

58
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,199
She said you've been getting close to a young man.

59
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,680
Did he give you this again?

60
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,319
No.

61
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,839
Stay away from him from now on.

62
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,439
Mom,

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,839
please believe me.

64
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:19,519
Third child,

65
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,879
he's not a bad person.

66
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,439
And our relationship...

67
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,879
What kind of relationship do you two have?

68
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Walnuts,

69
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:29,879
rock sugar,

70
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,279
and a jersey.

71
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,600
Ever since you came back from Xicunping,

72
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,120
you've been absent-minded.

73
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,639
It's not like I haven't noticed.

74
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,040
I know you're sensible.

75
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,240
That's why I haven't said much.

76
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,480
But how long do you plan to keep this from me?

77
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,680
You need to see things clearly.

78
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,240
What's our family's situation?

79
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,680
And what's going on with the third brother's family?

80
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,000
Can we even compare ourselves to them?

81
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,639
It's like heaven and earth.

82
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,560
Mom,

83
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,000
I've listened to you about everything since I was little.

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,279
You told me to always be cautious.

85
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,600
Even when I was bullied outside,

86
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
I always felt like it was my own fault.

87
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,160
I endured it.

88
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,480
I gave in.

89
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,639
In everything,

90
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,360
I tried my best to do well.

91
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,600
Just so all of you would be satisfied.

92
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,279
Does that mean I don't deserve

93
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,399
my own thoughts

94
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,800
or my own feelings?

95
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,879
Am I supposed to spend my whole life

96
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,240
living so cautiously, with my tail between my legs?

97
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,040
Where did Dad go?

98
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,079
Director,

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,879
the child's father has already been taken away.

100
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,800
At a time like this, the school

101
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,079
shouldn't make things worse, right?

102
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,439
Teacher Wang,

103
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,879
please try to understand.

104
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,240
Because of your husband's background,

105
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,199
we really can't

106
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,920
let you continue teaching.

107
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,519
Later,

108
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,120
your dad was released.

109
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,279
But he was already broken.

110
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,720
And then?

111
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,199
The school had me do odd jobs.

112
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,040
I wasn't afraid of hard work.

113
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,480
But the money I earned

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,680
wasn't enough to buy medicine for your father.

115
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,879
In the end, your father didn't make it through the year.

116
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,720
He passed away.

117
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,639
I admit,

118
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,680
I've always been a bit cautious.

119
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,240
But life forced me to be this way.

120
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,040
Mom,

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,920
don't worry.

122
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,519
About the third child,

123
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,879
I know what I'm doing.

124
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,680
You ignore Danniang,

125
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,160
and go after other girls.

126
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,879
How do you expect me to save face?

127
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,680
I wanted you to join the army,

128
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,040
but you refused no matter what.

129
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,600
The province invited you warmly

130
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,680
to join the provincial art troupe,

131
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,000
but you still refused.

132
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,680
Have you ever considered my feelings?

133
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,560
Uncle Sun, please don't be angry.

134
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,439
About Danniang,

135
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,439
your Uncle Wu entrusted her to me.

136
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,160
You must listen to me.

137
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,680
Return to the city immediately.

138
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,600
Join the art troupe.

139
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,600
Find time to marry Danniang.

140
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,799
Stop right there!

141
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,200
You brat!

142
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,039
Dad,

143
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,320
Danniang,

144
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,039
the one I like is Jingqiu.

145
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,039
Danniang,

146
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,679
I will always

147
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,799
see you as my own sister.

148
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,039
Who are you looking for?

149
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,840
What exploration team?

150
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,120
He quit.

151
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,360
Stop.

152
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,080
If you dare to leave today,

153
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,480
then don't come back to this house.

154
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,440
Take care.
