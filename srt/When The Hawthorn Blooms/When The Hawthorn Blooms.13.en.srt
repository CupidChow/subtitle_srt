1
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,359
Jingqiu

2
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,520
Come down, Jingqiu.

3
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,560
The temperature is really comfortable.

4
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,439
What time is it?

5
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,280
We've been lying here for a long time.

6
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,040
I don't know what's been going on lately.

7
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,359
I get sleepy for no reason.

8
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,439
It's rare to have moments like this.

9
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,040
And we just sleep through them.

10
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,879
It's okay.

11
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,039
This is nice too.

12
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,919
I wish it could always be like this.

13
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,479
Wait a moment.

14
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,080
This...

15
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,159
This is your home?

16
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,439
This is Jianxin's home.

17
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,120
But...

18
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,599
Given our relationship,

19
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,280
it's basically my home too.

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,680
What is your relationship?

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,919
Hey...

22
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,879
I just think,

23
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,719
meeting the parents this soon

24
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,080
is a bit rushed, isn't it?

25
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,479
Maybe we should wait a bit longer.

26
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,479
Oh, come on.

27
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,360
I'm just inviting you for a simple meal.

28
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,800
It's not like I'm asking you to propose.

29
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,199
What's wrong?

30
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,120
Are you scared?

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,039
I...

32
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,360
Let's go.

33
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:12,840
Come on.

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,120
Zhang Yi.

35
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,360
This is Uncle Sun.

36
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,280
Hello, Uncle Sun.

37
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,039
This is the person I often mentioned to you,

38
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,879
Zhang Yi.

39
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,439
I know your factory.

40
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,280
You've sent quite a few soldiers over.

41
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,199
I remember when you were young,

42
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,520
you even visited their factory.

43
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,000
That time,

44
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,240
the local team and the military

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,800
had a basketball friendship match.

46
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,599
Both sides competed and learned from each other.

47
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,120
Hey.

48
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,199
Don't you have sports meets now too?

49
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,159
You won a championship last year.

50
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,479
What competition was it again?

51
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,159
Mine was

52
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,599
arm wrestling champion.

53
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,919
When I first joined the army,

54
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,879
I really liked this.

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,240
Always looking for a challenge.

56
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,599
How about we give it a try?

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
No, no, no.

58
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,840
I just played around with a few guys in the workshop.

59
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,919
That wasn't an official factory competition.

60
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,599
You ran right into trouble.

61
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,840
When Uncle Sun was young,

62
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,439
he loved challenging people to arm wrestling.

63
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,879
Don't overestimate yourself.

64
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,319
I'm still in my prime.

65
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,680
Let's try.

66
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,240
Alright, let's try.

67
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,360
Come on.

68
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,720
I told you, you can't beat me.

69
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,639
Uncle Sun, is your hand okay?

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,519
Why didn't you go easy?

71
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,199
Was I too rough just now?

72
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,759
You're pretty strong.

73
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,439
Looks like you've been working hard.

74
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,480
That's right.

75
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,360
Did you get recognized as an outstanding worker last year?

76
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,279
I've been up for that for years.

77
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,360
But I never get picked.

78
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,920
To be honest with you,

79
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,720
I used to slack off a bit.

80
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,680
But I'll definitely work hard from now on.

81
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:09,839
Tell me,

82
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,399
how do you plan to take care of Dan-niang in the future?

83
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,240
Uncle Sun

84
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,879
My master says I'm quick-witted.

85
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,000
I have talent.

86
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,279
When I was learning to be a machinist,

87
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,720
I reached the intermediate level in just one year.

88
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,600
I believe that as long as I work hard,

89
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,360
I'll have a good life.

90
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,800
But the factory's situation isn't great right now.

91
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,600
As for my future plans...

92
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,079
Young man,

93
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,199
let me give you some advice.

94
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,279
Join the army.

95
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,839
What do you think?

96
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,399
Join the army.

97
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,800
You don't have to answer right now.

98
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,439
Take your time to think it over.

99
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,680
Uncle Sun

100
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,079
It's time to eat.

101
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,759
Let's eat and talk.

102
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,199
Okay.

103
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,680
Please, eat.

104
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,560
It's delicious.

105
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,639
Here, Uncle Sun.

106
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,279
Let me toast you.

107
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,199
Please.

108
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,439
This liquor is really strong.

109
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,680
I know I wasn't mistaken.

110
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,120
You, kid,

111
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,279
are cut out to be a soldier.

112
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,040
Uncle Sun,

113
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,000
is that all you care about?

114
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,639
I haven't forgotten about your marriage, either.

115
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,360
This kid is strong,

116
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,079
full of drive,

117
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:43,800
honest,

118
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,959
and ambitious.

119
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,680
I can't manage Jianxin anymore.

120
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,800
Entrusting you to Zhang Yi

121
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,600
is something your father would approve of.

122
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,920
It puts my mind at ease.

123
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,680
To be honest,

124
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,079
in my heart,

125
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,639
I can't quite let go.

126
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,199
Uncle Sun,

127
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,519
thank you for taking care of me all these years.

128
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,639
On behalf of my parents

129
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,399
and myself,

130
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,519
I toast to you.

131
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,079
Actually,

132
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,279
I've always seen you as my own father.

133
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,399
So from now on,

134
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll keep looking after you.

135
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,279
Are you ready?

136
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:31,480
Yeah.

137
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,639
Three.

138
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,040
Two.

139
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:35,920
One.

140
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,560
This is just too valuable.

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I can't accept it.

142
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,959
When I went to the exploration team,

143
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,120
it has always

144
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,360
been sitting at home collecting dust.

145
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,720
That's called wasting resources.

146
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,560
If you ride the bike,

147
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
when you go to do odd jobs,

148
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,560
you can get there faster.

149
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,360
It can save you time.

150
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Finish your meal.

151
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,800
Don't let go, no matter what.

152
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,199
Don't worry.

153
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,080
I can ride it now.

154
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,320
I can ride it now.

155
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,519
I can ride it now.

156
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,720
Jingqiu.

157
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,840
Be careful.

158
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,000
Mom.

159
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,000
Let me explain.

160
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,840
Jingqiu.

161
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,120
Go downstairs and wait for a bit.

162
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,440
I want to talk to Comrade Sun

163
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,679
alone.

164
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,639
Have a seat.

165
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,039
Auntie.

166
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,519
Call me Teacher Wang.

167
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,000
Thank you.

168
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,600
You've helped a lot.

169
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,600
Teacher Wang.

170
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,440
With a family like ours,

171
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,879
there's really no talk of a future.

172
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
The two of you

173
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,919
would be lucky if everything goes smoothly,

174
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,960
but if anything goes wrong...

175
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,279
Given your family background

176
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,320
you have many options.

177
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,519
You can still have a bright future.

178
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,879
But what about Jingqiu?

179
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,399
A few rumors

180
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,879
could ruin her completely.

181
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,320
Teacher Wang,

182
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,159
the issues you mentioned

183
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,240
I have carefully considered them all.

184
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,919
This really isn't a rash decision.

185
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,559
We truly

186
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,639
respect each other

187
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
and admire one another.

188
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,480
We are also

189
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,200
seriously thinking about our future together.

190
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,240
I can see that

191
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,000
you are honest,

192
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,120
sincere,

193
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,879
and have your own opinions.

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,440
So regarding the two of you,

195
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,960
I don't want to stand in your way.

196
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,440
But I have one request.

197
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,159
Please say it.

198
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,240
Anything is fine.

199
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,120
I'm sure you also know

200
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,279
that for Jingqiu right now,

201
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,559
the most important thing is to stay at the school.

202
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,840
There are so many people competing at the moment.

203
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,320
Previously, Teacher Luo from the school

204
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,240
has already come to complain.

205
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,639
There are no secrets that can be kept forever.

206
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,639
So I hope

207
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,519
that for this year,

208
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,159
the two of you don't see each other.

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,399
A whole year, huh?

210
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,600
So you agreed to it?

211
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,320
If it were me,

212
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,440
I couldn't handle it.

213
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,799
Come on, I already said it's just temporary.

214
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,919
Let's talk about something happy.

215
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,000
Well then,

216
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,360
let's talk about something happy.

217
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,200
Ah.

218
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Then I'll go ahead.

219
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,039
Go on.

220
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,480
Let me announce something to you all.

221
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,080
This is my new fiancé.

222
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,440
Oh.

223
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,440
The atmosphere is pretty good today.

224
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:49,799
Then I will also

225
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,720
announce some news.

226
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,600
I'm going to join the army.

227
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,200
For three years.

228
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,840
Dan Niang,

229
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,159
I know you won't be happy about it.

230
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,440
That's why I haven't dared to tell you.

231
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,559
But now that I've grown up,

232
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,200
it's the first time I've really forced myself

233
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,639
to get my mind working.

234
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,080
I've been thinking desperately.

235
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,039
Trying as hard as I can.

236
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,679
I want to improve myself.

237
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,039
I want to give you a better life.

238
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,039
I also want you to look up to me.

239
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,279
So I have to

240
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,000
seize this opportunity to join the army.

241
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,279
Please don't blame me.

242
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,559
Blame you for what?

243
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,720
You're being too suspicious.

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,159
You're doubting someone with good intentions.

245
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:48,960
Jingqiu,

246
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,679
If Brother Jianxin can wait,

247
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,000
then I can wait too.

248
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,840
Anyway, my home is your home.

249
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,840
Whenever you come back,

250
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,120
I'll be waiting for you.

251
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,879
Sister Jingqiu,

252
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,759
I have a home now.

253
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,840
I finally have a home.

254
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:16,919
Don't cry.

255
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,120
Who just said

256
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,919
we should talk about something happy?

257
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,200
Let's go somewhere else.

258
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,440
Pick the Great Wall.

259
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,120
It's so magnificent.

260
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,639
What do you know?

261
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,440
Pick West Lake.

262
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,480
West Lake is beautiful.

263
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,279
West Lake isn't as grand as the Great Wall.

264
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,480
Pick the Great Wall.

265
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,080
Sorry.

266
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,600
Neither of those two are available.

267
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,679
Are there any hawthorn trees?

268
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,799
Hawthorn trees?

269
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,159
Yes.

270
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,919
There really are?

271
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,879
Yes, yes, yes.

272
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,679
Where are the hawthorn trees here?

273
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,919
Young people,

274
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,320
look at all these trees on the mountain.

275
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,720
Hawthorn trees,

276
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,600
cherry trees,

277
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:01,759
apple trees,

278
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,200
there's everything.

279
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,039
Wait until next year.

280
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,159
When the hawthorn trees bloom,

281
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,919
let's all

282
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:09,759
go to Xicunping together.

283
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,200
Okay.

284
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,200
Everyone, look at the camera.

285
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,399
Where's the camera?

286
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,960
Over there.

287
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,960
Get ready.

288
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,200
Smile.

289
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,200
Three.

290
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,279
Collar, collar.

291
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,159
Two.

292
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:26,399
One.
