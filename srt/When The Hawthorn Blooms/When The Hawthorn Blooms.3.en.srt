1
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,479
Teacher Luo

2
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:46,679
There’s something you don’t know.

3
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,439
This book isn’t some kind of banned book.

4
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:49,560
In our exploration team,

5
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,280
we have several copies of it.

6
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,359
Jingqiu

7
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,079
Come here for a moment.

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,320
Jingqiu

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,000
The school sent you here

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,320
to collect and compile the village history.

11
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,000
Not to make friends.

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,359
You represent the school.

13
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:08,719
You need to be mindful of your behavior.

14
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,760
Sorry about this.

15
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
I dragged you into this with me,

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,439
having to watch other people’s reactions.

17
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,079
I was too focused on copying the book.

18
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,719
Let’s just finish reading the book for now.

19
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,519
Oh, right.

20
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,439
You know how to fix fountain pens?

21
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,199
I learned it when I did odd jobs before.

22
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,800
It's already fixed.

23
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
It won't leak ink anymore.

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,319
What are you doing?

25
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,639
Who are you?

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
You thief!

27
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,000
Put the eggs down!

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,039
Changlin!

29
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,319
Hey, you little rascal!

30
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,080
Why didn't you say anything when you came back?

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,319
Mom.

32
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:48,960
Yes?

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,319
Let's eat.

34
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,039
Oh!

35
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,199
Third son, sit down and eat.

36
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:54,719
Okay.

37
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,199
Alright.

38
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,319
Sit down.

39
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,719
Changlin

40
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,319
Hurry up

41
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:04,719
Hey

42
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:07,400
Changlin

43
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,680
Over here

44
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,080
Come

45
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,120
Sit here

46
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,360
Oh, sit down

47
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,520
Oh dear

48
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,879
My silly son

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,400
As soon as he sees a strange girl

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,599
having a meal with him

51
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,840
he gets all shy

52
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,280
Mom

53
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:25,680
Oh

54
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,719
Look at that

55
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,960
Now I can't even mention it

56
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:30,520
Changlin

57
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,639
Hurry and serve Jingqiu some food

58
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,120
Thank you

59
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,199
Qiu, dear

60
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,360
At your age

61
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,080
Hasn't your mother arranged a marriage for you?

62
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,000
Auntie

63
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,680
I'm still young

64
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,000
Besides, my mom isn't in good health

65
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,199
She has chronic lung disease

66
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,120
I still have to do odd jobs

67
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,599
to help support the family

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,759
I haven't thought about anything else

69
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,439
Oh dear

70
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,639
You should start thinking about it

71
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,800
At your age

72
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
In our countryside

73
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,599
that's already the age to be nursing children

74
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,319
Whoever marries you

75
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,879
will be truly blessed

76
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,560
Hey, you know

77
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,000
you and our Changlin

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,599
really look like a couple

79
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,199
Teacher Luo is here.

80
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,439
Teacher Luo.

81
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,000
Auntie, are you eating?

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,439
Have a seat.

83
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,160
Auntie.

84
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,199
Sorry to interrupt your meal.

85
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,639
I'm here to assign some tasks to Jingqiu.

86
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,680
I'll leave right away.

87
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,600
Jingqiu.

88
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,759
Sorry to trouble you.

89
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,800
You have good writing skills.

90
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,560
Try to learn more about

91
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
the village's culture and history.

92
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,319
It's for compiling our teaching materials.

93
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,959
Gather more material if you can.

94
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,600
Okay.

95
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,160
Alright.

96
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,079
Miss Qiu.

97
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,040
Our Changlin

98
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,480
grew up in the village.

99
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,319
If you need anything,

100
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,240
just ask him.

101
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,439
I've been in Xicunping for two or three years.

102
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,560
The local legends here

103
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,759
and the geography—I know them well.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,040
You can interview me anytime.

105
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,360
Ahem.

106
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,160
Jingqiu.

107
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,800
Be mindful of your words and actions.

108
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,319
Try to connect more with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

109
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,839
Alright, Auntie.

110
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,439
I'll be going now.

111
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:57,800
You all continue eating.

112
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,680
Take care.

113
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,600
Mother

114
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,839
I guess I belong to the poor and lower-middle peasants.

115
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,240
Of course.

116
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,759
Brother Changlin

117
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,480
Don't be nervous.

118
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,759
Just say what you know.

119
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,920
Didn't you say

120
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,079
there was a story about a guerrilla fighter who sacrificed himself?

121
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,480
Just tell that one.

122
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:23,879
Yes.

123
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,519
It happened over by the waterfall.

124
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,680
Qiu

125
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,839
You must be tired.

126
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,800
Take a break.

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,199
Have some oranges.

128
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,199
Thank you, Auntie.

129
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:32,920
This boy

130
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,800
is not very talkative.

131
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,439
For ages

132
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,759
he can't even get a word out.

133
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,319
Let me finish my task first.

134
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,240
I'll eat later.

135
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,160
Let me be honest with you.

136
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,959
What do you think of our Changlin

137
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,160
as a person?

138
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,600
Qiu, you see,

139
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,639
your family's class status isn't good.

140
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,519
In the city,

141
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,560
people will definitely look down on you.

142
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,439
But if you marry Changlin,

143
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,480
it'll be different.

144
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,600
Our family's class status is good.

145
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,199
Yours will be good too in the future.

146
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,759
Auntie

147
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,439
I just remembered

148
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,439
I need to report something to Teacher Luo.

149
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,839
I'll come back to hear Brother Changlin's story.

150
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Qiu

151
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,959
Or maybe ask him.

152
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,160
Forget it.

153
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,079
Don't drag him into dealing with Mr. Luo's moods anymore.

154
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:20,920
Where are you going?

155
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,160
Jingqiu.

156
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,480
What story do you want to hear?

157
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,560
I'll tell you.

158
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,240
There was a boy from a wealthy family.

159
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,199
He fell in love with a girl who had returned from studying in the city.

160
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,439
He ignored his family's objections.

161
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,519
He gave up the family business.

162
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:41,959
He followed the girl.

163
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,279
They joined the revolution together.

164
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,800
Later, the enemy invaded the village.

165
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,959
The girl, as a party member,

166
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,480
organized the villagers' retreat.

167
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,439
But she was captured by the enemy.

168
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,839
She was brutally tortured.

169
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,279
In the end,

170
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,720
she drowned in the water.

171
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,360
What about the boy?

172
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,120
Didn't he go to protect her?

173
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,920
The boy was fighting with the guerrilla forces elsewhere.

174
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,360
A few months later,

175
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,199
the guerrilla unit was surrounded by the enemy.

176
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,800
To help the main force retreat,

177
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,040
the boy lured the enemy here.

178
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,160
In a desperate situation,

179
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,959
he jumped off the waterfall.

180
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,759
He also died here.

181
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,879
So did they, until their deaths,

182
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,399
never know what happened to each other?

183
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,079
Jingqiu,

184
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,279
as long as you have the right attitude,

185
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,319
your work is still done very well.

186
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,800
Teacher Luo,

187
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,079
I've noticed

188
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,120
there are still many stories in the village worth writing about.

189
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,800
Besides these legends,

190
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,519
I think some of the village's geographical features

191
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,040
are also worth considering.

192
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,160
Jingqiu,

193
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,000
you just need to

194
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,839
take the tasks

195
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,480
assigned to you by the organization and complete them well.

196
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,720
The organization

197
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,159
will naturally decide what is important.

198
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,279
This

199
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,360
is not something you need to worry about.

200
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,279
The organization, the organization...

201
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,559
Isn't the organization just you?

202
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,600
In a couple of days,

203
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,559
you'll go back to the city.

204
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
There was a program before,

205
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,559
didn't I ask you to join the rehearsal too?

206
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,039
The performance is coming up soon.

207
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,000
You can go back and help me keep an eye on things.

208
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,840
See how things are going.

209
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,639
But Teacher Luo,

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,399
I wanted to use these days to do a few more interviews.

211
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,879
Isn't Dongmei also participating?

212
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,919
You could let her go back first.

213
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,480
You

214
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,559
can go back and visit your mother.

215
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,480
That sounds nice,

216
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,960
Teacher,

217
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,519
this is also for your own good.

218
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,720
Going around in circles,

219
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,080
it's obvious no one else wants to bother with it,

220
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,960
so they can only order me around.

221
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,600
Hey

222
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,799
Qiu, girl

223
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,080
Hurry back inside and pack your things.

224
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,159
I don't have much to pack, Auntie.

225
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,519
You should go back inside.

226
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,279
I'm going to cook.

227
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,279
Usually,

228
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,799
she looks so listless.

229
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,799
She's only been here a few days,

230
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,000
and already someone from the exploration team is standing up for her.

231
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,840
And this Auntie's son

232
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,600
keeps running around doing things for her.

233
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,360
Just as expected,

234
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
you really can't judge a person by their appearance.

235
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,759
Her family background isn't good,

236
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,600
so it's hard for her to get close to the city folks in the exploration team.

237
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,279
Marrying a farmer suits her.

238
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,039
That's what it means to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

239
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,799
And it's really learning in depth.

240
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,480
Excuse me, you two, please move aside.

241
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,000
This place is all dirty now.

242
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:58,600
Hmph.

243
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,000
Go on, keep pretending.

244
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,799
Those two admirers of yours are fighting over you.

245
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,840
Don't pretend you don't know.
