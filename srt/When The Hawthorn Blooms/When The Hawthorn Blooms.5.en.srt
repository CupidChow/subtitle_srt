1
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,280
Come out.

2
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,359
I see you.

3
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,319
Little girl.

4
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,799
Have a drink with me.

5
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,400
Help!

6
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,599
Little girl.

7
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,400
Stop her.

8
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,519
Slow down.

9
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,040
You run pretty fast.

10
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,719
Have a drink with me, girl.

11
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:29,879
I'm here.

12
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,400
You...

13
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,079
Don't run.

14
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,239
You run like a little rabbit.

15
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,359
Come with me.

16
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,400
You’re not hurt, are you?

17
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,200
That’s good.

18
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,959
Thanks for earlier.

19
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,519
It’s nothing.

20
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,760
How did you know I was there?

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,840
I told you during the day.

22
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,719
That I’d wait for you.

23
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,159
When you didn’t show up,

24
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,159
I thought

25
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,159
I’d come look for you.

26
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,400
Can I ask you a question?

27
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,280
Go ahead.

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
What’s your intention?

29
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:20,719
Huh?

30
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,639
You gave me rock sugar,

31
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,719
and walnuts,

32
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,919
helped me rehearse,

33
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,080
and waited for me here.

34
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:30,439
You—

35
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,719
What exactly is your purpose?

36
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,599
Do I have to have a purpose?

37
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,360
I mean,

38
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,319
if you have any

39
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,479
other intentions,

40
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
you’d better drop them.

41
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,400
I’ve helped you,

42
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,159
so you can help me in the future.

43
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,599
We help each other out.

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,719
Isn’t this

45
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,800
class friendship?

46
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,719
Class friendship?

47
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,199
That works.

48
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:58,919
Yeah.

49
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,800
It’s just class friendship.

50
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:03,879
But,

51
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,400
there’s nothing I can help you with right now.

52
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,479
There is one thing,

53
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,840
maybe

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,360
you really can help me with.

55
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,960
If I had known earlier

56
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,360
I wouldn't have agreed so quickly.

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,759
Forget it.

58
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,400
After all, we have a revolutionary friendship.

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,919
The quantity is seven hundred.

60
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,719
No way.

61
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,039
Let's go measure it on site tomorrow.

62
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,039
We're going again tomorrow?

63
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,240
All the names have been embroidered.

64
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:45,639
Hey.

65
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,560
Jingqiu is here.

66
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,520
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

67
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,759
Come in, come in!

68
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,439
Come on in.

69
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:52,840
Here.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,360
Look for your names.

71
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,560
Okay.

72
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,639
Thank you.

73
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,719
This is Lao San's.

74
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,120
These are all Lao San's.

75
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,639
Let me see.

76
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,879
How embarrassing.

77
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,639
Jingqiu.

78
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,639
Oh!

79
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,879
So it turns out

80
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,680
we're all Lao San.

81
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,000
You wish.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,519
That's only in their eyes.

83
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,879
There's only Lao San.

84
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,639
Oh.

85
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,000
Lao San.

86
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,519
Jingqiu

87
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,800
Do you know that by doing this

88
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,959
the consequences can be very serious?

89
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,399
Don't go looking for that Lao San.

90
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Hanging around together all day

91
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,360
is completely inappropriate.

92
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,879
Teacher Luo

93
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,800
My relationship with Lao San

94
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,720
is an open and honest friendship between comrades.

95
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:56,920
It's an open and honest friendship between comrades.

96
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,439
We're not afraid of what others think.

97
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,959
The reason I went to see him before

98
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,560
was also to collect information for the village history.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,319
He's been here for a long time

100
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,959
and studies geology.

101
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,519
He knows a lot about the local hydrology and geography

102
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,560
and is very familiar with it.

103
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,439
If you think this doesn't help me with writing the village history

104
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,839
at all,

105
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,639
then I won't go anymore.

106
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,680
This contains some records

107
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,480
about the hydrology and geography of Xicunping.

108
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,839
If you're writing the village history,

109
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,720
you might find it useful.

110
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,279
You can keep it.

111
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,639
Did my interviews

112
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,120
cause trouble for you?

113
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,920
I'm just worried about causing you trouble.

114
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,000
That Teacher Luo of yours

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,240
doesn't seem to like me very much.

116
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,600
If you have a clear conscience, you have nothing to fear.

117
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,839
Since our friendship is between comrades,

118
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,800
we shouldn't care about gossip.

119
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,639
This is my interview outline.

120
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,639
It's about Xicunping.

121
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,920
There are still many things I want to know.

122
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:09,879
Here.

123
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,879
Why are there sausages?

124
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,800
In our village,

125
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,800
there's a tradition.

126
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,759
If a young man

127
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,680
takes a liking to a girl,

128
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,279
he invites her over for a meal.

129
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,480
In her bowl,

130
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,240
he secretly puts a few slices of sausage.

131
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,560
That

132
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,959
means he's proposing to her.

133
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,000
If the girl eats them,

134
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,279
it means she agrees.

135
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,920
This silly boy...

136
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,079
Say something!

137
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,800
This silly boy...

138
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,000
Changlin,

139
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,800
I know

140
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,319
you mean well.

141
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,199
But...

142
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,639
Jingqiu,

143
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,680
do you like Lao San?

144
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,839
But Lao San, he...

145
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,639
Changlin,

146
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,040
I still have something to do.

147
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,480
I'll talk to you another day.

148
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,079
Can I ask you a question?

149
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:58,800
Yeah.

150
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,079
Do you really like stones?

151
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,079
Your notebook is filled with drawings of all kinds of stones.

152
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,240
Dealing with stones

153
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,839
is easier than dealing with people.

154
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,600
Actually,

155
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,920
I kind of envy you.

156
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,399
You can stay here

157
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,160
and hide in the world of stones.

158
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,639
Can't you also hide in the world of words?

159
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,839
I used to really enjoy

160
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,800
hiding in my own world.

161
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,920
Spending all day with just stones.

162
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,319
It's just that sometimes

163
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,040
I feel a bit lonely.

164
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,519
But later I realized

165
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,040
being able to

166
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,480
share my interests with others

167
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,519
makes me happier than being alone.

168
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,519
When someone is willing to take a look into my world,

169
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,679
it makes me feel really happy.

170
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,120
Laosan.

171
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,759
Changlin.

172
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,000
Changlin, what are you doing?

173
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,399
Jingqiu.

174
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,639
If you don't like me,

175
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,440
that's fine.

176
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,080
But Laosan, he...

177
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,200
Still, you can't just hit people.

178
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,399
He has a fiancée.

179
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,679
Who are you?

180
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,399
Who are you looking for?

181
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,840
Who exactly are you looking for?

182
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,200
Who are you?

183
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,000
Who let you in?

184
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,159
Where is Sun Jianxin?

185
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,679
I'm looking for Sun Jianxin.
