1
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,560
You

2
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,320
Do you really not remember me?

3
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,479
No evidence at all.

4
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,840
Why should I give it to you?

5
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:58,039
Sigh, why are you so stubborn, girl?

6
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,679
I already told you, it belongs to my friend.

7
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,920
Look at the cover.

8
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,039
There's a big "Sun" character on it.

9
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,640
His name is Sun Jianxin.

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,159
That doesn't prove anything.

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:05,840
Come on.

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
Classmates,

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,719
Break time is over.

14
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,480
Let's work harder.

15
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,040
You're about to fall behind.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,120
Hurry up and give it to me.

17
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,840
If you can name these three types of rocks,

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,200
I'll give it to you.

19
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,200
These are, respectively,

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,000
granite,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,680
basalt,

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,599
and limestone.

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,519
Rocks

24
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,519
are divided into which three categories?

25
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,519
Sedimentary rocks,

26
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,280
igneous rocks,

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,000
and metamorphic rocks.

28
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:35,799
The eight main rock-forming minerals of these three types of rocks are

29
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,560
quartz,

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,519
feldspar,

31
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,239
mica,

32
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:38,799
pyroxene,

33
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,879
amphibole,

34
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,480
calcite,

35
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,159
kaolinite and chlorite.

36
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,079
This is my exploration notebook.

37
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,359
Everything inside

38
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,079
was observed and recorded by me bit by bit.

39
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,599
Be more careful next time.

40
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,599
Something this important

41
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,680
shouldn't be lost again.

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
So it was you.

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,719
Why did they leave you behind?

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,120
My family's background isn't good.

45
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,199
They want to draw a clear line.

46
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,680
It's just to show their stance.

47
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,319
I can understand.

48
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,479
Then I'll give you this painting.

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,159
Just take it as

50
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,680
a welcome gift for coming to Xicunping.

51
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:40,719
Here.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,520
I just remembered I have something to do.

53
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,439
I'll listen to your stories next time.

54
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,719
So annoying.

55
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,520
Hey.

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,639
Why didn't you come that day?

57
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,000
Teacher Luo even asked about you.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,080
No one told me.

59
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
Blaming others for your own problems again.

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,240
Cut the nonsense.

61
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,039
Where's the book?

62
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,560
That's strange.

63
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,680
I clearly remember putting it in my backpack.

64
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,919
Why is it here?

65
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,479
It's not like the book can walk on its own.

66
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,800
I can't just give this away, can I?

67
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,159
This handwritten copy...

68
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,360
was meant for everyone to pass around and read.

69
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,280
Why should you keep it all to yourself?

70
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,000
Just because Mr. Luo praised your writing a bit,

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,439
do you think you can be a writer now?

72
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,280
We wait for you for days.

73
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,039
Fine.

74
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,080
I'll go ask everyone what they think.

75
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,719
Hey!

76
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,280
Three days.

77
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,039
Keep dreaming.

78
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,879
The handwritten copy is meant to be shared.

79
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,039
Even if you keep it a few more days,

80
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,479
it won't make a difference.

81
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,280
What does it have to do with you?

82
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,479
If you keep arguing like this,

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,960
and Mr. Luo finds out,

84
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,520
that you're passing the handwritten copy around in private,

85
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,400
it won't be good for anyone.

86
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,120
Three days, then.

87
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,479
Let's go.

88
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,520
Hmph.

89
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,280
Three days.

90
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,280
Half the book is already burned.

91
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,680
I can't even finish copying it.

92
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,120
I haven't even read the second half yet.

93
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,199
Am I supposed to make it up myself?

94
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,680
How did you find it?

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,199
I brought a few books to the exploration team.

96
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,079
Everyone took turns reading them.

97
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,000
This one just happened to be among them.

98
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,959
This lightbulb is too dim.

99
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,160
It's hard on the eyes to read.

100
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,439
I'll get you a brighter one.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,639
You want to copy it with me.

102
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,879
The two of us will copy it together.

103
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,199
We should be able to finish writing it in three days.

104
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,720
But we only have three days.

105
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,800
What happened to your hand?

106
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,439
It's nothing.

107
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,360
Tomorrow is the third day.

108
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,560
No matter how much I write, I can't finish it.

109
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,639
Time is running out.

110
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,600
We have to rely on everyone.

111
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:51,920
No problem.

112
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,680
It's a small matter.

113
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,560
Don't worry.

114
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,519
Leave it to us.

115
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,519
Why is it that every time I see him,

116
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,040
my heart

117
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
starts beating faster?

118
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,879
If you hadn't helped me,

119
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,120
I would have been in big trouble this time.

120
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,399
I just

121
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,800
can't stand seeing others being bullied.

122
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:12,720
I

123
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,439
I'm not that easy to bully either.

124
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,279
They better not think they can take advantage of me.

125
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,319
Paul

126
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,680
Hurry up and kiss her.

127
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,959
In a bit.

128
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,240
She's leaving.

129
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,279
Then

130
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,399
I'll go write too.

131
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,920
I promise to finish it by tomorrow.

132
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,600
Mm.

133
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,839
Impossible.

134
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,240
This isn't that book.

135
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,040
That book was clearly burned.

136
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,839
This even has Jingqiu's handwriting on it.

137
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,600
You must have copied it all over again.

138
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,279
Hey.

139
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,639
How did you know that book was burned?

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,800
I've never told anyone about it.

141
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,600
Jingqiu

142
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,040
Jingqiu...

143
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,160
Jingqiu

144
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,720
Jingqiu

145
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,439
You're talking nonsense.

146
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,279
Fine.

147
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,959
Then please explain.

148
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,240
How did you know the book was burned?

149
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,560
Don't think that

150
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,079
just because Teacher Luo praises you a few times

151
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,720
you can forget who you are.

152
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,199
You need to know your place.

153
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,839
Of course I know.

154
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,919
If Teacher Luo praised someone else

155
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,279
I'm afraid you

156
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,240
wouldn't dare act like this.

157
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
You wouldn't be so relentless, would you?

158
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,360
You can only bully someone like me.

159
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't you think it makes you look bad too?

160
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,200
Teacher Luo,

161
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,879
look,

162
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:45,639
this

163
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,720
is Jingqiu's handwriting.

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,159
She secretly copied a banned book

165
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,559
and even tried

166
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,279
to spread it among the classmates.
