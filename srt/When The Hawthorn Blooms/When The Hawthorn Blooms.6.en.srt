1
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,439
Jingqiu

2
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't go.

3
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:48,560
I...

4
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,679
I didn't mean to cause trouble.

5
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,359
I've been holding it in for a long time.

6
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,479
I just felt that

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,159
you still needed to know.

8
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:57,320
Thank you.

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,560
Brother Changlin

10
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:01,479
I...

11
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,000
Seeing you so angry,

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,359
I'm really worried about you.

13
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:05,840
I...

14
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:07,680
Jingqiu

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,439
Teacher Luo is calling you.

16
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,200
Do you know who came to the village by car?

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,120
Do you know their background?

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,799
I asked around.

19
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,000
That young man from the exploration team,

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,239
he's the son of the military district commander.

21
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,760
The one who came to the village by car

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,959
is his fiancée.

23
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,959
What does that have to do with me?

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,159
Word will definitely get back to them.

25
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,359
If she starts asking questions,

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,280
what are you going to do?

27
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,799
If things get out of hand,

28
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,239
not only will your reputation suffer,

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,319
do you still want to stay at the school?

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,120
I'll handle it.

31
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,120
Does it hurt?

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,400
Who did this?

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,280
I won't let him off.

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,040
I got hurt while working.

35
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:57,519
It's nothing.

36
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,439
Come back to the city with me right now.

37
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,040
Let's go to the hospital.

38
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,920
Go to the hospital for such a small injury?

39
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,120
Isn't that embarrassing enough?

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,640
Stop worrying.

41
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,000
Didn't I already say

42
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,599
I'll go back in a couple of days when I'm free?

43
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,719
Just take leave and come back with me now.

44
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,080
Uncle Sun is sick.

45
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,199
Don't you care about him?

46
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,240
You're just sulking.

47
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,599
He just wants me to go back and audition for the art troupe, right?

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
I'll audition if that's what he wants.

49
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,759
Uncle Sun said

50
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,280
it's much better than you playing with rocks in this remote place.

51
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,879
Jianxin

52
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,360
I finally managed to get a day off.

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,879
I came straight over to see you.

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,439
Besides, Uncle Sun is really worried about you.

55
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,240
Otherwise,

56
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,520
he wouldn't have asked me to come.

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,800
He wants you to go back, right?

58
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,560
By the way,

59
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,520
the scenery here is actually quite nice.

60
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,560
I rarely get to leave the city.

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,439
How about

62
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,800
you show me around a bit?

63
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,240
I heard that here

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,080
there's a

65
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,879
hawthorn tree with red blossoms.

66
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,879
Why don't you break off a branch for me?

67
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,120
I'll put it in my garden and take care of it.

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,319
From now on,

69
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,719
for every extra minute you stay,

70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,240
I'll delay my return by a day.

71
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,360
You...

72
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,759
You should leave immediately.

73
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,039
Go back to school early.

74
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,439
Put the fieldwork aside for now.

75
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,360
The articles you've written

76
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:13,840
and the materials

77
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,439
just leave them for me to organize.

78
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,560
Oh, right.

79
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,560
When you have time after you return,

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,199
write

81
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,599
a summary of this fieldwork.

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,439
When I report to the principal,

83
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,400
I'll have something to refer to.

84
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,319
Okay.

85
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,599
Go on.

86
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:08,719
Ouch.

87
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,520
Lao San.

88
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,800
I used to really enjoy

89
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,160
hiding away in my own world.

90
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,480
But later I realized

91
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,920
that being able to

92
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,360
share my interests with others

93
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,560
makes me happier than being alone.

94
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
When someone is willing

95
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,839
to take a look into my world,

96
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,519
it makes me feel very happy.

97
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,920
The one who came by car is his fiancée.

98
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,639
If things get out of hand,

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,319
not only will your reputation be ruined,

100
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,439
do you still want to stay at the school?

101
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,120
Jingqiu.

102
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,720
Jingqiu.

103
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,720
Jingqiu.

104
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,759
Jingqiu.

105
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
Lao San.

106
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:41,759
Jingqiu.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,519
Let me explain.

108
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:42,879
Lao San.

109
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,920
About the fiancée,

110
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,360
thank you.

111
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,279
The days at Xicunping

112
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,399
have been

113
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,879
the happiest time of my past few years.

114
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,759
It felt like a dream.

115
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,560
But dreams always come to an end.

116
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,879
You are the son of the military district commander.

117
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,639
I am the child of a "black five categories" family.

118
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,040
It's better for us to keep our distance.

119
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,000
This is the money for the rock sugar and walnuts.

120
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:22,720
Here you go.

121
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:27,879
Jingqiu.

122
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,720
I've been in the countryside these past few months.

123
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,000
I couldn't work.

124
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,480
Now I'm back.

125
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,800
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

126
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:46,959
Alright.

127
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,000
As long as you remember, that's fine.

128
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,560
I'm leaving now.

129
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,560
Take care.

130
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,319
Okay, got it.

131
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,959
Uncle Sun.

132
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,079
Here's your glasses.

133
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,959
Mm.

134
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,839
Brother Jianxin.

135
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,319
Where did you go so early this morning?

136
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,839
I went to buy things for the team.

137
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,800
The exploration team.

138
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,519
Hello, Xiao Wu.

139
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,160
Yeah, it's me.

140
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,800
I've finished buying the books.

141
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,560
If you guys

142
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,759
need to buy anything in the next couple of days, let me know.

143
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:31,639
Okay.

144
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,800
Is the exploration team your home?

145
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,720
This is a hotel.

146
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,519
Is it?

147
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,040
If I were staying at a hotel,

148
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,279
I definitely wouldn't stay here.

149
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,600
Take your things

150
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,040
and go right now.

151
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,040
Uncle Sun.

152
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,920
What Jianxin means is

153
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,079
this isn't a hotel.

154
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,920
This is home.

155
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,160
Right, Jianxin?

156
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,000
Stop.

157
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:55,839
Sit down.

158
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,600
We've never shorted her a single cent.

159
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,600
But every time, in front of the neighbors,

160
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,639
she deliberately humiliates us.

161
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,519
She acts polite on the surface,

162
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,279
but she's really mean inside.

163
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,519
Mom.

164
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,600
What happened to your leg?

165
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,680
The sole of my shoe came off.

166
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,720
I was walking too fast.

167
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,120
I accidentally tripped.

168
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,360
At first, it didn't feel like anything.

169
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,040
Maybe I stood for too long just now.

170
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,399
That's why it feels a bit uncomfortable.

171
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,879
Mom

172
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,840
Buy another pair

173
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,840
If you patch them up, you can still wear them

174
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,639
Hey, Jingqiu

175
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,799
When I was buying groceries today

176
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,399
I ran into the parents of some of your classmates

177
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,399
They haven't come back yet, have they?

178
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,240
Why did you come back by yourself?

179
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,799
Oh

180
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,840
Teacher Luo said

181
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,519
I write good essays

182
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,720
And I’ve done a lot of interviews

183
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,679
So

184
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,000
He let me come back early

185
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,600
And also

186
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,240
Help him prepare materials for his report

187
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,840
The conditions in the countryside are tough

188
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,799
So this counts as a kind of

189
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,039
special consideration for me

190
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,759
You come back in the middle of the night.

191
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,879
You go out early in the morning.

192
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,480
You wander around outside all day.

193
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Why did you even come back?

194
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,000
Didn't you just say it yourself?

195
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:30,679
Wandering around aimlessly.

196
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,440
You didn't get enough of playing with rocks in the countryside.

197
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,600
Now you're back in the city and still studying them all day.

198
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,000
You have an appointment with the art troupe leader tomorrow.

199
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,039
You should hurry and go meet them.

200
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,000
I have something to do tomorrow.

201
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,759
I can't go.

202
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,320
Uncle Sun.

203
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,240
Brother Jianxin.

204
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,279
He didn't say he wouldn't go.

205
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,120
He just happens to have something tomorrow.

206
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,759
We can just reschedule.

207
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,279
I don't want to join the art troupe.

208
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,519
Are you going to play with rocks your whole life?

209
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,720
Uncle Sun.

210
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,720
Brother Jianxin is just saying that out of frustration.

211
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,519
He really missed you when he was in the countryside.

212
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,440
Let's not talk about such serious topics.

213
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,960
Why don't you let him rest for a bit first?

214
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,639
I still want Brother Jianxin

215
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,919
to go see the show with me.

216
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,639
The show is about to start.

217
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,679
Let's go, Brother Jianxin.

218
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:13,519
Come on.

219
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,440
Hurry up.

220
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:17,639
Let's go.

221
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,200
Brother Jianxin.

222
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,000
Have you seen this play before?

223
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,559
I saw it once before.

224
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,960
If I ever get the chance in the future

225
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,399
to perform in a play like this,

226
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,000
that would be wonderful.

227
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:48,559
Danniang

228
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,000
My stomach suddenly feels uncomfortable.

229
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,159
I'm going to the restroom.

230
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,759
Did you eat something bad?

231
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,759
I don't know either.

232
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:54,639
I'll go first.

233
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,519
Hey.

234
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,080
Jianxin

235
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:58,759
Then

236
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,320
I'll wait in line first.

237
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,440
Come back quickly.

238
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,200
Jingqiu

239
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,000
The school ping pong team has started training again.

240
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,799
They said there's a city competition.

241
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,879
It's pretty important.

242
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,720
You're good at playing.

243
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:32,720
Want to join?

244
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,360
I heard the champion's prize

245
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,159
is a pair of brand-name sneakers.

246
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,399
Sneakers?

247
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,879
Who told you that?

248
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,279
Teacher Luo.

249
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,039
Teacher Luo also said

250
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,440
to participate in the competition

251
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,679
you must have a team uniform.

252
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,799
It wasn't this strict before.

253
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
It's such a hassle.

254
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,759
Okay.

255
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,399
Got it.
