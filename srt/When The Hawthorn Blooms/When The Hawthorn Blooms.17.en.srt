1
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,439
Doctor

2
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,759
Now

3
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,879
Is there really no other way?

4
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,400
We've already done our best.

5
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,680
During this time,

6
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,480
whatever the patient wants to do,

7
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,840
try to fulfill his wishes.

8
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,159
Okay

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,840
Jianxin

10
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,400
This article by Jingqiu

11
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,840
How many times have you read it?

12
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,319
Take your medicine first.

13
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,520
Jianxin

14
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,759
Are you really not planning

15
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,439
to see Jingqiu again?

16
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,039
Don't disturb Jingqiu's life.

17
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,439
Let her forget about someone like me, who's dying.

18
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,680
Zhang Yi

19
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,000
Danniang

20
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,319
Jingqiu

21
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,240
Jingqiu

22
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,319
Already

23
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,360
knows.

24
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,319
Where is Lao San?

25
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,439
Let's go in and take a photo.

26
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,080
Let's go, Jianxin.

27
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,439
Jianxin, I'll get your medicine.

28
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,159
Actually, these medicines

29
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,319
are no longer of any use to me.

30
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,639
Jianxin

31
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,160
You look pretty good today.

32
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,480
When we take the photo later,

33
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,600
it will definitely look nice.

34
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,480
Danniang

35
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,800
Help me colorize the photo.

36
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,920
Let this be my memorial photo.

37
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,199
Jianxin

38
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,480
What are you saying?

39
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,199
I'm afraid if I wait any longer,

40
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,879
I won't have the chance to take a photo.

41
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,360
Jianxin

42
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,800
I'm going to the restroom.

43
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,040
Wait for me.

44
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,839
Sir

45
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,600
Can you take a photo?

46
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,360
Is it okay if I sit here?

47
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,279
With this background.

48
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,120
Sir

49
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,319
Could you please help me

50
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
and make the photo look nice?

51
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,040
This photo

52
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,560
I want to give to someone.

53
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,000
He is the person I love most

54
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,639
in this world.

55
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,920
Even though he left without saying a word,

56
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,160
avoiding me,

57
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,759
refusing to see me,

58
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,120
I still know

59
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,360
that I am also the person he loves most.

60
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,560
Is this painting beautiful?

61
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
He gave it to me.

62
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,920
We even made a promise together

63
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,879
that when the hawthorn tree blooms,

64
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,439
we would go see it together.

65
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,160
It's a pity

66
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,519
there's no more chance now.

67
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,279
But I don't blame him.

68
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,000
He has his own reasons.

69
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,399
I know he did it for my sake.

70
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,560
I just feel

71
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,959
he underestimated me.

72
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,279
He underestimated both of us.

73
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,839
Why does he think I couldn't hold on?

74
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,199
Why does he think I couldn't handle it?

75
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,839
This is something between the two of us.

76
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,040
Why did he have to decide on his own?

77
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,079
Sir,

78
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,240
You know my boyfriend, right?

79
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,600
Could you please pass a message to him for me?

80
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,839
I will love him forever.

81
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,199
If he keeps refusing to see me,

82
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,240
I will wait for him forever.
