1
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,599
I've had many dreams

2
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,640
In my dreams

3
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,280
you became a famous writer

4
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,319
You wrote many stories

5
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,239
In them

6
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,159
there was also a version of me

7
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,400
The third child in my dreams

8
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,799
was also avoiding me?

9
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,319
In my dreams

10
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,519
the ending wasn't like this

11
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,799
I have an

12
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,959
article ready to be published

13
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,719
Let me read it to you

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,840
My

15
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,879
hawthorn tree

16
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,800
Xicunping

17
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,919
a remote mountain village

18
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,879
What I love most

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,400
is that

20
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,159
lonely hawthorn tree

21
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
It stands at the edge of the village

22
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,199
and has become

23
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,719
a harbor for my soul

24
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,159
Hey

25
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,800
Doctor

26
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,919
How is it?

27
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,400
The patient's condition

28
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,560
is very unstable

29
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,840
But

30
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,479
we managed to save them

31
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,360
If this happens again

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,800
I'm afraid

33
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,039
What did the doctor say about me?

34
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,080
He didn't say much.

35
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,280
He just said

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,520
that we should

37
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,080
make sure you get plenty of nutrition.

38
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,919
Oh, right.

39
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,319
I have a gift

40
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,680
to give you.

41
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,680
The exploration team sent a telegram.

42
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,479
They said the vein you discovered before

43
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,919
has been confirmed to exist.

44
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,719
And the deposit

45
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,199
is very rich.

46
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,919
I really want to go see it.

47
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,080
You'll have a chance.

48
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,759
I mean

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,040
the hawthorn tree.

50
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,079
I don't want to just die in this hospital bed.

51
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,319
Isn't this basically a death sentence for him?

52
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,560
Nonsense.

53
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,680
Absolutely not.

54
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,000
Doctor.

55
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,040
About him...

56
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,600
How much time does he have left?

57
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,000
Well...

58
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,439
Maybe less than three months.

59
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,600
In his condition,

60
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,920
it could happen at any time.

61
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,800
I understand.

62
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,920
Say no more.

63
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
I have just one thing to say.

64
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,399
No way.

65
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,839
Uncle Sun,

66
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
I'm scared too.

67
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,279
It hurts a lot.

68
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
I miss Lao San so much.

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
He never asked me for anything like this.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,160
I can't handle it.

71
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,199
But this is his last wish.

72
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,639
It's also the only thing we can do for him.

73
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,519
I don't want to let him down.

74
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,560
His condition is more stable today.

75
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,959
Remember to take your medicine on time.

76
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,759
Lao San,

77
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,240
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:52,959
Take me with you.

79
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,600
Let's go see the hawthorn tree.

80
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,560
It's so late.

81
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,519
Don't wheel the patient around anymore.

82
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,600
Okay.

83
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,199
Jianxin,

84
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,560
I'll do it myself.

85
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,680
Let me, let me.

86
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,959
Be careful.

87
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,279
It's all my fault.

88
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,759
I hesitated.

89
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,000
I came too late.

90
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,199
Last night

91
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,279
there was a strong wind.

92
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,399
It blew away all the flowers.

93
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,919
Lao San

94
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,519
We've finally arrived under the hawthorn tree.

95
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,879
Jingqiu

96
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:02,840
Promise me

97
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,480
that you'll work hard

98
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,759
and keep living your life.

99
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,240
Keep writing articles.

100
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,679
Be a good teacher.

101
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,080
Find someone

102
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,600
to marry,

103
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,919
have children,

104
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,039
and live a happy life.

105
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,480
I will.

106
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,879
I will.

107
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,480
I will.

108
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,240
Whenever I think

109
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,440
that you can live

110
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,879
happily like this,

111
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,399
I feel

112
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,159
like I'm still alive.

113
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,039
That's wonderful.

114
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,000
Lao San

115
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,120
Lao San

116
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,679
Jianxin

117
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,360
Brother Jianxin

118
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,919
Jianxin

119
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,879
Brother Jianxin

120
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,519
Jianxin

121
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,519
Brother Jianxin

122
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,480
Lao San

123
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,519
Brother Jianxin

124
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,519
According to Lao San's last wishes

125
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,639
after he was cremated

126
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,399
he was laid to rest beneath the hawthorn tree

127
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,679
In his final moments

128
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,600
he said to me

129
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,480
I can't wait for you for a year

130
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,799
but in another world

131
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,600
I will love you for a lifetime

132
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,399
Since then

133
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,799
in my dreams

134
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,919
I often return to the hawthorn tree

135
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,559
Here rests

136
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,799
the one I deeply love
