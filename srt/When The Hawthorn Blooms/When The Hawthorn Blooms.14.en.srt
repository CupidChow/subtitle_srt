1
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,280
You ask when I will return, but there is no set date.

2
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,280
You ask when I will return, but there is no set date.

3
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,280
With delicate brushwork,

4
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,840
the poet is depicted,

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,679
at night,

6
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,000
when hearing the sound of rain,

7
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,799
expressing longing for someone far away.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,359
Expressing feelings of longing.

9
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,000
Comrade Lao San,

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,000
Reading your letter feels like seeing you in person.

11
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,840
It has been over three months since we parted.

12
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,599
After successfully giving my trial lecture,

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,519
I was assigned to the elementary school department.

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,480
I entered the probation period.

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,159
In terms of teaching,

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,599
I have to undergo evaluation by the school leadership.

17
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,920
This period has been extremely busy.

18
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,159
There are so many things to learn.

19
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:29,560
Interacting with the students is interesting,

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,239
but not easy.

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,280
Teaching knowledge is one part,

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,040
but I also need to care about them,

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,920
and know how to show that care.

24
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,280
I often ask my mother for advice and experience.

25
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:43,879
Now,

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,439
I rarely do part-time jobs anymore.

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,359
After work,

28
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,959
I devote all my time to studying lesson plans.

29
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,480
I hope

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,560
that when I see you in the future,

31
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,640
I will be a better version of myself.

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,000
Besides,

33
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,599
during this period,

34
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
there was also something interesting

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,280
that I want to tell you about.

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,039
Jingqiu

37
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,840
Congratulations

38
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,400
on successfully staying at the school

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,319
I knew I wasn't wrong about you

40
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,520
When the teachers voted

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,120
I immediately voted in favor

42
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,919
Thank you, Teacher Luo

43
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,919
Have a seat

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,319
Oh

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,960
Jingqiu

46
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:26,840
Recently

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,879
I happened to reread a few of your articles

48
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,280
and took a closer look at them

49
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,719
They're very well written

50
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,120
As it happens

51
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,479
a friend at the provincial newspaper

52
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,520
said they need articles reflecting the youth of our era

53
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,520
This piece you wrote

54
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,080
"Notes from Xicunping" is quite good

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,120
It could be renamed

56
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,639
"My Friends and I"

57
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,960
If you polish it up a bit

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,120
and submit it

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,000
it might get published

60
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,840
So

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,919
I wanted to ask

62
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,199
what you think

63
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:56,960
Alright

64
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,520
I'll definitely revise it

65
00:02:59,199 --> 00:02:59,840
For

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,400
I still agreed.

67
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,520
I wrote about my classmates,

68
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,400
my friends,

69
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,439
and also the people of Xicunping.

70
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,240
Of course,

71
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,759
I wrote about you too.

72
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:16,919
I hope

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,919
these stories can be printed in type,

74
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,199
so that people can see them,

75
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,719
even if it's just a tiny space in the paper.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,159
I'd be satisfied with that.

77
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,840
But

78
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,080
Uncle,

79
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,120
Jingqiu,

80
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,240
looking for newspapers again?

81
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah.

82
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,919
The newspapers from these days are all inside.

83
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,759
You can look for them yourself.

84
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:38,919
Thank you.

85
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:39,639
No problem.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,919
Teacher Luo said

87
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,080
my article might be published in the newspaper this month.

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,879
But every time I ask him,

89
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,039
he always says he hasn't received any notice from his friend.

90
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,479
He tells me to keep an eye out myself.

91
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,039
So every few days,

92
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,560
I go with a little hope

93
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,319
to the mailroom to look through the newspapers.

94
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,400
I long to see my name printed there.

95
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,159
But

96
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,039
I haven't found it so far.

97
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,000
Uncle,

98
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,120
there are no newspapers for the 7th and 8th here.

99
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,240
Have you seen them?

100
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,120
The toilet is out of newspaper.

101
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,439
I'll go get some more newspaper.

102
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,160
Oh.

103
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,519
Maybe

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,759
this article doesn't even exist.

105
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,759
It's just my wishful thinking.

106
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,399
I'm so busy I don't have time to care.

107
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,920
I'd rather let it

108
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,199
exist in this uncertain way.

109
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,480
Like a dream.

110
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,879
I hope everything is well with you.

111
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,800
I look forward to your letter telling me how you've been.

112
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,360
No matter how small the matter,

113
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,240
or how trivial the details, it's all fine.

114
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,160
I eagerly await it.

115
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,959
Best wishes.

116
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,560
Jingqiu

117
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,079
The archives room has been under renovation lately.

118
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,199
Things are a bit messy.

119
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,959
All the newspapers and magazines are here.

120
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,040
You can look for them yourself.

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,160
Thank you.

122
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,439
Don't worry.

123
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,160
If your family has any difficulties,

124
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,160
you can delay paying the tuition and fees.

125
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,079
I'll apply to the school for you.

126
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,680
Don't feel any pressure about it.

127
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,120
Just focus on your studies.

128
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,959
Thank you, Teacher Jingqiu.

129
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Hurry to class.

130
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,199
Teacher Jingqiu.

131
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,720
You're really good to your students.

132
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,920
I'm just doing what I can.

133
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,480
I help however much I can.

134
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,079
Don't be so modest.

135
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,920
We all need to learn from you.

136
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,480
I almost forgot.

137
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,120
I still have to substitute for Teacher Luo.

138
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,839
Didn't he come this morning?

139
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,040
I think I saw him.

140
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Who knows.

141
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,839
Teacher Luo has been taking a lot of leave lately.

142
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,600
Look.

143
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,079
He's still running around outside in this heavy rain.

144
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,920
I heard he's busy with some activities.

145
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,079
He's preparing for a promotion.

146
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,399
He's joining the provincial writers' association.

147
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
He'll be managing cultural workers.

148
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,120
He won't have to breathe in chalk dust anymore.

149
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
I'm off to class.

150
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,839
Why are you here?

151
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,040
Hurry and dry off.

152
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,800
Don't catch a cold.

153
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,680
I'll do it myself.

154
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,480
Don't let the rain splash on you.

155
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,040
I don't even know who it was

156
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,639
who said they'd keep their promise.

157
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,040
Not see each other for a year.

158
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,519
But ended up breaking the rule themselves.

159
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,600
What's wrong?

160
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,680
Let me help you.

161
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,959
I found the newspaper.

162
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,639
Really?

163
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,240
Yeah.

164
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,680
But...

165
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,279
Jingqiu.

166
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:29,879
Jingqiu.

167
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,279
Here's what happened.

168
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,399
This article...

169
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,799
I've already submitted it for you.

170
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,279
A friend at the provincial newspaper said

171
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,039
there's no need to put two names on it.

172
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,039
He made the decision on his own.

173
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,519
He put my name on it.

174
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,120
By the time I found out,

175
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,240
it was too late to change it.

176
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,600
Teacher...

177
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,679
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,840
In the future,

179
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,240
I will definitely repay you.

180
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,799
When I transfer to the Writers' Association,

181
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,799
I'll be sure to recommend you.

182
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,399
To publish articles.

183
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,000
I just want what I deserve.

184
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,080
Dad.

185
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,360
Grandma's coughing really badly.

186
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,360
It scared my little brother and made him cry.

187
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,159
Then help Dad comfort your brother, okay?

188
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,759
Alright?

189
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,519
Dad.

190
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,200
I'm hungry.

191
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,279
Go play for a while.

192
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,200
We'll eat soon.

193
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:17,679
Okay.

194
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,559
Go on.

195
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,080
Every family has its own troubles.

196
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,639
My mother

197
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,919
has suffered from a chronic illness for years.

198
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,679
She needs constant medical treatment and medication.

199
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,039
We've accumulated a lot of debt.

200
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,759
My wife couldn't take this hardship.

201
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,399
She left.

202
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,480
My two children are still young.

203
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,759
They're at an age when they need a lot of care.

204
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,600
I transferred to the Writers' Association.

205
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,039
At least the monthly salary

206
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,480
is five yuan more.

207
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,279
With such a big family,

208
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,960
at least we can eat a bit better.

209
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,759
For me,

210
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,080
I had no other choice.

211
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,600
Actually,

212
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,639
I think you should

213
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,120
be the same kind of person as me.

214
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,879
No background,

215
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,240
no connections,

216
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,279
always having to please others,

217
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,399
and being at others' mercy.

218
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,759
I

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,279
I'm not willing to accept this.

220
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,600
I just

221
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,799
want to fight for a bit more dignity for myself.

222
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,320
Jingqiu,

223
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,200
for the sake of

224
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,720
our teacher-student relationship,

225
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,960
let's just let this go.

226
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,600
Is that okay?

227
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,279
I'm not the same kind of person as you.

228
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,960
This is seven yuan for the manuscript fee.

229
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,519
I didn't dare touch it.
