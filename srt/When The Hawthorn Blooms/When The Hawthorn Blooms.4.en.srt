1
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,399
Are you two going to buy or not?

2
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,200
Third Brother,

3
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,320
Why did you suddenly start liking walnuts?

4
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,280
When I win,

5
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,560
I'll take all of these.

6
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,159
Jingqiu,

7
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,240
My mom said

8
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,359
lung disease is hard to cure.

9
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,280
You can only nurse it.

10
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,239
The walnuts here are good.

11
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,079
They help strengthen the lungs.

12
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,680
Also,

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,680
rock sugar stewed pears

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,000
but we can't get rock sugar here.

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,280
Just take this.

16
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,400
It's so heavy.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,159
Sigh.

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,159
Changlin and I happened to run into a vendor selling walnuts.

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,079
So we didn't discuss it with you.

20
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:23,879
We bought some.

21
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:25,640
Take them.

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,239
Thank you both.

23
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:56,959
Come.

24
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,200
Have some eggs.

25
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,640
Thank you, Auntie.

26
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,359
Have some eggs.

27
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,200
Thank you, Auntie.

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,040
Qiu, girl.

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,519
Look at all the things you're carrying.

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,959
Let Changlin walk you home.

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,719
Changlin.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,199
Yes?

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,240
Jingqiu.

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,280
Let me walk you home.

35
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,759
I'll walk her.

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,199
Doesn't Changlin have to go to work?

37
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,159
Don't let him miss out on earning work points.

38
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,520
I don't need it.

39
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,919
Your exploration team is so busy.

40
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,479
Always climbing mountains and going into the woods.

41
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,159
Digging and breaking rocks all day.

42
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,719
You should get some rest.

43
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,759
Take care of yourself.

44
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,199
He's got plenty of free time.

45
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,439
Let him run some errands.

46
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:27,759
Okay.

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,919
It's fine, Auntie.

48
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,759
I have a day off tomorrow.

49
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,879
Really, there's no need to trouble everyone.

50
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,520
You're a young woman.

51
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,000
Walking back and forth on mountain roads.

52
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,879
Aren't you scared?

53
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,560
Even I get worried.

54
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,120
Aunt Jingqiu.

55
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,240
Third Uncle and Little Uncle both like you.

56
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,599
Who do you like?

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,319
No one needs to walk me home.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,919
I can carry it myself.

59
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,159
These walnuts

60
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,400
were really given by Auntie.

61
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,800
Yes.

62
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,919
Auntie is really kind.

63
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,319
Besides,

64
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,759
when I was at their place,

65
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,240
I helped them with a lot of work too.

66
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,240
Rumors travel far even without legs.

67
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,479
With our family's situation,

68
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,159
even if we don't cause trouble,

69
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,159
we're already under scrutiny.

70
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,319
And you still accept things from poor and lower-middle peasants?

71
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,879
What if something happens because of this...

72
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,120
I understand, Mom.

73
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,159
Especially

74
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,159
since you plan to stay at the school,

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,960
you need to be even more careful with your words and actions.

76
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,400
Don't give others anything to use against you.

77
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't worry, Mom.

78
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,080
As a child of a "black five categories" family,

79
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,199
no matter how careful I am,

80
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,280
there's always something for people to use against me.

81
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,000
What a coincidence.

82
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,160
Didn't I tell you not to walk me here?

83
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,800
I just happened to be coming into town.

84
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,920
I'm not joking with you.

85
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,680
My mom isn't in good health.

86
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,560
What if she finds out?

87
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,959
She can't get upset.

88
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,000
I know.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,800
Jingqiu.

90
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
Something happened in the rehearsal room.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,920
Come with me, quickly.

92
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,879
We're not practicing anymore.

93
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,399
How long have we all been waiting?

94
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,279
Exactly.

95
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:32,879
How are we supposed to rehearse now?

96
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:33,319
Don't go.

97
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,040
Don't go.

98
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,519
Everyone, don't panic.

99
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
I'm already looking for a classmate who can accompany us.

100
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,000
Even if he can't come this afternoon,

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,120
we can still practice without accompaniment.

102
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,600
Without accompaniment?

103
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,079
How are we supposed to rehearse?

104
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,800
Yeah, exactly.

105
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,279
Does anyone here know how to play the accordion?

106
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,519
I do.

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,800
Jingqiu.

108
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,399
Who is he?

109
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,600
I'm Jingqiu's cousin.

110
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,600
I originally just came to watch your rehearsal.

111
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,879
Didn't expect I'd be joining the rehearsal now.

112
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,800
That's pretty bold of you.

113
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,079
Everyone, stop standing around.

114
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,160
Let's get started.

115
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Forget it, cousin or not.

116
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
As long as we can rehearse smoothly, that's all that matters.

117
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,120
I didn't expect you to sing so well.

118
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,000
You're the one who's truly impressive.

119
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,800
You play the accordion so well.

120
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,160
When you tell a lie,

121
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,519
you don't even blush or skip a beat.

122
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,399
Ah, cousin.

123
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,920
Thank you for your kindness.

124
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,600
The phrase "public opinion is to be feared,"

125
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,079
to you,

126
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
is just an idiom.

127
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,600
But in my life,

128
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,000
I have to be cautious all the time.

129
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,040
Jingqiu.

130
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,279
Are you okay?

131
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,160
I'm fine.

132
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,240
It's just that I'm a bit

133
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,360
hypoglycemic.

134
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,879
Rock sugar is hard to find.

135
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,600
It's only sold in the city.

136
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,919
That's why I came along.

137
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,960
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,559
I didn't think it through.

139
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,679
You meant well too.

140
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,080
I shouldn't have said that to you.

141
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,679
Wait for me here for a moment.

142
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,080
The gift is from me.

143
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,120
I can't accept money for it.

144
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,440
I can't take a reward for nothing.

145
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,679
Don't take this money.

146
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,840
Then I don't want the gift either.

147
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,600
I won't take the money.

148
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,279
The rock sugar is for your aunt.

149
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,879
Don't overthink it.

150
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,919
This between us is

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,960
class friendship.

152
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,960
Besides,

153
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,200
didn't you also accept Changlin's walnuts?

154
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:34,759
I...

155
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,320
It'll be very dark when you go back tonight.

156
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,360
I'll wait for you in the county town.

157
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,759
Don't wait for me.

158
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,399
Jingqiu.

159
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,080
I'm leaving now.

160
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,200
Is it pretty?

161
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,440
It's pretty.

162
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,639
Jingqiu.

163
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,600
Why do you seem so distracted?

164
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,080
I've been holding back from saying anything.

165
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,600
Just now,

166
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,919
who was that person?

167
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,080
Who?

168
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
Don't pretend.

169
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,080
I saw everything.

170
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,360
You wouldn't...

171
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,879
Meinuo.

172
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,159
How could I...

173
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,480
I don't understand what you're talking about.

174
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,519
Men...

175
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,000
None of them can be trusted.

176
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,679
They say all kinds of things,

177
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,559
but in their minds,

178
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,000
they're just thinking about taking advantage of you.

179
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,679
When they haven't gotten you yet,

180
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,559
they'd promise to get you the stars and the moon.

181
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,799
But once you really fall for them,

182
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,639
and give them everything,

183
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,360
who knows, once the novelty wears off,

184
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,399
they won't stick around anymore.

185
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,320
He wouldn't.

186
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,799
Are there any tickets left?

187
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,600
No, there aren't.

188
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,039
Hello.

189
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,600
Are there any tickets to Xicunping?

190
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,840
No, they're all gone.

191
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,720
Look at the time.

192
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,360
So expensive.

193
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,919
Hey, miss.

194
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:31,840
Need a place to stay?

195
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,559
It's cheap.

196
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,720
I'll just walk back.

197
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,360
That third one

198
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,799
I already told you not to wait

199
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:57,919
Come out

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,960
I see you
