1
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,720
Little sparrow.

2
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,200
Little Sparrow.

3
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
I bought you the latest design.

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,280
Hey.

5
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:46,720
Don't...

6
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,720
Don't mess around.

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,960
Calm down.

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,400
Isn't that the crazy guy at the gate of the hospital?

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,040
I can explain.

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
Yes, I can.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,240
What to do?

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,320
I was so embarrassed that I wanted to make a living.

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,040
You two

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,640
live together so soon?

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,360
Kind of.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,480
No, no.

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,360
Of course it doesn't.

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,360
We've agreed to live together.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,560
And an agreement.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,760
Hey.

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,280
This...

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,280
He is an AI robot?

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,840
I'm not a robot.

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,360
His name is Jin Mu.

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,800
He is my...

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,560
Little sparrow.

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,160
It's over.

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,880
Since this is the robot that you studied,

29
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,800
I'm relieved.

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't lie to me next time.

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,880
Alright.

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,040
You are all hungry, right?

33
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,680
Why don't we go

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,280
come on.

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
Let's eat something delicious.

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
I've made a reservation.

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,880
Come on.

38
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,880
The vibe is

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,280
a little sour.

40
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,000
That's strange.

41
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,320
I booked the guest room at your favorite hot pot restaurant.

42
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,680
I am her boyfriend.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,960
Please behave yourself.

44
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,280
How can you be so self-conscious

45
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,680
don't flatter yourself.

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,520
I'm an alien.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,200
Are they crazy?

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,160
Hey.

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,920
He is...

50
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,240
It seems

51
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,400
It's good.

52
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,200
My arm is good.

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,360
Come on.

54
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,240
Try it.

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,440
Did he really want to hug me?

56
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,320
I can't.

57
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,320
I can't carry you.

58
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,920
You scared me.

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,120
This is a public space.

60
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,520
What a social media.

61
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,960
Look at him holding his girlfriend.

62
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,840
Look at yourself.

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,680
Is a cruel man.

64
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,720
Always be a god.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,600
Woman!

66
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,160
Come.

67
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,800
How dare you compete for my favor?

68
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,840
You eat it.

69
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,120
As if anyone can't.

70
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,080
Through the peephole,

71
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,120
this darn desire to win!

72
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,120
Give it to me.

73
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,840
I will peel them for you.

74
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,880
No need.

75
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,480
I can do it myself.

76
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,040
That's not good.

77
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,520
Give it to me.

78
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,320
Of course I can't.

79
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
She's my woman.

80
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,200
You don't need to do it yourself.

81
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,600
I know how to win.

82
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,320
Winning is child's play.

83
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,560
It has finally stopped.

84
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,040
Luckily,

85
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
he left me a piece.

86
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,720
Do you want me to eat or not?

87
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,240
Check out.

88
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,240
I will.

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,280
Six hundred and eight.

90
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,880
Keep the change.

91
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,760
Thank you.

92
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,440
Why are you pretending to have no money?

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,680
Hold on.

94
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,680
Better than speed.

95
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,360
Alright.

96
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
I will make you be convinced of your defeat.

97
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,520
Don't say I'm bullying you.

98
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,760
Let you go first.

99
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,200
Don't regret it!

100
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,680
I'll show you what a racer can do.

101
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,160
Sure enough.

102
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,720
The moment you can rely on a man

103
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,480
Is when sows are able to climb trees.
