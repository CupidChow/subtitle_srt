1
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,960
You

2
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,000
you

3
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,920
what are you doing?

4
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,280
I think

5
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,040
been here before.

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,080
Of course we did.

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:50,640
Come here.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,600
Check it carefully.

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,840
Do you remember her?

10
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,240
What a freak!

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,600
This towel saved me.

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,160
It becomes more certain.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,880
Plus the compensation

14
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,200
for emotional distress.

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,040
From now on,

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,200
work and repay my debt.

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,320
I'll give you three days.

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,520
Learn how to be an earthling.

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,600
Otherwise,

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,160
neither of us would survive.

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,040
Got it?

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,480
Well

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,040
In order to become

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,640
someone who's compatible with me,

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,880
let's start by figuring out your internal procedures.

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,720
Come here.

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,880
Let me use the company's brain-computer interface technology

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,360
to figure out the thinking of your built-in program.

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,280
What's wrong

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
has such a big head?

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,240
Don't move.

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,720
You are my research object now.

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,920
Eight yuan per hour

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,560
at least eight yuan per hour

35
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,520
to calculate your salary.

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,960
Why does the code look so familiar?

37
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,280
Who's the one that transformed you?

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,880
Sample.

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,240
You want to mess with me?

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,520
Don't bother.

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,160
Let me see what you can do.

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,160
Teach me how to change your program.

43
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,640
No need to do that.

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,600
I can do whatever

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,720
I can learn.

46
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,600
That's what you said.

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,960
The code looks familiar.

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,840
Who's that?

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why are you here?

50
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,880
I've finished reading it.

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,440
Tell me about it.

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,160
Listen carefully.

53
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,840
After watching the video,

54
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,160
I have a new understanding of Earth civilization.

55
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,200
Ospreys are cooing.

56
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,720
On the islet in the river,

57
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,320
a quiet and modest maiden

58
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,160
a gentleman's good mate

59
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,320
don't you see?

60
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,480
The Yellow River

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,680
and never returns.

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,160
The apple.

63
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,720
I can't love you too much.

64
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,160
Stop

65
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,000
pleasant Goat.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,560
Grey Wolf.

67
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,160
Stop

68
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,840
I...

69
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,440
OK.

70
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:53,760
Alright.

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,920
I know you are great at learning.

72
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,080
Searching.

73
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,840
Desolate

74
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,400
and miserable.

75
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Stop

76
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,120
I said it's fine.

77
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,920
I really want to eat you up.

78
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,280
To give me some peace.

79
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,040
I'm too dirty.

80
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,160
How about

81
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,600
wash them before you eat.

82
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,200
It's true.

83
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,000
It's really dirty.

84
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,960
That...

85
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,800
Go take a shower first.

86
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,400
I'll get you some clothes.

87
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,040
You don't really want to eat me?

88
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,920
Eat your ass!

89
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,440
Come on, Jin Mu.

90
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,560
Fight!

91
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,040
Last time?

92
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,920
You

93
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,520
use it.

94
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,840
Bath towel?

95
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,440
Last time the charging port was leaking.

96
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,880
That caused a leak.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,680
I've turned on the shower mode.

98
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,200
So it's OK.

99
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,920
Who programmed this thing?

100
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,040
He's so dramatic.

101
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,160
Little sparrow.

102
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,840
Computer technology

103
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Is a tool that promotes social development.

104
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,960
You have to

105
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,000
and make it contribute

106
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,400
to human progress.

107
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,600
All right, Miss Xi Fei.

108
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,440
I will.

109
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,200
Hurry!

110
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,840
Go to the Earth to find Sparrow.

111
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,560
It's safe there.

112
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,240
Grandpa, I'm not leaving.

113
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Leave now!

114
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,520
Don't...

115
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,320
Grandfather.

116
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,160
Grandfather.

117
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,640
Grandfather.

118
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,480
You must find Little Sparrow.

119
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,440
She's our hope.

120
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,720
Only she

121
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,760
can save Planet Kalam.

122
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,200
Grandfather.

123
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,920
Why did you ask me to find her?

124
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,200
I know who you are.

125
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,120
You wrote the program, right?

126
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,360
Who is Miss Xi Fei?

127
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
I'll cut off the electricity if you don't tell me.

128
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,440
And sell you to become a human model.

129
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,760
And be a slave forever.

130
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,360
My grandfather.

131
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,600
No wonder you look familiar to me.
