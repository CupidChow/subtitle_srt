1
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,400
This is killing me.

2
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,680
He stabbed me to my heart with a blow.

3
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,960
Such a boyfriend.

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,040
That's too crazy.

5
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,880
Is it a meteor?

6
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,320
The God opened its eyes

7
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,480
to give me, who has been single for 23 years,

8
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
for the sake of

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's my Mr. Right

10
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,480
little sparrow.

11
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,320
Will you marry me?

12
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,960
Yes, I will.

13
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,640
Where is she?

14
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,680
What?

15
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,600
She's gone?

16
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,920
What?

17
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,360
It's him again.

18
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,360
Little Sparrow.

19
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,280
Don't play with fire.

20
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,280
You are mine

21
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,320
do I know you?

22
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,920
I'm the one who met you across the Galaxy.

23
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,400
Crossing the galaxy.

24
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,520
The broken light bulb is always haunting me.

25
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,920
And ruining my dream.

26
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,480
Error warning.

27
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,640
Wrong converter...

28
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,000
What a freak!

29
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,320
What's going on?

30
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,680
Am I still dreaming?

31
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,040
You see a ghost?

32
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,080
Little Sparrow, come and save the situation.

33
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,640
Who are you talking to?

34
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,720
Are you taking pictures and lying?

35
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,240
I'm taking pictures?

36
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,680
Did San Shi destroy your family's grave?

37
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,560
He lied to me.

38
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,440
Shit!

39
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,000
Your teeth are like Tanks.

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,640
And it's affecting your Ferrari.

41
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,440
You

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,080
I will hit you.

43
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,600
Try to touch it again.

44
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,080
Shit!

45
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,160
Pu Xinnan!

46
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,160
Get out of here!

47
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Hey, Chen Feifei.

48
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,440
You've had 101 blind dates.

49
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,920
Do you think you are in a movie?

50
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,280
We all love for all.

51
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,560
As a single guy,

52
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,480
to understand her.

53
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:40,920
Alright.

54
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,640
Screw you!

55
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,000
You know what?

56
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,680
The strangest thing happened to me today.

57
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,360
He's...

58
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,920
I was taking a shower.

59
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
Little sparrow.

60
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
It seems

61
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,560
I'm in love again.

62
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,880
Chen Feifei.

63
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,720
Chen Feifei.

64
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Who's she?

65
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,200
He dresses so strangely.

66
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
This stupid dress must have attracted everyone's attention.

67
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,720
Strange things happen every year,

68
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,240
this year, there are many weirdos.

69
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,240
Excuse me.

70
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,040
Let me take a photo.

71
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,480
He is so handsome.

72
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,840
A handsome and decent man.

73
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,280
Chen...

74
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,760
This towel...

75
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,720
Hello

76
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,560
this is Chen Feifei.

77
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,840
Match failed.

78
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,240
The target match

79
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,960
Is 99.99% matched.

80

Hurry up.

81
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,760
Hurry up!

82
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,000
You must find Xiao Sparrow.

83
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,280
Only she

84
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,560
can save Planet Kalam.

85
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,840
This man...

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,160
Seem to have met before

87
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,760
I think I saw you in my dream.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,120
I finally found you.

89
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,200
Little sparrow.

90
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,720
Who are you

91
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,640
I am the one who met you across the galaxy.

92
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,920
I think even a man looks handsome.

93
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,920
Find your target

94
