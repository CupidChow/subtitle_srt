1
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,560
You're right.

2
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,080
The moment you can rely on a man

3
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,760
Is when sows are able to climb trees.

4
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,640
How did you come up here?

5
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,840
Human and machine as one.

6
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,240
Then you're not an individual.

7
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,480
Go on.

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,320
Who told you to get close to Little Sparrow?

9
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,120
I'm the one

10
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,640
speak for yourself.

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,360
What's the purpose of your approaching her?

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,920
What's your purpose?

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,400
I really do.

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,000
Shameless!

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,920
That's right.

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
You're so shameless.

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,520
You left her alone in the restaurant.

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,480
I'm going back to her now.

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,600
Thank you for the call.

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,960
I'll pick her up now.

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,800
Wasn't it charged in the morning?

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,400
Jinmu.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,280
Gold moth, here you go.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,400
You're not a human then.

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,480
Why is your heart beating so loud?

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,320
Are you all right?

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,120
Hey!

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,160
Put me down!

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,000
Hurry up.

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,400
It's because you ran so fast.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,320
Where's Xu Lai?

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,680
I recharged his car.

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,480
But I charged it with restraint.

34
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,360
How can you speak

35
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,400
It's weird.

36
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,160
I'm Jin Mulai.

37
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,840
Can you be a person?

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,000
You left my car battery,

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I came here by taxi.

40
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
Little sparrow.

41
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Nice to see you again.

42
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,000
Boss, get in the car.

43
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,280
I asked the professor to sign the contract.

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,760
Oh!

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,640
Little sparrow.

46
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,200
We will meet soon.

47
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,480
I'll leave then.

48
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,240
Well

49
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,280
what is this?

50
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,000
Angela.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,480
Lisa.

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,880
Bella,

53
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,200
jessica, this is your gift.

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,640
To fit in the trunk.

55
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,320
I knew it.

56
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,000
Little Sparrow,

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,680
I can explain.

58
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,360
Little sparrow.

59
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,800
I...

60
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,440
Boss.

61
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,120
Are you possessive!

62
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Think positively.

63
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,160
Little girls will have a boyfriend sooner or later.

64
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,840
I think you want to be fired.

65
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,920
She is using a computer even when she's sleeping.

66
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,400
Grandpa asked me to find the secret of little sparrow

67
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,240
Is inside this.

68
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,680
Jin Mu Lai.

69
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,680
What are you doing?

70
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,280
Speak out.

71
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,080
Are you trying to copy the idol drama model secretly?

72
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,880
And earn some money?

73
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,480
Right.

74
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,680
I owe you a lot of money.

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
So I...

76
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,840
Let go of me!

77
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,800
You

78
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,920
just stay here.

79
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,200
Don't let Xu Lai influence you.

80
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,880
He is fickle in love no matter how rich he is.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,560
Don't...

82
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,920
About money?

83
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,360
Of course I do.

84
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,000
But I only care about the money you owe me.

85
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,040
I'm going back to sleep.

86
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,480
Oh, right.

87
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,400
Don't come in my bedroom again.

88
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,080
It is improper for men and women to be improperly intimate.

89
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,120
You are dismissed.

90
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Little sparrow.

91
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,560
Xu Lai told me about everything.

92
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,560
Are you really going to

93
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,720
with an unknown jerk?

94
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,280
How can you stop me?

95
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,480
I know, Mom.

96
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,760
You're the president.

97
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,480
You have money.

98
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,480
Keep the change.

99
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
Why are you pretending to have no money?

100
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,480
How could you?

101
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,320
About money?

102
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,240
Of course I do.

103
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,720
Grandpa didn't send me to the Earth

104
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,760
to make money, right?

105
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,120
Just go.

106
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,960
Granny Hua.

107
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,240
The business is good today.

108
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,240
I've earned a lot of money today.

109
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,520
Young man, do you have any money?

110
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,360
Nothing.

111
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,360
Nothing.

112
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,120
No. You hurt my leg.

113
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,520
Sorry, grandma.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,880
I want to earn money.

115
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,040
If you want to earn money,

116
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,360
find it yourself.

117
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,280
It's not easy for me to find it.

118
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,360
How can it earn money?

119
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,800
Young man,

120
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,880
this one

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,160
this one.

122
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,920
Xiao Wu,

123
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,360
hurry.

124
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,840
Bring the sofa here.

125
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,840
Hurry up.

126
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,720
Young man,

127
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,200
he's still young.

128
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,920
She'll become

129
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,560
she'll be an expert in picking up trash.

130
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,760
You're really something.

131
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,200
Team up with me to pick up trash.

132
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
It's time to prove myself.
