1
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,120
Master!

2
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,560
How come there is a man

3
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,320
In order to stay,

4
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,160
I will be a good person.

5
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,000
If I hadn't pitied you,

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,920
out of pity,

7
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,280
would have sent you back to the galaxy.

8
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,560
I'm yours now.

9
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,040
What should I do?

10
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,680
The most important thing

11
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,600
to know

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,200
learn how to do laundry and cook,

13
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,240
and mopping the floor.

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,600
Doing chores is the same as being a human.

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,480
The days of free labor are beginning.

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,800
It looks good.

17
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,160
You did a good job.

18
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,080
I'll give you a thumbs up.

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,680
Am I in heaven now?

20
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,120
There are so many aliens.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,800
We haven't met yet.

22
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,320
Women on Earth

23
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
what a weird taste.

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,040
Don't cook anymore.

25
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,640
And only heat food.

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,040
Otherwise, we'll both be dead.

27
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,120
No, I don't want that.

28
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,080
You're a monster sent by God to punish me.

29
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,840
Help

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,640
forget about it.

31
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,040
Do what you should do.

32
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,680
Right now?

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,120
Right away.

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,760
Right away!

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,960
Something happened.

36
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,480
What are you doing?

37
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,760
Master.

38
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,720
He's sabotaging us!

39
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,880
I will eliminate him for you.

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
It hurts so much.

41
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,400
Run!

42
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,000
My Ji Erha.

43
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
Are you not in agreement with my birth chart?

44
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,080
You're staying at my house just to tear it apart, right?

45
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
What is intolerable?

46
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,680
For you to destroy them,

47
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
you are running away?

48
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,160
He looks like a human.

49
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,240
He doesn't do personnel matters.

50
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,440
You destroyed my family.

51
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,320
I will...

52
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,600
I will kill you worldwide.

53
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,320
From now on,

54
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,840
don't...

55
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,800
Don't move.

56
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,680
Comrade alien,

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,240
you can let me take you in.

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,680
But you know what,

59
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,080
we have three rules.

60
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,440
First,

61
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,680
without permission,

62
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,360
don't touch anything in this house

63
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,280
In this house.

64
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,360
Second,

65
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,320
to outsiders,

66
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,480
especially my mother.

67
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,960
You are my boyfriend,

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,840
however,

69
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,400
we have to keep our distance.

70
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,400
Third,

71
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,520
this is money you owe me.

72
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,520
That you owe me.

73
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,520
Do you agree with the above?

74
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,920
Yes.

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,920
You have to agree even if you disagree.

76
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,320
All right.

77
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,640
Let's seal the treaty.

78
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,280
No regrets.

79
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,480
Come here.

80
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,440
Give me your hand.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,440
Press your hand.

82
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,520
Alright.

83
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,960
My poor heart

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
what's going on?

85
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,200
By the way,

86
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,400
how did you know my address?

87
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,720
Do you know the GPS?

88
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,080
That's crap.

89
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,240
I am not an idiot.

90
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,520
You

91
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,800
like a pervert.
