1
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,200
DNA test successful.

2
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,320
You know how to play.

3
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,640
Little Sparrow.

4
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,000
Let go of that man and let me come.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,680
Chen Feifei.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,440
Wang Gang,

7
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,240
xiao Qiao was just abducted by a handsome guy.

8
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,000
Chase him now.

9
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,760
This isn't the first time you two went on a blind date behind my back.

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,280
It's all because all ugly men in the company...

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,560
Did you find the sparrow?

12
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,080
Got it.

13
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,560
Come on.

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,480
My leg is hurt.

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,320
I just arrived on Earth.

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,280
And I misjudged the speed.

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,920
Who the hell are you?

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,600
My name is Jin Mu.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,920
I'm from Planet Kalam.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,320
You're an alien.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,120
You from a star,

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:29,880
right.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,080
I came to look for you.

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,240
What's going on?

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,160
I don't know.

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,280
A light brush

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,320
so I hit the brake.

28
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,640
It's Sparrow.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
He's so handsome!

30
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,320
Hey!

31
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,440
Put me down quickly.

32
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,480
Her foot is hurt.

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,480
Then...

34
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,800
Handsome guy, we'll go first.

35
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,440
Tonight at Wuyi Pedestrian Street,

36
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,480
many influencers broadcast live,

37
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,920
captured this mysterious man and bright lights.

38
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,880
This place has attracted many internet celebrities all over the country.

39
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Trying to meet the mystery man again.

40
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,480
What mystery man?

41
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,080
He's such a rare handsome guy,

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,840
alright?

43
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,560
He isn't a good man.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,040
What?

45
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,960
Isn't he in the suburbs?

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,800
Why so fast?

47
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,760
You have a vision.

48
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,360
I saw him just now.

49
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,880
How are you here?

50
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,840
You are the first earthling I know.

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,320
Stop

52
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,880
you should go scourge other earthlings.

53
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,720
But I need you.

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,000
They need you more.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,480
You know what?

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
They will be looking for you.

57
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,760
They can't find me.

58
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,440
The safest place to be is in danger.

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,920
I think wherever you are

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,880
will be the most dangerous place for me.

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,120
I will come to you.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,960
What are you watching?

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,000
Here are the medicines.

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,400
The doctor said there's no problem.

65
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,120
And she can be discharged.

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,880
Little sparrow.

67
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,520
The professor assigned you a new mission.

68
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,200
Check your phone.

69
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,280
My body is weak and determined.

70
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,400
You still have to work despite being injured.

71
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,880
This is the research data on the brain-computer fusion of the primordial universe.

72
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,720
Our investors will visit the company soon.

73
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,840
What happened

74
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,040
you scared me.

75
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
What happened

76
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,360
a single trolley

77
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,960
Is he trying to frame me?

78
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,200
I almost ran into it.

79
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
To save a cat,

80
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,560
to save this cat.

81
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,640
Get away from this cat.

82
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,240
This dangerous thing will harm you.

83
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,400
Little sparrow.

84
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,400
Are you alright?

85
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,120
Luckily, he's a good driver.

86
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,840
She

87
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,000
put on another white lotus act.

88
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,680
Get out of the way.

89
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Little sparrow.

90
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,080
How come you've become such a mess?

91
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,120
Mother.

92
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,720
Why are you all here?

93
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
When mom heard that you were hurt,

94
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,480
she immediately called my son-in-law.

95
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,560
You and Xu Lai were childhood sweethearts.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You two

97
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,120
hurry up.

98
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,920
Engagement?

99
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,680
Get married,

100
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,720
and having two babies.

101
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,960
All of them.

102
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,600
Don't you know

103
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,160
I...

104
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,120
My head hurts.

105
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,840
Are you all right?

106
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,280
Aren't your feet wounded?

107
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,760
Why are you having a headache?

108
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,680
My feet hurt, too.

109
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,240
Your feet hurt.

110
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,320
It hurts so much.

111
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,200
Look at you.

112
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,520
You are addicted to drama.

113
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,560
Who knows

114
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,840
call Xu here

115
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,760
watch a movie,

116
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
for shopping?

117
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,480
Mr. Xu.

118
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,640
You have an appointment?

119
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,240
You're going to be late.

120
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,080
Cancel this for me.

121
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,200
Nothing is more important than a sparrow.

122
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,120
Come here, Xu.

123
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,040
Look at the time.

124
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,080
To settle down

125
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,680
of the two of you,

126
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,000
I can do it anytime, Aunty.

127
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,280
Why are you calling me aunty?

128
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,680
You need to call me Mom

129
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,640
to listen to me.

130
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,880
It's better than ten years' study.

131
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,800
No, hold on.

132
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
I can't.

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,720
Let's go back first.

134
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,320
Come on.

135
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,000
You don't have to pay for the car.

136
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,760
Please leave.

137
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,680
Let go of her!

138
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,040
Who are you?

139
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,880
It's me.

140
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,760
It could be her boyfriend.

141
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,160
Boyfriend?

142
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,200
Little sparrow.

143
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,360
What's your problem?

144
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,280
Explain it to me.

145
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,080
Jin Mulai.

146
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,000
What are you trying to do?

147
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,600
He wouldn't be able to come here.

148
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,720
Really an alien?

149
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,440
Why did you come to Earth?

150
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,040
I came to Earth

151
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,600
I've always

152
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,000
don't you know

153
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,000
you've brought me much trouble?

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,480
And caused me great loss.

155
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,480
I have no idea.

156
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,520
But I can help you with your work

157
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,880
and make money.

158
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,280
Alright.

159
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,880
From today on,

160
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,920
please work

161
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
to repay my debt.

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,520
Alright.

163
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,440
On one condition.

164
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
How dare you raise a condition?

165
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,000
I have nowhere to stay.

166
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,480
So?

167
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,440
That's why...

168
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,320
Let's live together.
