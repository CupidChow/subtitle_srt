1
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,480
Boss.

2
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,160
You wanted to see me?

3
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,520
What do you think of brain-computer fusion technology?

4
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,920
You mean the

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,000
of the primordial universe.

6
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,680
Right.

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,360
The concept of primordial universe is very good.

8
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,240
I've read Professor Xiao Sparrow's research report.

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,440
I've decided to invest in

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,000
Isn't it too hasty?

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,520
You should have seen that person

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,080
at the hospital gate.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,240
He said he's Xiao Sparrow's boyfriend.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,040
Boss.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
It's a good thing.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,320
I'm going to find Little Sparrow.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,480
Don't follow me.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,480
Little sparrow.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,040
There's only a sparrow in your heart.

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,880
You have superpower.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,360
I have the truth serum.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,040
Come on.

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,200
Take this.

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,440
Right.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,920
Let's come.

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,880
Have a toast.

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,360
Have a taste.

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,920
Come on.

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,840
That's right.

30
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,640
When wine is in truth, wit is out

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,520
I don't know if it works on aliens.

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,040
One more.

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,200
You can't have fish.

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,400
Your tolerance for alcohol is good.

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,760
What's

36
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,880
this thing?

37
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,280
What?

38
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,880
You're more and more beautiful to me.

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,480
That's right.

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,240
It's time.

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,360
To reveal your secrets.

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,920
Jin Mulai.

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,520
Let's play a game.

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,040
This game is

45
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,000
Is called Truth and Dare.

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,320
Where did you say you were born?

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,680
Are you trying to trick me into telling you something?

48
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,800
Stop laughing.

49
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,520
I will eat you up!

50
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,960
You

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,240
where did you learn to be so fierce?

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,240
Stop.

53
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,840
Right now,

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,040
a new flavor.

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,280
Switch to the warm man mode.

56
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,760
Activate.

57
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
The warm guy mode.

58
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,680
This is the chin.

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,160
That's your chin.

60
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,000
That's...

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,640
♪ Love your heart. ♪

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,040
I have the umbrella.

63
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,960
You have Big Head.

64
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Big head!

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,400
Don't worry about rain.

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,280
You're the one with the big head.

67
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,720
You aliens have big heads.

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,040
A woman!

69
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,280
Got in my car

70
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,640
will be mine.

71
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,560
Goodness.

72
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,400
You want a womanizer like me

73
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
lose the illusions?

74
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,200
There won't be an end to this matter.

75
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,360
You forced me.

76
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,760
If I don't do it,

77
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
second, they never stop.

78
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,120
Come on,

79
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,200
taste the water of happiness of us earthlings.

80
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,280
Cheers.

81
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,200
Watch the funny show.

82
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,280
He's screwed.

83
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,560
I fell into his hands.

84
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,080
Will it hurt you

85
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,280
will it hurt you?

86
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,280
Anyway,

87
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,880
this is my first time.

88
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,080
Be gentle with it.

89
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,400
Did it hurt?

90
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,400
It's...

91
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,640
It's alright.

92
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,760
I'll apply medicine to you first.

93
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,160
You finally look human.

94
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,280
Finally, you're here.

95
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,640
♪ Luckily I didn't give up ♪

96
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,320
Master,

97
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,080
you sing so well.

98
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,760
That's for sure.

99
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,960
Jin Mulai.

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,280
I finally see what you can do.

101
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,920
Why not

102
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,040
let's play something exciting.

103
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:05,920
Alright.

104
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,800
Step forward one more time

105
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll kill you!

106
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,480
You should do that.

107
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,280
Me too.

108
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,120
In the past,

109
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,640
In front of me.

110
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,040
And yours.

111
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,400
But I didn't cherish them.

112
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,680
Until it was gone,

113
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,280
until it was too late to regret.

114
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,160
The most painful thing in the world

115
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,960
Is this.

116
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,280
If God can give me another chance,

117
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,360
I'll say three words to that girl.

118
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,320
I...
