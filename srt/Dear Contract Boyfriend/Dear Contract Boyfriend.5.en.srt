1
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,800
Apart from that,

2
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,040
you really didn't remember anything?

3
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:44,960
Alright.

4
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,960
I'll trust you for now.

5
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,680
But I finally know your background.

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,040
This is not comfortable.

7
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,480
How...

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,120
Why can't you take off your clothes?

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,720
I will find you a dress.

10
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,000
Why is she blushing again?

11
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,280
It shouldn't be hard to look at him in this clothes.

12
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,560
Should I make it a rule not to take off clothes

13
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,040
not taking off clothes randomly?

14
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,240
The tailor makes the man.

15
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,360
The tailor makes the horse.

16
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,080
It's so pretty.

17
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,640
If we change him to be bossy by programming,

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,240
jin Mulai.

19
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,960
You can learn everything, right?

20
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,680
Certainly.

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,560
Woman,

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,080
you can only use my card.

23
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,920
Sister,

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,160
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,400
Don't be tired.

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
I'll feel bad for you.

27
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,560
What if you learn to be a domineering president?

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,520
What do you mean?

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,520
This is

30
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,840
how incredible.

31
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,360
The women on your Earth

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,560
prefer men like this.

33
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,960
I am testing you, okay?

34
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,360
Tell me now.

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,160
Can you learn from it?

36
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,760
Could you let me learn something good?

37
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,360
Think about it.

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,560
The money that you owe me,

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,520
alright?

40
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,680
Done.

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,520
Activate Alpha Mode.

42
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,320
Woman,

43
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,680
your caught my attention.

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,720
My goodness.

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
You entered the state so soon.

46
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,280
Woman.

47
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,440
Are you playing with fire?

48
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,640
Hold on.

49
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,120
This is not the script I asked for.

50
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,040
You're putting on an act?

51
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,920
How can my woman

52
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,200
a woman like me can't walk on her own feet?

53
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,520
That's a shameful line.

54
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,080
However,

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,320
I like that.

56
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,720
Why am I seeing these?

57
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,320
He's still a baby.

58
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,400
Help

59
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,520
oh, my goodness.

60
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,240
I haven't seen him for just a few days,

61
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,720
why is he suddenly paralyzed?

62
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,400
Come on.

63
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,200
That's not true.

64
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:16,920
Put me down.

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,280
Put me down.

66
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,680
Don't move.

67
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,520
Hold me tight.

68
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,760
Woman.

69
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,000
Drink more hot water.

70
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,320
Woman.

71
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,200
Slowly.

72
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,840
Don't burn yourself.

73
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,040
Come on.

74
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,400
Sample.

75
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,320
I don't believe I can't cure you.

76
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,320
That's enough.

77
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,160
If this goes on,

78
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,640
I have osteoporosis at such a young age.

79
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,440
I'm sick of it.

80
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,640
I can't eat this industrial saccharin anymore.

81
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,200
Please stop hugging me.

82
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,240
What old-fashioned trick is he playing again?

83
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,480
Brother.

84
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,720
Can't you play by common sense?

85
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,040
You're wrong.

86
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,160
Come again.

87
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,400
I don't know if she likes that overbearing president.

88
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,520
She is using a cruel trick.

89
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,560
Who can stand it?

90
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,160
Sleep mode.

91
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,640
[Loading]

92
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,800
Once in the bossy boss,

93
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,640
I'll never like the overbearing president again.

94
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,240
It seems that

95
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,840
the league has sent another alien to take me back.

96
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,600
I need to finish the task my grandpa entrusted me with.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,280
What else are you hiding from me?

98
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,360
I hope that guy

99
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,640
won't cause me any more trouble.

100
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,600
A safe landing.

101
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,600
Arrive at the earth safely.
