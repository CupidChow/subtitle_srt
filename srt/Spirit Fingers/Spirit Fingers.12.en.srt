You'd pop up out of nowhere at school,

U Yeon said that.

8
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,933
Why should I know everything that happens to her?

9
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,160

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,667

00:01:05,888 --> 00:01:07,700
just wait.

13
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:11,467

Don't grow up, Gi Jeong.

17
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,067
Don't be like that.

Hey, Gi Jeong.

29
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:08,767
He went to meet a friend. He's late.

U Yeon, you...

31
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,800
You're not distracted these days, right?

32

No.

What are you talking about?

38
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:30,800
You need to eat well so your brain works.
The math competition is right around the corner.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,833
Song U Dol.

40
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,033
Come sit here.

41
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,667
Pick up your spoon.

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,367
Song U Dol!

43
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:44,733
Why? You're scaring him.

44
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:45,900
You're the problem.

45
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,467
Why do you keep hovering over the kids? Seriously?

46
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:53,467
Not just one, both of them.

47
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:58,667
I can't take this.

48
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,800
Is something wrong?

49
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:12,533
When you scold kids, you need to be firm.

50
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,067
You could have just said it nicely.

51
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,667
Did something happen at school?

52
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,033
You're wondering if I failed

53
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,167

54
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,267
What? Why would you say that?

55
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:25,500
I didn't say anything.

56
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,833
Don't I know you?

57
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,800
You ask the same roundabout question
every year. It drives me crazy.

58
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,733
I'm frustrated because every year
you get so close, yet it keeps slipping away.

59
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:36,600
You think doing social life is

60
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,208
as easy as you make it sound?

61
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,567
Is it that easy?

62
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:44,100
Well, I guess someone who stays
home all day wouldn't know.

63
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,700
Just focus on the kids.

64
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,567
And stop stressing me out.

65
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:51,567
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:55,300
Dad was mad at me,
but he wrongly took it out on you.

67
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:57,376
No,

68
00:03:57,376 --> 00:03:59,100
Mom told Dad to do that.

69
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,100
What?

70
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,967
It's all because Mom is
controlling him from behind.

71
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:05,900
I really hate Mom.

72
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,000
U Dol, don't say that...

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,533
You don't like Mom either.

74
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,300
Why pretend you do?

75
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:24,733
You haven't seen Geu Rin lately, right?

76
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:26,800
You two still haven't made up?

77
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
We have.

78
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,900
Geu Rin said she wants to meet
after she settles something.

79
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,500
What is it?

80
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,533
Acaprio.

81
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:37,600
Huh?

82
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,500
Maybe I should've said I'd take care of it.

83
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,633
You don't trust her?

84
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,233
No.

85
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,267
Of course, I don't like it. How could I?

86
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:50,400
Whatever the reason is, why would I
be happy about them meeting?

87
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:55,667
I guess she's just trying to tie up loose ends.

88
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:58,433
Maybe that's something she needs.

89
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:05,367
U Dol, let's hurry. We'll be late.

90
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,133
Why rush so much?

91
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,367
Just to get used to the test environment.

92
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:11,133
U Dol.

93
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:15,700
Let's go, let's go.

94
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,200
Oh, U Seok, heading out?

95
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,933
Yes, to the library.

96
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:20,033
I'll be back.

97
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,967
I'll drive you to the library.

98
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:23,600
No need.

99
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,767
Look at your brother.

100
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,500
Don't you realize anything?

101
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:34,167
U Dol, let's go together.

102
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,033
Your classes end early today?

103
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:38,667
Dad's coming home early. Come straight back.

104
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,400
- Hey, Song.
- Se...

105
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,767
Why didn't you call me?

106
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:04,300
No, I was about to call you anyway.

107
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,333
I did it first.

108
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,500
No, I called first. I even got to 'Se.'

109
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,300
That means I started first.
You didn't finish my name.

110
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,333
That's unfair.

111
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,100
You shortened mine to just 'Song.'

112
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,867
Then call me 'Sel' or something.

113
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:18,233
You guys are so childish, seriously.

114
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:20,800
Picking a fight on purpose
doesn't really work, huh?

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,967
Hey, let's go. Come on.

116
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:27,300
Germany?

117
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,500
Why tell me now? Why am I
the only one who didn't know?

118
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,633
- You didn't tell me either.
- Hey.

119
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:34,467
No, scratch that.

120
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:38,800
I was going to tell you.

121
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,133
You were already so upset
because of your mom, so I put it off.

122
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,600
I genuinely knew nothing about this.

124
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,367
Hey, don't cry.

125
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,933
I already cried everything out earlier.

126
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,400
If you start over, I'll have to cry again.

127
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,100
What am I supposed to do?

128
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,300
What do you mean?

129
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,100
Do I have a terminal illness or something?

130
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,400
It's not like I'll live there forever.

131
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,367
We might not adjust and come back in a month.

132
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:02,400
No.

133
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,267
I feel like you'll end up marrying
some German guy and living there for generations.

134
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:08,500
What? Why would I live there?

135
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,667
I'm a descendant of Dangun, you know.

136
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,867
I just want to try living with Mom.

137
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,733
I'll live with her as long as I did with Dad.

138

By the time this passes, we'll be adults, right?

139
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:25,867
Able to make our own choices
and take responsibility for them.

140
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:28,533
Yes, Se Ra.

141
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:32,633
Until then, avoid boys! I mean it, no dating!

142
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:34,900
Just focus on studying like now.

143
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,000
- Just studying.
- Yeah.

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,467

Yes, teacher. Hello.

00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:04,867
What? He didn't show up? What do you mean?

148
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:09,376
But I

149
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:12,467
clearly saw him enter the exam hall.

150
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:14,067
What happened?

151
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,100
- Mom.
- U Yeon.

152
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,767
Did you see U Dol on your way here?

153
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:25,233
Huh? U Dol?

154
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:26,733
They said U Dol never entered the exam room.

155
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,333
What?

156
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,033
U Dol!

157
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:33,633
U Dol!

158
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:36,600
Where have you been? Huh?

159
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,633
Where were you all this time?

160
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,000
U Dol.

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,333
Explain everything to me.

162
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,733
You wouldn't do this without a reason.

163
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:49,700
I don't want to talk about it.

164
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,600
Was it that Min Ho again?

165
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,000
Did he bully you again? Hit you?

166
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,233
This won't do. Let's go to the hospital.

167
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:07,667
Why?

168
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:10,633
Afraid I'll get brain damage and can't study?

169
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,867
Worried I'll embarrass you?

170
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:15,667
That's all that matters to you, isn't it?

171
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,433
U Dol, what's wrong?

172
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,800
What do you mean?

173
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,600
He learned this all from you.

174
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,933
- Me what?
- You as his older sister,

175
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:24,967
talk back to me, lie,

176
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,400
sneak around, and join weird clubs.

177
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
That's good behavior?

178
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,733
You're the one who lied first.

179
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,033
What?

180
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,067
Why? What's going on?

181
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:37,967
Uh, it's nothing.

182
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,867
Your ballet career was all fake.

183
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:43,133
You're the fraudster, so why blame me?

184
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,500
And,

185
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,100
you will abandon me if I fail studies, right?

186
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,933
Like how you tore U Yeon's drawing,
you'll discard me too, right?

187
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:53,533
How could you say that, U Dol?

188
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,600
Song U Dol.

189
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,633
How dare you speak to Mom like this?

190
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:58,933
Honey, don't shout at the kids.

191
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,633
You, move aside.

192
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,533
Apologize to your mom right now.

193
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,433
Now!

194
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:08,400
You have no right to scold me.

195
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,067
You ignore us and constantly blame Mom.

196
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:12,533
- What did you say?
- Let's go inside, U Dol.

197
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,700
I read about guys like you in books.

198
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,267
Because they're looked down on in society,

199
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:19,633
they act scary at home
and take out their anger on family.

200
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:21,333
You're a coward.

201
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:24,500
This punk, seriously.

202
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,800
Calm down, Dad.

203
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,400
U Seok, move aside.

204
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:30,700
- Move aside!
- Stop this!

205
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,800
Ah, these darn kids, seriously.

206
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,933
Honey. Stop, why are you doing this?

207
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:40,133
<i>All this time, I thought that without me,</i>

208
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:43,400
<i>our family would be perfect.</i>

209
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,920
<i>That was</i>

210
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,967
<i>my perfect delusion.</i>

211
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:50,533
<i>Everyone was wearing masks.</i>

212
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:52,448
<i>Even my</i>

213
00:10:52,448 --> 00:10:54,367
<i>seemingly perfect brother.</i>

214
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,700
I'll be back.

215
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:20,600
What? He's not here yet?

216
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,267
Anyone here?

217
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,967
Director.

218
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,900
What's with that look?

219
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,267
Don't you remember?

220
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:46,067
It's the outfit I wore when we first met.

221
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,800
Rin Rin's favorite.

222
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,267
I told you not to call me that.

223
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:53,333
- Where is the Director?
- The Director

224
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,100
is stuck in traffic and running late.

225
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,533
Oh, he's late?

226
00:11:57,533 --> 00:12:00,467
While we wait, let's catch up
and reminisce about old times.

227
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:03,000
You can talk about old stories all by yourself.

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,933
Even though I knew it was all talk,
the reason I came willingly was...

229
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,533
Wait.

230
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,633
Let's rewind to the past.

231
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:32,467
It was all my fault. Forgive me, okay?

232
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,733
It's okay. Anyone could've made that mistake.

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,864
Will you

234
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:43,367
forgive me too?

235
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:45,000
For what?

236
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,400
You still cut people off, huh?

237
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,733
Anyway, let me finish.

238
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:02,467
Even though I knew it was all talk,
the reason I came willingly was

239
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:04,267
to reassure my man.

240
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:07,100
- What?
- I didn't date Seon Ho out of loneliness.

241
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,767
Even when dating you, Seon Ho always came first.

242
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:14,100
Then and now, you can't beat Koo Seon Ho.

243
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,900
Hey, Nam Geu Rin.

244
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,700
Hey, Nam Geu Rin!

245
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:36,167
Koo Seon Ho, what are you doing here?

246
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:38,167
I'm on emergency standby.

247
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,400
Come here.

248
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,100
I'm here. What now?

249
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:53,600
I missed you.

250
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:58,267
Me too.

251
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:07,500
I did as Pink said.

252
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,300
I proudly declared that I came to reassure my man.

253
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,167
I was really pathetic, huh?

254
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,533
Why did I act that way?

255
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:19,000
So embarrassing.

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,800
I'll keep it to myself.

257
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,000
But seriously, why did you?

258
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,733
Unlike your usual self.

259
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,133
The sorrow of unrequited love, I guess.

260
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,133
Unrequited love?

261
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,533
You've gotten bold, Koo Seon Ho.

262
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,933
I've liked you for a long time.

263
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:34,533
What?

264
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:38,600
Hey, why didn't you come yesterday?

265
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,133
You can't skip out like that.

266
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,200
Yesterday was my dad's memorial.

267
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,333
Oh, the memorial...

268
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,933
What?

269
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:51,533
My father passed away last year.

270
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:53,153
You...

271
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:56,167
Are you okay?

272
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:58,067
Yeah, I'm fine.

273
00:14:58,067 --> 00:15:00,300
Why are you crying?

274
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,067
Liar.

275
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,033
I'm sad too.

276
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:08,800
It must've been harder hiding your pain.

277
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:14,500
I'll take better care of you, Seon Ho.

278
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,100
Hey, I said don't cry.

279
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,433
I think that's when it started.

280
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:33,920
When I

281
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,800
started liking you.

282
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:39,967
Why? Why didn't you say anything?

283
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,700
Why would I?

284
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,000
I was afraid you'd reject me.

285
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,600
- What?
- You get it now, right?

286
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,633
It's been a long time for me.

287
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:03,867
U Seok!

288
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,000
I wanted to take photos.

289
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,400
Huh?

290
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,733
I want to go to Africa

291
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:19,367
and photograph zebras and lions,

292
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:22,533
and in the desert, the stars too.

293
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,767
What's this?

294
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,433
You know National Geographic?

295
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:36,000
Getting my photos published there

296
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,767
was my dream.

297
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,832
I thought

298
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:44,467
you'd be the first in our family to gain freedom.

299
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:45,856
Because

300
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:48,233
I'm the least capable one.

301
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:51,033
No one is incapable.

302
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:53,733
You just are yourself.

303
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:55,767
Do what you want.

304
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,600
But be smart about it.

305
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,967
Why aren't you meeting your boyfriend
who acts like a friend?

306
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,567
Did you fight?

307
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,767
Not exactly...

308
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,667
Whatever it is, don't drag it out too long.

309
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,100
Or it might really end that way.

310
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:14,000
I'll head to the lab.

311
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,633
You go ahead.

312
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,233
U Seok.

313
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,433
Take care.

314
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:24,900
You'll come next week?

315
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:29,800
Yeah.

316
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:55,033
U Dol.

317
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,633
Huh?

318
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,000
U Dol!

319
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,033
U Dol, are you there?

320
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,967
Huh?

321
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,200
Mom.

322
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,400
Yeah, why?

323
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,200
Where's U Dol?

324
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,067
He's probably in his room.

325
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:36,000
He's gone. He's nowhere in the house.

326
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,767
It's so noisy, ugh.

327
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,533
Hey, Gi Jeong.

328
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:52,633
Hey, it's an emergency.

329
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,800
- What's wrong?
- Something's up at your girlfriend's place.

330
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,300
The kid ran away.

331
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,900
What?

332
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,433
Bong Gu...

333
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,833
<i>Hello?</i>

334
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,467
Brother-in-law!

335
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:24,767
What?

336
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:27,067
<i>Uh, well...</i>

337
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,833
There's something I need to tell you...

338
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:29,967
<i>Lies.</i>

339
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,733
<i>You called after hearing about me, right?</i>

340
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,600
I'm not coming back, so hang up.

341
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,267
You don't have to come back.
Just hear me out, okay?

342
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,333
What is it?

343
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:43,367
About U Yeon!

344
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:44,600
<i>If you leave home,</i>

345
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,100
I might have to break up with U Yeon too.

346
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,833
Why?

347
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,733
She'd be better off without me.

348
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:53,267
No, that's not true. You know?

349
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:54,300
Let's meet up real quick.

350
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,200
Can you give me some advice before leaving?

351
00:19:58,133 --> 00:19:59,500
<i>Brother-in-law, huh?</i>

352
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,600
At least give me a word before you go, right?

353
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:07,367
Fine.

354
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:09,933
<i>I'll text you, so come there.</i>

355
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,712
But

356
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,333
don't tell anyone, okay?

357
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,000
Of course, no problem.

358
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,800
You're busy too, right?

359
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,133
10 minutes. Just 10 minutes.

360
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
Okay.

361
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,600
You were spouting nonsense. Did it work?

362
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,067
Yeah, luckily it's not far. I'll be back.

363
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:42,067
Does that even make sense?

364
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,400
It actually worked?

365
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,300
<i>The subscriber you have dialed is not available.
You'll be connected to the voice mail.</i>

366
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,367
His phone's off. Even the tracking app's disabled.

367
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,167
Did you find him?

368
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:04,067
Not here.

369
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:07,167
No, he hasn't come home yet.

370
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,300
Yes.

371
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:12,833
Yes.

372
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,967
What did Dad say?

373
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:17,800
He's checking the next complex.

374
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,067
Twice a day? What's going on?

375
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:27,933
Who's U Dol's best friend?

376
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,400
U Dol.

377
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,400
Bong Gu.

378
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,167
Why do you keep falling?

379
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:55,800
It's an unknown number.

380
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,567
Don't answer those.

381
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,033
Okay.

382
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:07,900
They hung up.

383
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,533
Huh?

384
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:13,567
[Slide to power off]

385
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,167
Here.

386
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,833
What?

387
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:21,667
<i>The subscriber you have dialed has powered off.
You'll be connected to the voice mail.</i>

388
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:24,700
It's off.

389
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:33,433
Where's Bong Gu's house?

390
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:34,700
U Dol.

391
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,533
Why did you run from the exam?

392
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,167
I hated it.

393
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:43,600
I hate exams too.

394
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:47,133
Bong Gu.

395
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,533
I came to say goodbye.

396
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:53,633
I'm leaving home.

397
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:56,667
Who'll take care of you?

398
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,200
I don't need anyone.

399
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,333
I'm smart. So I'll grow up on my own.

400
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,367
I can do it.

401
00:23:02,367 --> 00:23:03,367
But...

402
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:05,533
Just anywhere but home.

403
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:07,333
I hate seeing everyone.

404
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,833
Wanna come with me?

405
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:11,867
Huh?

406
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:16,033
No. Grandma would be sad.

407
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,400
I was just saying.

408
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,933
Why isn't he coming?

409
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,100
I need to hurry.

410
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,100
Who?

411
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,133
Giant creep.

412
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:34,267
He says he wants to discuss
something about my sister.

413
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:40,100
Try it. It's fun.

414
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:43,933
So childish.

415
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:55,333
<i>But don't tell anyone, okay?</i>

416
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,100
Ugh, this little punk.

417
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,733
Alright?

418
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:03,433
More! More!

419
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:08,928
One,

420
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:11,136
two,

421
00:24:11,136 --> 00:24:12,567
three!

422
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,267
Bong Gu!

423
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:20,300
Bong Gu!

424
00:24:20,933 --> 00:24:24,100
Bong Gu!

425
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:33,600
Are you okay, brother-in-law?

426
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:45,067
Bong Gu!

427
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,733
Bong Gu!

428
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:48,400
Bong Gu!

429
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,567
He's okay.

430
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:15,500
It's just minor bruises.

431
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,700
He fainted from shock briefly.

432
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,467
Bong Gu's grandma said he's fine too.

433
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:24,233
Because of me, Bong Gu...

434
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:27,567
It's not your fault, okay?

435
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:31,833
Let's go.

436
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:34,333
Bong Gu is waiting.

437
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,967
Come.

438
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:43,400
This darn kid, seriously.

439
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,100
U Dol.

440
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,767
I'm sorry.

441
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:57,600
It's all because of my kid. I'm sorry.

442
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,167
It's alright.

443
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:02,033
Kids can get hurt while playing.

444
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:03,680
But

445
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,633
he was really shocked earlier.

446
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:09,367
His face turned completely pale.

447
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,667
U Dol.

448
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,000
We are not scolding you.

449
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,033
Come here, okay?

450
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:15,800
U Dol, Song U Dol.

451
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,567
U Dol.

452
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:20,200
U Dol.

453
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:28,033
U Dol, Mom was wrong.

454
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:30,267
I won't do it again.

455
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:37,033
Come to Mommy, sweetie.

456
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,067
Mom.

457
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,467
Mom.

458
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,767
I'm sorry for hurting you.

459
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,467
By the way,

460
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:04,767
where did that boy go?

461
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:08,133
That tall student who saved the kids.

462
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:11,300
Oh, right. Where did he go?

463
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,600
We didn't even get to thank him.

464
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,867
- Grandma.
- Yes?

465
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:19,833
He's not just the tall student,
he's U Dol's brother-in-law...

466
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,367
Huh?

467
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:23,900
We could've been in big trouble without him.

468
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,300
He even took them to
the hospital. We're so grateful.

469
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,600
I should thank him.

470
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,800
Exactly.

471
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,967
Did he just leave?

472
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:37,067
U Yeon, where are you going?

473
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:38,833
Go. What?

474
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,633
What are you doing?

475
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:46,272
Oh.

476
00:27:46,272 --> 00:27:47,680
Huh?

477
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,133
Mom, Dad.

478
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:54,667
He's not just some passing student.

479
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,733
He's my boyfriend.

480
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:02,300
- What?
- What?

481
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,667
Gi Jeong, say hello.

482
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:05,700
These are my parents.

483
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,112
Oh.

484
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,967
Hello.

485
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:10,333
I'm Nam Gi Jeong.

486
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,167
Brother-in-law.

487
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,600
What are you saying right now?

488
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,400
You...

489
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,767
Gi Jeong.

490
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:19,800
You!

491
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,833
Run!

492
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,633
- Huh?
- Hey, hey!

493
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:25,433
Song U Yeon! Song U Yeon!

494
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:27,067
Hey, you punk!

495
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:30,567
Bro-in-law! Bye!

496
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:31,600
What did you say?

497
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,867
<i>♫ I was searching for something precious ♫</i>

498
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:42,367
<i>♫ While losing what matters most ♫</i>

499
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:49,567
<i>♫ This misunderstood heart of mine ♫</i>

500
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:56,533
<i>♫ No one could embrace it ♫</i>

501
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,800
<i>♫ The excitement I feel ♫</i>

502
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,433
<i>♫ Everything about you ♫</i>

503
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:10,400
<i>♫ Even dreaming feels miraculous ♫</i>

504
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:16,900
<i>♫ You make me understand ♫</i>

505
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:26,600
<i>♫ Oh, she's flying ♫</i>

506
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:33,433
<i>♫ Oh, she's flying ♫</i>

507
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:53,933
<i>♫ Oh, she's flying ♫</i>

508
00:29:55,133 --> 00:30:00,833
<i>♫ Oh, she's flying ♫</i>

509
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,033
Jonathan.

510
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,333
Bigfoot.

511
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,833
Cute.

512
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:16,833
What brings you here at this hour?

513
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,400
We're currently rebelling.

514
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:23,133
Rebelling?

515
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:24,567
Perfect timing.

516
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:27,067
Can you watch the shop for a bit?

517
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:29,367
- About 30 minutes.
- Okay.

518
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:31,400
Alright, let's go, Bigfoot.

519
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,067
Take care. Bye.

520
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:35,700
Bye.

521
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,467
This is where you wanted to come?

522
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:44,633
I thought I'd never see this place again.

523
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:46,233
And now?

524
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,833
Fight.

525
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:50,433
Fight!

526
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,233
I'm sorry.

527
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,633
Me too.

528
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:10,900
What did you do?

529
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,633
All the things that upset you.

530
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:15,033
I wasn't upset.

531
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,867
It's just me being petty.

532
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:21,400
Because you like me,

533
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:25,100
I felt like I'm actually a decent person.

534
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,267
And as time went on,

535
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:30,167
I think my greed grew bigger.

536
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,300
I'm sorry

537
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:37,167
for making it hard on you.

538
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,200
You are a good person,

539
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,367
and it's okay to want more.

540
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:49,733
In my whole life,

541
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:53,033
I've never really cared deeply about anyone.

542
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:58,600
So, you can imagine how flustered
I was because of you at first.

543
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,933
I find myself caring anew,

544
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:03,333
feeling happy anew,

545
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,300
feeling uneasy anew.

546
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:08,767
Anyway,

547
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:11,100
everything with you is a first for me.

548
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:42,567
Again, again!

549
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:44,500
Is this your 'I like you' face?

550
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,467
Gi Jeong.

551
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Get up.

552
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,433
Huh?

553
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,600
Gi Jeong, that's right.

554
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,633
I...

555
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,700

Cool, good.

566
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,300
This is weird. Why is he working so hard?

567
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,700
He didn't lose his temper with the boss today.

568
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,100
And he even got an offer from an agency.

569
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,733
So I guess he's not an amateur anymore, huh?

570
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:03,100
Kinda feels like he's actually a celebrity.

571
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:06,533
I feel a bit off.

572
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:07,567
Why?

573
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:10,267
Seeing that guy I always
hang out with working so hard

574
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:14,067
makes me feel like I should do something too.

575
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:16,833
Don't you feel that way?

576
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:19,500
Exactly.

577
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
It's so unfair that he's the only one doing well.

578
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,733
Want to see?

579
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:24,367

Yeah.

583
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,967
Heard you're going to Germany.

584
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:55,733
It's awkward.

585
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,733
We're not close enough for a heartfelt goodbye,

586
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:04,067
but if I let you go without saying
anything, I'll regret it forever.

587
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,800
Regret?

588
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,600
Yeah.

589
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,233
I'll regret it for ages.

590
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:13,367
Like 'I should've said something back then.'

591
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,067
If you speak up now, you will really regret it.

592
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:19,833
Probably.

593
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:26,033
Either way, am I just left as a pathetic guy?

But come back.

597
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,333
I'll start over from that moment.

598
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:05,667
What? You're not coming back?

599
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,933
Take care.

It's me.

He's just a middle schooler.
How good-looking can he be?

614
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:05,033
Stop chatting and start drawing.

Hey!

Oh, U Seok.

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,033
I'm waiting. Where are you now?

638
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,667
So which school does he go to?

00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:21,367
Not 'him,' Gi Jeong. Nam Gi Jeong.

Got it, got it. So which school?

641
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:26,967
- He goes to Chiwon High.
- Chiwon High?

642
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:28,600
Are you insane?

643
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,133
What?

644
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:31,800
What's wrong with Chiwon High?

645
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,233
What do his parents do?

646
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Right.

647
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,900
No sane parent would send
their kid to Chiwon High.

648
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,633
What's so great about our family?

649
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:51,000
Our family's the messed-up one.

650
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,767
What are you talking about...

651
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,533
Yeah.

652
00:39:55,533 --> 00:39:56,900
I'm not fit to be your mother, am I?

653
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,200
I spoke out of line.

654
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,133
That's not what I meant. Why are you...

655
00:40:00,133 --> 00:40:01,300
That's not what you meant?

656
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,600
You found my weakness. You should use it now.

657
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:09,533
I wish I could do that too.

658
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:12,067
But I can't.

659
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:14,267
I keep wondering why you did it,
and what your story was.

660
00:40:14,267 --> 00:40:16,400
The worry comes first.

661
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,733
It's unfair to me too.

662
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:22,100
I want to hate you with all my heart, but I can't.

663
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,400
You treat me differently and push me away,

664
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,824
but I can't bring myself to hate you.

665
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:27,433
It's so unfair.

666
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,033
U Yeon.

667
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:03,967
I did it all for your own good.

668
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:06,400
Do you really think I did it out of hate?

669
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:10,033
What does 'doing well' even mean?

670
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:11,800
Everything's according to your standards.

671
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,700
Then what are your standards?

672
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,067
Let's hear how great they are.

673
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,248

while painting what I love.

675
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:25,533
That's just naive talk.

676
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,267
You think doing what you love

677
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:31,400
makes everyone happy, huh?

678
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,067
Were you unhappy doing ballet?

679
00:41:35,433 --> 00:41:36,533
Let's drop that topic.

680
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:39,667
No, I want to hear it.

681
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:43,800
You don't want U Dol to keep
misunderstanding either, huh?

682
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:54,567
I had talent for ballet,

683
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,633
so I enjoyed it at first.

684
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:01,367
Felt proud when others envied me.

685
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:04,833
Then one day,

686
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:09,800
a girl too poor to buy ballet shoes
joined our academy.

687
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,600
<i>I gave her my old shoes when I bought new ones.</i>

688
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:18,267
Can I really take these?

689
00:42:18,267 --> 00:42:20,800
Yeah, I got new ones.

690
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,933
Thank you so much.

691
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:25,333
But you won't last in ballet.

692
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,400
It costs too much money.

693
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,500
Even my mom nags about it daily.

694
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,400
Yeah, I know it too.

695
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,167
But I'll never give up.

696
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:38,433
<i>It was fun seeing Seung Hee think that way.</i>

697
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,733
Now, the next demo...

698
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:43,900
Hey, they're calling you.

699
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,833
Seung Hee, try it.

700
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,000
Me?

701
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,433
<i>That day I tasted humiliation for the first time.</i>

702
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:59,233
'Living happily doing what you love'?

703
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:04,800
That's only for the talented ones.

704
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,200
So, you quit?

705
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,200
Couldn't even quit properly.

706
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,633
My grandparents vehemently opposed it,

707
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:19,133
so I kept following that girl's footsteps
until she joined a company.

708
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,967
So, you did join a ballet company.

709
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,567
Then, you quit after you got injured, right?

710
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,200
No.

711
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:30,500
Seung Hee was the one who got hurt.

712
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,167
Huh?

713
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:35,700
The power went out during rehearsal,
and there was an accident.

714
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,633
Suddenly I, the second-best, got framed.

715
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:42,300
Coincidentally, my father's business collapsed,

716
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,267
so I quit ballet without hesitation.

717
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,133
Why let people misunderstand?
Don't you feel wronged?

718
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:54,333
Better to be seen as a villain than pitied.

719
00:43:56,633 --> 00:44:00,233
You enjoy hearing this pathetic story?

720
00:44:00,233 --> 00:44:04,200
No one would believe the truth anyway.
A cool lie's better.

721
00:44:06,567 --> 00:44:08,467
I believe you.

722
00:44:08,467 --> 00:44:11,300
And I prefer the 'pathetic' version anyway.

723
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:14,100
You are really saying something dangerous.

724
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,200
What exactly did you hear?

725
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,567
I said it's tough.

726
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:20,400
Someone as soft as you couldn't handle it.

727
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,067
I'm not soft at all anymore.

728
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:25,033
If you and Dad object,
I'll just skip college and keep drawing.

729
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:26,600
Work part-time to become independent.

730
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,233
And keep dating Gi Jeong too.

731
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,633
See?

732
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:32,767
Now I even talk back to you properly.

733
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:35,133
Jeez, you really...

734
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:37,267
Let's just stop talking.

735
00:44:37,267 --> 00:44:40,967
Who did you get your stubbornness from?

736
00:44:40,967 --> 00:44:42,300
I got it from you.

737
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,100
Don't be like me!

738
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,533
But I want to.

739
00:44:47,533 --> 00:44:50,800
I'm your daughter. I take after you.

740
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
And I'll live like you.

741
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,000
So,

742
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,784
from now on, live splendidly.

743
00:44:58,784 --> 00:45:00,467
Okay, Mom?

744
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:02,133
Let's do that.

745
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,400
I get it, now let go.

746
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,400
I won't let go.

747
00:45:08,267 --> 00:45:09,533
Let go now.

748
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:11,933
It's ticklish, U Yeon.

749
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:15,200
Ah, why?

750
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,100
I'm hungry.

751
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,200
Why did you leave in the middle of eating?

752
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,700
Byeon Soon.

753
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:35,500
When Gi Jeong smashed this,

754
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:39,800
he destroyed our glorious childhood memories too.

755
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,000
Watching Gi Jeong grow up
is so painfully exhausting.

756
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,567
Don't grow up.

757
00:45:46,733 --> 00:45:48,867
Dae O, think of it this way.

758
00:45:48,867 --> 00:45:52,033
The more mature Gi Jeong gets,
the fatter our wallets become.

759
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:53,833
He'll introduce us to
pretty girlfriends too, right?

760
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:55,633
Since he's mature now.

761
00:45:57,833 --> 00:46:00,533
- Girlfriends?
- Yeah.

762
00:46:00,533 --> 00:46:02,633
So,

763
00:46:02,633 --> 00:46:06,633
let's throw away this junk
and prepare for a new era.

764
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:12,333
- New era!
- Yeah, new era!

765
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:18,900
Ah, Gi Jeong.

766
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,267
Respect the new era.

767
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,033
Excuse me.

768
00:46:27,133 --> 00:46:28,900
Over here.

769
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:30,700
This one here.

770
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,333
This one?

771
00:46:33,633 --> 00:46:35,300
These are the repair experts.

772
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,533
I searched the whole country to find them.

773
00:46:38,533 --> 00:46:40,512
- Look at this thing.
- Huh?

774
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,900
This is completely ruined.

775
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,100
This won't be easy.

776
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,424
Huh?

777
00:46:47,424 --> 00:46:48,533
Can't fix it?

778
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:50,567
There's nothing we can't fix.

779
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:53,467
The only thing we can't fix
is someone's personality.

780
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:55,300
Bro?

781
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,833
- Let's go.
- Wait!

782
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,567
No, no.

783
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:00,900
I'm sorry.

784
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,833
I almost destroyed our childhood memories.

785
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:05,000
Don't worry.

786
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,133
I'll never change.

787
00:47:07,133 --> 00:47:09,233
Never! Never! Never!

788
00:47:09,233 --> 00:47:12,200
Snap out of it!

789
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,100
Sir! Don't fix that!

790
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,200
Just throw it away.

791
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,167
It's a new era now!

792
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,500
New era?

793
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,833
<i>We returned to our daily lives.</i>

794
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,267
<i>This thought came later.</i>

795
00:47:42,267 --> 00:47:44,367
<i>When Delulu returned,</i>

796
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:46,900
<i>she seemed more childish than me somehow.</i>

797
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,000
<i>Or had I outgrown Delulu in that time?</i>

798
00:47:51,967 --> 00:47:55,233
<i>Delulu left again.</i>

799
00:47:58,567 --> 00:47:59,633
Oh, my.

800
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:04,133
Oh my, oh dear, such a big one on Mom's back...

801
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:07,433
<i>Feeling guilty about what he said to Mom,</i>

802
00:48:07,433 --> 00:48:09,633
<i>U Dol didn't try to leave.</i>

803
00:48:09,633 --> 00:48:11,267
<i>Eventually,</i>

804
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:16,367
<i>he became a pampered kid

805
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:27,233
<i>Mom let me keep attending SF meetings.</i>

806
00:48:27,233 --> 00:48:28,600
<i>That wasn't all.</i>

807
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,600
I'll be back.

808
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,367
U Yeon, wait.

809
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,133
Today's your academy payment deadline, right?

810
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:37,700
Pay in three monthly installments.

811
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,267
Mom!

812
00:48:39,267 --> 00:48:43,867
Register, change the canvas, and get new brushes.

813
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,833
Thank you.

814
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:50,633
<i>She kept saying I'd never
get into SNU with my art skills,</i>

815
00:48:50,633 --> 00:48:52,867
<i>yet enrolled me in art academy.</i>

816
00:48:52,867 --> 00:48:54,000
- This?
- Yeah.

817
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,600
There.

818
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,467
What kind of safe is this?

819
00:48:59,467 --> 00:49:00,767
- Dad!
- What?

820
00:49:00,767 --> 00:49:02,900
You should untie it and throw it away.

821
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,467
Why tie it up if you're just gonna undo it?

822
00:49:05,467 --> 00:49:07,500
You were the one who tied it up.

823
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,000
My hands got dirty.

824
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:32,700
Bye.

825
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:47,167
<i>Se Ra left for Germany with her mom,</i>

826
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,933

a 'promising rough diamond',</i>

828

Oh, my ball, my ball!

837
00:50:52,033 --> 00:50:53,900
Strike!

838
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:57,800
Even with our sports theme,

839
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,567
indoor ball games are forbidden.

840
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:01,600
Sorry.

841
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,100
Everyone, look here.

842
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:08,100
Our Red got cast in a project.

843
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,400
Hey, you Green Pig!

844
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,133
Why? This is good news.

845
00:51:11,133 --> 00:51:13,233
Every audition, he was criticized for bad acting,

846
00:51:13,233 --> 00:51:14,933
so he gritted his teeth and practiced acting.

847
00:51:14,933 --> 00:51:15,967
Seriously, why are you telling them?

848
00:51:15,967 --> 00:51:17,667
What's the role?

849
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:19,033
A convenience store part-timer.

850
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:21,467
He gets two whole lines.

851
00:51:21,467 --> 00:51:23,000
Two whole lines?

852
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,100
Song U Yeon.

853
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,133
Not you too...

854
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:27,833
- Wow, congrats.
- Congratulations.

855
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:31,333
A handsome convenience store worker
should trend online for sure.

856
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,367
Oh, I want your autograph first.

857
00:51:33,367 --> 00:51:35,000
I should get it before anyone else.

858
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,233
Address all requests to me.

859
00:51:36,233 --> 00:51:38,133
I'm Gi Jeong's manager now.

860
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,533
Huh? Khaki?

861
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:43,033
You styled your hair?

862
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,600
Ah, yes. For a blind date.

863
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,700
Blind date?

864
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,233
- Yes
- Since when?

865
00:51:47,233 --> 00:51:49,500
I should do it too. Dating.

866
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:53,567
Today's main character is late.

867
00:51:53,567 --> 00:51:55,167
He said he had to stop somewhere first.

868
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:57,333
He's not getting a buzzcut, is he?

869
00:51:57,333 --> 00:51:59,367
- No way.
- What?

870
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:01,767
No way!

871
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:03,933
You can't stop him now.

872
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,333
Geu Rin, where are you going?

873
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:34,100
Seon Ho, your hair...

874
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:48,167
You haven't cut it yet?

875
00:52:52,033 --> 00:52:53,533
What? Why are you crying?

876
00:52:53,533 --> 00:52:58,567
Black said you're getting a military haircut.

877
00:52:58,567 --> 00:53:02,133
It makes enlistment feel real.

878
00:53:02,133 --> 00:53:05,567
That you're actually enlisting.

879
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:08,200
Why the tears?

880
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,000
Don't cry, okay?

881
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,267
I'll wait for you this time.

882
00:53:13,267 --> 00:53:15,400
I'm a loyal girlfriend.

883
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:23,500
What're you doing? What if someone sees?

884
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,133
What do I do if I miss you?

885
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,767
What's this? What? What!

886
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:33,100
What are you doing? No, no.

887
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,033
No, no.

888
00:53:35,033 --> 00:53:36,667
This isn't right.

889
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:46,467
Ugh, ruined it.

890
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,333
Just redraw it, no big deal.

891
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:07,733
I don't know how to play golf.

892
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,767
The ball came to me!

893
00:54:14,767 --> 00:54:16,400
Stay back.

894
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:19,767
Red's changed a lot too, huh?

895
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:21,267
- Yeah
- True.

896
00:54:21,267 --> 00:54:22,967
Speaking of which,

897
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:25,467
the first time I saw him, he was really scary.

898
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:29,667
He was scarier in middle school.

899
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:32,000
Seon Ho, I'm still scary now!

900
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,200
Stay away from our U Yeon.

901
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,900
Hey, stand properly.

902
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,267
I'm watching.

903
00:54:37,267 --> 00:54:40,033
Ugh, that troublemaker.

904
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,500
Oh, but hasn't Brown changed the most?

905
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,533
What? Me?

906
00:54:44,533 --> 00:54:45,733
Yes!

907
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:48,367
You wore the same outfit every day.

908
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:50,567
Thought it was a uniform.

909
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:51,667
Exactly.

910
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:54,600
Even now, look, he's the most serious
about the concept.

911
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,133
Come to think of it, that's true.

912
00:54:57,133 --> 00:54:58,900
If I hadn't met Blue back then,

913
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,867
I'd probably still be stuck at home,
drowning in alcohol.

914
00:55:02,867 --> 00:55:07,667
Honestly, it's not easy to socialize at this age.

915
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:09,933
Thanks, everyone,

916
00:55:09,933 --> 00:55:11,900
for hanging out with this old man.

917
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,333
I'm the oldest one here.

918
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:17,133
What are you talking about?

919
00:55:17,133 --> 00:55:19,933
Who cares about age when you love painting?

920
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:21,567
True.

921
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:27,033
Saying things like that.

922
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:29,200
So cool, Baeblu.

923
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,667
That's our Baeblu.

924
00:55:30,667 --> 00:55:33,233
We're so beautiful.

925
00:55:39,133 --> 00:55:40,733
Wait a minute.

926
00:55:41,933 --> 00:55:43,600
Hey, we're not done yet.

927
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,267
Yes, Mom.

928
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,700
I think I'll be home after dinner
because of Seon Ho's farewell party.

929
00:55:50,733 --> 00:55:53,967
Got it, I'll be home on time.

930
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:55,600
Okay.

931
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:13,600
<i>♫ The colors hidden in my diary ♫</i>

932
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,233
<i>♫ What new adventures await today ♫</i>

933
00:56:15,233 --> 00:56:17,100
Excuse me.

934
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,333
Yes?

935
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:21,733
I'm sorry, but do you have a moment?

936
00:56:21,733 --> 00:56:23,367
Pardon?

937
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,400
Me?

938
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,367
<i>♫ But trapped within time ♫</i>

939
00:56:29,367 --> 00:56:33,233
<i>♫ I stay up all night overthinking about you ♫</i>

940
00:56:33,233 --> 00:56:36,900
<i>♫ I couldn't say anything at first ♫</i>

941
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,933
<i>♫ But now I'm gathering courage to approach you ♫</i>

942
00:56:40,933 --> 00:56:44,700
<i>Sometimes, I think about that.</i>

943
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:54,167
<i>What if I hadn't met SF that day?
How different would things be?</i>

944
00:56:54,167 --> 00:56:56,767
<i>What if my friends had arrived earlier?</i>

945
00:56:56,767 --> 00:56:59,333
<i>What if I had refused to be the model?</i>

946
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:03,680
<i>If that had happened,</i>

947
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,267
<i>no one would be here now.</i>

948
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:11,200
<i>Neither me nor my dreams.</i>

949
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,033
<i>♫ I'll never crumble ♫</i>

950
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:19,900
<i>♫ Take my hand and rise again ♫</i>

951
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:23,267
<i>♫ Together, we're enough ♫</i>

952
00:57:23,267 --> 00:57:26,900
<i>♫ With you by my side,
let's fill our dreams together ♫</i>

953
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,000
<i>Honey.</i>

954
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,600
Honey.

955
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,733
<i>I used to</i>

956
00:57:37,567 --> 00:57:42,300
<i>only imagine things
that could happen in fantasies.</i>

957
00:57:44,633 --> 00:57:47,488
<i>I was too scared</i>

958
00:57:47,488 --> 00:57:49,967
<i>to dream in reality.</i>

959
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,133
<i>But...</i>

960
00:57:55,133 --> 00:57:56,967
<i>now I know.</i>

961
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,967
<i>That even someone like me can do something.</i>

962
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:09,700
<i>That when I change, my world changes too.</i>

963
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:18,800
<i>I'm still timid,</i>

964
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,067
<i>and anxious about what the future holds,</i>

965
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,467
<i>but I won't give up halfway.</i>

966
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:28,300
<i>Because...</i>

967
00:58:29,867 --> 00:58:36,367
<i>♫ Though we used to look in different directions ♫</i>

968
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:43,600
<i>♫ From now on, we'll gaze at the same place ♫</i>

969
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:48,967
<i>♫ Stand up, I'll never fall down ♫</i>

970
00:58:48,967 --> 00:58:50,167
<i>♫ Brush off my knees and rise again ♫</i>

971
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:52,133
U Yeon.

972
00:58:52,133 --> 00:58:53,767
What are you doing here?

973
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:55,667
<i>Because I'm</i>

974
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:58,967
<i>the one and only</i>

975
00:58:58,967 --> 00:59:01,233
<i>Special Baeblu Finger in the world.</i>

976
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:04,433
Now, who will be the next model?

977
00:59:11,133 --> 00:59:12,800
