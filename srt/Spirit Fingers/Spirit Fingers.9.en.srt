185
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,900
Let me see your face.

186
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,933
Look at me.

187
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:23,367
Oh my, your face...

188
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,967
Who did this?

189
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,267
Did you hit him?

190
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,500
What?

191
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,920
No,

192
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,300
no...

193
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:35,267
So you hit him, right?

194
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:38,333
Please calm down and wait
until Min Ho's mom arrives.

195
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,667
This punk hit first.

196
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:40,900
Min Ho.

197
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,833
Look at this kid lying.

198
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,896
Where'd you learn to lie?

199
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:48,096
- Ma'am.
- Huh? Did your parents teach you to lie?

200
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:49,633
Ma'am, please calm down and wait a moment.

201
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:54,333
They say his parents are too busy
with their divorce to care about him.

202
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:58,567
- Wait, divorce?
- Divorce?

203
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:00,600
Ma'am, please don't say that...

204
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,533
I hit him first.

205
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:03,667
What?

206
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,000
I said I hit him first.

207
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:16,667
[Mobeom Elementary School]
Making a scene over nothing. Unbelievable.

208
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,300
Don't worry, U Dol.

209
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,333
I will take care of it, so you just

210
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,800
focus on your studies.

211
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,100
Aren't you going to scold me?

212
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,500
What did you do wrong?

213
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,900
He probably started it first.

214
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,167
Let's go to the hospital first.

215
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,233
I just want to go home.

216
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:39,800
No, you're hurt. You need to go to the hospital.

217
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,067
I just want to go home.

218
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:44,200
I want to go home. Take me home!

219
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:56,000
Aren't you going to tell me why you really fought?

220
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,433
No matter how angry you get,
you shouldn't hit people.

221
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:00,733
Violence is bad.

222
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,767
Did you know about this too?

223
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,200
About what?

224
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,400
That Mom lied?

225
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,200
Lied?

226
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:23,633
How's U Dol?

227
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:25,600
He fell asleep.

228
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,267
He hasn't even done his homework.
How could you let him sleep?

229
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,100
- U Dol!
- Just leave him.

230
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,700
He passed out from exhaustion.

231
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,467
He must've been under a lot of stress.

232
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,467
There's no way he hit first.

233
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:41,867
Min Ho definitely looks like
the type to throw the first punch.

234
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,000
Mom.

235
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,600
They're still kids, so don't say things

236
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,167
about throwing the first punch.

237
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:51,033
It's a matter of home education.

238
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,467
Jeez.

239
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:56,400
Why does he sleep in your room instead of his own?

240
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,967
He has to do his homework, you know?

241
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:15,167
Kids naturally grow up fighting like that.

242
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:18,733
Let's not embarrass ourselves
fighting over childish things.

243
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:22,967
Why would someone who's usually so level-headed

244
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,767
say something like divorce

245
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:29,400
in front of the kids?

246
00:12:31,104 --> 00:12:32,800
I won't

247
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,800
just let this slide.

248
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:53,267
I can't believe it.

249
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:55,900
They're the ones at fault, anyway.

250
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:09,333
Oh, dear son.

251
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:13,967
How could you not come home even once a week?

252
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:16,533
I know your lab keeps you busy.

253
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:20,400
Professor must be struggling without you.

254
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,333
You still need to make sure
you're eating properly, okay?

255
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,667
Love you, son.

256
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,633
Yeah.

257
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:55,400
Hello.

258
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,600
Huh?

259
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,500
There's no meeting today?

260
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,233
I'm here to boost the sales.

261
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,833
Ah, an appointment?

262
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,233
A date.

263
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:06,067
A date?

264
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,400
Oh, it's that person, huh?

265
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,567
Who?

266
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,328
Well,

267
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:12,333
it's not.

268
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,733
Wow.

269
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:16,867
So the person you're dating has changed again?

270
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:19,600
The ones I've seen,

271
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,100
one, two, three, four, five, six,

272
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,000
seven, eight, nine, ten.

273
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,233
- Eleven.
- Jonathan.

274
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,133
Not funny.

275
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:32,200
What's the reason for the breakup this time?

276
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,233
Well...

277
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:36,300
He said something I told him never to say.

278
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,100
I asked him to just follow
that one rule. Why couldn't he?

279
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:47,267
Don't tell me your date today is...

280
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,833
Him?

281
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,833
What is it?

282
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:07,200
This...

283
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,500
I said I'd buy it for you.

284
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,233
So, did you work in construction to pay for it?

285
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:20,667
Ah, this is...

286
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,433
Thanks. I'll use it well.

287
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,333
Oh, Ms. Taeng Ja!

288
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:33,728
Ms. Taeng Ja.

289
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,367
Enjoy it.

290
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:42,367
Thank you.

291
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:46,233
Was the person I saw earlier an art student?

292
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:48,100
He looked so fresh.

293
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:50,467
Mr. Kim Seok Gu.

294
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,233
Yes.

295
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:55,600
Let's end our relationship here.

296
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,667
What?

297
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,200
Why so sudden?

298
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,900
I told you not to call my name.

299
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:07,833
I guess this is where our relationship ends.

300
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,767
Then, goodbye.

301
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,533
Wait...

302
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:13,333
Ms. Taeng Ja.

303
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:36,200
Don't pick at your food.
You're gonna waste your luck.

304
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,033
Ah, okay.

305
00:16:44,032 --> 00:16:46,300
Is it not tasty?

306
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,333
- It's not that.
- Then why are you picking at it like that?

307
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,733
You're ruining my appetite too.

308
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,633
I'm sorry.

309
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:59,733
This is what it's like between us.

310
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:01,033
Generation gap.

311
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:03,767
What's the big deal about that?
Is it really important?

312
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:05,833
Do you like me?

313
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,300
I don't see you as a man.

314
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,400
Date someone your own age.

315
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,333
Stop being needlessly stubborn.

316
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,933
It looks better that way.

317
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,300
I'll get going now.

318
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,833
I can't keep looking at that expression of yours.

319
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,767
See you at the meeting.

320
00:17:47,328 --> 00:17:48,567
Sorry.

321
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,767
Eun Gi has been ordering a lot today.

322
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:53,600
So? You threw another tantrum and just left?

323
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,720
No,

324
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,867
you told me not to do that.

325
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,633
Yeah, don't do that.

326
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:58,967
You don't need to walk me home every day.

327
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:00,400
No.

328
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,400
You're more important than work to me.

329
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,344
- More than work?
- Yeah.

330
00:18:05,344 --> 00:18:07,800
You're the most important.

331
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:10,633
Where are your friends?

332
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:12,233
You're running late, so they went ahead.

333
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:14,033
Let's go.

334
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:22,867
Let's hold hands and go.

335
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:33,000
I used to wonder why people get married.

336
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,633
It's for this reason.

337
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:36,733
To not want to break up.

338
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,467
- Gi Jeong.
- Huh?

339
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:46,200
You said earlier that
I'm more important than work.

340
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,667
Of course.

341
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,967
Honestly, right now,

342
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:53,033
I can't say the same to you.

343
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:55,167
Oh, really?

344
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:59,633
I'm not saying you're less
important than studying,

345
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:01,952
but right now,

346
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:04,200
studying is really important for me.

347
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,067
My future depends on it.

348
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:09,567
It doesn't have to be studying,

349
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:12,667
but haven't you ever imagined
your future with what you're doing now?

350
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:16,367
Like becoming a famous model,

351
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:19,433
or working in related fields.

352
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:21,184
No,

353
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:23,232
I haven't.

354
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:25,067
I'm just doing part-time jobs.

355
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:26,700
I told you.

356
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,800
You don't have to stress over it.

357
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,933
I just feel like I'll end up
being a really cool person, you know?

358
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,433
- Wait...
- Stay still.

359
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:46,967
I'm sharing my energy with you.

360
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:50,033
Energy to become amazing.

361
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:54,233
You overthink way too much.

362
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:57,767
I've thought a lot because of you too,

363
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,967
and it's really hard.

364
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,367
I've tried studying too,

365
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,900
but honestly, it's not something humans should do.

366
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,600
So,

367
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,667
just leave it.

368
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:16,867
You'll become someone incredible anyway.

369
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,633
You really think so?

370
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:21,600
Of course.

371
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:41,567
U Yeon?

372
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,200
U Dol.

373
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,633
Ow, it hurts.

374
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:54,000
Who is he?

375
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,067
Huh?

376
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:57,567
Who are you?

377
00:20:57,567 --> 00:21:00,733
U Dol, this is my friend.

378
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:02,200
This is my little brother.

379
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,000
Huh?

380
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,300
Brother-in-law.

381
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,567
Quickly take him away,

382
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:08,633
or something bad might happen.

383
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,200
Oh? Brother-in-law,

384
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,800
I'm not a thing.

385
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,100
Get him out of here before Mom comes.

386
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,600
- What?
- U Dol.

387
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
- Go on, just go.
- U Dol.

388
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,000
Why'd he leave so fast?

389
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,233
- Mom.
- U Dol.

390
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:23,600
U Dol.

391
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,633
Song U Dol?

392
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,533
Huh?

393
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,500
Why are you here?

394
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,067
- Mom.
- You just got home?

395
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:35,900
Huh?

396
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,064
Yeah,

397
00:21:40,064 --> 00:21:42,000
she just got home.

398
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,233
U Dol.

399
00:21:45,984 --> 00:21:49,167
Ugh, that kid's still sulking.

400
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:50,900
Look at this.

401
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,300
He's doing exactly what you did to me last week.

402
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,800
Your actions get reflected like this.

403
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,633
Get inside quickly.

404
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:01,152
U Dol,

405
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:03,500
wait for me.

406
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:21,467
[Gi Jeong: Your mom didn't notice me, did she?
I'm pretty quick, huh?]

407
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:23,367
[Yeah, we're fine.]

408
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:27,500
[Don't worry about your brother.]

409
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,633
[He saw us hugging.]

410
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:34,667
[Pfft, what does that kid know?
Just say it's a friendly hug.]

411
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:38,767
He's not just some kid.

412
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,167
Hey, U Dol.

413
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:03,800
Did you get a boyfriend?

414
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,600
Huh?

415
00:23:06,912 --> 00:23:08,433
Yeah.

416
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:10,667
I don't like him.

417
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:11,767
Break up with him.

418
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:12,967
No, U Dol.

419
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:14,667
If Mom finds out, she'll go crazy.

420
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:17,767
I don't want to keep seeing you
get scolded by Mom.

421
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:20,633
- Huh?
- So break up quickly.

422
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:21,867
What?

423
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,416
<i>Don't come to my house for a while.</i>

424
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,600
<i>Don't contact me either.</i>

425
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,867
<i>Don't wait for me at school.</i>

426
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:27,900
<i>Don't even come to the study room.</i>

427
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,500
Why not?

428
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,433
Just do as I say for now.

429
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:32,967
If he tells Mom, it's over.

430
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:36,700
Why is that little kid
trying to act like an older brother?

431
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,233
He's not just an ordinary kid.

432
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:43,800
He's still just 10 years old, right?

433
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,667
But I'm telling you,
he's not a normal 10-year-old.

434
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:51,667
Anyway, just follow my plan for now.

435
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,967
- U Yeon.
<i>- I'll contact you again.</i>

436
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:55,387
U Yeon,

437
00:23:55,387 --> 00:23:56,633
U Yeon!

438
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:59,167
What's wrong? Did you guys fight?

439
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,700
Darn. If he's not just an ordinary kid...

440
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,300
Okay.

441
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,560
Hey,

442
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,233
what were you doing in third grade?

443
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:14,400
- I picked my nose.
- No, not that stuff.

444
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,833
- I played games!
- Yeah, isn't that

445
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,800
what you're supposed to do in third grade?

446
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,400
Right! They're usually
picking their nose and playing games!

447
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,767
But seriously, why is he like that?

448
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:26,433
Hey!

449
00:24:28,576 --> 00:24:30,000
Darn it.

450
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,967
Ah, that crazy punk. Is this thing broken?

451
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:34,432
I'll smash it to pieces.

452
00:24:35,168 --> 00:24:37,100
[Mobeom Elementary School]

453
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,400
Hey, kiddo.

454
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,433
Can we talk for a sec?

455
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:42,667
Wow, a giant.

456
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:46,000
I have something to say.

457
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,300
Hey, kiddo.

458
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,633
Hey, can't you hear me?

459
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:50,800
I said I need to talk.

460
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,933
Wow, a handsome giant.

461
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:53,967
Come here quickly.

462
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:56,633
Oh, look at that tiny kid.

463
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:57,633
Hey, the kiddo's friend.

464
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:58,633
Yes?

465
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:00,300
Don't answer.

466
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,133
Okay, got it.

467
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,367
Want me to buy you ice cream?

468
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:05,233
Yes.

469
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:06,867
Don't take food from strangers.

470
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:09,167
It might be poisoned.

471
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:10,272
Poison?

472
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,700
I'm Nam Gi Jeong.

473
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:26,800
I'm 18 years old,

474
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:30,500
187cm tall, 70kg.

475
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,776
Wow,

476
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:34,267
U Dol's only 130cm.

477
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't care about that.

478
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,100
Which school do you go to?

479
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,067
Chiwon High.

480
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:42,933
The one on top of the mountain?

481
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:45,567
Oh, you know it.

482
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:49,467
Well, our school is pretty famous.

483
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,933
What?

484
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:59,067
- Wait.
- Where are you going suddenly?

485
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:01,567
I don't need to listen anymore.

486
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,133
Thanks for the ice cream.

487
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,067
<i>What was that?</i>

488
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,600
<i>That's total disrespect.</i>

489
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,700
Darn it.

490
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,567
Isn't this too much? From an elementary kid?

491
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:14,933
Yes, exactly.

492
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:17,067
Is it our fault for attending Chiwon High?

493
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:18,867
Darn it.

494
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,367
Then whose fault is it?

495
00:26:26,912 --> 00:26:28,167
Stop overreacting.

496
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:30,033
He's still just a kid.

497
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:31,467
No.

498
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:33,733
U Yeon was right.

499
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:34,976
He is

500
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:36,667
not just an ordinary kid.

501
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:40,000
Even if he's smart, he's just a 3rd grader.

502
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,200
You might look like someone who just

503
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,100
relies on being handsome and acts like a punk,

504
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,467
but show him you're actually a kind person.

505
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:48,633
Did you just insult me?

506
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:49,667
That was a compliment.

507
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:50,933
Sounded like an insult.

508
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:53,033
Does that matter right now?

509
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:54,688
Any ideas?

510
00:26:55,392 --> 00:26:57,967
Huh? Brother-in-law.

511
00:26:57,967 --> 00:26:59,500
Brother-in-law.

512
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,700
Wow, a giant teddy bear.

513
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,300
Brother-in-law.

514
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,700
Brother-in-law.

515
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,767
Wait a minute.

516
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:07,967
Hey, where are you touching?

517
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:09,167
Hey, hey!

518
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:11,333
No, stop touching me.

519
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,133
You punks!

520
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:19,567
Who gave me a wedgie?

521
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:21,367
You punk!

522
00:27:22,688 --> 00:27:25,133
Brother-in-law, brother-in-law!

523
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:29,000
- He's super fun, right?
- Hey, kid!

524
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:33,500
What? Kids like teddy bears?

525
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,467
Jeez, this isn't working at all.

526
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:37,933
What now? Huh? Seriously.

527
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:40,867
I misjudged him.

528
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,767
Listening to classical music,
he's not just an ordinary kid.

529
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:45,200
So you just realized that now?

530
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,000
Wait.

531
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,133
Let's raise the bar.

532
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:51,933
What?

533
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,168
Something U Dol likes?

534
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:57,800
Well...

535
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,133
He likes quizzes maybe?

536
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:02,233
- Why?
- Oh.

537
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:03,767
Dae O asked me.

538
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,300
Why would Dae O...

539
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:10,100
Gi Jeong put him up to this, right?

540
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,867
- Just leave him be.
- No, they shouldn't meet.

541
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:15,567
You never know what Gi Jeong might say.

542
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:17,967
It seems like he's trying to do something.
Just trust me for now.

543
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:21,733
We can't keep walking on eggshells
around U Dol forever.

544
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:31,833
Why are you here again?

545
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:34,500
Let's settle this man-to-man.

546
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,600
How childish.

547
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:39,500
Scared?

548
00:28:40,233 --> 00:28:41,967
Who?

549
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,767
Me?

550
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:45,867
That's right.

551
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:46,900
Deal.

552
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,033

736
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:14,367
If she dates someone like you, it'll get worse.

737
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:19,233
What?

738
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:23,424
If you like her, why let her be disrespected?

739
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:25,033
So,

740
00:37:25,033 --> 00:37:28,167
please break up for my sister's sake.

741
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,033
Let's go.

Hey.

743
00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:36,067
That kid's got a sharp tongue.

744
00:37:36,067 --> 00:37:39,367
Hey, hey, quiet down.

745
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:45,024
That was really fun earlier,

746
00:37:45,024 --> 00:37:46,933
right?

747
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:48,633
What was fun?

748
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,167
He's dumber than I expected.

749
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:53,700
It seemed like he was doing it on purpose.

750
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,267
To make friends laugh.

751
00:37:56,267 --> 00:37:58,633
What?

752
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:03,200
When signing autographs earlier,
he memorized all their names at once.

753
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:07,800
U Dol, come quick.

754
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,067
<i>Gi Jeong, if you see this, please contact me.</i>

755
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:18,700
<i>Gi Jeong, what's going on?</i>

756
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,567
I guess he lost, since he hasn't contacted you.

757
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,500
Is he crying somewhere?

758
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,267
Nam Gi Jeong wouldn't do that.

759
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:30,067
Even if he lost, he'd be bragging loudly.

760
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:31,800
But why is he ghosting you?

761
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,500
Call U Dol.

762
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
You know what?

763
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,633
Maybe he's buying burgers
now that the vibe has lightened up.

764
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:40,300
I really hope that's the case.

Hey, goddess,

00:39:35,488 --> 00:39:37,333
look at me for a second.

774
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,233
Gi Jeong!

775
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:45,500
So I said 'Lal Paris' and everyone cracked up.

776
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,300
Then the kids came at me like this.

777
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,933
- And they kept asking for autographs.
- Really?

778
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:53,867
See? This is your boyfriend.

779
00:39:53,867 --> 00:39:55,367

780
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:57,100
Thanks for not getting discouraged.

781
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,467
I worried for nothing.

782
00:39:58,467 --> 00:40:00,800
Me? Discouraged?

783
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,900
I'm Nam Gi Jeong.

784
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,467
Just see U Dol's behavior as cute.

785
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:09,500
You challenged a kid to a duel
just to humor him, right?

786
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,467
Well... yeah.

787
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:14,533

00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:16,133
Why wouldn't I?

789
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:17,167
I'm Song U Yeon.

790
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:21,400
Oh, Song U Yeon.

791
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,533
U Dol's acting like that because of me.

792
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:27,300
He hates seeing me get scolded by Mom.

793
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,767
If Mom finds out about you and me,
she'll scold me again.

794
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:33,167
But when I heard that, it kind of touched me,

795
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:36,533
so even though U Dol is overacting, I'm not mad.

796
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:39,700
So just understand him a little.

This is so frustrating.

806
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,800
He spent the whole night as
that darn pink caterpillar, groaning.

807
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:18,033
Looks like U Yeon's brother
really cares about her.

00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:21,800
Well, I also think U Yeon is
a hundred times better anyway.

So when did you two get close?

818
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,467
Since you started dating that punk.

819
00:41:58,367 --> 00:42:01,900
He came to me asking to talk you down.

820
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,467
That's probably the first time
he called me 'brother'.

821

Not bad for a little brother.

Listen carefully, kiddo.

912
00:47:42,633 --> 00:47:45,300

00:47:56,733 --> 00:47:59,600
This seems like a pretty proper meeting to me.

918
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,400
I can't accept that.

919
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,333
The truth is, studying is
more important than playing.

920
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:09,867
Fine. Whether you agree or not is your choice.

921
00:48:09,867 --> 00:48:14,933
But we're free to reject rude party crashers too.

922
00:48:17,867 --> 00:48:20,900
Either wear this or go home.

923
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,067
Your call.

924
00:48:35,067 --> 00:48:39,067
How am I supposed to wear this?

925
00:48:39,067 --> 00:48:40,900
Need help?

926
00:48:41,967 --> 00:48:43,767
Hello?

927
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:45,800
I'm Koo Seon Ho.

928
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
That was too harsh on the kid earlier.

929
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:53,033
I just treated him like an adult
because he didn't want to be treated like a child.

930
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:55,733
I'm sorry, my brother has been acting really rude.

931
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:57,667
No, it's okay.

932
00:48:57,667 --> 00:49:00,533
Actually, I was exactly like that
when I was young.

933
00:49:01,633 --> 00:49:05,100
But why are you so helpless
around your little brother?

934
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,133
Yeah, when he acts up,
just smack him and set him straight.

935
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:10,833
Like this, like this, like this, like this!

936
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:12,433
Poor Gi Jeong.

937
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:14,000
That's how real siblings act.

938
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,267
That's right, good job.

939
00:49:21,233 --> 00:49:24,500
- Wow.
- Wow.

940
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,100
Well, this photo feels a bit ambiguous.

941
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:33,233
I wish we could redo this one.

942
00:49:34,688 --> 00:49:36,433
Will he reshoot?

943
00:49:36,433 --> 00:49:37,767
Right?

944
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:39,433
No, it's just...

945
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:42,667
<i>My sister already gets ignored by Mom.</i>

946
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:46,167
If she dates someone like you, it'll get worse.

947
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:48,367
I think it would be better
if he could strike a stronger pose.

948
00:49:48,367 --> 00:49:50,667
It's okay, but...

949
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,200
Let's reshoot.

950
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,633
- Huh?
- Huh?

951
00:49:55,633 --> 00:49:58,100
Give me the clothes. We're redoing it.

952
00:49:59,067 --> 00:50:00,933
Bro.

953
00:50:00,933 --> 00:50:04,833
If anything feels off next time,
tell me to reshoot. Okay?

954
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:05,867
Okay.

955
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:07,900
That's how professionals do it.

956
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,967
Now only Gi Jeong's not here?

957
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,167
Oh, right.

958
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:20,800
Gi Jeong isn't coming anymore, right?

959
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,333
He quit, didn't he?

960
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:23,567
Yes.

961
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:25,467
When?

962
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:27,667
Khaki!

963
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:30,667
You pose first. Go ahead.

964
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:34,267
Alright, starting 3-minute croquis now.

965
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:43,667
Want me to teach you how to do croquis?

966
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:45,467
No, thanks.

967
00:51:13,733 --> 00:51:15,300
Vanilla!

968
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,200
Niagara!

969
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,300
- Abu... what was it?
- Yeah, that one.

970
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,600
Pass, pass! I don't know!

971
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:27,300
I'd accept it if it were that guy.

972
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,067
- Hey, are you okay?
- Are you okay?

973
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:32,067
- Ouch, it hurts.
- Be careful.

974
00:51:32,067 --> 00:51:33,333
Let me see.

975
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:36,867
What's this weirdly uncomfortable
feeling I'm getting?

976
00:51:36,867 --> 00:51:38,600
Whose sketchbook is this?
There's nothing drawn here.

977
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,167
That's yours, right?

978
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,700
It's better to not draw at all than to draw badly.

979
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,100
It's a waste of time.

980
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,600
U Dol, but still...

981
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,500
What if I can't draw well?

982
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,100
It's natural to struggle with your first croquis.

983
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,500
How about trying to draw like this?

984
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,168
If you

985
00:52:07,168 --> 00:52:09,900
were to draw her...

986
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,967
- Like this.
- Me?

987
00:52:11,967 --> 00:52:14,000
Is this a drawing?

988
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,700
Have you heard of abstract art?

989
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,067
Of course!

990
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:21,433
Abstract art moves away from mimicking shapes

991
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:25,967
to focus on pure elements
like points, lines, surfaces, and colors.

992
00:52:25,967 --> 00:52:27,367
Right.

993
00:52:27,367 --> 00:52:30,400
If you see this as abstract art,
it becomes a valid piece.

994
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,833
If figure drawing's hard,
try approaching it like abstraction.

995
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:37,133
Or like me, just draw the parts you like.

996
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:39,567
SF doesn't have any set rules.

997
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:42,400
You're free to draw however you want.

998
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,400
There's no such thing as a bad drawing.

999
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,667
- There isn't.
- There isn't.

1000
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:49,000
You can do it. You can do it.

1001
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:53,033
What do you think?

1002
00:52:53,033 --> 00:52:55,233
Wanna give it a try?

1003
00:52:56,033 --> 00:52:58,167
This meeting really feels weird.

1004
00:52:58,167 --> 00:53:00,400
U Dol.

1005
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,633
But I'll try it for once.

1006
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,533
<i>♫ You're shining brightly, like a star ♫</i>

1007
00:53:28,533 --> 00:53:32,067
<i>♫ You're lighting up my heart ♫</i>

1008
00:53:32,067 --> 00:53:37,400
<i>♫ With your own light, your own color ♫</i>

1009
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,200
<i>♫ You make the whole world beautiful ♫</i>

1010
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,667
Next up, our little guest.

1011
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:46,567
<i>♫ You, who fill my dreams ♫</i>

1012
00:53:46,567 --> 00:53:50,167
<i>♫ I really want to reach you ♫</i>

1013
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:56,433
<i>♫ Become a comet of miracles ♫</i>

1014
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,833
Uzbekistan.

1015
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:00,067
Tashkent.

1016
00:54:00,067 --> 00:54:02,167
- Romania.
- Bucharest.

1017
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:03,167
What's the capital of Kenya?

1018
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:04,867
- Nairobi.
- What about the UAE?

1019
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,467
Abu Dhabi.

1020
00:54:06,467 --> 00:54:08,500
São Tomé and Príncipe.

1021
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:11,233
São Tomé.

1022
00:54:13,733 --> 00:54:15,600
Do you have a girlfriend?

1023
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,200
Huh?

1024
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,933
U Dol.

1025
00:54:18,933 --> 00:54:21,400
If you're single, how about dating my sister?

1026
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,500
What are you doing?

1027
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,567
She's naturally pretty once you look closely.

1028
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:26,767
- And she's kind!
- U Dol, U Dol.

1029
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:27,933
I'm sorry, Seon Ho.

1030
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:30,367
I'm sorry, but I...

1031
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,933
He likes someone else.

1032
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:39,400
She's a hundred times less pretty than U Yeon

1033
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,433
and a thousand times worse in personality,

1034
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:44,700
but, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

1035
00:54:47,233 --> 00:54:49,733
You said he wouldn't come, right?

1036
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:53,033
You lost the game, right?
You said you wouldn't meet my sister.

1037
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:54,900
U Dol.

1038
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:06,100
No, stop looking.

1039
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,233
Do you think I'm stupid?

1040
00:55:07,233 --> 00:55:08,667
I saw you holding hands earlier.

1041
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:10,967
Let's talk about adult relationships,
adult relationships.

1042
00:55:10,967 --> 00:55:13,800
Is it normal to not care
when my girlfriend's ex keeps hovering?

1043
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,400
How should I make you feel like I'm a man to you?

1044
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,400
Liking someone?

1045
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,467
Maybe you just want to get to know
each other more and more?

1046
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:22,733
I did what Mom said, even if I didn't like it,
because I was afraid you'd hate me.

1047
00:55:22,733 --> 00:55:23,900
I hate it when Mom plays favorites.

1048
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,100
- I'll throw it away.
- You've started

1049
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,000
avoiding me again, huh?

1050
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Like a real man, smack the wall!

1051
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,900
What should I do, Gi Jeong?

1052
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:36,033
I'm trying to hate you.

1053
00:55:42,533 --> 00:55:45,100
I have a request.

1054
00:55:46,967 --> 00:55:49,933
From now on, don't call me a kid or anything.

1055
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,533
I don't want to.

1056
00:55:54,533 --> 00:55:56,067
Why not?

1057
00:55:56,067 --> 00:55:58,033
It's just how I feel.

1058
00:56:06,267 --> 00:56:08,067
Did you get scolded?
