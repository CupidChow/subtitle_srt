00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,910

28
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,760
Was it a year ago?

29
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,960
I think we worked here once before.

30
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,460
I guess I was too indirect back then.

31
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,280
Since you didn't understand, I'll say it clearly.

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,540
I don't want to be in a relationship with you.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
I want to keep seeing you
as a friend for a long, long time.

Until I die.

35
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:48,800
I know my friend Koo Seon Ho is a great guy.

36
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,400
But,

37
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,800
if we become a couple...

38
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,180
that might not work.

39
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,280
There'll be too many expectations
right from the start.

40
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,613
Those expectations will pile up,
until there's no going back.

41
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:10,120
And when that moment comes,

42
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,980
when we start to hate each other...

43
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,440
That'd be the worst.

44
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,600
I never want to go through that again.

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,280
You still don't seem to get it...

46
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,931
so let me make it clear.

47
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,300
I won't be your friend.

48
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,120
- Koo Seon Ho.
- And you've got one thing wrong.

49

I don't plan on keeping

50

a female friend once I'm married.

51
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,480
So there's only one way you can keep seeing me

52
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,880

53
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,480

55

Is this what our friendship means to you? You...

56
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,120
I told you, I'm not planning to just be friends.

57
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,060

What do you think is my prettiest part, Mom?

73

Don't get carried away by words like that.

74
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:34,550
It makes you look desperate.

75
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,320
I need to ask you something.

76
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,480
I don't have money.

77
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,320
Can't you just speak to me a little more kindly?

78
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,330
What?

79
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,333
I know you see me as lacking and frustrating.

80
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,904
But I'm trying really hard...

81
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:54,440
Then study hard like your brother and U Dol do.

82
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,480
Studying isn't everything.

83
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,590
You did dance too, why keep pushing academics?

84
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,630
Hey, I did dance because I was good at it.

85
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,230
If I hadn't injured my ankle,
I wouldn't be your mom today.

86
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,710
Since you're not good at anything else,
you should at least study well.

87
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,680
You draw well.

88
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,460
It's not good enough to call it talent...

89
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,440
You've improved a lot.

90
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,180
That means you've got talent.

91
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,780
Really?

92
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,560
You're lucky.

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,013
You're good at what you love,
you've got a clear dream...

94
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:42,230
and you're pretty too.

95
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,020
Yeah, I guess I am.

96
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,160

97
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,540
U Yeon!

98
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,210

99
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,150
Huh? No, I'm not that good.

100
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,613
Artist Song, don't be picky, just draw it.

101
00:07:04,613 --> 00:07:05,900
Then draw me too.

102
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,540
That one you drew looks fun.

103
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,170

The model has arrived.

107
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,970
Can you draw even if I pose like this?

108
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,346
But can you really draw us in just one minute?

109
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,280
Yeah, you get used to it as you go.

110
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,950
At first, I couldn't draw at all.

111
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,650
U Yeon, my legs hurt.

112
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,250
Okay, starting the one-minute timer.

Let's go to the hospital!

128
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,210
He's already been to the hospital.

129
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,910
It could be psychological factors.

130

Have you been under a lot of stress lately?

131
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,240

Turns out you liked her after all.

134
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,590
Seriously, he's this messed up over one rejection?

135
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,933
Bet he never thought
he'd get dumped with that face.

136

but now he's in a whole new world.

137

She'll get caught by her mom again.

186
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,000
It seems like you want her
to get scolded by her mom?

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,970
When did I?

188
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:33,951
<i>You'd better like me.</i>

189
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,010
He's totally treating you
like one of his concubines.

190
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,710
You don't have to spell it out, I know.

191
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,190
There you go again, putting yourself down.

192
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,800
Who'd treat you as concubines?

193
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,253
Besides, concubines are pretty.

194
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,586
He said I'm pretty too.

195
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:55,650
You got your hopes up?

196
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,250
What hopes?

197
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,853
When he was hesitating, you thought he'd say,

198
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,050
'I like you,' didn't you?

199
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,370
No, I didn't.

200
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,050
Yeah, right.

201
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,430
I don't know.

202
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:17,040
U Yeon!

203
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,013
What are you doing?

204
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:20,626
Hey.

205
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,253
Darn it.

206
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:28,950
Hey, you can make up for a mistake.

207
00:12:30,546 --> 00:12:32,650
What was my mistake?

208
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,860
You weren't acting like yourself.

209
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,970
Your charm is blunt honesty,

210
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:47,110
but you beat around the bush like someone else.
She probably thought you were joking.

211
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,330
Even I'd get mad.

212
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,040
You should've just said how you felt,

213
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,120
straight and simple, like you always do!

214
00:12:59,093 --> 00:13:01,190
My true feelings?

215
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,110
Yeah.

216
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,530
It's not too late.

217
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,213
Fix it fast,

218
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:10,946
and go poop, Gi Jeong. Okay?

219
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,693
[This week's dress code, 'historical drama']

220
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,613
Spirit Fingers' dress code for this week
is is historical drama.

221
00:13:26,613 --> 00:13:28,520
Where am I supposed to find a hanbok?

222
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,410
Wow, we're getting sponsored outfits.

223
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,010
Our Artist Song sure lives lavishly.

224
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:44,360
U Yeon, how about we pick a theme like
they did and try it ourselves?

225
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,970
Good idea.

226
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,570
- Not bad.
- I like it.

227
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,570
Let's just make our group
a sub-organization of Spirit Fingers.

228
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,050
Oh!

229
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,413
That's a pretty good idea.

230
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:56,270
So U Yeon is basically the founder of the group?

231
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,670
Hey.

232
00:14:00,546 --> 00:14:02,493
- Let's go.
- Okay.

233
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,050
I knew our legend would make
waves with this teaser.

234
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,270
Check the number of likes.

235
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,020
Wow, look at this face.

236
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,506
Ah, I'm dying.

237
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,010
Huh?

238
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,880
Why did he come here?

239
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,200
Huh?

240
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,413
Why are my eye pranking me?

241
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:35,960
Oh, you can't take pictures.
You can't take pictures.

242
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
Bring your phone.

243
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,580
Ah, the ugly one should just sit this out.

244
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,600
Isn't that him?

245
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
U Yeon.

246
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,240
Hey, Miss Piggy.

247
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,000
Stand over there.

248
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,560
That lunatic.

249
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,800
Song U Yeon.

250
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,286
What? Why is he here?

251
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,980
Why'd you come all the way here
and make a scene? Embarrassing.

252
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,144
Embarrassed?

253
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:14,260
Wow. Hey, am I the embarrassing one?

254
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,906
You're the only girl
who'd ever feel ashamed of me.

255
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:19,200
If that's all you came to say, leave.

256
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:24,053
I came to apologize face-to-face.

257
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,380
Apologize for what?

258
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,640
Did my confession sound like a joke to you?

259
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,760
Huh?

260
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,620
- It's real.
- What is?

261
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,860
He wasn't looking good
because of the photo edits or a filter.

262
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,100
Seriously, why is someone that amazing
mixed in with ordinary people?

263
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,580
Are things going well?

264
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,853
Wow, even his friend's gorgeous.

265
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,373
Darn it.

266
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,480
Those two seem to have a good vibe, don't they?

267
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,413
Hey.

268
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:59,560
Ugh, the goddess is over there.
Why pick some plain girl?

269
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,613
Where's this goddess?

270
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:03,693
Ah, that girl with the long hair.

271
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:06,560
Long hair, looks like a top student?

272
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,700
How is that a top student look?

273
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,423
She's just a goddess.

274
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,650
Hey, Byeon Soon.

275
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,653
I think that she's been checking me out.

276
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,350
Did you think I was kidding?

277
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,890
You knew what situation I was in that day.

278
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,520
But did you really want to mess with me like that?

279
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,410
What if I was serious?

280
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,270
Serious about what?

281
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,720
- Let's...
- Huh?

282
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,386
Let's...

283
00:16:48,386 --> 00:16:51,390
Don't tell me... he's asking me out...

284
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,160
Let's...

285
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,660
get married!

286
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,980
Let's get married!

287
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,570
I hate it!

288
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,613
Hey.

289
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,080
Hey, Gi Jeong!

290
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,840
'Like me, not Seong Ho?'

291
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,670
Come on, that's clearly a confession.

292
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,520
Honestly, I thought the same at first.

293
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,660
But look at today.

294
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,860
He straight up said 'Let's get married'.

295
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,240
It does feel a bit out of nowhere.

296
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,641
Totally something an elementary kid would do.

297
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:34,100
He even brought friends along.

298
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,280
Mi Rae.

299
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,400
What do you think?

300
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,900
Not sure about other things,

301
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,320
but I want to join that club too.

302
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,125
- Spirit Pinger, or whatever?
- Huh?

303
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,200
Why are you going there?

304
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,711
Song's going. Why can't I?

305
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:48,280
My friend, take me with you.

306
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,700
Ugh, stop being so clingy.

307
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,420
You have zero interest in drawing.

308
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,950
You just want to check out guys, right?

309
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,786
Song's only going there for guys too!

310
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:56,940
She joined there because of that guy, Blue Finger.

311
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,440
At first it was that,

312
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,100
but now I go there because sketching's fun.

313
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,681
Ah, what a lie.

314
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,700
- Or maybe she switched to the Poop Boy.
- Hey, Jo Mi Rae.

315
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,000
Are you going to keep talking like that?

316
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,460
Song's already feeling awkward.

317
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,320
Why do you always pick on me?

318
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,340
Are you Song's guardian or something?

319
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,020
Stop fighting, guys.

320
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,760
I'll ask him right now.

321
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,080
Hey, if you think you can skip
and just model, you're wrong.

322
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,480
You have to do the sketching too.

323
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,020
Last time I checked,
everyone was terrible except for that guy.

324
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,240
I could draw better than that even with my feet.

325
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,840
What?

326
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,169
- Take back what you just said.
- Huh?

327
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:30,360
I said take it back.

328
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,733
Well,

329
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,730
it was a joke, why are you so serious?
You're embarrassing me.

330
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,260
Everyone worked really hard on their drawings.

331
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,180
Don't talk like that, dismissing their effort.

332
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,160
You think you're so great, huh?

333
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,912
Mi Rae.

334
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,240
- What?
- Hey, you fool.

335
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,680
You should've asked to date first.

336
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,281
How can you say 'let's get married'?

337
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:05,640
But you said to be direct with my feelings.

338
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,520
I mean, doesn't dating lead to marriage anyway?

339
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,240
Oh my god, you fool.

340
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,373
Are you trying to be funny?

341
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:14,100
Ugh, forget it.

342
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,060
Get lost.

343
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,820
This isn't working.

344
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,420
Let's go.

345
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,300
Get out here fast, dude.

346
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Stay still.

347
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,980
Did I even need to contact her?

348
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,120
You came, sis?

349
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,666
He got caught up with a girl?

350
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,440
Is that for real?

351
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Sis.

352
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,200
I-I understand your feelings,
but he needs to live too.

353
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,860
Who is it? Who's that smart kid
living life properly?

354
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,640
Yeah, she's the who joined
the same art group as him.

355
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,900
She's called 'Miss Piggy'.

356
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,180
'Piggy'?

357
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,420
Don't tell me... 'Piggy'?

358
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,500
Is she really that 'Piggy'?

359
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,440
Yes, but it seems like she has a crush
on another boy in the same group.

360
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
A crush?

361
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,776
Come on! Get up!

362
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:19,380
Gosh. Darn it.

363
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,380
This won't do. First, let's do an enema.

364
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,520
Are you insane?

365
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,780
It feels like I was just
changing your diaper yesterday.

366
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,160
Our baby's grown so much.

367
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,400
What are you saying?

368
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,520
Hey, you lonely heart.

369
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,706
Girls always run away if you push too hard.

370
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:41,106
What? You're giving advice
after getting played by a playboy?

371
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:44,506
I'm trying to be serious here,
why bring up the past?

372
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,560
I'll let it slide out of pity.

373
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,100
Go away.

374
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,520
Hey, you think 'Piggy' is the kind of kid
who changes her mind so easily?

375
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,040
There's no way she went from liking khaki
yesterday to liking red today.

376
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,200
What nonsense is that?

377
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,820
They said Piggy's crush is in the same group.

378
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,720
Isn't that Khaki?

379
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,880
Hey, go home.

380
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,401
You clueless green pig.

381
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:12,200
You're making my condition worse.

382
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,800
Can't even poop properly, seriously.

383
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,430
'Hey', 'you'?

384
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,530
You punk, I went easy on you 'cause you were sick.

385
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,510
Do you want to die? You little...

386
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,390
Why did you call her?

387
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,550
Exactly.

388
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,010
You're lying.

389
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,573
Or maybe she switched to the Poop Boy.

390
00:21:57,573 --> 00:21:58,910
I let it slide once.

391
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,270
Hey, it was a joke, why are you so serious?
You're embarrassing me.

392
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,390
Everyone worked really hard on their drawings.

393
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,826
Don't talk like that, dismissing their effort.

394
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:07,670
You think you're so great, huh?

395
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,053
You nasty girl.

396
00:22:10,053 --> 00:22:12,810
<i>Let's get married.</i>

397
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,510
You little punk.

398
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:19,790
<i>Since you're good at nothing else,
shouldn't you at least study well?</i>

399
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,630
I have feelings too.

400
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,530
I have feelings!

401
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,340
Are your feelings just like coal ashes
to be kicked around?

402
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,140
Everyone treats me so carelessly.

403
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,426
Everyone talks to me too easily.

404
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:56,146
I get hurt too.

405
00:22:56,146 --> 00:23:00,420
I also have my pride.

406
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,040
But you're the one who made them think it was okay

407
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,120
to treat you like that, right?

408
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,746
So...

409
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,920
it's all my fault then, huh?

410
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,110
Hey, Green Pig.

411
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,290
Hey!

412
00:23:44,786 --> 00:23:45,840
What time is it?

413
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,260
Wake up Tae Seon and send him to school.

414
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,800
Because of you,
he's out there sleeping in the dew.

415
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,780
Ugh, annoying.

416
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,360
What about you?

417
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,770
It's not about liking or disliking.

418
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,040
Piggy doesn't really know you yet, you know.

419
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,510
Just try getting closer step by step.

420
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,610
I thought we were close enough already.

421
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,110
Well,

422
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,310
I don't think that's enough yet.

423
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:23,750
Seeing that she doesn't know
how decent a guy you are.

424
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:29,110
If she really knew you, she'd know

425
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,213
my brother is quite an awesome guy.

426
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,490
So, try getting a little closer to her.

427
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,950
Now I shall take my leave.

428
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,630
Ah, go take a poop first.

429
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,510
Stop making your sister worry.

430
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,030
Byeon Tae Seon, wake up.

431
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,650
Hey, and who wrote 'Green Pig' there?

432
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,120
If I catch whoever did it,
I'll cover their face in spray paint.

433
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,560
That you're actually a decent guy.

434
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,480
That you're pretty cool.

435
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,080
There's no one cooler than you in this world.

436
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,740
Do you feel the urge?

437
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,260
Let's go to school.

438
00:26:19,226 --> 00:26:21,030
You go ahead.

439
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,470
Do you know why I was so angry?

440
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,527
Spirit Pinger or whatever, how long have you
known those people to be taking their side?

441
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:32,650
I was super hurt.

442
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,866
You think I wasn't hurt by you?

443
00:26:34,866 --> 00:26:38,670
- What?
- If the listener gets hurt, it's not a joke.

444
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,386
Why do you always talk to me like that?

445
00:26:40,386 --> 00:26:41,750
Do you know how hurt I feel every time?

446
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,810
Unbelievable.

447
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,351
- You should've said something! Why endure?
- Because you're my friend.

448
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,670
Just because I laughed it off
doesn't mean I wasn't hurt.

449
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,850
I held back because I didn't
want to fight with my friend over this.

450
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,510
Wait a second.

451
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,551
Calm down. Mi Rae, you too.

452
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:57,770
Yeah?

453
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,890
You must've had a hard time being friends
with someone as mean as me.

454
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,430
- If you hated it, why didn't you say so?
- Hey.

455
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,530
No need to hold back anymore.

456
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,750
I won't ask to be friends anymore.

457
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,270
Try being buddies with Miss Perfect
and Miss Suddenly-Popular.

458
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,510
Hey, Jo Mi Rae.

459
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:49,426
Mom says it's time to eat.

460
00:27:49,426 --> 00:27:51,040
U Dol.

461
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,830
Come here for a sec.

462
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,430
Why?

463
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,750
Ah, what?

464
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:08,510
How many friends do you have?

465
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,510
Zero.

466
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,510
Still?

467
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,610
Haven't made a single friend?

468
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,430
I chose not to.

469
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,066
Since when is Seong Gwan Sik a friend?

470
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:18,550
Maybe if there were someone
helpful like Se Ra, then yeah.

471
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,070
Do you really think that?

472
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,090
U Dol.

473
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,432
I don't need that.

474
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:30,146
Mom says relationships can be such a headache.

475
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:32,760
So why waste time on that?

476
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,790
There's no benefit to it at all.

477
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,050
Why suddenly talk about friends?

478
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,250
Did you fight?

479
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,853
Well, probably not Se Ra.

480
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,630
With that Jo Mi Ryo?

481
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,080
Why call my friend like that?

482
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,410
Good.

483
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,570
Just end the friendship.

484
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,451
That girl really doesn't help you at all.

485
00:28:50,451 --> 00:28:51,550
Hey.

486
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:55,670
Otherwise, you'd keep getting pushed around
and living like a pushover.

487
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,070
Sorry.

488
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,730
Did I just interrupt you
while you were studying, genius?

489
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,250
Hey, I already said I'm sorry.

490
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,590
Are you ignoring me?

491
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,770
Ah, sorry.

492
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,850
I've never learned the language of lower animals.

493
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,190
Animals?

494
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,930
You really wanna die, punk?

495
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,370
If you hit him, the principal will scold you.

496
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,505
Let go.

497
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:39,610
Hey, think being a genius excuses everything?

498
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,130
Does it?

499
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,290
Guys.

500
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,970
Teacher's coming.

501
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,560
If you fight, you'll get in trouble.

502
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,590
You'll get in trouble.

503
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,190
You'll regret this.

504
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,413
Today in art class,
we'll try drawing our friends' faces.

505
00:30:02,413 --> 00:30:04,490
Everyone has their crayons
and sketchbooks out, right?

506
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,350
Yes.

507
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,106
Discuss with your partner,
decide the order, then start drawing.

508
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,390
Yes.

509
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,990
- U Dol, want to work with me?
- Yes.

510
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,270
Miss, miss.

511
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,411
Oh, right.

512
00:30:15,411 --> 00:30:17,870
Since Eun Seo's absent, Bong Gu's alone.

513
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,530
Perfect. You two can work together.

514
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,130
Come here.

515
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:26,973
Hi.

516
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,130
Hey, look at them.

517
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,370
Hello.

518
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,400
Wow, so many colors.

519
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,820
Wipe your nose.

520
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,000
It's too messy for me to draw.

521
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,373
Hey, are you crying?

522
00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:01,250
Why cry?

523
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:05,750
It's my first time getting a gift like this...

524
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,390
- I'm touched.
- What?

525
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,790
I'll cherish it forever.

526
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,224
Gotta keep precious stuff in my undies.

527
00:31:12,224 --> 00:31:14,530
Treasure undies.

528
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,470
- Hey, you should sit and draw.
- Treasure undies.

529
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,070
Got it.

530
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:37,780
Sorry, U Dol. Moms kept
holding me back again today...

531
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,380
I was not expecting it.

532
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,340
Ah, U Dol.

533
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,520
The moms say there's a kid
in your class who's slow?

534
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,780
Doesn't he bother anyone?

535
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,060
Who?

536
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,280
There's like 20 slow kids.

537
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,680
20... Oh, right, right. True.

538
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,040
Oh, compared to our U Dol,
everyone else is lacking anyway. Moms just forgot.

539
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,213
What's that kid's name again?

540
00:32:05,213 --> 00:32:07,780
Was it Bong Sik or Bong Gu?

541
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,280
Well, they said he's unhygienic and can't read?

542
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,300
What on earth are his parents doing?

543
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,620
Your homeroom teacher is a problem too.

544
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,760
Why even keep a special class?

545
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,300
They should've sent him there.

546
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,600
How's that supposed to create
a study-friendly atmosphere?

547
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,540
I'm tired.

548
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,573
I just want to go quietly.

549
00:32:25,573 --> 00:32:26,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

550
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,080
Sleep tight.

551
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,780
Ta-da!

552
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,160
Wow, amazing.

553
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,620
Hey, Mi Rae.

554
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,360
Your friend's here?

555
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:47,610
Song's never gotten mad at you before, right?

556
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:50,570
If you're lecturing, I'm leaving.

557
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,470
She's gotten mad at me before.

558
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,690
In middle school.

559
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,130
When my parents divorced, I almost went astray.

560
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,930
Hung out with troublemakers,
went places teachers would faint knowing about.

561
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,730
Wanted to self-destruct,
so my parents would regret it.

562
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:10,440
But...

563
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,050
Where should we go?

564
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,626
- Should we go where we went last time?
- Oh, that singing room?

565
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:15,990
Yeah, let's go.

566
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,413
Yeom Se, you're skipping academy.
Where are you going?

567
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,850
I'll handle it.

568
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,750
Stop worrying.

569
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,070
Snap out of it, Yeom Se Ra!

570
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,790
She exploded in anger like a different person.

571
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,773
That was our first big fight.

572
00:33:33,106 --> 00:33:35,506
Thinking back,

573
00:33:35,506 --> 00:33:39,106
I guess Song must have felt pretty bad to do that.

574
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,410
That's when I realized.

575
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,546
'Something's wrong with me.'

576
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:02,010
And when you started fangirling,
Song was really lonely too.

577
00:34:10,973 --> 00:34:12,890
Where'd you disappear to?

578
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,010
Did you meet Mi Rae? How is she?

579
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,290
If I apologize, do you think she'll accept?

580
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,950
Why get mad if you'd apologize in a day?

581
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,430
If so, just endure it.

582
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,320
Nothing you said yesterday was wrong.

583
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,691
Let her apologize first.

584
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:30,573
Mi Rae needs time to realize things too.

585
00:34:30,573 --> 00:34:33,370
But what if she really cuts ties?

586
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,350
She won't.

587
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,070
What happened to Nam Gi Jeong?

588
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,440
No contact since that day?

589
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,136
Yeah.

590
00:34:43,136 --> 00:34:45,910
That was a confession,
but why do you keep missing it?

591
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,186
Saying 'let's get married' was a bit much.

592
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,610
I think it fits his character to say that.

593
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,410
A, a confession!

594
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,013
No, it's not.

595
00:35:00,426 --> 00:35:03,280
He says...

596
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,150
I'm pretty.

597
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,450
- So what?
- There's no way he'd say that, right?

598
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,680
There are so many pretty girls around.
How could I be one of them?

599
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,341
- So that was just a joke...
- What does that have to do with anything?

600
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:17,510
He probably only sees you as pretty.

601
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,333
So what if he thinks you're pretty?

602
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,930
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

603
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:29,630
Both you and Mi Rae are caught in traps right now.

604
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,590
What kind of trap?

605
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,773
The trap of inferiority complex.

606
00:35:33,773 --> 00:35:35,626
Let's go.

607
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,190
There's no in-between, none at all.

608
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,440
He's really hyped today.

609
00:35:57,293 --> 00:36:00,430
Okay! Let's call it a day!

610
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,546
Okay! Ah, nice, nice!

611
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,830
How come all today's takes are A-cuts?

612
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,470
Nam Gi Jeong, what's going on?

613
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,770
Why are you so excited today?

614
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,090
There's someone I need to show...

615
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,370
Can you meet me briefly today?

616
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,450
There's someone I need to show how awesome I am.

617
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,030
Oh, Ye Rim's here?

618
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,053
Ye Rim, let's take a 20-minute break.

619
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,750
Hi, Ye Rim.

620
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,350
Hi, guys.

621
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,570
Gi Jeong, I need a quick consultation.

622
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,213
I'm a bit busy right now.

623
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,610
You can at least do a quick consultation, right?

624
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,050
Don't you have that much responsibility toward me?

625
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,893
[I can come in 20 minutes. Wait.]

626
00:36:47,893 --> 00:36:49,020
Is he flying here or something?

627
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,480
How could he get here in just 20 minutes?

628
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,480
<i>You don't have to rush.</i>

629
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,120
<i>If you rush for no reason...</i>

630
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,040
<i>Okay.</i>

631
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,600
Want something to eat?

632
00:37:04,426 --> 00:37:06,320
Hey, is Ahn Ye Rim ghosting us again?

633
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,380
No use talking.

634
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,700
Guess she doesn't vibe with us anymore.

635
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,280
After all, she did something
during the middle school days.

636
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,600
Now she's pretending to be nice.

637
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,620
Hey, check this out.

638
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,100
Ahn Ye Rim's being ridiculous.

639
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,900
So this is the lifelong-single guy
she said was cute?

640
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,780
Ah, such a tease.

641
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,026
They're just close colleagues, right?

642
00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:27,560
If the blind date hadn't been canceled,
it would've been a disaster.

643
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,781
Now she's clearly telling us to back off.

644
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,840
Hey, even if she told me to date him, I wouldn't.

645
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,946
He's kind of a weirdo.

646
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,340
What's this advice about?

647
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,973
Just tell me quickly.

648
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:45,480
Eun Gi suggested doing a proper
personal shoot instead of fittings.

649
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,180
What do you want to do?

650
00:37:49,173 --> 00:37:51,680
I can't decide.

651
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,900
If you want to try, gaining experience is good.

652
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,680
Just don't get carried away.

653
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,540
What if you get too excited and end up confused?

654
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,680
I heard your grades are good.

655
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,266
Then you should focus on getting into college.

656
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:06,640
Okay. Thanks, Gi Jeong.

657
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,840
We are done, right? Bye.

658
00:38:12,352 --> 00:38:14,586
Could you come with me...

659
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:20,293
at least to the shoot?

660
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,453
Why should I?

661
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:28,466
- Well, it's just...
- Hey, Ahn Ye Rim.

662
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:30,370
Listen carefully one last time.

663
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:35,240
From now on, if you see me as a man, we're done.

664
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,970
Got it?

665
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,960
Then why did you save me back then?

666
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,140
This is all because of you.

667
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,160
- If it weren't for you...
- Then you'd have kept living as a troublemaker.

668
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:51,946
No. I don't do that anymore.

669
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,110
Yeah?

670
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,660
If you're gonna fake being nice, commit to it.

671
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,600
Don't make me regret helping a bully unknowingly.

672
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,890
So you hate me for that?

673
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,630
Because I was a bully?

674
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,030
No.

675
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,650
I just do.

676
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,940
Hey, what was Ye Rim talking about earlier?

677
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,849
- Are they dating?
- Ugh, no way.

678
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:35,906
No, earlier she mentioned
taking responsibility or not.

679
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,200
Exactly.

680
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,540
Hey, hey, hey.

681
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,800
What's that about?

682
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,680
She was probably talking about the first time
Gi Jeong and Ye Rim met back in the day.

683
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,866
Huh?

684
00:39:44,866 --> 00:39:47,180
She's more skilled than I thought.

685
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,210
<i>Ah, seriously.</i>

686
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,930
She's too cute.

687
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,430
<i>I'm the one who's supposed to be cooler.</i>

688
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,050
Ah, don't touch me.

689
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,930
You're still cute, you know.

690
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,670
What are you doing?

691
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:54,573
- What?
- Your hair.

692
00:40:54,573 --> 00:40:55,710
Just like this.

693
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,840
What? Darn it.

694
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,391
I rushed over.

695
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:04,310
Exactly.

696
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,770
How'd you get here in 20 minutes?

697
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,720
You said 'yes' too, right?

698
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,730
I just answered it that way.

699
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:17,890
Is your jaw okay?

700
00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:24,650
Oh, it hurts.

701
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,586
Why's your punch so strong?

702
00:41:26,586 --> 00:41:27,830
Are you a guy?

703
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,613
Because I was pissed off.

704
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:30,630
Why do you keep teasing me?

705
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,490
I told you I meant it.

706
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,331
Why can't you believe me?

707
00:41:34,331 --> 00:41:37,150
You asked me to marry you.
Would you believe it if you were me?

708
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,570
Sorry about that.

709
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,040
Then let's just pretend that never happened.
What would I have to say for you to believe me?

710
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,570
What do you keep asking me to believe?

711
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,110
That I like you.

712
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,270
What do you mean?

713
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:54,130
If I said I like you and asked you out,

714
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,270
you'd hate it, right?

715
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,690
Hey, I know everything.

716
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,493
Hey, it's a joke. Seriously.

717
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:03,000
Hey, I know too.

718
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,066
I shouldn't come on to you like that
when you're not ready.

719
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,690
What's there to be ready for?

720
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,730
That'll never happen.

721
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,890
Then why'd you ask to meet today?

722
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,870
Why do you keep joking around?

723
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,650
We've already talked about that. Done?

724
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,250
No.

725
00:42:21,693 --> 00:42:25,830
Why did you say I was pretty?

726
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,130
Was that a joke too?

727
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,690
I said it because you're pretty.

728
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:29,930
Why?

729
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,070
Don't lie.

730
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:34,920
Why do you keep treating me like a joke?

731
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,650
What's pretty about me?

732
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,390
Everything.

733
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,010
Everything's pretty.

734
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,708
See?

735
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:45,710
Why?

736
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,030
What's wrong?

737
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,970
Can't everything be pretty?

738
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:50,150
Stop it.

739
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,990
That's basically the same
as saying I'm not pretty at all.

740
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,130
So it's all lies.

741
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,550
Where's the logic in that?

742
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,550
You lack sincerity.

743
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,590
Sincerity?

744
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,190
What's that?

745
00:43:01,186 --> 00:43:03,250
Sincerity... You don't know?

746
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,510
I don't know.

747
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,750
Then if I point it out clearly,
would you believe me?

748
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,350
Huh?

749
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:12,270
See?

750
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,150
If everything's pretty,
how can I pick one? Darn it.

751
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,106
See? You can't even say it.

752
00:43:17,106 --> 00:43:19,250
Wait, wait, hold on.

753
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,530
Earlobes.

754
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,710
Everything's pretty,
but especially your earlobes are pretty.

755
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,551
- What?
- Your earlobes are really pretty.

756
00:43:27,551 --> 00:43:28,710
Huh?

757
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,770
You have a mole here, huh?

758
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,790
Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

759
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,170
Hey.

760
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,170
Why're you so red?

761
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,630
Running a fever?

762
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:43,230
Hey.

763
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,010
What should I do?

764
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,840
Ah, this is so embarrassing.

765
00:44:04,026 --> 00:44:05,770
Are you okay?

766
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,370
Yeah.

767
00:44:08,293 --> 00:44:09,710
Why'd your temperature spike suddenly?

768
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,430
Is it sudden flu-like symptoms?

769
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:14,350
- Shouldn't you take medicine?
- I'm fine now.

770
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:16,110
I'll leave now. Bye.

771
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,050
Hey.

772
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,990
We haven't even started talking.
Where are you going?

773
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,590
Huh?

774
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,360
Back here again?

775
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,480
Talk fast.

776
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,680
What is it?

777
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,380
So,

778
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,053
I won't ask to date right away.

779
00:44:34,053 --> 00:44:36,720
- Huh?
- Instead, let's be friends.

780
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,066
What?

781
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:41,746
You don't really know me, right?

782
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:45,320
How awesome I am.

783
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,680
Well, actually, how decent I am, you know.

784
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,200
I want you to have time to get to know me.

785
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,260
What's that supposed to mean?

786
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,340
So until now, if we weren't friends...

787
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,360
We haven't done enough
to really call ourselves friends.

788
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,653
But it's too comfortable to say we're not.

789
00:45:01,653 --> 00:45:03,720
It's an awkward spot, right?

790
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,466
Then let's officially
declare our friendship this time

791
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,333
and do a 'Doweon-gyeori' thing.

792
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,440
That doesn't sound quite right.

793
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,660
No. It's 'Doweon-gyeori'.

794
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,440
Hey, why are you Googling that?

795
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,120
It's 'Blood Brotherhood Oath'.

796
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,680
Not 'gyeori' but 'Blood Brotherhood Oath'.

797
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,280
Whatever!

798
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,440
Okay.

799
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,660
My friend request.

800
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,580
You'll accept it, right?

801
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,820
Why are you making a friend request
sound like a duel challenge?

802
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,653
You'll accept it, right?

803
00:45:38,306 --> 00:45:40,670
Leave now.

804
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,270
Just a little further.

805
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,770
What kind of friend takes me home?

806
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,650
Hey.

807
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,290
Friends can take you home too.

808
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,390
Anyway, go.

809
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:55,010
It'll be awkward if we meet my mom like last time.

810
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:56,610
But we're friends now?

811
00:45:57,773 --> 00:45:59,640
Anyway, go.

812
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,110
Got it.

813
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,370
But,

814
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:08,853
let's not do this friend thing
like someone else and drag it out.

815
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:09,870
Huh?

816
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:12,906
From what I've seen, that never ends well.

817
00:46:12,906 --> 00:46:16,520
Let's keep things fast and clean.

818
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,350
You know where this week's gathering is, right?

819
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:19,350
Should we meet up and go together?

820
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,030
No.

821
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,410
See you on Sunday.

822
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,010
I'll go.

823
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,830
Nam Gi Jeong.

824
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,590
Huh?

825
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,946
Don't you have an inferiority complex
or something?

826
00:46:32,946 --> 00:46:34,570
Inferiority complex?

827
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:35,790
What's that?

828
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,390
Is that some new pencil lead brand?

829
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,010
See you on Sunday! My female friend!

830
00:46:45,186 --> 00:46:48,600
'Quick and decisive', you dummy.

831
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,230
Go.

832
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,550
I don't want to say anything to you.

833
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:16,770
I said go.

834
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,710
You drama queen.

835
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:26,910
How decent I am, you know.
I want you to have time to get to know me.

836
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,910
Hey Song U Yeon, your earlobes are really pretty.

837
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,290
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

838
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,050
Oh, jeez.

839
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:37,950
Why does he go around touching
other people's earlobes like that?

840
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,040
You have a mole here, huh?

841
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,240
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

842
00:48:07,386 --> 00:48:10,520
Wow, they look awesome.

843
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,893
What are you doing? Not coming? Let's go.

844
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,380
Make some noise
when walking behind me from now on.

845
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,360
Oh, okay.

846
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:39,360
Suits you well.

847
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,640
They said it's around here.

848
00:48:51,106 --> 00:48:52,880
I guess it must be over there.

849
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,853
Huh? Baeblu, you came?

850
00:49:00,853 --> 00:49:01,910
Oh.

851
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:03,570
Have you arrived?

852
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,830
Wow, everyone looks so different.

853
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,850
You two look perfect together.

854
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,890
This is most unjust.

855
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:15,090
If I had only won at rock-paper-scissors,
I'd have become king.

856
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,640
Goodness, how daring.

857
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,310
Depose the Ping Empress immediately
and execute three generations!

858
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,450
What did you say?

859
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:23,310
- Warrior Kahyul!
- Warrior Kahyul!

860
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:27,110
Run at once to my father and tell him
to take measures to depose the king!

861
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:28,750
As you command, Your Highness!

862
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,190
Wait, weren't you supposed to be my bodyguard?

863
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:36,266
I, your humble servant,
shall take up this sword, Your Majesty!

864
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:37,350
Ugh.

865
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,350
You two-faced rat!

866
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,830
- Drag him away and execute him!
- Execute him!

867
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:42,667
Show mercy, Your Majesty.

868
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:46,530
All three names are already in the death registry.
Don't struggle pointlessly.

869
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,150
You'll all just take turns dying anyway.

870
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,600
You look amazing!

871
00:49:56,013 --> 00:49:57,586
Where's Blue Finger?

872
00:49:57,586 --> 00:49:58,770
Blue Finger?

873
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:00,750
Oh, there he is.

874
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,040
As expected, he's awesome.

875
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,518
Blue Finger.

876
00:50:29,706 --> 00:50:31,640
You dung beetle.

877
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,190
Behold. I am Nam Gi Jeong!

878
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,760
Wow, she's totally out of it.

879
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,260
Ah, this is making it way too easy.

880
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,606
- Have you come?
- Move aside.

881
00:50:46,606 --> 00:50:47,610
Huh?

882
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,340
Get out of the way.

883
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,460
<i>He's classy.</i>

884
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,400
You came?

885
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,840
Hey.

886
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,840
Hurry up and change.

887
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,510
Hey, you're the only one
who didn't change clothes.

888
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:14,440
- Wait.
- Ugh, seriously.

889
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,200
Hey, get over here quick.

890
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,880
Hold on.

891
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,480
Just once.

892
00:51:24,493 --> 00:51:26,840
Pretty. It suits you.

893
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,660
What, you've never seen someone pretty before?

894
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:32,540
Hey, Miss Piggy.

895
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,140
Come out already.

896
00:51:40,626 --> 00:51:44,110
No, this is kinda complicated.

897
00:51:51,946 --> 00:51:53,130
Why?

898
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,990
Does it look weird?

899
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:57,670
Yeah.

900
00:51:58,290 --> 00:51:59,890
Super weird.

901
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:03,070
I'm an idiot for even asking you.

902
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:18,230
Cute.

903
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:38,920
Hey.

904
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,850
What're you doing there?

905
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,070
Huh?

906
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,670
What are you doing?

907
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:52,270
Come now. Let's go together.

908
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,870
Wait, my friend.

909
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,546
Give it. It's not heavy.

910
00:53:03,546 --> 00:53:05,786
I know.

911
00:53:05,786 --> 00:53:09,290
Does Gi Jeong like Baeblu?

912
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:10,430
Yeah.

913
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:12,030
To the point of lovesickness.

914
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,266
Should I have been that obvious too?

915
00:53:16,266 --> 00:53:18,290
Would it have been easier then?

916
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,328
Let's go.

917
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,710
Hey, Green Pig.

918
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,490
What?

919
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:33,010
The one who Baeblu likes isn't Khaki.

920
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:36,430
Then who is it?

921
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:39,910
Your guy friend, Seon Ho.

922
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,470
What are you doing?

923
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:43,470
Not going?

924
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,630
I'll go.

925
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:47,610
Alright, everyone,

926
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:52,550
welcome to the Spirit Fingers
spring outdoor croquis session!

927
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,550
So, shall we start with a 1-minute sketch,
starting with Baeblu?

928
00:53:57,186 --> 00:53:58,790
Sure.

929
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:00,390
Alright, let's get started.

930
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,480
Right.

931
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:10,080
Come to think of it, we did
outdoor croquis when we first met too.

932
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,773
Couldn't have imagined this back then.

933
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:17,660
Why the grin, Lord Baeblu?

934
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:23,700
I'm confident in my poses now, you see.

935
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,826
Your posture is truly uninhibited, my lord.

936
00:54:36,826 --> 00:54:39,740
What's your concept?

937
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,586
The concept is a carefree nobleman.

938
00:54:44,586 --> 00:54:46,700
You're too adorable.

939
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:00,510
Come here, Lord Red.

940
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,170
I, I'll go.

941
00:55:07,146 --> 00:55:10,240
Hey! Snap out of it! You clueless fool!

942
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,110
Get in.

943
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,893
Why?

944
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,640
Fix it.

945
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:21,110
She has gotten quite bold, our Baeblu.

946
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:22,710
Tell me about it.

947
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:30,405
I am Mint, a court eunuch.

948
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:40,570
Am I visible to you?

949
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,170
Let's go together.

950
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:49,770
Wow, your drawing skills are improving so much.

951
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:52,150
You drew this particularly well.

952
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:57,550
Oh, I'm full.

953
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,370
Okay, everyone.

954
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:09,910
How about 30 minutes of free time to digest a bit?

955
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:10,910
Okay.

956
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,870
- Go ahead.
- No, let's all go.

957
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,680
All together.

958
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,533
Out, out, out.

959
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:31,690
I'll come too.

960
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:34,290
What?

961
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:36,750
Don't you owe me an apology?

962
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,350
For what?

963
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,773
- You touched mine back then.
- Huh?

964
00:56:52,386 --> 00:56:54,860
What nonsense is this?

965
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:59,173
Are you pretending not to know? You pretended
to fall while hiding and touched my chest!

966
00:56:59,173 --> 00:57:02,280
That was an accident.

967
00:57:06,386 --> 00:57:08,386
It was my first time.

968
00:57:08,386 --> 00:57:10,260
My purity.

969
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,260
Jeez.

970
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:19,760
I can't believe I got excited by that person.

971
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:22,460
Fine.

972
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:24,160
Sorry, I apologize.

973
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,760
Just words?

974
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,360
Then what?

975
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:37,586
Then let me touch you a bit too,
and we'll call it even.

976
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:45,770
You pervert.

977
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:48,030
Do you want to die?

978
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:49,030
Hey, why?

979
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,810
What goes around, comes around.

980
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:52,810
Hey.

981
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,910
Hey, you, stay there!

982
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:56,890
Hey!

983
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:00,030
- Are you dating me? Why keep following me?
- I'll kill you.

984
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,790
Ah, darn it.

985
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:05,090
I made space for that punk,
but he's just acting like a kid without a care.

986
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,493
This won't do. I should go...

987
00:58:06,493 --> 00:58:08,131
Don't move.

988
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,400
Just stay like that for 15 seconds.

989
00:58:18,586 --> 00:58:19,620
Done.

990
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,640
Go now.

991
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,120
Hey, I'll leave even if you don't tell me to.

992
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,520
Hey.

993
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,520
Wait.

994
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,066
Stop throwing a tantrum for no reason.
You'll get hurt.

995
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:07,398
- I'm going to wipe you out of my head entirely!
- Wipe what?

996
00:59:07,398 --> 00:59:08,450
Let go.

997
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:10,630
If you knew that, why did you
tear it up and waste money?

998
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,950
We were clueless today.

999
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,430
- Enjoy your date.
- Bye!

1000
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:14,930
Let me sleep, you punk!

1001
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:16,250
I took off my wig.

1002
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,250
This is my real hair.

1003
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:18,950
You took off your hat,
but why do you look the same?

1004
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:21,110
I've been attending drawing club
every Sunday lately.

1005
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:23,430
That jerk. Darn punk.

1006
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:24,430
Are you insane?

1007
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,510
I'll pick you up when exams end.

1008
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:29,790
If walking around together
after exams isn't a date, then what is?

1009
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:32,650
If you step in instead, I won't refuse.

1010
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,770
Should I go talk to Seon Ho?

1011
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,370
That I like him?

1012
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:41,750
Darn it, I'm late for class!

1013
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:42,870
Koo Seon Ho!

1014
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,893
Koo Seon Ho isn't here, right?

1015
00:59:44,893 --> 00:59:47,880
Darn it! Oh, sorry.

1016
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:55,430
Today was tough.

1017
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,060
Since we worked hard, let's eat something good.

1018
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,120
You've gotten so skinny from avoiding me.

1019
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,240
Let's go eat.
