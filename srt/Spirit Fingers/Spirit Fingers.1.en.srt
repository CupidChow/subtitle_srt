You're Gi Jeong, right?

557
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,800
Ye Rim told us so much about you.

558
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,367
Aren't you a shopping mall model?

559
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:40,267
Why cover your face when you're so handsome?

560
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:44,967
I've seen you a lot on InStar,
but this is my first time seeing you in person.

561
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:47,000
- It's not the first time.
- Huh?

562
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,233
I saw you earlier.

563
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,067
In front of the women's restroom.

564
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,967
<i>Don't go!</i>

565
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,600

Three more orders of pork neck, please.

567
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:19,333
Hey.

568
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,933
You ruined a perfectly good
blind date for pork neck.

569
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:24,933
Ma'am, cancel the pork neck! Three orders
of frozen belly pork instead.

570
00:32:24,933 --> 00:32:26,433
Wait, so...

571
00:32:26,433 --> 00:32:28,233
What the heck did they do earlier?

572
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:29,233
Hey, are you not eating?

573
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:31,400
I'm going to eat it.

574
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,733
Are you scared of women? Do you hate women?

575
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:35,300
No, that's not it!

576
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,633
Are you, by any chance,
planning to become a woman in the future?

577
00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:40,400
With your looks, there has to
be a reason you're still single.

578
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,767
I'm not single by choice, okay?

579
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:42,767
You're not?

580
00:32:42,767 --> 00:32:43,767
Why wouldn't it be?

581

- Darn it!

because of his older sister.

583

Sister?

584
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,467
Hey, what time is it?

585
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:51,800
- Dunno.
- It's 3 o'clock.

586

It's 3 o'clock?

587
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,467
We're doomed!

588
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:57,333
Where are you going?

589
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,533

So you're SF's new member.

Our group calls each other
by color nicknames, like this.

632
00:37:06,867 --> 00:37:09,200
You need to come up with one too.

633

Do you have a favorite color?

634
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,800
No, not really.

635
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,033

No.

Everyone has a color.

You just haven't found it yet.

639
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:27,267
Until next time, make sure you find it. Okay?

640
00:37:27,267 --> 00:37:28,300
Okay.

641
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,133
Alright, to celebrate our new member,
let's bring back an old tradition.

642
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:36,400
- To a member who forgets history...
- There is no future!

643

Let me help you with that.

644
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,633
Now, let's begin the briefing
on Spirit Fingers' history.

645
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,000
So, in the beginning,

646
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,733
Koo Seon Ho and I started it
as a study group. Just the two of us.

647
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:56,500
Hey guys, let's draw some pictures.

648

- No.
- Ugh, no.

649

- No.
- No.

650
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,267
Every time we asked the school kids,
we got rejected.

651
00:38:02,267 --> 00:38:04,100
So we had to start on our own.

652
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,433
Of course, it was fun at first.

653
00:38:06,433 --> 00:38:10,067
But then we got to the point where
we'd want to throw up just looking at each other.

654
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:13,100
That's when we decided to recruit more members.

655
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,133

<i>I don't do that kind of thing, kid.</i>

A kid who needs to find their own color.

904
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,100
Isn't your brother a high schooler?

905
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,100
Forget that brat.

906
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,167
That poop-head needs
to have his colors stripped away.

907
00:53:47,167 --> 00:53:52,633
But what is the SF spirit?

908
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:56,767
I quit modeling!

909
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:58,233
Is the great Poo Gi Jeong getting left on read?

910
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:01,333
Left on read? Never happened before
so I didn't know. It's driving me crazy.

911
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:03,300
Isn't this the first time that brat
has been interested in a girl?

912
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,733
How can you even eat ramen!

913
00:54:04,733 --> 00:54:05,767
[Nam Gi Jeong: She didn't read it yet?]
Wow, so creepy.

914
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:08,200
You know you're the perfect
guy friend material, right?

915
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,067
What do you mean,
"friends" between a guy and a girl?

916
00:54:10,067 --> 00:54:11,100
You two have kissed before, haven't you?

917
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,533
If you don't want to see me, just say so.
Why do you have to lie?

918
00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:16,000
He's totally self-centered
and glares at people all the time.

919
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,367
[I like her]
I don't know what's going on between you two.

920
00:54:17,367 --> 00:54:19,633
- If you fought, make up.
- After saying all that,

921
00:54:19,633 --> 00:54:21,833
- it sounds like a date.
- Looks like he's got a girlfriend.

922
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:23,467
Don't live your lives like this.

923
00:54:23,467 --> 00:54:26,267
I'm right behind you.

924
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:32,600
No, I said I'll just hang out for a bit!

925
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,333
I'm meeting Se Ra and Mi Rae.

926
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,467
I studied hard until yesterday.

927
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:43,933
Even if you keep comparing me to my brother,
I don't have his brains.

928
00:54:43,933 --> 00:54:46,133
Besides, he is a cheat code guy.

929
00:54:48,267 --> 00:54:50,533
Why am I not good at anything?

930
00:54:51,233 --> 00:54:53,033
Huh?

931
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,767
No.

932
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,900
Well, there's...

933
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,933
Fine.

934
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:07,733
I'll just play for two hours then go.

935
00:55:13,133 --> 00:55:15,400
Deal!

936
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,800
Still, I'm not dead.
