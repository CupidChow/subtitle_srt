I wonder what look the model
will show up with today.

120
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:25,433
Right, he makes me look forward to it every time.

121

He'll have to do more than a Harley Quinn costume.

122

Oh, really?

130
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:53,133
Did you bring a croquis book?

131
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,033
No.

132
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,632
What? You're not scared?

133
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:35,400
No, not really.

134
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,067
I might just bite you.

144
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,667
Yeah, I came as U Yeon's guest.

Yeah.

147

You two know each other? Since when?

How? Why?

150
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:21,767
We just met by chance recently.

151
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,367
She helped me when I was in trouble.

152
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:25,100
I invited her here to return the favor.

153
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,800
By chance?

154
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,467
Hey, you might not realize it,

155
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:33,300
but she's not the type to just run into someone
and help them by chance.

156
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,933
But we did meet by chance.

157
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,433
And she did help me.

158
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:39,500
Be honest.

159
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,100
She said she wanted to come here, right?

160
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,296
No,

161
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:45,500
I invited her.

162
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:51,133
Hey, maybe you really don't know,

163
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,933
but she likes me, so that's why...

164
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:55,100
I know.

165
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,608
What?

166
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,267
You knew?

167
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:00,233
I sort of heard about it.

168
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,100
Heard?

169
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,033
What exactly did you hear?

170
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,033
Yeah.

171
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:12,400
You heard and you know it.

172
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,267
But you don't care?

173
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,767
Why should I care?

181
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:49,600
- No.
- I'm sorry.

182
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,200
I told you not to say anything to him,

183
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,933
but I should've told him earlier.

184
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,104
It's nothing.

185
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:56,833
Let's go in.

186
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,433
Let's stay out a bit longer.

187
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:08,352

I really don't want to go to the study room.

189
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,533
Then just 30 more minutes, okay?

190
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:17,700
Ah, just 30 minutes.

191
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:20,032
Jeez.

192
00:11:20,032 --> 00:11:21,467
Darn it.

193
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,967
Watch where you're going.

194
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:27,267
What's wrong, Song?

195
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:29,300
Wait.

196
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,100
Just stay still for a moment.

197
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,267
So annoying.

198
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:38,600
Hey!

199
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,333
Good to see you guys.

200
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,633
- What?
- Oh, thanks.

201
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:46,300
- For showing up here.
- What's this about?

202
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,300
You know her?

203
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,500
No.

204
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,267
Who are you? You know me?

205
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:51,700
Of course.

206
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Don't you know me?

207
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,667
Who are you?

208
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm...

209
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,100
I'm Song U Yeon's bestie, you punks!

210
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:03,552
- Let her go!
- Stop!

211
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:05,100
Hey!

212
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,200
Right, time to pick a nickname for our guest.

213
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
- Oh, right.
- What color do you like?

214
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,300
Pardon?

215
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,533
<i>This is so childish.</i>

216
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,967
I...

217
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,333
White Finger, how about that?

218
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,133
Matches well with Ye Rim, right?

219
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:22,167
Oh, perfect match.

220
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,967
I like it too.

221
00:12:31,744 --> 00:12:34,933
Alright, now that the guest is here...

222
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:39,433
- Time for 'I Am Ground' introductions!
- Time for 'I Am Ground' introductions!

223
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:40,667
Stick to the concept and don't smile.

224
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:41,700
Or you'll get punished.

225
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,400
Good.

226
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,633
- Time for 'I Am Ground' introductions!
- Time for 'I Am Ground' introductions!

227
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,867
<i>What's this?</i>

228
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:50,933
<i>They really go overboard.</i>

229
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:53,100
You smiled.

230
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,487
- Lie down.
- Lie down.

231
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:59,867
- Lie down.
- Lie down.

232
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:01,567
- Ye Rim.
- Lie down.

233
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,000
- U Yeon.
- Lie down.

234
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,867
- Lie down.
- Wait.

235
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:08,600
Punishment shield.

236
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,833
Punishment shield?

237
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,100
Gi Jeong and Ye Rim know each other.

238
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,008
They are colleagues from the same studio.

239
00:13:20,864 --> 00:13:23,633
Let's get this over with!

240
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:31,067
Indian!

241
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:32,267
What are you doing?

242
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:36,267
- Indian!
- Indian!

243
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:37,440
- Rice!
- Rice!

244
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,100
Huh? Yeom Se Ra?

245
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,933
Huh? Oh Dae O?

246
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:46,133
Do you study here too? Me too, nice to see you.

247
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:49,567
Unlike Poo Gi Jeong and that perv,
you're genuinely cool.

248
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,100
What's that flower for?

249
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,667
Oh, this?

250
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:55,200
Here, take this. I found it on my way here.

251
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,400
Oh, really? But why are you saying it so casually?

252
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,000
Right. Why am I saying it so casually?

253
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:02,216
Jeez.

254
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:04,567
Huh?

255
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,233
Is that a fight?

256
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,380
Let go! Let go!

257
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:15,656
Stop it!

258
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,672
Darn you!

259
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:30,200
Darn, girls fighting...

260
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:35,100
Se Ra?

261
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,233
Se Ra?

262
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:38,467
Se Ra!

263
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:39,833
Se Ra!

264
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,467
Are you okay?

265
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:42,784
Hey, don't worry, I'm here.

266
00:14:42,784 --> 00:14:43,872
What?

267
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:46,200
Let go while I'm asking nicely.

268
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:58,767
You, I won't let this slide!

269
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,467
Hey! You squid!

270
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:16,100
Hey! Oh Dae O! You alright?

271
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:19,900
You guys are all done for!

272
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,280
Three minutes up!

273
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:41,024
Maybe it's because of today's dress code,
but everyone drew really well.

274
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:44,500
My brush pen's gliding smoothly too.

275
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,467
<i>Is that supposed to be me?</i>

276
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,967
<i>Is this really a drawing club?</i>

277
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:53,700
<i>Nobody here can draw properly.</i>

278
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,400
<i>Huh?</i>

279
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:59,967
<i>That one's actually not bad.</i>

280
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,100
Your line work's getting cleaner.

281
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,200
Really?

282
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,900
Yeah.

283
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:12,767
Right. Couple posing time is back!

284
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:14,067
Who's going to do it today?

285
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:16,200
Geu Rin and Seon Ho could...

286
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,367
Nope!

287
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,800
Hey, don't embarrass me.

288
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,867
I don't wanna do it, either.

289
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:24,200
Yeah? Well, that's a relief then.

290
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,933
Don't get all lovey-dovey here.

291
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:27,000
What's that supposed to mean?

292
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,667
I hate beans.

293
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,933
I won't even eat bean rice.

294
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,300
Goodness, you hate beans?

295
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,300
Bean hate? Is this a joke?

296
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,433
- Well...
- Excuse me...

297
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,933
Can I give it a try? With Gi Jeong?

298
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:56,000
Well, we're both pros,
so we should be able to show you properly.

299
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,333
Do it.

300
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,167
Oh, okay.

301
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:07,267
Two professional models posing
should be worth watching.

302
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:10,033
Right? Right?

303
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,433
As expected of a pro. They're really bold.

304
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:24,067
This makes me actually want to draw.

305
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:25,833
Starting now.

306
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,520
Baeblu,

307
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,300
you're not drawing?

308
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,033
Pardon?

309
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:59,533
<i>I've been like that since I was little.</i>

310
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,664
<i>A kid who didn't particularly</i>

311
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,133
<i>like or dislike anything.</i>

312
00:18:08,224 --> 00:18:10,633
<i>Coming here,</i>

313
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:14,567
<i>I finally figured out what I like,</i>

314
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,672
<i>but I still think</i>

315
00:18:16,672 --> 00:18:19,867
<i>I don't really know what I dislike.</i>

316
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:25,933
<i>I hate this.</i>

317
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:30,033
<i>I really hate this.</i>

318
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:43,233
<i>You're really the worst, Song U Yeon.</i>

319
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,400
- Talk to me.
- Ah, what is this?

320
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,167
What are you doing?

321
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:13,300
Is it the same now?

322
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,933
You feel nothing about it?

323
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:16,867
You still feel that way?

324
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:18,967
Yeah.

325
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:20,233
You really...

326
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:21,867
You're fine with me being that close to her?

327
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:23,933
What's that got to do with me?

328
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:26,533
It's not like we're dating.

329
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,233
What?

330
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:37,567
Oh, seriously!

331
00:19:38,592 --> 00:19:41,333
Good work today. Okay.

332
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:44,833
I'm really craving kimbap, tteokbokki,
and sundae. It's been so long.

333
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,033
Oh, right, kimbap, tteokbokki, and sundae.

334
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:49,100
Baeblu, are you okay with that?

335
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:54,033
Need to rush to the study room?

336
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:56,967
Not exactly.

337
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:58,767
Hey friend, come with us.

338
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:02,467
Yeah, since you're part of us today.

339
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,433
Is that alright?

340
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:06,000
Of course.

341
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,033
Thank you for looking out for me.

342
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:11,667
I'll just go. My head hurts.

343
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:12,833
Hey!

344
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,333
Oh, that punk.

345
00:20:15,936 --> 00:20:18,000
He's at it again.

346
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:23,367
When we work together,
he keeps saying he has a headache.

347
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,767
Is he hurting badly?

348
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,633
Huh? He never said anything like that.

349
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:31,600
Well, I just notice because I often see him.

350
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,400
Do you see him as often as Geu Rin does?

351
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,500
What?

352
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,567
She's Gi Jeong's sister.

353
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:40,467
Huh?

354
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,200
Oh, sorry.

355
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,700
Forgot to mention it.

356
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,900
No need to apologize.

357
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,500
Here, we don't call each other
by titles like sister or brother.

358
00:20:59,904 --> 00:21:02,233
Ah, then I'll head out first.

359
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:04,967
Gotta take care of that punk.

360
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:07,392
See you next week.

361
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,000
Take care of him?

362
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,912
Geu Rin taking care of Gi Jeong?

363
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:15,700
I'll get going too.

364
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:22,233
Ugh.

365
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:25,233
Getting over that hill ain't easy.

366
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:44,067
Thanks to you, I feel a bit better with Gi Jeong.

367
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:46,800
Thanks for today.

368
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,533
Oh, that's great.

369
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,667
But U Yeon.

370
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:58,167
Can I ask one thing?

371
00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,833
Huh?

372
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,933
Yeah, what is it?

373
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:04,983
This might be weird

374
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:07,267
to ask now but,

375
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:09,533
U Yeon, by any chance,

376
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:13,267
do you like Gi Jeong?

377
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,767
Huh?

378
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:21,567
No.

379
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:23,567
Really?

380
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:25,700
You two looked so close.

381
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,967
Thought maybe you liked him.

382
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:31,267
Then I've been cluelessly stuck between you two.

383
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,833
It's really not the case, right?

384
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,700
You're sure?

385
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:38,833
No, it's not.

386
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,667
We're just friends.

387
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:43,033
Gi Jeong suggested being friends.

388
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:44,267
U Yeon.

389
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:47,000
Will you stay friends with me long too?

390
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,933
I really like you a lot.

391
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:53,267
Let's go. I'm getting hungry.

392
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:55,400
Let's go.

393
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,200
So back then when Gi Jeong
saved you from bullies...

394
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,712
Now U Yeon got saved by coincidence?

395
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:04,768
Is that a dad joke?

396
00:23:04,768 --> 00:23:06,767
It's a rhyme.

397
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:08,933
You got it, right?

398
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:11,633
It's not like I actually saved her.

399
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:14,633
I was too scared to step in.

400
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:17,333
Is it true, Baeblu?

401
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,944
Huh?

402
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,267
Oh, right.

403
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:25,267
If not for Ye Rim, I would've
ended up like a drenched little mouse.

404
00:23:25,267 --> 00:23:28,533
Ah, so she saved you from hair loss?

405
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:34,433
Oh, because it was acid rain, hence hair loss?

406
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,712
- Is that a joke?
- Hilarious.

407
00:23:39,712 --> 00:23:40,967
Say something.

408
00:23:40,967 --> 00:23:42,800
Police station?

409
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:49,867
I really put my fighting skills
back in the day against Legend haters to use.

410
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:54,080
<i>Hey, fighting isn't the solution.</i>

411
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,233
No, stay seated.

412
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,267
Anyone hurt?

413
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:59,456
<i>Don't worry. I'm fine from head to toe.</i>

414
00:23:59,456 --> 00:24:00,800
Jeez.

415
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,433
Which police station is it?

416
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:04,100
<i>Huh?</i>

417
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,767
<i>U Yeon! It's just a district outpost,
not a police station.</i>

418
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:10,067
Ah, so where exactly is it?

419
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:12,967
Why did you call her? You're making her worry.

420
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:15,600
We should at least tell her
that we got revenge for her.

421
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,000
Hey! Oh Dae O! Are you okay?

422
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,100
Huh?

423
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,833
Oh Dae O?

424
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,552
No wonder he seemed familiar.

425
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,767
That's him, right?

426
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:27,800
The squid from the blind date with us.

427
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,900
What?

428
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,933
What?

429
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:31,767
A blind date?

430
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:35,467
Yeah, that squid who just
wouldn't stop talking back then.

431
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:38,100
Wait, you only just realized that?

432
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,300
So what? What?

433
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,333
What do you mean 'what'?

434
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:45,200
If you were me, would you
want to keep looking at your face?

435
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:53,867
So you never properly looked at my face before?

436
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,533
I saw it once.

437
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:58,267
Darn it, I only saw it once.

438
00:24:58,267 --> 00:25:00,767
Ah, my eyes!

439
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:03,467
Hey, what should I do? Are you okay?
You're not going blind, are you?

440
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:06,592
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay? Let me see.

441
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:09,184
Crazy, darn it!

442
00:25:09,184 --> 00:25:12,533
- Ah, seriously, what's wrong with you?
- Hey!

443
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:13,567
Hey! Hey!

444
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:15,633
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

445
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:17,533
Stop, no!

446
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,000
Sit down.

447
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,700
- Hey, Dae O.
- Hey, you guys.

448
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,400
Sit.

449
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:28,133
Tae Seon.

450
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:32,100
What? What's going on?

451
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,167
They hit me.

452
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:40,000
Baeblu's such a good friend.

453
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,600
Baeblu must rush over
because they're good friends, right?

454
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,633
Yes.

455
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:48,033
Hurry up. They might be waiting.

456
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:49,400
Ye Rim, I'm sorry.

457
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,967
Then I'll see you next week.

458
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,700
Yeah.

459
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,367
Then I should...

460
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:57,333
Oh, you should stay and hang out longer.

461
00:25:57,333 --> 00:26:00,600
- Huh?
- There's plenty of food left.

462
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,067
Aren't you curious about the modeling world?

463
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:03,233
I'm curious.

464
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:04,800
Then

465
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,100
what do you want to know?

466
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,600
More importantly,

467
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,200
should we finish our earlier conversation?

468
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,867
What conversation?

469
00:26:11,867 --> 00:26:13,867
About school bullies.

470
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:17,967
I have a lot to say about school bullies.

471
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:19,933
I still remember it vividly.

472
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:22,000
The faces of those who tormented me that day.

473
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,967
Their snickering laughter.

474
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:26,967
Even the disgustingly humid weather that day.

475
00:26:26,967 --> 00:26:30,367
Like they say, forgiving makes
your heart feel lighter.

476
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:32,267
Or the one who got hit sleeps well,

477
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:34,933
but the bully can't.

478
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:37,033
All that's complete nonsense.

479
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:38,367
People like that

480
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:42,900
should gather all the universe's energy
to become utterly miserable.

481
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:45,967
Exactly!

482
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:50,467
Oh, not the right vibe?

483
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:51,900
Black.

484
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,367
Did that happen to you in school?

485
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:08,333
<i>What's with her?</i>

486
00:27:13,376 --> 00:27:16,200
Wait, was she saying that for me to hear?

487
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,633
Ugh, annoying.

488
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:23,433
Came to this lousy place
and got involved with lousy people.

489
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,667
Darn, this is annoying.

490
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,633
Why are you out there?

491
00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:32,567
Because I'm too full.

492
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,600
Yeah, me too.

493
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,400
Maybe doing this will help me digest it?

494
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:39,767
By the way, mister.

495
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:41,700
Yeah?

496
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,967
About Black.

497
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,933
She's super charismatic.

498
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:48,667
Yeah, right?

499
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:53,367
Because of that, she seems to speak

500
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,933
pretty directly to you guys.

501
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:57,067
Yeah?

502
00:27:57,067 --> 00:28:00,833
I guess you don't notice
because you see her often.

503
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:06,367
Did you say your name is Ye Rim?

504
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:09,533
Excuse me, officer.

505
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:10,800
Do you have friends?

506
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,833
I do.

507
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:13,900
- Call your dad.
- Imagine a bunch of bullies

508
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,567
doodling all over your friend's face,

509
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:17,933
taking pictures, and giggling about it.

510
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:19,500
- Could you just stand by?
- What am I supposed to do?

511
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,267
Ah, but you shouldn't beat people up like this.

512
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:25,267
So even with the rain pouring
and them tossing your friend to the ground,

513
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:27,133
you'd just do nothing?

514
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:28,267
When did I say I'd just stand by?

515
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:29,433
I said I wouldn't hit anyone.

516
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:31,167
Ah, this is really annoying.

517
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,533
Yeah, we're the ones who doodled on her face,

518
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:34,967
but on a rainy day like that?

519
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:36,700
Even we didn't want to do it.

520
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,933
- Hey.
- Let go.

521
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:40,833
I'm so annoyed I can't take this anymore.

522
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:44,900
Hey, she told us to deal with
your loser friend, so we had no choice.

523
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,784
Hey, stop it.

524
00:28:46,784 --> 00:28:48,167
Leave her be, and yeah.

525
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:49,767
We were ordered to do it.

526
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:52,864
I don't even care about your loser friend
anymore, but she made us!

527
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,633
- How dare you call her a loser?
- Don't.

528
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,533
Made you?

529
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:59,833
Someone ordered you to mess with U Yeon?

530
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,867
Who? Why?

531
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:05,767
If we tell you, you two need to work it out
and be done with it, okay?

532
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:07,500
Who was it?

533
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,367
It's Ye Rim.

534
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:10,867
Do you like Gi Jeong?

535
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:11,867
Pardon?

536
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:13,767
But Gi Jeong isn't interested in you, right?

537
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:17,633
That's why you are annoyed with U Yeon, huh?

538
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,067
Well, you know how Gi Jeong is.

539
00:29:19,067 --> 00:29:22,100
This isn't about trying to impress him,

540
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,933
but rather to create conflict between them?

541
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:27,833
Did you think we wouldn't notice?

542
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:32,200
Since you guys knew everything,
you guys played along nicely, right?

543
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,600
Played along? Us? When?

544
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,033
Pretending not to know is part of the act.

545
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:39,233
We weren't pretending to go along with it.

546
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:42,433
We did it because you're just a kid.

547
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:46,200
Ye Rim.

548
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,267
Don't try acting like an adult already.

549
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:51,600
When you grow up, you'll have unavoidable reasons

550
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,000
to become pathetic sometimes.

551
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,833
We all end up becoming
mediocre losers against our will.

552
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,833
What does it matter? You're just bitter old farts.

553
00:30:15,072 --> 00:30:17,733
<i>Hey, Ahn Ye Rim. Se Ryeong spilled everything.</i>

554
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,433
What is she talking about?

555
00:30:24,128 --> 00:30:25,633
Did you scold her?

556
00:30:26,752 --> 00:30:28,433
Oh please.

557
00:30:29,568 --> 00:30:33,267
I knew you would scare her from the start,

558
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:34,467
but you held back a lot.

559
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:36,967
Why would I pull rank on a kid?

560
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:40,467
One solid and quick strike
at the right time would suffice.

561
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:43,367
But that kid was brazen till the very end.

562
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:45,967
I didn't expect her to just grab her bag
and leave without saying a word.

563
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:47,633
And right in front of us.

564
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:50,233
Kids these days are all like that, I guess.

565
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,300
Back in my day...

566
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,272
No, hear my 'back in my day' story first.

567
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:55,800
Hear my 'back in my day' story.

568
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,633
Here, drink this.

569
00:30:57,633 --> 00:31:00,033
My story's way better.

570
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:02,900
<i>Looks like you need to come here.</i>

571
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,333
<i>You should come, explain,
and apologize to settle this.</i>

572
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:08,767
<i>Ah, those lunatics say it's only
a settlement if you do that.</i>

573
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,700
<i>Even if both sides are wrong,
we're at a bigger disadvantage.</i>

574
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:22,567
Mi Rae! Yeom Se!

575
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:24,300
Song.

576
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,312
Gee.

577
00:31:25,312 --> 00:31:27,667
What happened to your face?

578
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:29,500
If we hadn't run into each other,
nothing would've happened.

579
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,400
But when they just showed up
in front of us, how could we ignore it?

580
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,833
Well, Miss Piggy.

581
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:37,000
We're here too, you know.

582
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,267
Wait, why...

583
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:42,767
Do you know Ahn Ye Rim?

584
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,567
Ye Rim?

585
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,000
How do you know Ye Rim?

586
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,467
Last time when it rained, they messed with you.

587
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:55,867
She was the one who ordered that.

588
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:01,133
What are you talking about?

589
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:04,167
Hey, you rats. Say that again.

590
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,000
You said your boss Ahn Ye Rim ordered it, right?

591
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Darn it.

592
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,633
Boss?

593
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:25,667
<i>Hey, Ahn Ye Rim, you really not coming?</i>

594
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:28,064
<i>The loser's friend's dad is a prosecutor!</i>

595
00:32:28,064 --> 00:32:31,840
<i>If my dad finds out about this again, I'm dead.</i>

596
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,200
<i>Fine, it's do or die.</i>

597
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,800
<i>I'll spill all your past stuff
on your precious InStar.</i>

598
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,833
<i>Then you know your modeling career,
or anything else, is over, right?</i>

599
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:44,067
I don't care if I don't model.

600
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:46,867
I'll just quit.

601
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:52,767
You know what makes me better than you?

602
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:57,000
I can actually take the CSAT and go to college.

603
00:32:57,933 --> 00:33:00,033
Where are you running to?

604
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:16,533
Unbelievable.

605
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:18,800
She told you that she's his ex?

606
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,000
You idiot, you actually believed that?

607
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,700
Wow, Ahn Ye Rim's terrifying.

608
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,133
She tricked you into inviting her to SF.

609
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,233
What?

610
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:32,000
And that punk Nam Gi Jeong.

611
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,767
They work together,
so he should've known what she's like.

612
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,600
Jeez.

613
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,700
Nam Gi Jeong didn't tell you anything?

614
00:33:40,384 --> 00:33:42,467
<i>Hey, you might not realize it,</i>

615
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:46,500
<i>but she's not the type to just run into someone
and help them by chance.</i>

616
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,900
She likes me.

617
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,467
- That's why...
- I know.

618
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:52,400
He told me.

619
00:33:55,392 --> 00:33:57,800
He told me, but...

620
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,067
Why would I run?

621
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:04,800
I'm just heading home.

622
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,767
See you later, Gi Jeong.

623
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:09,167
The ones at the police station right now,

624
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,367
they're your friends, right?

625
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:13,067
Huh?

626
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,733
I don't know what you're talking about.

627
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:28,567
- Right.
- And you made them bully U Yeon too?

628
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,967
Yeah.

629
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:34,033
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have touched her.

630
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:36,633
You should've kept ignoring everyone as usual.

631
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:39,300
Then maybe I could've given up too.

632
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,067
Why did it have to be that pathetic girl...

633
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:46,867
Do you know why I hate girls like you?

634
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:51,000
Because you try to use people's feelings.

635
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,400
You can't earn someone's heart that way.

636
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,700
I feel bad for her too.

637
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,467
I'll apologize if that's what you want, so...

638
00:34:58,467 --> 00:34:59,776
No,

639
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:01,900
don't apologize.

640
00:35:02,592 --> 00:35:03,900
U Yeon

641
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,933
will accept your apology and even forgive you.

642
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:08,400
So absolutely not.

643
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,033
And you don't need to apologize to me, either.

644
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:12,733
What?

645
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:25,933
Thanks to you, I'll spend my whole life
repaying my debt to U Yeon.

646
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:28,933
For giving me a reason to stay by her side,

647
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:30,433
thank you,

648
00:35:30,433 --> 00:35:31,933
Ahn Ye Rim.

649
00:35:34,304 --> 00:35:36,733
Sir, please let us go now.

650
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:39,100
We really didn't do anything wrong.

651
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,700
It's true.

652
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,533
Alright, stop making a scene.

653
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:46,600
- Is Prosecutor Yeom coming?
- Call your guardians now.

654
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,100
Se Ra.

655
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,900
Are you okay?

656
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:09,900
You should've called your mother. Why me?

657
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,100
I didn't even think about that.

658
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,567
Oh, it's hard.

659
00:36:14,567 --> 00:36:16,167
Hey.

660
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:18,100
This is weird.

661
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,367
Huh?

662
00:36:19,367 --> 00:36:21,000
What is?

663
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,200
I contacted Gi Jeong.

664
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,433
He could've come by and caused a scene already.

665
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:28,467
Song, haven't you heard from him?

666
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:30,400
He didn't come?

667
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,167
You can't reach him, can you?

668
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,767
Se Ra, your mom's coming.

669
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:44,067
Okay, it's late. Everyone go home.

670
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:46,600
- Thank you.
- Alright.

671
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:51,133
Bye.

672
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,900
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

673
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:00,167
Mi Rae, go ahead first.

674
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,333
I have somewhere to be.

675
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,200
- Where?
- See you tomorrow.

676
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,400
Huh? At this hour?

677
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:10,967
- Tae Seon, can you...
- Want me to walk you home?

678
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:13,667
Worry about yourself.

679
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:21,667
<i>Do you know why I hate girls like you?</i>

680
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:24,400
<i>Because you try to use people's feelings.</i>

681
00:38:01,024 --> 00:38:03,733
What? Want to hit me?

682
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:07,033
Was everything they said true?

683
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:08,200
You heard it already, right?

684
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,233
I want to hear it from you.

685
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:12,467
Why ask when you already know?

686
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:15,733
Darn, still pretending
to be the good one till the end.

687
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,033
I'm not that nice.

688
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:25,433
What?

689
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:28,533
When you asked if I liked Gi Jeong earlier,

690
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:32,400
I actually hoped you'd just be the bad person.

691
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,267
If you hadn't asked me,

692
00:38:36,267 --> 00:38:39,833
I might never have realized my own feelings.

693
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,312
Thanks,

694
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:42,933
Ye Rim.

695
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:46,233
For giving me a reason to stay by her side,

696
00:38:46,233 --> 00:38:47,763
thank you,

697
00:38:47,763 --> 00:38:49,300
Ahn Ye Rim.

698
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:55,200
I hope you find someone even better than Gi Jeong.

699
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,900
Bye.

700
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:11,776
<i>Nam Gi Jeong must be so disappointed in me.</i>

701
00:39:11,776 --> 00:39:14,800
<i>I would be too.</i>

702
00:39:18,433 --> 00:39:20,667
<i>Not here, either.</i>

703
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:25,167
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

704
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:28,267
<i>Gi Jeong always showed up when I struggled.</i>

705
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:29,600
- My chicken!
- My chicken!

706
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,867
Don't cower if you did nothing wrong.

707
00:39:32,832 --> 00:39:36,267
<i>When I was bullied,</i>

708
00:39:36,267 --> 00:39:39,000
<i>when I struggled with Mom...</i>

709
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:43,767
<i>If this punishment
comes from taking him for granted,</i>

710
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:46,300
<i>you deserve it, Song U Yeon.</i>

711
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:57,767
Gi Jeong.

712
00:40:04,896 --> 00:40:06,733
I'm sorry.

713
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:10,700
I was such a fool.

714
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,167
Why are you the fool?

715
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:15,667
I'm the fool.

716
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:18,533
Everything that happened to you is my fault.

717
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:19,567
Exactly.

718
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:21,667
I don't mess up spelling for nothing.

719
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:23,233
It's all because I'm stupid.

720
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:24,867
What's the point of looking good on the outside?

721
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:27,200
I didn't even notice you were hurt.

722
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:30,900
It's okay.

723
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,333
Now that you're here, it doesn't matter.

724
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,033
Really.

725
00:40:39,488 --> 00:40:41,400
I'm sorry.

726
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:44,033
Sorry, U Yeon.

727
00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:52,333
Now that I think about it,

728
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,467
I was acting really weird today.

729
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:55,900
You know what adults say?

730
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,100
It's like I was possessed.

731
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:01,867
I have something to tell you.

732
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:03,933
I...

733
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:05,667
I...

734
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:09,567
I think I like you.

735
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,100
What?

736
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:17,667
I think I like you too.

737
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:23,600
Forget it. If you didn't hear me, just leave.

738
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,867
I like you more.

739
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,767
I like you more, U Yeon.

740
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:46,500
Yeom Se Ra, are you out of your mind?

741
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,467
You had to cause trouble at a time like this?

742
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:49,800
Stop it.

743
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,133
I never asked you to take care of my child.

744
00:41:52,133 --> 00:41:53,400
Stay out of it.

745
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,733
You don't even care about her. Why interfere?

746
00:41:55,733 --> 00:41:59,333
You think dropping by every six months
and acting nice makes up for everything?

747
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,133
Se Ra.

748
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:04,367
You'll be a senior next year.

749
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:07,967
I thought you were doing fine alone.

750
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:13,067
Mom, so you do know I'll be a senior next year.

751
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:15,800
You've shown so little interest.
I figured you wouldn't even know.

752
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,333
Se Ra, what's gotten into you?

753
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:19,767
What kids take care of themselves like me?

754
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:22,233
Even though you and Dad
both refused to take me in,

755
00:42:22,233 --> 00:42:23,867
I grew up on my own

756
00:42:23,867 --> 00:42:25,667
and never once lost first place in my class.

757
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:28,333
What more do you want from me?

758
00:42:31,267 --> 00:42:33,067
Se Ra.

759
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,900
Se Ra.

760
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:52,767
I'm sorry.

761
00:43:14,784 --> 00:43:17,467
Where have you been all this time, huh?

762
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:20,633
You didn't answer your phone,
and you weren't at the study room!

763
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,300
Are you seriously going to keep acting like this?

764
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,667
How long are you going to
keep rebelling like this?

765
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,733
So you've decided not to talk at all now?

766
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:35,200
How long are you going to keep ignoring me?

767
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:46,533
I'm sorry, Mom.

768
00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:50,467
Something happened
with Se Ra and Mi Rae, so I stayed late.

769
00:43:50,467 --> 00:43:52,267
I'm not being rebellious.

770
00:43:52,267 --> 00:43:55,067
Sorry for not answering calls.

771
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:56,576
Sorry for...

772
00:43:56,576 --> 00:43:59,200
being rude last time too.

773
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,933
I won't do that again.

774
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:12,533
I'll go shower.

775
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:14,500
You should cool off too, Mom.

776
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:39,600
What a day it's been.

777
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,433
Even after living 18 years,

778
00:44:42,433 --> 00:44:45,400
the world is still full of things
I don't understand.

779
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:48,167
Right, Delulu?

780
00:44:54,267 --> 00:44:56,067
<i>I know.</i>

781
00:44:56,067 --> 00:44:59,967
<i>That at some point, Delulu disappeared.</i>

782
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:02,933
<i>And today I realized</i>

783
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:05,833
<i>that with or without Delulu,</i>

784
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:10,867
<i>I've always made decisions
that stayed true to myself.</i>

785
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:15,533
<i>Even if those choices were
the wrong ones, as they often were.</i>

786
00:45:15,533 --> 00:45:20,367
<i>Even if that meant facing pain
and getting hurt all over again.</i>

787
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:23,367
Yeah, you heard and you know it.

788
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:24,700
But you don't care?

789
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,200
Why should I care?

790
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,400
<i>Lies.</i>

791
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,233
What's that got to do with me?

792
00:45:29,233 --> 00:45:31,200
<i>Upon lies...</i>

793
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,667
<i>I spent the day telling lies upon lies.</i>

794
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,367
U Yeon, do you like Gi Jeong?

795
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:41,376
Huh?

796
00:45:41,376 --> 00:45:44,300
If you hadn't asked me,

797
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,367
I might never have realized my own feelings.

798
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:48,967
<i>In the end,</i>

799
00:45:48,967 --> 00:45:52,200
<i>I'm someone who always finds a way,</i>

800
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,900
<i>no, someone who knows
how to find the best conclusion for myself.</i>

801
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,733
I think I like you.

802
00:45:58,733 --> 00:45:59,733
What?

803
00:45:59,733 --> 00:46:02,300
<i>Even if I don't know much,
even if I'm a little slow...</i>

804
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,733
[Would you like to accept the membership?]
<i>Eventually,</i>

805
00:46:03,733 --> 00:46:08,400
<i>believing that I'm someone
who can actually get there,</i>

806
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,700
<i>that's my way of loving myself.</i>

807
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,233
<i>Even without Delulu,</i>

808
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:18,176
<i>now</i>

809
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:19,867
<i>I know.</i>

810
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,733
<i>I don't know anymore.</i>

811
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:37,533
Me, dating Koo Seon Ho?

812
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:46,400
<i>No way. No.</i>

813
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:52,433
<i>Then what if Koo Seon Ho
falls in love with some other girl?</i>

814
00:46:56,133 --> 00:46:58,336
Honestly,

815
00:46:58,336 --> 00:47:01,033
that doesn't feel great, either.

816
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,867
You like Koo Seon Ho, don't you?

817
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:08,933
I do.

818
00:47:08,933 --> 00:47:11,533
Do you feel good when you're with him?

819
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:12,800
- Of course, I do.
- Comfortable?

820
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,333
Very comfortable.

821
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:16,933
Then you've got a bit of possessiveness
toward him, don't you?

822
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,500
Well...

823
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:24,967
I mean, maybe a little bit.

824
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,700
You kinda want exclusive rights
to him too, don't you?

825
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:33,833
Yeah, I do.

826
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:36,500
So if Koo Seon Ho gets married,
would you be 100% happy for him?

827
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,933
Certainly not 100%, no.

828
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:47,900
Okay, last question.

829
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,467
Do you get butterflies when you're with him?

830
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:55,767
You mean, do I get butterflies thinking about him?

831
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,733
[Koo Seon Ho]
What's this? It's nearly at dawn.

832
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:05,233
Today I'll break this elephant curse.

833
00:48:07,233 --> 00:48:09,133
Ugh, seriously.

834
00:48:12,128 --> 00:48:13,736
Jeez.

835
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,600
Why does he look different again?

836
00:48:27,167 --> 00:48:28,667
You're here.

837
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,000
I am.

838
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,133
No chit-chat. Solve it quick.

839
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,633
Solve it.

840
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,967
Ah, I said solve it!

841
00:48:37,967 --> 00:48:40,267
- I can't solve it.
- Hey!

842
00:48:40,267 --> 00:48:44,200
Even if I want to solve it, I don't know how.

843
00:48:45,667 --> 00:48:48,832
Oh, so you poisoned me

844
00:48:48,832 --> 00:48:50,967
and now you're saying there's no antidote?

845
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:53,900
Your choice of words...

846
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:57,300
Can't you be more romantic?

847
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,200
What romance is there between us?

848
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,400
What?

849
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,600
Why those puppy eyes?

850
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,300
You think I'll fall for that act?

851
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,667
I'm not buying it.

852
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:09,467
Look at your track record.

853
00:49:09,467 --> 00:49:10,900
Never once wavered.

854
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,600
And your confession to me came so easily, too.

855
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,333
Even if I ran wild with flowers in my hair,
you'd watch from above like some deity,

856
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:18,200
even throwing curses my way.

857
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,833
So confident, huh?

858
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,633
Darn show-off.

859
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:24,767
Did it look easy for me?

860
00:49:25,467 --> 00:49:27,167
Huh?

861
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:34,133
It wasn't easy at all.

862
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:38,667
Every single day, I was shaken and anxious.

863
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:41,033
If you were me, could you really stay calm?

864
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:44,000
I'm not some extraordinary guy, you know.

865
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,800
No, I mean...

866
00:49:50,464 --> 00:49:53,967
I honestly don't even know anymore.

867
00:49:53,967 --> 00:49:55,700
It's not that I dislike you.

868
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,933
No, I do like you.

869
00:49:57,933 --> 00:50:00,067
But I just can't picture it.

870
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:02,367
How could we become lovers?

871
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,100
If we dated, we'd have to...

872
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,667
We'd need to kiss.

873
00:50:07,667 --> 00:50:10,333
I just can't imagine kissing you.

874
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:12,267
No matter how hard I try,

875
00:50:12,267 --> 00:50:13,967
I can't picture it.

876
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:16,933
It doesn't even feel real.

877
00:50:29,867 --> 00:50:31,567
<i>A star</i>

878
00:50:32,467 --> 00:50:37,333
<i>grows, little by little, over billions of years.</i>

879
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:41,233
<i>But when gravity can't withstand
its own energy anymore,</i>

880
00:50:41,233 --> 00:50:43,800
<i>then boom, it explodes.</i>

881
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,700
<i>The star</i>

882
00:50:52,033 --> 00:50:54,033
<i>has exploded.</i>

883
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:01,067
Seon Ho.

884
00:51:24,704 --> 00:51:27,067
We're dating, we're really dating!

885
00:51:27,067 --> 00:51:29,333
Thinking about Gi Jeong
just fills you with energy, huh?

886
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:31,467
- Yeah.
- Lacks thrill now.

887
00:51:31,467 --> 00:51:33,267
The adrenaline of almost getting caught...

888
00:51:33,267 --> 00:51:34,400
- A date?
- A date?

889
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,400
You got a boyfriend?

890
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,900
- I don't like him.
- Hey, squirt.

891
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,496
- Want ice cream?
- Yes.

892
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:40,567
- Come on!
- Coolest guy ever.

893
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:42,733
I'll play the fool a thousand times for you.

894
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,400
Since you started dating that punk...

895
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,667
I've totally forgotten him.

896
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:47,567
You're so obvious.

897
00:51:47,567 --> 00:51:49,233
Did your parents teach you to lie?

898
00:51:49,233 --> 00:51:50,833
Can't let this slide.

899
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:53,100
If he starts acting up, give him a good smack.

900
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,067
If you don't have a girlfriend,
how about my sister?

901
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:17,767
<i>He doesn't like me because I'm overweight.</i>
