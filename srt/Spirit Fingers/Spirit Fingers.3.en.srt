Do you like Seon Ho?

7
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:49,761
I'm asking if you like him?

8
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:58,661
You like him.

00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:16,681
[Episode 3]
Ugh! What is this feeling?

10
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:20,917
<i>Do you like Seon Ho?</i>

11
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:24,141
What am I supposed to do?

12
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:25,961
Why can't you say it?

13
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:29,531
Why can't you say it?

14
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:30,651
"I like him."

15
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:31,681
"He's my soulmate."

16
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:33,621
Why can't you say it?

17
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:35,901
Did I do something wrong again?

18
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:37,735
- Should I have told him?
- Are you crazy?

19
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:39,449
You did well this time.

20
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:42,432
- Your shyness and lameness saved you.
- What?

21
00:01:42,432 --> 00:01:45,152
What are you staring at? You already know.

22
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:46,786
If you admit it,

23
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:49,358
it's only a matter of time
before Seon Ho finds out.

24
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:55,251
- He's not the type to tell.
- No, he isn't.

25
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:57,851
But you know, even if you can trust the person,
you can't trust the situation.

26
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:01,769
A situation could arise where he just
blurts it out without realizing it.

27
00:02:04,306 --> 00:02:05,758
Shall we continue our conversation?

28
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:09,586
Do you hate it or like it if Seon Ho finds out?

29
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:14,878
- I hate it.
- Why?

30
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:19,895
Because I'll definitely get rejected.

31
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:21,941
Just thinking about it makes me cringe.

32
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,226
Shut up, okay?

33
00:02:29,255 --> 00:02:31,121
Okay.

34
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,891
Goodnight, love you.

35
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:45,841
No way!

36
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:48,603
How did he know?

37
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,889
Not knowing would've been weird.

38
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:52,638
It's so obvious.

39
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:54,171
You must have been giving it away, right?

40
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:56,752
You just saw his face and
smiled like an idiot, didn't you?

41
00:02:56,752 --> 00:02:58,901
Have some pride.

42
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:02,306
So? What did he say?

43
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:04,158
No idea.

44
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:06,681
He just said, 'you like him,' and left.

45
00:03:06,681 --> 00:03:08,935
Just like that?

46
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:12,261
What was his tone when he said, 'you like him'?

47
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:14,551
Gosh, I can't tell.

48
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:16,321
I was too shocked.

49
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,592
Like making fun of you?

50
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,353
- Look closely, ta-da!
- You like him.

51
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:26,969
- Why push me?
- You like him.

52
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:30,229
You like him.

53
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:31,289
You like him.

54
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,591
Ugh, it's all mixed up.

55
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:35,893
<i>Do you like him?</i>

56
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:40,725
<i>You like him.</i>

57
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:44,558
But he seemed angry.

58
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,071
- Angry?
- Yeah.

59
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:52,091
Right, that's it.

60
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:54,221
Furious, completely pissed off.

61
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:56,295
I heard his sister and that guy like each other.

62
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:58,421
No, she said they're just friends.

63
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:00,272
'Just friends' between a guy and a girl? Nonsense.

64
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:01,701
They're clearly flirting.

65
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:04,695
He's mad you might interfere
with his sister's love life.

66
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:07,289
Even if their sibling chemistry is
fire, his sister matters most.

67
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,301
Why would some random girl matter?

68
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:15,232
- Right?
- Maybe he's just mad that she likes him.

69
00:04:15,928 --> 00:04:17,598
Gosh.

70
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:18,969
Dude, I got the chills.

71
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:22,421
True friends wake you up harshly
when needed, even if it hurts.

72
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:23,632
Where's the proof that I'm wrong?

73
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:24,681
It's right here.

74
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,711
Watch carefully again.

75
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:29,665
Ta-da! Crazy chemistry!

76
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:35,221
U Yeon.

77
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:41,641
Nam Gi Jeong! Ta-da! Insane!

78
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:43,881
All three have model vibes.

79
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:46,631
Even if you make that sad
face, it can't be helped.

80
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:47,801
Chemistry is science.

81
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,451
There's no particular reason
for Nam Gi Jeong to like U Yeon,

82
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:51,601
but are there plenty of reasons
for him not to like her?

83
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:53,361
Isn't it obvious?

84
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:54,801
- He's a model.
- Hey.

85
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:57,309
We're not talking about him and me right now.

86
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:59,932
I was about to get annoyed.

87
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:04,941
But Mi Rae,

88
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:06,991
you're right about everything.

89
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:09,265
I know you're a sharp-shooter,

90
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:13,976
but sometimes, please,
miss the target a little. Let's go.

91
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:16,721
Go easy on her.

92
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,443
Even if you miss, everyone
knows you're my best friend.

93
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:22,865
Hey, what did I...

94
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,431
Why did you call me?

95
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:42,491
Last night... last night...

96
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:45,171
you asked me something weird.

97
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:47,532
I don't like Seon Ho.

98
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:50,954
Why ask that out of nowhere?
It made me feel weird.

99
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,001
No, it's just...

100
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:02,701
It's not really something I need to explain,

101
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:07,932
but since you basically declared
it a fact, got mad and left...

102
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:09,354
Did I get mad and leave?

103
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:11,176
You seemed mad yesterday.

104
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,776
Why would I be mad?

105
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:15,398
Why should I care who you
like? Why would I be upset?

106
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:18,243
I never said you were upset.

107
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:21,398
Anyway, I was not mad.

108
00:06:21,398 --> 00:06:24,065
Then why did you leave without
even saying goodbye yesterday?

109
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:27,976
Because... my stomach hurt.

110
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:31,471
- Don't you know I have IBS?
- I didn't.

111
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:32,581
Hey, really!

112
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:33,831
How could you not know that?

113
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:35,121
How did we first meet?

114
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:39,398
If I didn't have that condition, would
I ask a random stranger for tissue?

115
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:43,631
But if I had that condition,
I would carry tissues around.

116
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:46,376
That's why I never thought you had IBS.

117
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:50,154
Why are you so smart?

118
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:54,376
Oh right, you said you're good at studying.

119
00:06:58,511 --> 00:06:59,781
Why are you laughing?

120
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:03,132
It's so weird. Why is everything
so easy when I'm with you?

121
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:07,398
No matter how serious it is,
it becomes nothing. It's strange.

122
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:14,509
- Then, I'm relieved.
- Huh?

123
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:21,976
Wait, so you don't like Seon Ho?

124
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:29,557
Yeah, he's just a nice guy.

125
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,341
Got it.

126
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:35,381
I can't make it to this week's gathering
because of my part-time job.

127
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:56,643
You should learn how to lie better, kid.

128
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,731
Not bad, your lying has improved.

129
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:01,961
- Was it okay?
- You did well.

130
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:05,887
But you hesitated for a beat.

131
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:11,532
I was worried you'd say you liked Seon Ho.

132
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:16,831
Gi Jeong really needs to learn how to lie better.

133
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:19,087
He said he wasn't mad, but he was totally mad.

134
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:21,576
This feels like the right thing to say.

135
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,231
You did well this time.

136
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:29,091
Of course, being honest and confident is the best,

137
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,932
but you have to look before you leap.

138
00:08:31,932 --> 00:08:36,401
If you're honest and confident and end up being
teased about it forever, you might want to die.

139
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:39,798
Always put yourself first.

140
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:45,487
Now, go back to how you were.

141
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:48,465
Keep Seon Ho as your eternal one-sided love.

142
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:50,431
That's better, right?

143
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,309
The excitement, butterflies
and occasional heart-flutters.

144
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:06,868
[The system is down.]

145
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:09,751
Let's mourn the death of this assignment.

146
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,691
Ugh, so frustrating!

147
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:16,776
I'm doomed.

148
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:20,821
This is divine intervention.

149
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:22,901
How about a beer? Deal?

150
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:25,261
We still have time before the deadline.

151
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:27,351
- Hurry up and start again.
- Yeah.

152
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:29,651
This is so typical of you.

153
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:33,798
Okay, let's try again.

154
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:38,773
Hey!

155
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:42,331
- Hey...
- Hey, wait.

156
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,521
Stay still.

157
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:44,841
Am I bleeding?

158
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:47,132
Luckily, no blood.

159
00:09:47,132 --> 00:09:49,976
Watch where you're going next time.

160
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:59,932
<i>To me, you're a girl. That's why it's a problem.</i>

161
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:10,837
[Koo Seo No, you jerk!]

162
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:14,998
Hey, Seon Ho.

163
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:20,554
Coffee delivery is here.

164
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:22,687
This is my junior from
the first year, Kang Ji Won.

165
00:10:23,351 --> 00:10:25,843
I'm Koo Seon Ho, Geu Rin's friend.

166
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:29,671
You look even better up close.
Speak casually, please.

167
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,861
Don't even mention it. This kid
has been driving me crazy,

168
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:35,391
- saying she wants to get close to you.
- True, I made a scene.

169
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,198
She's such a rare, adorable junior.

170
00:10:38,198 --> 00:10:42,154
Myeong Hun's a great junior too.

171
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:46,001
I want to be more than a good junior.

172
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:49,111
Myeong Hun, listen up.

173
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:50,761
There's no room for 'good men' in my life.

174
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:53,791
Only good friends, brothers, and juniors.

175
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,981
If you can't keep boundaries, I will. Don't worry.

176
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:58,361
Wow, you're such a girl crush.

177
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:00,381
It's not like boundaries are visible.

178
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:01,671
How can you stick to it perfectly?

179
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:04,865
Hey, if I tell you to stick to it,
stick to it. Is this insubordination?

180
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,909
It's not insubordination,

181
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:09,331
it's just... I want to be seen as
a good man rather than a good junior.

182
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:10,332
It's insubordination.

183
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:13,881
Rules are meant to be broken,
and promises are meant to be bent.

184
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,981
Why are you talking back?

185
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:17,001
If you don't cross the line, it's fine.

186
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:19,901
Lines exist to be crossed!

187
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:21,843
They exist to be kept.

188
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:28,065
We'll get going then.

189
00:11:28,065 --> 00:11:30,551
Geu Rin, we'll get going then.

190
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:36,643
Stop hitting on him! See you tomorrow. Come on.

191
00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:38,781
Bye.

192
00:11:39,976 --> 00:11:43,309
You two look good together.

193
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:48,231
- Let's go.
- Koo Seon Ho, go home.

194
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:50,332
If you take me home first,
you have to go all the way back.

195
00:11:50,332 --> 00:11:54,801
- Go. Don't be weird.
- It's still early. I haven't even had a drink.

196
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:58,554
Only transform into my private jet
when I'm black-out drunk.

197
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:05,971
Jeez, so awkward.

198
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:08,401
Don't be so serious. What about my limbs?

199
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:11,421
Hey!

200
00:12:11,421 --> 00:12:13,571
I'm doing this so I'll feel less
sorry to your future wife.

201
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:15,901
What if I send you to her with worn-out
bones from doing all the work?

202
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,798
If you can't use your strength when you need to,
I'll become your family's sworn enemy.

203
00:12:23,887 --> 00:12:26,198
Stop it.

204
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:31,398
Bye.

205
00:12:31,398 --> 00:12:35,001
Oh right, what's this week's concept?

206
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:38,643
Bye, my friend Koo Seon Ho. See you tomorrow.

207
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:46,961
<i>What should this week's concept be?</i>

208
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:48,241
<i>Suggestions are welcome!</i>

209
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:49,265
<i>- The King's Woman.
- Book Club.</i>

210
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:50,421
<i>- In Search of a Poet.
- Mental Anguish.</i>

211
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:51,891
<i>- Here We Go Again.
- Gone With the Wind.</i>

212
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:53,087
<i>No comments.</i>

213
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:55,029
This is fun.

214
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:02,611
But why isn't Seon Ho saying anything?

215
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:05,398
<i>Why isn't Baeblu saying anything?</i>

216
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:10,741
<i>I'll just go with whatever's decided.</i>

217
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:13,361
<i>That's not how it works. Unacceptable.</i>

218
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:15,351
<i>Let's pick a penalty. This time Baeblu decides.</i>

219
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:19,798
Huh? Me?

220
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:22,951
<i>It's Baeblu's turn.</i>

221
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:29,532
<i>Baeblu! Baeblu! Baeblu! Baeblu!</i>

222
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:41,443
<i>Hey! Nam Gi Jeong! No input?
Why are you just lurking?</i>

223
00:13:43,132 --> 00:13:46,198
Gi Jeong isn't saying anything, either.

224
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,681
<i>Yes...</i>

225
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:00,821
They're practically invisible. So transparent.

226
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:03,176
What? What's this?

227
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:06,954
Wait, I need to focus.

228
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,909
<i>Hey, can you talk right now?</i>

229
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:18,821
So transparent, right?

230
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:25,087
- What? Where's he going?
- Nice! Where's he headed?

231
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:30,954
- Gi Jeong.
- What? What?

232
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,561
You saw SF's group chat, right?

233
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:36,601
The crucial task of deciding
this week's concept fell on me.

234
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:39,281
What's so important about that?

235
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:42,421
Are you entering the Biennale or something?

236
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:45,571
Or walking the Academy's red carpet?

237
00:14:45,571 --> 00:14:49,081
Maybe directing a Grammy stage?

238
00:14:49,081 --> 00:14:53,976
It's just that I've never taken
the lead on anything before.

239
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:58,554
<i>- Hey, you...</i>
- That's not it. I'm afraid I'll disappoint everyone.

240
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:01,111
What if everyone hates it?

241
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:03,801
What if they pretend to like it when they don't?

242
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:05,976
- That would be a nuisance, wouldn't it?
- You dummy.

243
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:08,401
How is that a nuisance?

244
00:15:08,401 --> 00:15:12,109
Hey, then just make the concept
'Things That Suck.'

245
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:15,061
- Problem solved. The worse, the better.
- Huh?

246
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:18,991
Everyone will scramble to come dressed
as the worst thing they can think of.

247
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:21,871
Look at Green Pig.

248
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,921
Are there any normal people in that group
who would be disappointed?

249
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,441
- Ah...
- What 'ah'?

250
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:30,941
Why are you always so anxious about everything?

251
00:15:30,941 --> 00:15:33,398
Just go for it. Anything.

252
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:36,591
- This is why I called.
- What?

253
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:39,601
I told you why I wanted to talk.

254
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:42,598
Talking to you makes everything easier.

255
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:48,121
I feel stronger talking to you.
There is no logical reason,

256
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:54,243
but you're a miracle. Thanks.

257
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:56,598
You helped me decide what to do.

258
00:15:57,354 --> 00:16:00,371
Got it. Bye.

259
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:03,309
- Gi Jeong!
- What? What?

260
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:06,287
Are you really not mad?

261
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:19,043
You don't actually like Seon Ho, right?

262
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:23,932
- Shut up.
- No.

263
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:28,111
Fine. I'm not mad, either. Bye.

264
00:16:34,554 --> 00:16:37,532
I finally moved on. Why bring it up again?

265
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:49,109
- About what? Huh?
- Gosh!

266
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:53,451
Who likes Seon Ho?

267
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:55,081
Wait, who's Seon Ho?

268
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,081
Geu Rin's friend,

269
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,841
from the drawing club.

270
00:16:57,841 --> 00:17:00,211
Him? Who likes him?

271
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:03,791
Miss Piggy? That Miss Piggy likes him?

272
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:07,354
So that's why you're upset?

273
00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:10,891
My sister. I'm talking about Green Pig.

274
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:13,887
Nam Geu Rin likes Seon Ho.

275
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:18,081
Okay. That's possible.

276
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:21,176
But why are you upset?

277
00:17:22,465 --> 00:17:25,532
I'm her younger brother!

278
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:28,481
So, I'd surely feel a little bad,
and it could be that.

279
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,087
Think about it, guys.

280
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:37,532
Do you like Seon Ho? Seriously?

281
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:40,821
So that's why you were upset.

282
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:42,821
No! Really! Stop it!

283
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:45,532
We're friends! I mean it.

284
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,354
Don't call us friends!

285
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:49,576
Don't come near me!

286
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:54,598
My concept is...

287
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,376
something I've never tried my whole life.

288
00:18:02,421 --> 00:18:05,309
And probably never will.

289
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:08,198
Because I'd definitely fail.

290
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:17,932
<i>♫ G.O.A.T. G.O.A.T. ♫</i>

291
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:22,151
<i>Let's try it once before I die, 'girl crush'.</i>

292
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:25,891
<i>♫ I'm the bottom line ♫</i>

293
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:27,665
<i>♫ I'ma make my moves ♫</i>

294
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:28,751
<i>♫ Better hurry up ♫</i>

295
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:31,671
<i>♫ What you waiting for ♫</i>

296
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:34,381
<i>♫ I'm your go-to ♫</i>

297
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:38,865
- Baeblu!
- Hello.

298
00:18:40,465 --> 00:18:44,554
- Ready to transform, Baeblu?
- Yes.

299
00:18:46,243 --> 00:18:48,598
This is totally U Yeon's style. U Yeon!

300
00:18:48,598 --> 00:18:50,731
This is so hip. So cool.

301
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:53,443
- How about this?
- This looks better.

302
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:04,501
Not this? What then?

303
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,761
It's a 'girl crush' concept.

304
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:31,121
But why does she look cute in everything?

305
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,421
Wait. Let me try something.

306
00:19:41,443 --> 00:19:46,151
Ta-da! Looks perfect. Right?

307
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,951
I've never tried this hairstyle before.

308
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:49,821
I think it's good.

309
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:53,111
Wait, there's an outfit I had my eye on. Hold on.

310
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:54,998
I also picked something out.

311
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:15,798
<i>To be honest, I've never
really gone shopping properly.</i>

312
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:27,081
- Ta-da! How do I look?
- Hmm, pretty and cute.

313
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:31,151
Even when shopping with friends,
I'd end up empty-handed.

314
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:33,265
It always ended with me just agreeing with them.

315
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,911
Song, aren't you buying anything?

316
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:38,865
You said that was pretty. At least try it on.

317
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:46,154
<i>Even if I saw clothes I liked...</i>

318
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:50,091
No, it probably won't look good on me.

319
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:54,732
<i>So I always bought clothes that
were unnoticeable, just like me.</i>

320
00:20:57,843 --> 00:20:59,976
Why? Do you like that?

321
00:21:00,631 --> 00:21:03,081
I just thought it looked nice.

322
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:06,251
- I've wanted to try this style.
- Then, try it.

323
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:08,376
You have to try clothes on to know.

324
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:12,198
- No, I've never worn clothes like this...
- We'll try this.

325
00:21:24,331 --> 00:21:27,501
- Does it look weird?
- No, not at all.

326
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:29,301
You like it?

327
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:34,931
- Yes! Totally.
- Then it's settled.

328
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:37,231
- Shopping done. She'll wear this.
- Wait a moment.

329
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:40,154
Why? Is there a problem?

330
00:21:40,154 --> 00:21:42,641
I was wondering if I should
buy something more plain.

331
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:45,087
I probably won't wear it much anyway.

332
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:46,741
Are you from the future?

333
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:49,091
Giving up in advance? That's a bad habit.

334
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:53,391
So what? Just wear it once. Let's go!

335
00:21:53,391 --> 00:21:55,761
<i>Why are you always so anxious about everything?</i>

336
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:58,131
<i>Just go for it.</i>

337
00:21:58,131 --> 00:22:01,487
Then I'll leave wearing this.

338
00:22:06,865 --> 00:22:11,051
Wow, look how pretty they are. Are they models?

339
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:13,491
Whoa, so stunning.

340
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:17,976
Hey, isn't that the loser girl?

341
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:21,354
Huh? No way.

342
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,451
That's great.

343
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:30,171
If she was alone, I'd totally
shake her down. Forget it.

344
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:31,771
No word from Ahn Ye Rim?

345
00:22:31,771 --> 00:22:33,309
Is she coming today or not?

346
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:37,176
Gosh! I just got a text. She can't make it.

347
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:44,789
Jeez, so annoying. She made us wait all this time.

348
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:47,441
Okay. Next pose.

349
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:51,132
Let's try crossing arms gently.

350
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:55,771
Let's take a short break.

351
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:57,601
We barely shot anything! Break already?

352
00:22:57,601 --> 00:22:59,151
Let's just power through.

353
00:22:59,151 --> 00:23:00,441
- Faster.
- Just a short break.

354
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:02,687
Ye Rim isn't even complaining.

355
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:04,241
It's hot. Let's rest for five minutes. Seriously.

356
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:06,709
Hey, the boss is talking here.

357
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:09,041
Aren't you coming? Coming or not?

358
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,841
I'll go drag him here.

359
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:12,751
Let's just rest for five more minutes.

360
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:14,411
We've got plenty of time.

361
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:18,065
Fine. Let's rest.

362
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:29,921
[Oh! You met U Yeon?]

363
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:38,643
Man, this weather's insane.

364
00:23:42,325 --> 00:23:47,265
- Why no progress in your crush?
- Stop it.

365
00:23:47,265 --> 00:23:50,554
- Siblings fighting over one guy?
- Ridiculous.

366
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,741
- My heart aches.
- Aches indeed.

367
00:23:52,741 --> 00:23:55,443
- This is boring.
- It's fun! Really!

368
00:23:55,443 --> 00:23:58,241
But you know, Seon Ho and Geu Rin
have been close for a long time.

369
00:23:58,241 --> 00:24:00,821
They've been friends since middle school.

370
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:04,021
Where do you fit between them?

371
00:24:04,021 --> 00:24:06,021
You haven't confessed yet, right?

372
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:11,301
Don't confess! Just don't. Please.

373
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:16,109
If you do that and get rejected hard, you'll be
banging your head in the closet again screaming.

374
00:24:18,601 --> 00:24:21,309
- Did you actually confess?
- Jeez, you scared me.

375
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:25,887
Are you going to keep doing
this? It's not even funny.

376
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:28,931
What's not fun?

377
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:31,398
Gi Jeong likes some guy.

378
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:35,843
- Tae Seon, Dae O, come here.
- Yes?

379
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,561
Is your phone broken?

380
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:52,381
No. Stop sending me selfies.

381
00:24:52,381 --> 00:24:53,571
Because you're not replying.

382
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:57,231
I keep asking if I look good, and you ignore me.

383
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:59,941
- Why won't you reply?
- Why are you asking me that?

384
00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:02,198
You'd know if you looked in the mirror.

385
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:06,598
I want to hear it from you, that's all.

386
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:14,732
- How many outfits left?
- Five. Why?

387
00:25:17,621 --> 00:25:19,176
I'll finish them in thirty minutes.

388
00:25:19,176 --> 00:25:22,831
You'll finish? Oh wow, Mr. Hotshot
here. Who do you think you are?

389
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:23,971
I'll do as instructed.

390
00:25:23,971 --> 00:25:26,401
Whether it's linking arms or putting
an arm around the shoulder, I'll do it all.

391
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:29,851
I can even do a pose that's
stronger than what you want.

392
00:25:29,851 --> 00:25:32,465
Nice! Next pose!

393
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,533
Okay.

394
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:41,887
Oh, this works.

395
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:47,665
Good. More! Just a bit more.

396
00:25:49,932 --> 00:25:51,561
Okay, got it!

397
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:54,154
Got the shot. We're wrapping up.

398
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:56,961
Done? Are we finished? Bye.

399
00:25:57,665 --> 00:26:00,351
- Hey! Change first.
- I'm late.

400
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,376
Hey, where are you going?

401
00:26:03,532 --> 00:26:05,532
What's the rush?

402
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:23,261
Pretty. The pink hairpiece makes it perfect.

403
00:26:23,261 --> 00:26:25,221
Really?

404
00:26:25,221 --> 00:26:28,917
We're done here. We'll go ahead.

405
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:31,309
We'll go finish up.

406
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:39,671
<i>♫ You've waited so long, I'm late ♫</i>

407
00:26:39,671 --> 00:26:44,561
<i>♫ I'm sorry, I'm new to this, didn't know ♫</i>

408
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,798
<i>♫ Just because it's you, just because I like you ♫</i>

409
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:52,811
<i>♫ Words can't express it ♫</i>

410
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:53,821
Nam Gi Jeong?

411
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,376
<i>♫ There's no other way ♫</i>

412
00:26:57,443 --> 00:26:59,576
You said you couldn't come today
because of your part-time job.

413
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:05,191
<i>♫ I've captured it all here ♫</i>

414
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:15,932
It ended earlier.

415
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:18,021
The 'screwed' concept, how is it?

416
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:20,021
The 'things that suck' concept.

417
00:27:20,643 --> 00:27:23,701
What kind of 'things that suck' concept is this?

418
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:28,821
What's more 'sucky' for me than 'girl crush'?
How is it? Full of concept, right?

419
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:34,598
- I don't know.
- You came? I thought you couldn't make it.

420
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:40,021
Why is that guy coming down from there again?

421
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:44,021
- Hello.
- Doesn't U Yeon and I have similar vibes today?

422
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:46,821
It looks good on you.

423
00:27:46,821 --> 00:27:50,301
Really? The girls helped me get ready.

424
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,281
Let's go, Miss Piggy.

425
00:27:52,281 --> 00:27:53,391
Let's go, huh?

426
00:27:53,391 --> 00:27:57,709
Where? Is it here today? Here?

427
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,641
Oh, it's here.

428
00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:03,576
Why are you annoyed?

429
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:06,109
It actually suits her surprisingly well.

430
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,721
Who does it suit?

431
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:11,932
You should make some noise when you move around.

432
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:15,691
How do I look today? Isn't it amazing?

433
00:28:15,691 --> 00:28:18,931
Wow, it's really amazing.

434
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:29,241
Put this on.

435
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:37,391
Hey! What are you doing?
This is part of the concept.

436
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:40,598
You'll catch a cold. Give it to me
when we're working later.

437
00:28:52,154 --> 00:28:53,976
Looks like you're getting hit again today.

438
00:28:57,461 --> 00:28:59,665
Alright, shall we begin?

439
00:29:06,687 --> 00:29:08,776
Hey! Move aside.

440
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:10,491
This is my spot, okay?

441
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:12,341
Out. Get out.

442
00:29:12,341 --> 00:29:15,281
Hey, I saved this spot with my sketchbook.

443
00:29:38,198 --> 00:29:40,981
<i>♫ You're shining brightly ♫</i>

444
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:47,481
<i>♫ Like a star lighting up my heart ♫</i>

445
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:52,643
<i>♫ With your own light, your own colors ♫</i>

446
00:29:52,643 --> 00:29:59,541
<i>♫ Filling the whole world
and my dreams with beauty ♫</i>

447
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:10,954
My pencil is broken.

448
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:14,881
Pass me a pencil.

449
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:17,211
Hey, I'm using this.

450
00:30:22,598 --> 00:30:24,661
Okay, one minute left.

451
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:29,511
This one is a masterpiece. A masterpiece!

452
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:32,065
I loved the cosplay theme.

453
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:36,109
Look, look!

454
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:38,371
But where is Baeblu's drawing?

455
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:43,132
Why are you like this?

456
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,881
Let me see.

457
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,971
I really messed up drawing this.

458
00:30:50,971 --> 00:30:53,051
It's okay. It's okay.

459
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,371
No, it's not okay.

460
00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:59,976
It's only been a short time, of course.
Plus I told you it doesn't matter if it's bad.

461
00:31:10,165 --> 00:31:12,021
Is this me?

462
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:14,687
What's wrong with you, Green Pig?

463
00:31:14,687 --> 00:31:17,431
You need to be re-educated!

464
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:32,909
Listen up, Baeblu. Confidence
matters more than skill. Got it?

465
00:31:34,321 --> 00:31:36,261
Let's go.

466
00:31:36,981 --> 00:31:38,865
Gather around.

467
00:31:39,571 --> 00:31:42,421
- It's enough.
- Okay, stop.

468
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:45,398
Let me see.

469
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:51,798
The lines have such energy.

470
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,521
Hmm, you're surprisingly a power-type.

471
00:31:58,521 --> 00:32:02,211
- You're 'gentle on the outside, strong on the inside'?
- What did you say?

472
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,211
The sense of proportion is good.

473
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:06,851
It's really amazing for someone
who hasn't been doing it long.

474
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:09,461
Your chaotic inner self is expressed perfectly.

475
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:12,111
As expected of the stormy period of adolescence.

476
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:15,843
- Stormy, stormy...
- You're going to be great.

477
00:32:16,461 --> 00:32:17,741
There's no way...

478
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:21,001
There's just no way. No, really,

479
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:24,643
what's wrong with everyone's eyes?
What about this... where?

480
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,909
It's hard to even draw like this
when it's your first time.

481
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:30,243
It's good. It's good for a first time.

482
00:32:30,243 --> 00:32:32,901
You still haven't been hit
enough! You! Get back here!

483
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:35,431
What's your problem, Green Pig?

484
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:44,154
Geu Rin is right.

485
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,041
That's good for your level, Baeblu.

486
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:50,761
I couldn't even draw a single line for a month.

487
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,561
Should I show you?

488
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:01,443
Ah, here.

489
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:07,021
And today...

490
00:33:07,021 --> 00:33:08,841
Today, you even colored?

491
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:13,176
- I had 2 seconds left, so I tried coloring.
- Coloring?

492
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:17,941
I still think my strokes are too light.

493
00:33:17,941 --> 00:33:20,554
Still better than me.

494
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:26,361
Yeah, I can't even finish mine.
I always leave off an arm or a leg.

495
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:29,631
But you're really good at drawing faces.

496
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:33,401
I find drawing faces really fun.

497
00:33:33,401 --> 00:33:37,111
Look. Especially the expressions.
They're all different, right?

498
00:33:37,111 --> 00:33:42,751
If I look at them closely, I get really
focused, and... it's just so much fun.

499
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:46,781
So, Khaki, take off that hat sometimes.

500
00:33:46,781 --> 00:33:49,641
Right, let's see your face.

501
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:53,132
<i>Everyone really loves drawing.</i>

502
00:33:54,109 --> 00:33:56,731
<i>Hey, is this you?</i>

503
00:33:56,731 --> 00:33:58,451
<i>You said this was a group for people who draw.</i>

504
00:33:58,451 --> 00:33:59,843
<i>What is this?</i>

505
00:33:59,843 --> 00:34:07,176
<i>How could they laugh at a drawing
someone worked so hard on? That's the worst.</i>

506
00:34:08,371 --> 00:34:10,732
It's no different from that jerk.

507
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:14,554
Okay, let's finish with a couple
pose. Who wants to do it?

508
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:19,991
How about U Yeon and Seon Ho today?
They're wearing couple outfits.

509
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,954
- Oh, fresh idea.
- Sounds good.

510
00:34:22,954 --> 00:34:26,643
- Then, shall we?
- Yeah! Do it.

511
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:32,053
U Yeon.

512
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:50,841
I'll do it.

513
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,271
I'll do the couple pose with Miss Piggy.

514
00:34:55,271 --> 00:35:00,821
- Lend me your jacket.
- Gi Jeong would look better in it anyway.

515
00:35:26,509 --> 00:35:28,931
Can that even be called a pose?

516
00:35:28,931 --> 00:35:30,909
Hey, Nam Gi Jeong, step up your game.

517
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:32,554
How can I work with such a stiff model?

518
00:35:32,554 --> 00:35:35,401
- What more can I do?
- Exactly, U Yeon.

519
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:40,376
- Try being more natural, okay?
- Got it.

520
00:36:33,621 --> 00:36:37,061
Another masterpiece today!

521
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,841
Gi Jeong is a real model.

522
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:41,971
You and U Yeon don't look good together.

523
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:43,971
Nah, I like this one the best.

524
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:45,001
I'm going to the bathroom.

525
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:47,881
The rediscovery of manly-man in Brown.

526
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:49,781
Most people don't realize this,

527
00:36:49,781 --> 00:36:53,309
but I'm actually the manly man of this era.

528
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:57,481
Then I'm a total 'girl crush'.

529
00:36:58,909 --> 00:37:01,576
I've been called 'girl crush' a few times.

530
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:05,487
I know Geu Rin well.

531
00:37:05,487 --> 00:37:07,932
What do you know, punk?

532
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:11,061
Obviously.

533
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:17,251
- Well...
- Let Geu Rin explain.

534
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:20,581
Do you remember any 'manly man'
moments from Seon Ho?

535
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:26,521
Nope. Koo Seon Ho has never been tough.

536
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:30,991
Black Finger is a 'girl crush' every single day.

537
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:34,381
Well... Where did Poo-Gi go?

538
00:37:34,381 --> 00:37:38,291
- That jerk.
- Clueless as usual.

539
00:37:59,181 --> 00:38:01,281
What's wrong?

540
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:04,571
Are you mad because you
couldn't pose with Seon Ho?

541
00:38:04,571 --> 00:38:07,701
- What should I say?
- What?

542
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:10,776
Why did you come today?
You said you weren't coming.

543
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:17,398
I said I don't like Seon Ho.

544
00:38:18,191 --> 00:38:20,776
But you couldn't trust me,
so you came to watch me?

545
00:38:23,061 --> 00:38:25,281
Just answer one thing.

546
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:30,301
Why can't I like Seon Ho?

547
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,776
- Who said you can't--
- Stop lying.

548
00:38:35,851 --> 00:38:40,332
I know why you're mad I like Seon Ho.

549
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:45,087
You fear I'll sabotage
his relationship with Geu Rin.

550
00:38:46,141 --> 00:38:48,376
Why would I interfere?

551
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:51,665
How could I come between them?

552
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:54,361
I'm not stupid.

553
00:38:54,361 --> 00:38:57,932
I know better than anyone how perfect they are.

554
00:39:00,281 --> 00:39:03,132
Did you run here because you
were afraid I'd confess?

555
00:39:05,161 --> 00:39:07,043
How could I do that?

556
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:14,331
I know perfectly well that if I confess,
I won't even be able to just watch him from afar.

557
00:39:14,331 --> 00:39:19,341
Why would I do something so stupid?

558
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:30,731
So, Gi Jeong, stop monitoring me.

559
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:34,509
I don't matter as much as your sister does.

560
00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:37,887
Why would I walk down a path
where I'll obviously get hurt?

561
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:48,954
Fine, I like Seon Ho.

562
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:54,831
But I'll keep it to myself.

563
00:39:54,831 --> 00:39:56,741
Who I like is my business.

564
00:39:56,741 --> 00:40:00,821
So, stop meddling with my business.

565
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:41,781
<i>[Geu Rin: You and Poo Gi Jeong, looking so good
it is annoying. Here's the picture, try to draw it]</i>

566
00:41:00,243 --> 00:41:02,465
- Were you spacing out again?
- Huh?

567
00:41:02,465 --> 00:41:05,354
It's open to the same page you were on early.

568
00:41:05,354 --> 00:41:07,443
What's wrong with you?

569
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,176
Whatever.

570
00:41:14,154 --> 00:41:19,576
How many days have you been stuck on this
chapter? Your brother finished it in 2 days.

571
00:41:19,576 --> 00:41:23,291
You said you could study on your own,
so I even canceled the study room.

572
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:25,132
Should I hire a tutor again?

573
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:29,111
No, I can do it myself.

574
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,631
My score went up a little on the last test.

575
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:35,354
You call that improvement?

576
00:41:42,954 --> 00:41:44,851
Should I just give up on you?

577
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:46,732
Would that be better?

578
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:50,871
Finish all of this before you sleep.

579
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:09,887
<i>Why did you come today?</i>

580
00:42:10,509 --> 00:42:12,725
<i>You said you weren't coming.</i>

581
00:42:12,725 --> 00:42:14,613
Exactly.

582
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:17,391
I don't know, either.

583
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:22,643
<i>I said I don't like Seon Ho.</i>

584
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:27,471
<i>- But you couldn't trust me, so you came to watch me?</i>
- No.

585
00:42:27,471 --> 00:42:33,831
<i>- I know why you're mad I like Seon Ho.</i>
- Right.

586
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:35,531
Say something.

587
00:42:35,531 --> 00:42:37,271
Why am I even mad?

588
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:39,871
<i>You fear I'll sabotage
his relationship with Geu Rin.</i>

589
00:42:39,871 --> 00:42:41,161
That's not it.

590
00:42:41,161 --> 00:42:45,843
<i>Why would I interfere? How
could I come between them?</i>

591
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:50,509
<i>Just answer one thing.</i>

592
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:04,598
<i>Why can't I like Seon Ho? Answer.</i>

593
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:10,521
<i>Answer me.</i>

594
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,341
<i>Why not?</i>

595
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:32,885
<i>In front of the Gallery by 5:30.
I'll wait even if you don't come.</i>

596
00:43:32,885 --> 00:43:40,885
[Arsehole]

597
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:44,154
Hello?

598
00:43:44,776 --> 00:43:46,732
Yeah, I'm not going.

599
00:43:52,287 --> 00:43:54,261
Don't need--

600
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:26,591
<i>The client you are trying to reach
can't answer the phone right now.</i>

601
00:44:26,591 --> 00:44:29,132
What's up with Nam Gi Jeong?

602
00:44:32,243 --> 00:44:34,133
U Yeon.

603
00:44:37,932 --> 00:44:40,941
- You're on time!
- Huh?

604
00:44:40,941 --> 00:44:42,865
Gi Jeong is sick.

605
00:44:42,865 --> 00:44:47,043
He suddenly insisted on going to a gallery,
and then said he was sick and sent you instead.

606
00:44:47,043 --> 00:44:48,961
Isn't that why you're here?

607
00:44:51,538 --> 00:44:53,436
It's Gi Jeong.

608
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:58,211
Hey, Gi Jeong. You didn't tell U Yeon?

609
00:44:58,211 --> 00:45:01,443
Okay. Got it. Just a sec.

610
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:13,811
- Yeah.
<i>- Seon Ho loves small galleries.</i>

611
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:16,598
<i>Green Pig and Seon Ho aren't dating.</i>

612
00:45:16,598 --> 00:45:19,351
<i>They're just buddies.</i>

613
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:21,911
<i>I've seen them for years.</i>

614
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:23,511
<i>Don't worry.</i>

615
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:27,443
<i>Instead of worrying, just stop
liking him only in your heart.</i>

616
00:45:28,081 --> 00:45:32,332
<i>And I'm sorry about yesterday.</i>

617
00:45:36,732 --> 00:45:40,951
Ah! And you are pretty good at lying.

618
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:45,941
Didn't you say talking to me simplifies things?

619
00:45:45,941 --> 00:45:47,631
But even when we were together yesterday,

620
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:50,509
you were overthinking
and seemed conflicted, right?

621
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:56,461
Ask Seon Ho to buy you something tasty.

622
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:59,621
<i>- Stand up straight.</i>
- Huh?

623
00:46:07,521 --> 00:46:10,021
- Did the call go well?
- Yes.

624
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:11,921
Shall we go in, then?

625
00:46:56,821 --> 00:47:01,398
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

626
00:47:03,576 --> 00:47:05,921
Why? Was it not fun?

627
00:47:05,921 --> 00:47:08,287
No, it was fun.

628
00:47:11,031 --> 00:47:13,798
- Well, Seon Ho.
- Yes?

629
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:17,754
There's something I want to ask you.

630
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:24,181
Wait. Na Na?

631
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:29,391
Hey, Geu Rin is drunk again. Come
get her before it gets cold tonight.

632
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:30,391
Keep holding onto her. I'm coming now.

633
00:47:30,391 --> 00:47:31,911
Keep holding onto her.

634
00:47:31,911 --> 00:47:34,732
<i>I need to rush there.</i>

635
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:37,991
Sorry, U Yeon, I have to go.

636
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:40,287
Looks like Geu Rin has passed out again.

637
00:47:41,845 --> 00:47:44,911
- Okay. Go check on her.
- Sorry.

638
00:47:44,911 --> 00:47:46,732
Gi Jeong insisted that I treat you to a meal.

639
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:50,451
No need. Don't worry about me.

640
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,465
Then, I'll see you at the club meeting.

641
00:47:56,901 --> 00:48:02,554
U Yeon, it will get colder.

642
00:48:02,554 --> 00:48:04,851
Give it to me later.

643
00:48:04,851 --> 00:48:06,081
No, it's okay.

644
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:07,311
I can just go.

645
00:48:07,311 --> 00:48:09,871
This way I'll feel better about it.

646
00:48:19,487 --> 00:48:22,154
I'm leaving. Get home safe.

647
00:48:28,732 --> 00:48:30,554
<i>Blue Finger is an amazing person.</i>

648
00:48:30,554 --> 00:48:34,287
<i>- Excuse me.
- Yes?</i>

649
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:38,881
<i>Sorry, do you have a moment?</i>

650
00:48:38,881 --> 00:48:41,354
<i>Someone who noticed
someone like me at first sight.</i>

651
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:46,651
<i>- This size is perfect. How is it?
- Good.</i>

652
00:48:46,651 --> 00:48:50,998
<i>The person who brought me into a new world.</i>

653
00:48:51,771 --> 00:48:56,581
<i>It's natural for amazing people
to like amazing people.</i>

654
00:49:21,181 --> 00:49:28,371
<i>My heart, which dared to like a cool
person... That's right. It's my heart.</i>

655
00:49:28,371 --> 00:49:29,971
I told you not to call Koo Seon Ho.

656
00:49:29,971 --> 00:49:34,371
- I didn't mean for you to dump me on just anyone.
- 'Just anyone'?

657
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,661
Am I 'just anyone' to you?

658
00:49:35,661 --> 00:49:39,191
I'm just giving you a ride.
You won't even allow that?

659
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:41,981
My private jet isn't coming anyway.

660
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:47,551
- I'll just walk alone.
- Geu Rin.

661
00:49:48,461 --> 00:49:51,051
This won't do. I'll get you a hangover remedy.

662
00:49:51,051 --> 00:49:52,885
Wait right here.

663
00:49:55,087 --> 00:49:57,843
Bring Na Na over.

664
00:50:00,871 --> 00:50:02,671
Ugh, I'm so tired.

665
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:11,251
<i>He said he doesn't like me because I'm fat.</i>

666
00:50:12,332 --> 00:50:15,443
<i>Don't mind him. Just leave me alone.</i>

667
00:50:17,221 --> 00:50:19,541
<i>I'm going to lose weight.</i>

668
00:51:07,176 --> 00:51:09,132
You're getting better at this.

669
00:51:10,081 --> 00:51:12,909
You knew I was following you, yet stay silent?

670
00:51:14,681 --> 00:51:18,687
This feeling of receiving
a favor, it's kind of nice.

671
00:51:21,301 --> 00:51:23,411
What's wrong with Seon Ho?

672
00:51:23,411 --> 00:51:25,511
Why did he just leave?

673
00:51:25,511 --> 00:51:28,287
I specifically told him to treat you to a meal.

674
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:37,087
- You really...
- Why?

675
00:51:38,287 --> 00:51:43,665
I don't know how you got mixed up in this,

676
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,376
but you don't have to worry about me anymore.

677
00:51:48,109 --> 00:51:50,611
About getting mad at you yesterday...

678
00:51:50,611 --> 00:51:54,243
It wasn't your fault. It was mine.

679
00:51:55,887 --> 00:52:02,554
Some days I feel like a 10 won
coin rolling on the ground.

680
00:52:03,576 --> 00:52:08,109
- A 10 won coin?
- Yes. Would you pick it up?

681
00:52:08,109 --> 00:52:10,411
- No.
- See?

682
00:52:10,411 --> 00:52:12,101
No one picks it up.

683
00:52:12,101 --> 00:52:14,711
Ten won is still money, yet no one cares.

684
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:16,781
It's considered useless.

685
00:52:16,781 --> 00:52:18,643
Want to hear something funny?

686
00:52:18,643 --> 00:52:21,041
Since I'm a teen, maybe 10 won is okay.

687
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:25,871
The rhyme works, teen and 10 won.
But later, in your 20s, 30s, 40s,

688
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:29,221
what if I'm still a 10 won coin growing old?

689
00:52:29,843 --> 00:52:32,311
- Have you ever thought about that?
- No.

690
00:52:32,311 --> 00:52:36,154
Never. My boss calls me a blank check.

691
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:41,709
As expected, Nam Gi Jeong makes it easy.

692
00:52:49,141 --> 00:52:50,941
Didn't you know that?

693
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:57,887
- You are pretty.
- What?

694
00:52:58,598 --> 00:53:02,332
In my eyes, you look beautiful right now.

695
00:53:06,821 --> 00:53:11,354
- U Dol, it's Mom. What?
- What should I do?

696
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,665
Your sister still isn't home?

697
00:53:13,665 --> 00:53:16,687
- What's wrong?
- It's my mom. Hide!

698
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:23,176
No signs she came and left?

699
00:53:27,021 --> 00:53:30,198
Do you know what time it is? Why isn't she home?

700
00:53:34,391 --> 00:53:37,398
Ah! Gosh! I thought we were caught.

701
00:54:01,132 --> 00:54:02,998
Ah, I'll go.

702
00:54:08,509 --> 00:54:10,357
Now I get it.

703
00:54:11,031 --> 00:54:13,265
The reason I was upset.

704
00:54:15,487 --> 00:54:20,151
You should like me.

705
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:25,132
Not Seon Ho.

706
00:54:39,398 --> 00:54:41,411
- No.
- I'll just die.

707
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:45,798
They found you. New world ahead.
I should block his ass.

708
00:54:45,798 --> 00:54:47,301
The godfather's an ace member of SF.

709
00:54:47,301 --> 00:54:48,954
Your male friend Seon Ho.

710
00:54:48,954 --> 00:54:51,709
- I won't date you.
- I don't want to be friends.

711
00:54:51,709 --> 00:54:53,176
Don't I deserve that much responsibility?

712
00:54:53,176 --> 00:54:56,331
- You have to put precious things in a ring.
- I heard there's a slow kid in your class.

713
00:54:56,331 --> 00:54:57,521
Me too.

714
00:54:57,521 --> 00:55:00,561
- Even my friend is that handsome. Ah, darn...
- That guy is cool.

715
00:55:00,561 --> 00:55:02,301
Why do that?

716
00:55:02,301 --> 00:55:03,921
- They look good together.
- They look really good, right?

717
00:55:03,921 --> 00:55:06,221
I'll save up some skinship for later, too.

718
00:55:06,221 --> 00:55:08,581
Let's get married!

719
00:55:16,721 --> 00:55:18,191
That's so like you.

720
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:21,331
- Shouldn't you be studying instead?
- No, I--

721
00:55:21,331 --> 00:55:24,131
I was just taking a short break.

722
00:55:24,131 --> 00:55:28,051
- You fall for it every time.
- That's so you. Shouldn't you be studying instead?

723
00:55:28,051 --> 00:55:29,921
Who said you could just
come into my room? Get out!

724
00:55:29,921 --> 00:55:31,931
- What's 7 multiplied by 8?
- 56.

725
00:55:31,931 --> 00:55:35,611
- What's 12 multiplied by 4?
- 48.

726
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:38,154
What's 345 multiplied by 512?

727
00:55:38,154 --> 00:55:39,981
It's 176,640.

728
00:55:39,981 --> 00:55:41,351
You don't even know that?

729
00:55:41,351 --> 00:55:44,401
Ah, I'm tired from playing with an idiot.
