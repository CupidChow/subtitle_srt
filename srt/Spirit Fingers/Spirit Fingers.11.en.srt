00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,367
[Episode 11]
What's wrong? Is she ignoring your messages?

7
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:51,467
No.

8
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:52,900
[I just saw your text.
I'm going to the study room.]

9
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,367
She's responding to all your messages.

10
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:57,567
But it feels strange, you know?

11
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,533
What does?

12
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:03,233
She's not ignoring me, but it feels like she is.

13
00:01:03,904 --> 00:01:06,433
Hey, why do you think she lied to me yesterday?

14
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,767
I'm sure she had good reasons.

15
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,567
Hey, cut her some slack.

16
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:12,967
Being too clingy will turn her off.
You'll soon crash and burn.

17
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:16,833
I guess your girlfriend is upset again today.

18
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,667
Jo Mi Rae is asking what happened yesterday.

19
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:21,733
She says she's been down all day.

20
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:23,567
What? I wonder what's going on.

21
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:26,367
I tried not to bring this up,

22
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:27,776
but did you

23
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:30,200
seriously think you looked the coolest yesterday?

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,433
Yes, isn't that a given?

25
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:35,767
Hey, to be honest, those guys
without shirts on were quite cool.

26
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:36,967
Especially the one called Won Bin.

27
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:38,167
Wow.

28
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,033
Even his name was Won Bin!

29
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,800
You can't compete with
a guy with a name like that.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,800
Gosh, you should've just
ripped your shirts open too.

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,633
So are you saying

32
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:52,267
that U Yeon was checking someone else out?

33
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:53,900
My girl U Yeon isn't like that.

34
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,733
Have you ever heard of
'Seeing something can spark desire'?

35
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,100
It's the only Chinese-character idiom I know.

36
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,067
I haven't!

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,900
Isn't that a four-character idiom?

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,900
A four-character idiom?

39
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,120
Yes.

40
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:12,833
Where's U Yeon?

41
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,467
She left already.

42
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,767
What do we do now?

43
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:22,433
Without U Yeon, you'll make
excuses to go alone again.

44
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,043
What's going on?

45
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,033
Just tell me already.

46
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:29,933
I like Tae Seon.

47
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:31,600
I know.

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Did you also know Tae Seon likes you?

49
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,933
My head tells me it's not your fault,

50
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:39,733
but I just got angry whenever I saw your face.

51
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:41,300
Don't worry. I'd never date him.

52
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,567
Hey!

53
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:43,967
Seriously, Yeom Se Ra.

54
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:47,300
Do you know how infuriating it is
when you talk like that?

55
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,533
Pretending that nothing matters
and that you don't care what happens.

56
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:54,367
I'm swallowing my pride here.
Do you have to be so dismissive?

57
00:02:57,433 --> 00:02:59,933
My dad got transferred out of town.

58
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:01,167
What?

59
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,328
Mom wants me to go to Germany,

60
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:05,067
but I'm not sure yet.

61
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,533
Part of me wants to try living with Mom,

62
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:12,600
but I also feel bad for Dad.

63
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,333
I haven't told Song yet,
so keep this between us for now.

64
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,816
Okay,

65
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:21,000
I won't say a word.

66
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:29,367
I think I should go see U Yeon.

67
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:30,833
I think something's up.

68
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,128
<i>Gosh. Seriously, dude.</i>

69
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:35,133
How in the world would you know that?

70
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,033
<i>A man's intuition.</i>

71
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:38,967
Intuition, my foot.

72
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:40,400
Oh, come on.

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,567
Since when do guys have intuition?

74
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:43,767
Men just...

75
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:45,088
Stop meddling and wait.

76
00:03:45,088 --> 00:03:46,967
No, I can't do that.

77
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:50,133
If something happened, I need to know.

78
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:06,433
Gosh, I don't even want to
imagine that possibility.

79
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:08,133
What if it's really another guy?

80
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,633
<i>But you said it can't be Won Bin.</i>

81
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:10,967
You said you trust her!

82
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:12,433
<i>It's not that.</i>

83
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:14,667
Miss Piggy's so pretty, you know?

84
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,128
Do you think guys will just leave her alone?

85
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:19,000
<i>She doesn't say it, but there must be tons.</i>

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,067
- Gosh, just hang up.
<i>- Still, U Yeon</i>

87
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,767
is principled, so I'm not really worried.

88
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:25,800
But what if there are pests bothering her?

89
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,367
I doubt it, Gi Jeong.

90
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,867
<i>She's too nice.</i>

91
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:31,100
So she hates rejecting people.

92
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,400
What in the world!

93
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:44,033
Is the lab closed until the end of this week?

94
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,667
Yes.

95
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,867
Hey!

96
00:04:52,448 --> 00:04:55,533
U Yeon! Are you okay?

97
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,800
Get away from her!

98
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,400
Gi Jeong.

99
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,833
Gi Jeong, wait.

100
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,267
Was it this punk?

101
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:07,233
The one that's been
making life hard for you lately?

102
00:05:08,704 --> 00:05:10,600
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

103
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,567
But...

104
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,433
I get why you keep following U Yeon around.

105
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:16,567
Sure.

106
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,067
She's gorgeous.

107
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,667
But she's taken.

108
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,033
By none other than me!

109
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:25,000
I, Nam Gi Jeong, am Song U Yeon's boyfriend.

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,133
So scram right now!

111
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:30,167
Gi Jeong, it's not like that.

112
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:32,633
It'll be over soon. Don't worry.

113
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,933
Are you a college student?

114
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:40,433
If you're, go hang out
with other college students.

115
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:43,800
Stop showing off and trying
to seduce an innocent minor.

116
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,933
If you don't back off, I'm calling the cops.

117
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:47,967
- He's my brother!
- Hello, officer?

118
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:49,967
My biological brother!

119
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:51,600
What?

120
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:58,767
Good evening, sir.

121
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,567
I'm U Yeon's...

122
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm Nam Gi Jeong, U Yeon's guy friend,
pretending to be her boyfriend.

123
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,867
U Seok, you go inside first.

124
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:12,800
I need to talk with my friend for a bit.

125
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,233
Have a good night, sir.

126
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:18,233
Sir, please go in.

127
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:19,867
Take care.

128
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,467
Wow.

129
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,500
I almost got into big trouble.

130
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,033
Your brother's glare was no joke.

131
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,267
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:35,267
But for now,

133
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:36,867
- since I said I'm your guy friend...
- Are you an idiot?

134
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:39,767
Who would believe that?

135
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,300
What do I do now?

136
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,400
Things were already awkward between me and him.

137
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,100
How can I face him now?

138
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,624
Gosh.

139
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,504
Am I...

140
00:06:51,552 --> 00:06:53,233
that embarrassing?

141
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,833
What?

142
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,100
Why did you come?

143
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,267
You didn't even tell me you were coming.

144
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:07,367
Are you mad I came unannounced?

145
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:08,533
You don't like it?

146
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:10,367
No, that's not what I meant.

147
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,633
Why are you twisting my words?

148
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:22,300
Let's sit for a minute.

149
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:43,033
I thought something was going on with you.

150
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,967
You wouldn't tell me anything,

151
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:48,800
so I ended up imagining other possibilities.

152
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,867
Like guys were harassing you.

153
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:58,533
I'm really sorry about earlier.

154
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:01,533
Don't just assume things from now on.

155
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:05,367
And don't act so boldly without thinking.

156
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:08,033
Okay.

157
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:10,967
And nothing's going on with me.

158
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:13,233
I'm sorry if I made you worry.

159
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:17,167
But...

160
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:20,032
I forgot about tomorrow's pop quiz.

161
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,633
Sorry.

162
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,267
What?

163
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,208
Oh...

164
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,133
Nothing.

165
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,467
Oh, right.

166
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,700
I need to tell you something.

167
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,700
I meant to tell you yesterday.

168
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,167
I got scouted by an entertainment agency.

169
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,100
What?

170
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,633
They want to develop me as an actor.

171
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:45,500
I said I'd consider it.

172
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,267
I think I'll try it.

173
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:49,312
But...

174
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:52,400
you've never been interested in that before.

175
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,760
True,

176
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,400
but...

177
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,633
If she dates someone like you, it'll get worse.

178
00:09:04,832 --> 00:09:07,333
I changed my mind.

179
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,400
Don't worry.

180
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,667
It's a large, reputable company Eun Gi knows.

181
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:15,400
Once I put my heart into it, I'll excel for sure.

182
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:18,433
Overconfident, you'd say?

183
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,633
I doubt that.

184
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:22,867
What?

185
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:25,567
Nothing.

186
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,033
I need to go now.

187
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:30,700
Okay.

188
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,967
Let's part ways here.

189
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:34,567
It'll be awkward if we meet my brother again.

190
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,500
See you at the meeting.

191
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:09,533
You just got back?

192
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,300
Yes.

193
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:17,633
- The thing is...
- Don't worry.

194
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:20,167
I won't tell Mom.

195
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,600
Thanks, U Seok.

196
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:47,600
<i>I got scouted by an entertainment agency.</i>

197
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,800
<i>They want to develop me as an actor.</i>

198
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,033
I should've congratulated him.

199
00:10:56,544 --> 00:10:59,776
How mean.

200
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:02,667
You're really terrible, Song U Yeon.

201
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:09,248
- That's so petty.
- Yes!

202
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:11,067
- You just got back?
- You just got back?

203
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:13,067
What happened?

204
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,967
Who was that guy?

205
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,000
Older brother.

206
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,633
What?

207
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:19,833
U Yeon's older brother.

208
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,267
No way.

209
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:23,200
Hey, you didn't get beaten up?

210
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,933
No.

211
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:28,167
He's so forgiving. His heart is as big as
the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans.

212
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:31,000
But why do you keep frowning?

213
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,224
Tell me about it.

214
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:35,233
I don't know.

215
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:38,000
Something's definitely up,
but she wouldn't tell me.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,200
Do you think she doesn't trust me?

217
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,500
Wouldn't trusting you be weirder?

218
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,100
That's a fair point.

219
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,067
You punks. Seriously.

220
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:49,900
Nice!

221
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,533
I'm first place, right?

222
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,800
Where are you?

223
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
<i>I'm in my room. Why?</i>

224
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,367
I'm coming downstairs for a bit.

225
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:01,667
<i>Do you have a death wish?
Don't you dare come in here.</i>

226
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:03,500
Are you hiding a guy in there?

227
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,367
<i>Enough. I'll come up.</i>

228
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:08,063
Game.

229
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,433
Why are you whining in the middle of the night?

230
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,400
- Sis.
- Do you have a death wish?

231
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,700
What's the problem?

232
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
U Yeon's been acting cold.

233
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,033
What do you mean?

234
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:30,833
She's so cold to me all of a sudden.

235
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,767
I can't think of any reason why.

236
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,600
She even stayed to watch my photoshoot yesterday.

237
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:38,567
Were you being annoying?

238
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:41,767
No, I was totally killing it.

239
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:42,800
Then why would she be like that?

240
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,767
Who knows? That's why I'm frustrated too.

241
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,233
Something must've happened.

242
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:49,233
But she won't tell me.

243
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:51,933
I guess she doesn't want to tell you.

244
00:12:53,184 --> 00:12:54,864
I don't think U Yeon

245
00:12:54,864 --> 00:12:57,333
likes me as much as I like her.

246
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,000
But she said she likes you.

247
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,567
That's true,

248
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:03,100
but seeing U Yeon act like this

249
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,300
doesn't give me confidence.

250
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,233
Confidence, my foot!

251
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:10,267
Maybe it's that time of the month for her!

252
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:11,600
- What?
- Don't you remember you bothered me that day

253
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,933
and got beaten up?

254
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:19,333
I've got my own problems to worry about.

255
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,333
I'm the one who needs counseling.

256
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:29,467
It's from Brown Finger.

257
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:33,568
<i>Next meeting's theme is retro,
which had been postponed.</i>

258
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:37,233
<i>You prepared costumes last time, right?</i>

259
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,800
<i>See you day after tomorrow.</i>

260
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,500
<i>How exciting.</i>

261
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:44,433
Next meeting...

262
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:46,667
I want to skip it.

263
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,500
Should I just not go?

264
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,000
But you said, 'See you at the meeting.'

265
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,667
That's true.

266
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,800
But you don't feel as comfortable
around Gi Jeong anymore?

267
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,767
I don't.

268
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:02,700
Even more so after talking to him today.

269
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,233
Because he got scouted by an entertainment agency?

270
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:06,267
Now Gi Jeong's pursuing a concrete goal too.

271
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,872
You should support him.

272
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:10,600
I know that's the right thing to do.

273
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,133
But it hits harder that
he's on a different playing field.

274
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:19,200
I feel like I might end up holding Gi Jeong back

275
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,067
and there will be many girls who are

276
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:24,467
prettier and smarter than me around him.

277
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm pathetic, don't you think?

278
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What happened?

279
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,833
You left me so boldly,
only to end up back as a loser.

280
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,967
Song U Yeon.

281
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:41,933
You really won't tell us?

282
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:44,467
What happened that day you went to the studio?

283
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,633
I think I should break up with Gi Jeong.

284
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:49,733
- What?
- What?

285
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:51,680
Gi Jeong

286
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,133
wants to become an actor.

287
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,367
An actor?

288
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:55,633
He said he wasn't interested at all.

289
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,433
He said an agency approached him.

290
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:58,867
They said they'd support him.

291
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:02,267
What's that got to do with breaking up?

292
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:04,700
I might hinder his future...

293
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,033
Do you even know how confusing it is to hear

294
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,800
such unilateral decisions that people make?

295
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,133
And why do you assume that you'd be a hindrance?

296
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:14,300
You could actually help him.

297
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,200
How could I help at all?

298
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,233
I can't even plan my own future...

299
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:20,667
Why do we keep going in circles?

300
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:28,600
Honestly,

301
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,600
you've been acting so ridiculous lately.

302
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,767
<i>I know how foolish</i>

303
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:45,533
<i>and pathetic I may seem.</i>

304
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:49,600
<i>But I can't control these strong feelings.</i>

305
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,367
<i>I don't know how to stop.</i>

306
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:57,100
<i>It feels like there's a big hole in my head</i>

307
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,233
<i>pulling everything in, Gi Jeong.</i>

308
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:06,967
<i>♫ I was searching for something precious ♫</i>

309
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,167
<i>♫ If you lose what's precious ♫</i>

310
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,600
<i>♫ A heart no one understands ♫</i>

311
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,467
She wouldn't tell me.

312
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:27,067
Gosh, what seriously happened?

313
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:28,867
Stop asking.

314
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:31,100
She must have good reasons.

315
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:34,067
Why did you act like that earlier?

316
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,600
You were acting out of character, getting angry.

317
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,267
You really startled me, you know?

318
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:40,167
I think even U Yeon knows that she's
saying things out of stubbornness.

319
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,600
How could I agree with her?

320
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,567
Still, you used to say things
in a nice way, you know?

321
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:48,133
If you talk nonsense even though you know better,
it means you're asking to hit rock bottom.

322
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,533
That's the only way to climb back up.

323
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:53,133
Then we should help her get back up quickly.

324
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:54,767
What?

325
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:59,600
I felt the same way when my parents divorced.

326
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,833
The only reason the three of us
stayed friends all this time

327
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,267
is because we had you
who were like an older sister figure.

328
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:12,700
If you go to Germany,

329
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,400
we'll just become goofballs
who have lost our sister.

330
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,433
What are you talking about?

331
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:19,680
Stop crying,

332
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,900
okay?

333
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,633
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm not.

334
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:26,000
Stop crying.

335
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:34,112
[Spirit Fingers, 12th Meeting, Dress Code: Retro]

336
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:37,800
Mr. Kwon, one instant coffee, please.

337
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,733
Yes, ma'am.

338
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:44,967
Me too.

339
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:50,433
Mr. Kwon, the fax machine's broken.

340
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:51,933
Yes, ma'am.

341
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:54,800
Mr. Kwon, what about the coffee?

342
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,900
Yes, ma'am.

343
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,433
Mr. Kwon, fax!

344
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:01,267
We need to receive urgent documents.
The client's throwing a fit!

345
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:02,333
Mr. Kwon, where's my coffee?

346
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,667
Mr. Kwon.

347
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,800
Fax!

348
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Gosh, seriously!

349
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,000
What's wrong with you all?

350
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm sorry. What can I do?

351
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,033
What can you do?

352
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,967
You all seem really down,

353
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:24,033
so we, the older ones, are trying to cheer you up.

354
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:25,433
I'm sorry.

355
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:29,200
Okay, shall we dance to some '70s and '80s tunes?

356
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,400
- No.
- No.

357
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,000
I bet we'd be the only ones end up dancing anyway.

358
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,667
Those helpless good-for-nothings

359
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:39,867
would just ruin the sacred disco time too.

360
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:42,333
Forget it. Let's just start croquis.

361
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,400
No couple poses today.

362
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:12,967
Special edition.

363
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,433
<i>Is this fate's cruel joke?</i>

364
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:20,833
<i>Their once burning passion</i>

365
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:25,800
<i>now reduced to ashes.</i>

366
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,700
<i>Oh, this whirlwind of emotion</i>

367
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,833
<i>stirred by the bone-chilling wind</i>

368
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,900
<i>envelops SF.</i>

369
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,367
Why did they get into a fight?

370
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,533
Ten-minute break!

371
00:19:59,904 --> 00:20:01,700
U Yeon!

372
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:08,167
I need to use the restroom.

373
00:20:14,912 --> 00:20:16,600
Based on my observation,

374
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,700
I don't think Gi Jeong intended anything at first.

375
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:25,933
Hello.

376
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,896
Your time traveler outfit today really suits you.

377
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,767
Do you really think so?

378
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:34,933
Hello.

379
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,067
Hi there, Baeblu.

380
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:39,967
Baeblu, you look like a time traveler too.

381
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,300
Hey, you look so cute.

382
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,933
Stop it.

383
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,367
Where are you going?

384
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:52,467
I need to call Mi Rae.

385
00:21:00,768 --> 00:21:03,833
But it seemed like U Yeon was avoiding Gi Jeong.

386
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,767
Are those youngsters
already having a lover's quarrel?

387
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,133
Oh dear.

388
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:10,967
Then what about those two?

389
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:16,300
They've been separated like the Red Sea
since the moment they arrived.

390
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,033
The water...

391
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:29,300
- Hello.
- Hey, Blue.

392
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,333
Wow, trying out the department head look today?

393
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,400
Section chief look?

394
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,367
Senior staff look?

395
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,533
Junior staff look?

396
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:38,100
Assistant manager look.

397
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,333
Oh, assistant manager. Looking sharp.

398
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,300
- Hey, Geu Rin!
- Hello.

399
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,700
Wow, Geu Rin's outfit concept today...

400
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,867
I'll head in first.

401
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:50,467
What?

402
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,633
Geu...

403
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:58,720
It seems like Geu Rin is
walking on thin ice around Seon Ho.

404
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,967
Do you know anything?

405
00:22:03,328 --> 00:22:07,067
Did Geu Rin offend Seon Ho in some way?

406
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,100
Are you going to the restroom?

407
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,633
No.

408
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,167
Then why are you out here?

409
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:20,800
Let's go.

410
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:24,800
We need to talk.

411
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:28,033
About what?

412
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,000
About what? Everyone's waiting.

413
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:38,600
How many times did you
make eye contact with me today?

414
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,500
What? Many times, of course.

415
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,667
No, we never once locked eyes.

416
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,900
You kept looking away.

417
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,933
Sorry, I was distracted by other thoughts.

418
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:50,900
- What thoughts?
- What?

419
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
I'm constantly thinking about you.

420
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,767
What's on your mind?

421
00:22:55,552 --> 00:22:58,633
What's on your mind that
you can't even look me in the eye?

422
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:01,167
Gi Jeong.

423
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,967
Is this about me possibly joining an agency?

424
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,433
If you hate it, I won't do it.

425
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:07,100
It's no big deal.

426
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,767
Why does everything seem so easy for you?

427
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:12,300
- What?
- Tens of thousands of people shed

428
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,900
blood, sweat, and tears
to get opportunities like that.

429
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,500
But they come so easily to you
and you discard them just as easily.

430
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,733
You don't even realize
what gifts you were born with.

431
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,233
No, you don't even care.

432
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,633
You get recognition
and opportunities without even trying.

433
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:26,467
Coming from someone like you,

434
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:29,167
did you think I'd fall for that too?

435
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:30,833
Song U Yeon.

436
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,467
I'm sorry.

437
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,533
Something's bothering you.

438
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:38,933
What's wrong?

439
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,800
No.

440
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,500
Nothing's wrong.

441
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,833
Why won't you tell me?

442
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,800
How can I possibly tell you
everything that happens in my life?

443
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,033
You really don't trust me at all?

444
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,900
It's not that. That's not what I meant...

445
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,033
Are we even really dating?

446
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:05,400
I feel like I'll die if I don't
see you even for a day.

447
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,100
But you don't seem to feel the same.

448
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,967
I'm always the only one who feels
impatient, anxious, and worried.

449
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:12,544
Honestly,

450
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,467
it still feels like I'm the only one in love.

451
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,567
That's not true, Gi Jeong. I too...

452
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:19,200
So you like me?

453
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:29,133
Then can I verify that?

454
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:30,800
Verify how?

455
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,700
Gi Jeong.

456
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,500
Gi Jeong.

457
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:46,300
<i>♫ I'm not sure what to say ♫</i>

458
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,633
<i>♫ Even when I just look at you.
Even if our fingertips just touch ♫</i>

459
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:55,000
<i>♫ What if you hear my pounding heart ♫</i>

460
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,867
I'm heading out first.

461
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,367
I can't believe that punk!

462
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:08,667
I apologize,

463
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:11,533
but I need to head out early today.

464
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,633
<i>♫ You've waited so long, I'm late, I'm sorry ♫</i>

465
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:20,367
<i>♫ I'm new to this, so I didn't know ♫</i>

466
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:23,833
<i>♫ Just because it's you, just because I like you ♫</i>

467
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:28,600
<i>♫ Words can't express it ♫</i>

468
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,500
<i>♫ There's no other way ♫</i>

469
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,800
<i>♫ I've captured it all here ♫</i>

470
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:41,367
<i>♫ I've captured it all here ♫</i>

471
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,267
I'm sorry about today.

472
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:57,667
It seems like we're about to wrap up,
so I'll head out first too.

473
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:02,867
My apologies.

474
00:26:12,128 --> 00:26:14,333
Then I should

475
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:17,200
also get going now.

476
00:26:33,696 --> 00:26:35,467
Seon Ho.

477
00:26:40,128 --> 00:26:43,000
Do you want to grab a drink with me?

478
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,454
[Late-night Food Stall]

479
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,900
I doubt it, you know?

480
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,967
Playing dating games?

481
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,333
Geu Rin's not immature.

482
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,667
Right?

483
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:22,167
But that's how I feel.

484
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,467
If Seon Ho feels that way,

485
00:27:25,467 --> 00:27:29,067
maybe you're partly responsible?

486
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:31,167
I did nothing wrong.

487
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:36,067
I laid my whole heart bare for him.

488
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:38,267
We even kissed so many...

489
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,867
How many times?

490
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:49,600
Geu Rin must feel certain about her feelings.

491
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,767
That's why your doubting feels
frustrating to her, you know?

492
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:58,272
She can't literally take
her heart out and show it to you.

493
00:27:58,272 --> 00:28:01,400
Wouldn't it be great if you were right?

494
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,167
No, I'm sure you're right. But...

495
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:08,967
- But...
- Then why can't he trust me?

496
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:11,333
I mean, other than 'I like you' and 'I love you,'

497
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:14,033
what more can I say to prove my sincerity?

498
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:17,867
Should I promise to pluck stars from the sky?

499
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:21,333
That's why I compensated with
more than words. All those kisses...

500
00:28:24,128 --> 00:28:26,933
So how many times?

501
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,067
They all just felt playful.

502
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:35,700
I've known Geu Rin for seven years.

503
00:28:37,568 --> 00:28:39,333
But Geu Rin

504
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,433
acts the same whether we're friends or dating.

505
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:46,333
Nothing's changed.

506
00:28:47,584 --> 00:28:50,933
Things should be a little different
when you're dating, don't you think?

507
00:28:52,192 --> 00:28:55,267
But isn't that actually better?

508
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:58,912
If Geu Rin acts differently
when she's your girlfriend,

509
00:28:59,648 --> 00:29:02,200
wouldn't that be way creepier?

510
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,467
You two have been friends for too long.

511
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:09,500
You probably still confuse friendship and romance,

512
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,800
so that must have come through in your actions.

513
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,333
Seon Ho understands, but can't help feeling hurt.

514
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:20,433
But Seon Ho's the same way.

515
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:21,667
No.

516
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:25,233
Seon Ho was ready to be more than
friends with you whenever you were.

517
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:28,200
Was he? Why?

518
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,133
That's because

519
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:32,867
he's liked you for so long.

520
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,712
Who? Koo Seon Ho?

521
00:29:38,848 --> 00:29:42,433
Hey, anyway, you ought to understand Geu Rin.

522
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:45,233
Of course, I do.

523
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:48,480
Because I know

524
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,367
everything about Geu Rin.

525
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:52,667
Even more than she knows herself.

526
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,933
Of course. That's your way of loving someone.

527
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:58,133
But then what's the issue?

528
00:29:58,133 --> 00:29:59,296
Then...

529
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:01,467
why did you suddenly snap?

530
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,367
He says it's because of Acaprio.

531
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:06,433
Jealousy?

532
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,533
It's all because of that punk, Acaprio!

533
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:14,600
Then take it out on him.

534
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:18,233
No matter how innocent you may be,

535
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:23,967
his mere existence must be making Seon Ho upset.

536
00:30:24,704 --> 00:30:28,700
You should be understanding of that.

537
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,567
Gosh, so heavy.

538
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:33,133
Why is she so heavy?

539
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,700
Am I heavy?

540
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,367
I've got my own private jet.

541
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,767
I've got a private jet.

542
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:42,967
But I can't call it right now.

543
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:46,500
It's broken.

544
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,472
- I'm just going to drink up!
- Gosh.

545
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,567
I need to fly my jet!

546
00:30:55,648 --> 00:30:58,933
Seon Ho, seeing you so messed up
makes me like you more.

547
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:01,600
But

548
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,000
why don't you believe Geu Rin likes you?

549
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,900
Gosh, seriously!

550
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,967
Stop asking if I'm excited or not!

551
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:21,300
Please, just stop!

552
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,500
I'm back.

553
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,304
U Yeon,

554
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:39,967
you're in trouble!

555
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:41,600
What?

556
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:45,533
What's this?

557
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:46,848
Mom.

558
00:31:46,848 --> 00:31:49,933
What on earth have you been doing?

559
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:52,400
Give me your phone. I'm confiscating it.

560
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,333
What's going on?

561
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,467
Mom, wait. Just hear me out first.

562
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:04,133
What's this?

563
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:06,067
Should I call this number?

564
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:09,152
[Koo Seon Ho]

565
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:13,184
What?

566
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:15,000
You went to the study room?

567
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,100
You acted all high and mighty
only to lie to me like this?

568
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:22,533
Why aren't you answering?

569
00:32:23,168 --> 00:32:25,500
Admit your wrongdoing!

570
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,500
I was wrong.

571
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,133
Your phone.

572
00:32:31,456 --> 00:32:33,400
I said, your phone!

573
00:32:39,136 --> 00:32:40,833
Mom.

574
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:45,200
You're grounded from now on.

575
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,500
Come straight home after school.

576
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,600
I'll get you a tutor.

577
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:53,733
U Dol, go to your room.

578
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,433
What's going on?

579
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:07,833
U Seok.

580
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:11,133
What do I do about U Yeon?

581
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:18,833
Gosh, it's so frustrating.

582
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:21,200
Gosh, it's so frustrating!

583
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,067
Oh my, what am I going to do about U Yeon?

584
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:30,167
Oh my gosh, this is so frustrating.

585
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,333
Geu Rin.

586
00:35:38,144 --> 00:35:40,500
Who were you drinking with on Sunday?

587
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,533
Seon Ho looked like he was
suffering too when I saw him earlier.

588
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:45,000
- Did you see Seon Ho?
- Yes.

589
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,433
He said he was exhausted
and went back to the dorm.

590
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:47,900
He wanted to rest a bit.

591
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,433
Did you drink with Seon Ho?

592
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:51,300
No.

593
00:35:56,933 --> 00:35:59,800
Darn it, who's calling?

594
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,667
Hello?

595
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:05,767
<i>It's me, Rin Rin.</i>

596
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,733
How'd you get my number?

597
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:10,767
I'm blocking you.

598
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:12,767
<i>You'll regret it.</i>

599
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,133
What?

600
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:20,416
[Geu Rin]

601
00:36:23,712 --> 00:36:25,367
Spit it out.

602
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:29,000
If the seniors are conversing, the juniors
ought to excuse themselves from the room.

603
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,933
Younger ones are so disrespectful these days.

604
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:32,567
- Total chaos.
- I'm leaving now.

605
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:36,400
The upcoming A Midsummer Night's Dream production
has the original Broadway cast.

606
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,933
You know the stage director
and crew came along too, right?

607
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:41,200
- Should I?
- Of course.

608
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,833
That stage director was my brother's
best friend during his studies abroad.

609
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:48,800
So I begged him to pay a visit
to our school's studio theater.

610
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,633
Why?

611
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:52,533
Why else?

612
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:54,800
It's for you.

613
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,128
The pretext

614
00:36:56,128 --> 00:36:58,467
is that he's advising
on the stage design for our fall production.

615
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:00,133
Does someone like that
really have nothing better to do

616
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:02,133
than advising a college play?

617
00:37:03,136 --> 00:37:04,768
Geu Rin,

618
00:37:04,768 --> 00:37:05,833
it's me, you know?

619
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,000
Heo Zero.

620
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,200
I can make all things possible.

621
00:37:15,264 --> 00:37:16,267
[A Midsummer Night's Dream]

622
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,433
What do you think?

623
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:21,664
It's rare to get a chance to talk
with a stage director

624
00:37:21,664 --> 00:37:23,767
from Broadway.

625
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:27,933
We're meeting at the studio theater
day after tomorrow at 6 p.m.

626
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:29,833
Come by.

627
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,700
I'll introduce you.

628
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:36,133
Think about it and let me know.

629
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:37,967
You got my number, right?

630
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,333
I'll get going.

631
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,800
The day after tomorrow at 6 p.m.?

632
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:47,967
Yes, 6 p.m.

633
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,967
He has an interesting way to agonize.

634
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:13,133
How many hours has it been?

635
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:21,367
Gi Jeong. Hey, Nam Gi Jeong!

636
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:23,767
Don't call me. You're ruining my rhythm.

637
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,800
Jo Mi Rae says,

638
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,733
do not call or text U Yeon.

639
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:32,433
Tell her I wouldn't even if she begged.

640
00:38:32,433 --> 00:38:33,833
That's not what I mean.

641
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:36,433
Her mom confiscated her phone.

642
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,300
What?

643
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:11,500
Koo Seon Ho.

644
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,967
Are you feeling okay?

645
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:14,080
What?

646
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,400
How did you know?

647
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,033
Myeong Hun told me.

648
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,967
What's Myeong Hun doing?

649
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:21,267
He's like an owl, delivering messages.

650
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:23,300
Well, are you okay?

651
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,467
<i>He said you went to rest.</i>

652
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:26,233
How did you know?

653
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:29,233
Myeong Hun told me.

654
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,333
Myeong Hun's an owl indeed.

655
00:39:32,928 --> 00:39:35,333
Shouldn't we talk?

656
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:40,928
Well,

657
00:39:40,928 --> 00:39:42,500
why aren't you answering?

658
00:39:44,224 --> 00:39:45,600
You don't want to see me?

659
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,433
It's not like that.

660
00:39:47,433 --> 00:39:48,700
I want to see you.

661
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,600
Then why won't you answer?

662
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,933
<i>I have so much to say to you.</i>

663
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:54,700
Me too. I have so much to say to you too.

664
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,767
But not right now.

665
00:39:56,767 --> 00:39:57,833
Not right now?

666
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:59,067
<i>No.</i>

667
00:39:59,067 --> 00:40:01,633
After I wrap things up,

668
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:04,167
let's meet up then.

669
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:07,200
Fine.

670
00:40:08,896 --> 00:40:11,833
I don't get it but I'll do as you wish.

671
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:13,667
Just don't take too long.

672
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:16,033
Or I'll get upset again.

673
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,500
Upset?

674
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,400
You get upset too?

675
00:40:21,408 --> 00:40:23,967
I do get upset too, you know?

676
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:26,367
I'm an interesting human being too.

677
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:28,500
Okay.

678
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,333
Wait just a little longer.

679
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,033
What?

680
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,533
Wait.

681
00:41:03,616 --> 00:41:05,667
Nam Gi Jeong?

682
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:06,833
Well...

683
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:09,567
Where's U Yeon?

684
00:41:11,296 --> 00:41:13,600
She won't be coming to the study room anymore.

685
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,700
Actually, she can't.

686
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,767
Why not?

687
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:19,133
I, Nam Gi Jeong, am Song U Yeon's boyfriend.

688
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:20,667
So scram right now!

689
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:22,080
He's my brother!

690
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,667
My biological brother!

691
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:27,367
Did she find out about me?

692
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:28,533
What?

693
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:29,824
No,

694
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:31,000
her mom found out about her drawings.

695
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,033
- What?
- She found out U Yeon's going to SF.

696
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,767
Her mom tore up her drawings and went crazy.

697
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:38,667
- What?
- She's grounded, so she can't come to study room

698
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:41,333
and has to go straight home after school.

699
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,733
Hey, Nam Gi Jeong.

700
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:43,967
That aside,

701
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:46,200
did something happen between you and U Yeon?

702
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,867
- What?
- By any chance,

703
00:41:47,867 --> 00:41:48,933
did you betray U Yeon?

704
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:50,400
No.

705
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,904
In any case,

706
00:41:51,904 --> 00:41:54,567
if you betray Song,

707
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:56,300
I'll skin you alive!

708
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,667
- Thank you, sir.
- Goodbye.

709
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:05,367
- See you again, U Yeon.
- Take care.

710
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:08,067
Good night.

711
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,216
What?

712
00:42:09,216 --> 00:42:10,967
You're home early today.

713
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:12,867
Welcome home, Dad.

714
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,033
Who was that?

715
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:21,233
U Yeon's tutor I told you about.

716
00:42:21,233 --> 00:42:23,367
I heard he always knows
exactly what's going to be on the test.

717
00:42:30,688 --> 00:42:33,067
Are you sure we're not wasting time for nothing?

718
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:34,633
That's enough.

719
00:42:34,633 --> 00:42:37,967
If tutoring were going to help,
her grades should've improved ages ago.

720
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:40,333
I've told you countless times.

721
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:41,400
Stop wasting money.

722
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,933
But still...

723
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:44,633
Enough!

724
00:42:44,633 --> 00:42:47,167
I'm traveling next week.
Pack my things in advance.

725
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,167
Gosh, where to? For how long?

726
00:42:58,816 --> 00:43:02,033
You heard how worried Dad is, right?

727
00:43:02,033 --> 00:43:03,733
Worried?

728
00:43:05,824 --> 00:43:07,233
I'm telling you this just in case.

729
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:10,667
Don't mention drawings
or whatever in front of your dad.

730
00:43:11,968 --> 00:43:13,700
Got it?

731
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,267
U Dol, have some spinach too.

732
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:31,016
Open up.

733
00:43:33,088 --> 00:43:36,800
Look at him. He's all grown up now
and doesn't want me to feed him anymore.

734
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,667
He's in third grade. He's all grown up.

735
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:41,067
How long are you going to treat him like a baby?

736
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:43,533
He only looks big. He's still a baby.

737
00:43:43,533 --> 00:43:46,967
He doesn't know how to
do anything besides studying.

738
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,200
Dad.

739
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,533
I'd like to talk to you about something.

740
00:43:54,533 --> 00:43:57,000
Sure, later.

741
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,700
- U Seok, you've been at the lab lately...
- Later when?

742
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:04,533
You always say that but never actually listen.

743
00:44:04,533 --> 00:44:06,667
Dad's having an important talk with your brother.

744
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:08,667
As for me,

745
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,688
I wish

746
00:44:10,688 --> 00:44:13,300
you'd scold me like Mom does instead.

747
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,667
That would be so much better
than being treated like I'm invisible!

748
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:17,867
Why are you acting up like this at dinner?

749
00:44:17,867 --> 00:44:19,767
Come on, U Yeon.

750
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:22,000
- Get up.
- Why don't you hear her out first

751
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,667
to find out what she has to say.

752
00:44:25,408 --> 00:44:27,933
But please finish your dinner first.

753
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,520
Let's take some time

754
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,400
to talk after dinner.

755
00:44:46,944 --> 00:44:49,700
<i>Though I believed I could convince them,</i>

756
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,033
<i>part of me still feared I might fail.</i>

757
00:44:53,856 --> 00:44:57,433
<i>So Dad's answer didn't shock me.</i>

758
00:44:57,433 --> 00:44:59,600
<i>Because it was as expected.</i>

759
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,833
<i>What truly disappointed me</i>

760
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:06,333
<i>was my own pathetic self.</i>

761
00:45:08,384 --> 00:45:11,600
<i>The moment I faced Dad's stern expression,</i>

762
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,567
<i>my heart started to race and mind went blank.</i>

763
00:45:15,488 --> 00:45:19,133
<i>All I managed was to
let out a few stumbling words.</i>

764
00:45:19,936 --> 00:45:21,733
No.

765
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:24,736
I won't allow it,

766
00:45:24,736 --> 00:45:26,300
okay?

767
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,200
Consider this conversation never happened.

768
00:46:07,767 --> 00:46:11,616
Why did you bring that up
knowing that it'd go nowhere?

769
00:46:11,616 --> 00:46:14,500
Look at how you've ruined the whole family's mood.

770
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,367
Now I have to tiptoe around Dad because of you.

771
00:46:25,267 --> 00:46:27,867
What exactly do you do at home?

772
00:46:27,867 --> 00:46:29,300
What have you been doing to make her like that?

773
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,333
Why are you blaming me again?

774
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:33,700
You just hang around other moms all day.

775
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,900
That's exactly why she turned out like that!

776
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,300
What about you?

777
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,500
You come home only on weekends.
You never look after kids!

778
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,967
Then you go earn money!

779
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:45,433
If you hadn't held me back, I wouldn't have
ended up in that countryside, you hear me?

780
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,467
I want to die.

781
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,633
Gi Jeong.

782
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,467
Come straight home after school.

783
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,733
Don't keep your tutor waiting.

784
00:48:08,733 --> 00:48:10,333
Okay.

785
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,833
U Dol! Song U Dol!

786
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:17,600
Time to wake up.

787
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:21,833
A prince shouldn't sleep in this late, you know?

788
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:25,267
Will you get up yourself? Or should I come in?

789
00:48:25,267 --> 00:48:27,300
Can you do it on your own?

790
00:48:27,933 --> 00:48:29,800
I'm coming in.

791
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,833
Wait.

792
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:43,867
U Dol, that's your brother-in-law over there.

793
00:48:43,867 --> 00:48:46,000
Brother-in-law.

794
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,633
Ice cream.

795
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:51,133
Here you go, Bong Gu.

796
00:48:51,133 --> 00:48:52,933
My mom will be here soon.

797
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:54,240
You'll be in trouble

798
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,400
if she finds out.

799
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,933
Is she coming to pick you up?

800
00:48:57,933 --> 00:48:58,967
It must be so tough for her.

801
00:48:58,967 --> 00:49:00,200
Don't you hate my mom?

802
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,867
The reason U Yeon keeps you
a secret is because of her.

803
00:49:02,867 --> 00:49:04,067
Because my mom has a terrible personality.

804
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:06,233
You shouldn't say that about your mom.

805
00:49:06,233 --> 00:49:08,100
Moms and Dads are all like that.

806
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,467
They're just worried, that's all.

807
00:49:09,467 --> 00:49:12,267
He's right, U Dol. What's wrong?

808
00:49:13,824 --> 00:49:16,133
Why are you pretending to be nice?

809
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:18,500
My mom has a terrible personality.

810
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,067
She tore up U Yeon's drawings too.

811
00:49:20,067 --> 00:49:22,100
That's why I came.

812
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,648
How's your sister?

813
00:49:23,648 --> 00:49:26,633
- Is everything okay?
- She's fine.

814
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:29,933
She's just obeying my mom like an idiot.

815
00:49:40,512 --> 00:49:42,533
What are you doing?

816
00:49:45,267 --> 00:49:46,767
That's my number.

817
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:50,144
If anything happens to your sister,
please call me.

818
00:49:50,144 --> 00:49:51,800
Promise?

819
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,280
I'll get going now.

820
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:56,112
I don't hate your mom,

821
00:49:56,112 --> 00:49:57,800
but she scares me.

822
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:02,100
Wow, he's fast.

823
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,048
[Giant Creep]

824
00:50:07,968 --> 00:50:10,333
He asked if you were okay.

825
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:11,933
Give him a call.

826
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,533
No, it's okay.

827
00:50:25,967 --> 00:50:27,667
Coward.

828
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:29,933
What?

829
00:50:42,816 --> 00:50:44,608
Cuckoo,

830
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:47,567
cuckoo, cuckoo.

831
00:50:47,567 --> 00:50:49,000
Over here.

832
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,700
Cuckoo.

833
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,333
Hey!

834
00:50:54,112 --> 00:50:55,833
Cuckoo.

835
00:50:58,033 --> 00:50:59,683
U Yeon,

836
00:50:59,683 --> 00:51:01,133
U Yeon!

837
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,200
U Seok,

838
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,467
what are you doing here?

839
00:51:12,467 --> 00:51:14,100
What?

840
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:17,900
What's that?

841
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,833
Where did you get that?

842
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,467
It's mine.

843
00:51:24,367 --> 00:51:25,667
Don't tell Mom and Dad.

844
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:27,333
What?

845
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:28,933
Let's go.

846
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,600
<i>U Yeon.</i>

847
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,733
<i>I was lucky to see you today.</i>

848
00:52:28,192 --> 00:52:31,200
<i>I still have so many questions I want to ask you,</i>

849
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:35,367
<i>but I'll hold back.</i>

850
00:52:36,064 --> 00:52:40,416
<i>It's okay if you never tell me.</i>

851
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:42,500
<i>You must have your reasons.</i>

852
00:52:43,936 --> 00:52:47,567
<i>Meeting you taught me
that something like that exists.</i>

853
00:52:49,568 --> 00:52:51,600
<i>Also,</i>

854
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,933
<i>I'm sorry for being pushy that day.</i>

855
00:52:54,933 --> 00:52:56,900
<i>I must've been out of my mind.</i>

856
00:52:57,696 --> 00:53:02,560
<i>I'm so embarrassed that I can't even face you.</i>

857
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,832
<i>Like you said,</i>

858
00:53:04,832 --> 00:53:07,000
<i>I'll keep waiting.</i>

859
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,400
<i>If you won't forgive me until the day you die,</i>

860
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,433
<i>then I'll wait for you until the day I die.</i>

861
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:14,367
<i>And this</i>

862
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:17,500
<i>is the message I'll send when we make up.</i>

863
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,100
<i>So don't make me wait too long.</i>

864
00:53:21,133 --> 00:53:23,033
<i>I miss you, U Yeon.</i>

865
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:29,167
<i>♫ I run toward you until I'm breathless ♫</i>

866
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:34,433
<i>♫ Even if I forget everything, it doesn't matter ♫</i>

867
00:53:34,433 --> 00:53:39,033
<i>♫ I'll turn coincidence into destiny ♫</i>

868
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:44,833
<i>♫ Now shout to the ends of the earth.
You're my destiny ♫</i>

869
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:47,233
I'm sorry. It's all because I was being too petty.

870
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:49,800
Something happened to your girlfriend's family.
The little one ran away from home.

871
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,000
Even when we were dating,

872
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,500
I always cared about Seon Ho more than you.

873
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,700
Come back to me.

874
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,300
I'll start fresh from that point.

875
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,000
- Do what you want.
- U Seok!

876
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,333
But do it smartly, so that you don't get hurt.

877
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:00,533
I should do it too. Dating.

878
00:54:00,533 --> 00:54:02,467
Today's main character is late.

879
00:54:02,467 --> 00:54:04,233
He's not getting a buzzcut, is he?

880
00:54:04,233 --> 00:54:05,533
No way.

881
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,167
- Bong Gu.
- Oh no, Bong Gu.

882
00:54:07,967 --> 00:54:08,967
Why?

883
00:54:08,967 --> 00:54:10,733
What nonsense is this?

884
00:54:10,733 --> 00:54:12,500
Gi Jeong, you're right.

885
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,600
I...

886
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,700
I've fallen for you.

887
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,808
Wait,

888
00:54:23,808 --> 00:54:25,200
we're here already?

889
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,667
We'll see each other again tomorrow.

890
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:31,933
Let's just walk a little more
until we get to your place, okay?

891
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,667
Wait.

892
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:43,552
I don't want to leave.

893
00:54:43,552 --> 00:54:46,667
You have to. What if we bump into my mom?

894
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:48,800
I'll greet her politely.

895
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,667
Hello. I'm Nam Gi Jeong.

896
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:52,533
Please entrust your daughter to me.

897
00:54:52,533 --> 00:54:55,367
She'll break my legs in two.

898
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:56,400
This isn't the Joseon era, you know?

899
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,967
She'll say, 'Your grades are bad.
You have no time for dating.'

900
00:55:01,504 --> 00:55:04,433
I want to grow up fast and rescue you.

901
00:55:04,433 --> 00:55:06,533
Just go already.

902
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,067
Do you really have to go in right now?

903
00:55:13,792 --> 00:55:18,333
I think being 20 minutes late should be okay.

904
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:19,967
All right!
