[Episode 10]
He said Gi Jeong is a giant creep.

8
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,467
Kiddo, watch closely.

9
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:57,233
This is the kind of guy I am.

10
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:05,667
There he goes overacting again.

11
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:06,767
Just get started already.

12
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,133
Alright, alright. Let's draw quickly.

13
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:10,733
Start.

14
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:24,967
What?

15
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:30,500
Can we do couple poses?

U Dol...

17
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,433
Brother-in-law.

18
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:38,800
Of course, absolutely.

19
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:45,100
U Dol, what are you doing?

20
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,233
Just leave him be.

21
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,067
Focus on drawing faster!

22
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,433
This kid's impressive.

23
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:55,000
Isn't Red even more impressive
for picking a fight with a kid?

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,667
After giving birth to him,
my mom ate seaweed soup for weeks.

25
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,867
Oh, Mother!

26
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,067
Kiddo.

Time's up. Five minutes are over.

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,267
U Dol, get up quick.

35
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:08,167
Hey, Gi Jeong.

36
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:09,267
Are you okay?

37
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,100
Yes, I'm fine.

38
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:14,100
You're not fine.

39
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,733
Are you okay?

40
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:19,333
This is nothing for me.

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,267
Right, kiddo?

42
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:26,700
Yeah.

43
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,067
I figured I could finally get a proper look here.

44
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:32,833
They cropped out all the faces in the mall photos.

45
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:36,433
If even a bit of his face shows, he goes crazy.

46
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:39,867
It actually works better for me that way.

47
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,567
Because his face isn't overexposed.

48
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:44,233
Oh, I told you to drop that idea.

49
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:47,800
He has absolutely zero interest in that world.

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,600
You know CEO Kye from Star & Studio, right?

51
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,633
I do.

52
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:54,033
The legendary photographer
who makes anyone famous.

53
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:58,733
I begged him to take just one look
and finally got him here.

54
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:01,367
But...

55
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:04,667
You know J One? J One?

56
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,067
Hey, stay still.

57
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,067
The senior coming now

58
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:11,467
worked with J One before fame
and made him a top star.

59
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,367
You gotta impress him, okay?

60
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:16,033
Ugh, I don't care about that.

61
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:17,767
You said triple pay for today, right?

62
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:19,000
Keep your word.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,567
Got it, man.

64
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:22,367
Darn, you are ridiculously handsome.

65
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:29,133
Senior, it's an honor to have you visit our place.

66
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:31,700
Man, I'm busy.

67
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,933
Is this the guy?

68
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:33,933
Where's the camera?

69
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:35,800
Ah, yes. Here it is.

70
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,467
What's with your face?

71
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:41,700
Why do you look so sour?

72
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:44,100
How about a smile?

73
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,733
Don't wanna.

74
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:51,000
What did you say?

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,967
If you want me to smile,

76
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:55,300
try making me laugh first.

77
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:01,233
Charming.

78
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,400
Now I want more.

79
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,733
Stop. Won't do it.

80
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:08,300
I begged for three years.

81
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:14,067
Thanks to this cute kid, today was fun.

82
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:16,800
Shall we take a group photo?

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,167
- Sure.
- Okay.

84
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,533
Let's go over there.

85
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,733
U Dol, wanna take one with me?

86
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:24,233
- Yeah.
- Pose like this...

87
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,833
Ah, done.

88
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,300
Sorry.

89
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,233
Four, three, two.

90
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:42,167
How was today? Did you have fun?

91
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:44,933
Well... it was okay, I guess.

92
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,300
It was fun, right?

93
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,267
Will you keep seeing that giant creep?

94
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,900
Huh?

95
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:55,600
I said we broke up.

96
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,133
U Dol, eat this.

97
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:58,600
Think I'm stupid?

98
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,533
I saw you holding hands earlier.

99
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:05,567
Five, four, three, two.

100
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll say it again.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,467
I hate that guy.

102
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:17,767
U Dol.

103
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:21,367
Even though the kid's still in grade school,
he's got this air that keeps you in check.

104
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:25,300
No wonder Baeblu gets flustered around him.

105
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Gi Jeong handled him pretty well though.

106
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,233
'Handled well'? My foot.
He's just as mentally immature.

107
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:32,967
U Dol might actually be more mature.

108
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:34,267
Jeez.

109
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:37,100
Still, that kid was way too bold.

110
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,600
Even though he's a pathetic younger brother,

111
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,000
he nearly broke the precious spine
responsible for continuing the Nam family lineage.

112
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,867
That's not it.

113
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,800
I won't tell Mom.

114
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:51,333
I don't get it at all,

115
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:55,000
but maybe that guy has
some charm only you can see.

116
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,633
Huh?

117
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,667
He relaxed his body.

118
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:03,667
Then suddenly, he lifted his hips a little.

119
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:07,033
And he held himself up with his own strength.

120
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,700
He's really thoughtful.

121
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,067
Must take after U Yeon.

122
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,633
As expected, he's still
one step ahead of my brother.

123
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:17,867
Really?

124
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:19,000
He actually gave permission?

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,100
<i>Yeah, I guess he learned something from it.</i>

126
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,133
Good call bringing him along.

127
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,333
You did great holding out earlier too.

128
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,900
<i>No.</i>

129
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,200
U Dol was so light,

130
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,000
so it was like lifting a feather.

131
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:37,000
Or maybe your waist is just super strong?

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,267
Of course my core strength is amazing.

133
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:42,167
As expected, the man's back power is...

134
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,700
Hello?

135
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:52,960
Hello?

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,600
Did we get disconnected?

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,300
Gi Jeong!

138
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,367
Huh?

139
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:01,600
Yeah.

140
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,533
What? I thought we got disconnected.

141
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,633
Why'd you stop talking?

142
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:07,667
Well.

143
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,600
It sounded too suggestive.

144
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,067
Suggestive?

145
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:15,333
Your... your comment about...

146
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,800
What did I say that was inappropriate?

147
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,433
I only mentioned your waist being really strong.

148
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,696
Well, that...

149
00:08:25,696 --> 00:08:28,200
you know.

150
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,467
How's that...

151
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,900
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

152
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,933
See you tomorrow.

153
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:33,267
Gi Jeong? Gi Jeong.

154
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:34,867
Wait.

155
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,333
What? Why...

156
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:41,400
But at our age,

157
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,433
should we really be discussing
PG-15 teenage romance?

158
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:47,567
Let's talk about adult relationships,
adult relationships.

159
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:50,533
Nothing? How about you guys?

160
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:52,233
You're at the perfect age for it.

161
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:54,133
Ugh, why are you asking us that?

162
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,433
What about you, Black?

163
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:57,467
Black's relationships aren't interesting.

164
00:08:57,467 --> 00:09:00,633
They're boring yet she never stops dating.

165
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:02,500
What about her latest fling?

166
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,133
She already broke up.

167
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:08,167
How do you know?

168
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:12,500
Wait, are you two giving
each other dating advice now?

169
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:15,533
Jonathan.

170
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:16,533
Jonathan told me.

171
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:18,600
How does Jonathan know?

172
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,833
Wait, are you two that close?

173
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,167
No, it's not like that.

174
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:28,600
The more you talk, the deeper
the hole you dig, time to stop.

175
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,467
Long story short, he and Jonathan
found out. The end.

176
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:34,833
Ugh, enough! What's important here?

177
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,167
What matters is Black's relationship ended.

178
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,767
Why aren't you dating anyone?

179
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:42,233
Huh?

180
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,167
Why aren't you two dating?

181
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,967
I wonder that sometimes too.

182
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:51,168
Do you really

183
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:53,033
not have feelings for each other?

184
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What about Seon Ho?

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,433
Have you ever felt anything for Geu Rin?

186
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,800
I have.

187
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,733
Sure have.

188
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:12,033
Pretty often, actually.

189
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:14,267
Oh my, what are you gonna do about that?

190
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,767
What about you, Geu Rin?

191
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,000
Ever felt a spark with Seon Ho?

192
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,600
He's annoying.

193
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:37,500
Why are you following me?

194
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,433
You seemed upset earlier.

195
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:42,067
You were awfully cheeky today.

196
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:43,467
I've got something to ask.

197
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,067
I don't wanna hear it.

198
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,433
Ms. Taeng Ja!

199
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,133
So Jonathan didn't tell you
why I broke up with that guy, huh?

200
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,467
Because he called you Ms. Taeng Ja.

201
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:05,533
You called me that even though you knew?

202
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Taeng Ja.

203
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,533
What did you just call me...

204
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:15,800
How can I make you see me as a man?

205
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:21,633
Taeng Ja, what do I need to do
for you to see me as a man?

206
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,633
I!

207
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:36,567
I told you not to call me Taeng Ja!

208
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,233
<i>What about you, Geu Rin?</i>

209
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,800
<i>Ever felt a spark with Seon Ho?</i>

210
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:49,133
I'm home.

211
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,200
Why are you drinking alone?

212
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,133
Did you eat something wrong?

213
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:04,500
I got the rod of love.

214
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,100
Is that soju?

215
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,933
It's here! It's here! It's here!

216

<i>Why do you like me?</i>

217
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,367
<i>Should I only say one reason?</i>

218
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,467
<i>No, list them all out.</i>

219
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,467
<i>It's your homework.
I'll check your answers in person.</i>

220
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,633
Yes!

221
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:44,167
Oh my god!

222
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:48,667
Hey, that's really naughty.

223
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,733
So what's so naughty about it?

224
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:52,400
Are you saying that talking about
strong waist strength is a naughty thing?

225
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,433
No.

226
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:55,067
Jo Mi Rae, did you get heatstroke or something?

227
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,500
You just said it was naughty.

228
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,800
The one who felt the naughtiness
in that word is the naughty one.

229
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,600
Ah, Nam Gi Jeong, Nam Gi Jeong.

230
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,533
He's got that devil of lust deep in his heart!

231
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:06,967
Speak in a way I can understand.

232
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:08,000
In Earthling terms.

233
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,533
Did you guys kiss?

234
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:12,267
Not that peck from before, but a real kiss.

235
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,133
What are you talking about? That never happened.

236
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:15,167
Really?

237
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:17,600
Okay, let me put it in Earthling terms for you.

238
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,000
Nam Gi Jeong will soon

239
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,933
pounce on you.

240
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,167
You didn't stop reading smut, did you?

241
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:25,500
Why would I stop?

242
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,333
You should go pray or something.

243
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,167
The lust demon's all over you.

244
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,833
Hey, catch U Yeon.

245
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:35,133
He will pounce on U Yeon! Catch U Yeon.

246
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:39,500
The kissing technique to win her heart.

247
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,233
Do I really have to teach this with my mouth?

248
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:46,500
This is all the expertise I gained
through spending money and time.

249
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,833
Hey, Nam Gi Jeong.

250
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:57,067
You can really act dense when you want to, huh?

251
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,900
Please.

252
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,233
Please teach me.

253
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:06,167
Don't just mindlessly charge in.

254
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:08,200
Oh.

255
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,767
The most important thing

256
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,967
is her preference.

257
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:14,600
Her preference?

258
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:18,304

U Yeon.

A girl who wants you to ask her
in a romantic way before kissing her.

261
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,900
Can I kiss you?

262
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,400
No.

263
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,367
Ugh, why would you ask something like that?

264
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:31,767
[Version 2: Pull Closer]
A girl who wants you to pull her in and kiss her.

265
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:32,800
Don't do that.

266
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,867

[Version 4: Soulful Gaze]
A girl who wants you to gaze into her eyes

270
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,933
and naturally lean in for a kiss.

271
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:53,504
But U Yeon

272
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:56,000
wouldn't do any of these.

273
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,800
Ugh, hopeless kid.

274
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,900
He's getting lessons just because he can't kiss?

275
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,367
I didn't expect Nam Gi Jeong's
love life to be like this.

276
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,433
Hey, what book did he ask us to buy for him?

277
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:09,567
Can't remember even after hearing it 100 times.

278
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,167
'A book about how to read books properly'!

279
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:17,033
Wait,

280
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:19,567
didn't he buy and read that last time?

281
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:21,633
That was about reading books properly,

282
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:27,700
but this one's about how to read books
about reading books.

283
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,667
What kind of nonsense is that?

284
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,033
It's not about being possessed by lust demons.

285
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,100
I'm just chasing my dream.

286
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,267
Dreams?

287
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:38,067
I've chosen my path.

288
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:40,533
I'll become a romance novelist.

What?

290
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:44,967
You said not long ago that
you were going to become A&R.

291
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:47,667
You said you wanted to create idols
like Legend with your own hands.

No, I think I'm more talented in this field.

293
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:55,300
And there's someone inspiring me these days too.

294
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,400
Other than Legend?

295
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,467

It's so unlike you.

Yeah.

By the way, Jonathan, I'm curious about something.

You're a rocker, right?

323
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,000
Correct.

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,400
Wow.

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,900
Were you originally aiming to be a rocker?

That's right.

What's your dream, Baeblu?

I don't

There's nothing I'm exceptionally good at.

331
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,967
I don't know what to pursue.

332
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:17,167
Then consider what you enjoy doing.

333
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:19,700
Maybe that'll give you some direction.

334
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,167
I did think about that.

335
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:26,533
But I don't even know what I like.

336
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:33,167
A blank slate, huh?

337
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,633
Well, with a blank slate,
you can draw anything, right?

00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:39,233
Blank slate?

339
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,267
Now that I think about it,

340
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:02,733
there's something I do like.

341
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,867
Does that mean Nam Gi Jeong becomes my dream?

342
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:08,500
Me too.

343

you thought of me like that.

00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,500
No, that's not it...

346
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,967
What do you mean 'no'?

347
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:21,900
I heard everything.

348
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,333
That's not what I meant.

with suggestive comments.

And now you're messing with my heart,
so what are you going to do about it?

What?

367
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,700
No, absolutely not.

368
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:17,200
I knew you'd say that.

369
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,133
But someday, we will kiss.

370
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:23,000
Of course, I want to do it right now, though.

371
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,500
I can't hear you.

372
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,900
If you really like someone,
kissing comes naturally.

373
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:36,400
I really like you too, but...

374
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:42,067
Okay, you don't need to explain.

375
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,933
I already knew this is how you are.

376
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,633
But I wanted to see
if you have other sides to you.

377
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:51,533
Other sides?

378
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:52,533
U Yeon.

379
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:54,733
How much do you think you know about me?

380
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:55,833
Huh?

381
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,633
The you I know isn't your entire self.

382
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,067
The me you know isn't all of me, right?

383
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:02,533
So, I guess that means liking someone

384
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:06,600
is about wanting to get to know
each other more and more.

385
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,900
Oh, my head.

386
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,433
You really make me think a lot.

387
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:16,567
Oh my gosh.

388
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:21,100
Is it too late to go to the study room?

389
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,200
No, it's not.

390
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,967
Looks like Se Ra and Mi Rae
are staying late at the bookstore too.

391
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:27,967
Oh, it's time to go.

392
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,100
Maybe I should start going to the study room too.

393
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,300
No.

394
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,700
Am I that embarrassing?

395
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,267
Oh, right!

396
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:41,567
It was jealousy, right?

397
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,933
It's not jealousy.

398
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:49,500
U Yeon.

399
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,267
I really can't handle studying.

400
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:56,167
But I'll never become someone who embarrasses you.

401
00:21:56,167 --> 00:22:00,100
I'll start seriously thinking about my future too.

402
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:02,600
You said you'll become amazing?

403
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,633
Yeah, need to make it more specific.

404
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:09,367
Okay, let me know
when you figure it out. I'm leaving.

405
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:11,233
- Study hard.
- Yeah.

406
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,667
Gi Jeong.

407
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:19,567
Huh?

408
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:21,300
Can I...

409
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,500
Can I go see you work?

410
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,533
Huh?

411
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:28,133
I want to know more about you, is that okay?

412
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:30,800
Sure! Sure! Totally fine!

413
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,500
I'll make sure to pick a day when I look my best.

414
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,267
Alright, see you later.

415
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:37,833
Hey, be careful on your way.

416
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,767
Well, look who it is.

417
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:56,400
Aren't you neglecting your work?

418
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,800
Sorry, I had lots to do yesterday.

419
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,500
It's fine. I only had one beer yesterday.

420
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,067
Managed to walk home
on two feet instead of crawling.

421
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,067
Impressive.

422
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:07,333
People keep saying I'm acting weird.

423
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,800
Did I change too suddenly?

424
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,533
Do I look like I'm pretending?

425
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:12,367
- Absolutely not.
- Right?

426
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:13,900
Love changes people.

427
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,167
At the very least, I should avoid
worrying the person I like.

428
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,900
You know that's how I approach
relationships, right?

429
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,600
Even before...

430
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:30,333
Last time too, I went home early
because I didn't want you to worry.

431
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:33,700
So responsible.

432
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,367
Of course. See you later.

433
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,100
Geu Rin.

434
00:23:40,967 --> 00:23:44,700
About Pink's question...

435
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,533
- Huh?
- What about you, Geu Rin?

436
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:49,167
Ever felt a spark with Seon Ho?

437
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:55,100
Go on, hurry.

438
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,033
Did you hear? Senior Heo Zero
is returning to school.

439
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,667
I heard. School life might
actually become interesting now.

440
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:17,100
He looks really cool when smoking.

441
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,133
Wow, I thought I was watching a photoshoot.

442
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:22,300
Didn't he date that freshman
from the stage design department?

443
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,200
Ah, Nam Geu Rin? Probably broke up.

444
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,767
- What?
- Really?

445
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:32,467
So that's why Eun Gi was crying his eyes out?

446
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,133
He cried?

447
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:37,333
Bawled his eyes out.

448
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,333
Hey, that's harsh.

449
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,312
You've ignored his words for three years,

450
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:43,900
but said yes to some girl you just met?

451
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,567
Hey, you're here.

452
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,867
Nam Gi Jeong, nice to meet you.

453
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:52,480
Ah, this is Manager Noh Ji Won
from SN Entertainment.

454
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,696
My junior from school.

455
00:24:56,333 --> 00:25:00,633
I'm sure you're tired of hearing
compliments about your looks.

456
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:03,500
[Manager Noh Ji Won, SN Entertainment]
How should I persuade you...

457
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:09,433
Why did you change your mind?

458
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:13,300
You said you hated the attention and being busy.

459
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,933
Exactly.

460
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,567
Well...

461
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:21,367
I'm happy with how things are,

462
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:24,267
but if I can become better,

463
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:26,833
I should try.

464
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:31,833
He said he wants to get to know you better?

465
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:32,900
Huh?

466
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,067
Yeah, why?

467
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:37,400
That's a totally suggestive thing to say.

468
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,433
Why is that a suggestive thing to say?

469
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,133
The male lead in the novel I read yesterday

470
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,967
said that exact line before doing 'that' with her.

471
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:46,400
But you said that?

472
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,767
Oh man, why did you do that?

473
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:50,000
Doing 'that'?

474
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,367
Mi Rae, get a grip.

475
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:56,167
And please read clean fic instead of smut.

476
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:58,233
You shouldn't have access
to adult content. How'd you get it?

477
00:25:58,233 --> 00:25:59,467
It's a secret.

478
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:02,133
Anyway, true love is R-rated apparently.

479
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:05,200
So, you're going to visit
where your boyfriend works?

480
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,800
Yeah, I've never seen Gi Jeong working before,

481
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,100
so I thought he might be upset.

482
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:15,200
Also, I thought there might be
sides of Gi Jeong I don't know.

483
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,167
Oh, already checking for cheating?

484
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:20,300
No, that's not it...

485
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,367
Gi Jeong's here.

486
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:26,133
He said he's late for work,
just came to see me quickly.

487
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:27,667
Fix Jo Mi Rae.

488
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:29,000
See you at the study room.

489
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,733
Not sure if she can be fixed.

490
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:33,633
Let's go.

491
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,167
Oh, right.

492
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:37,333
I had somewhere to go.
I need to get my act together.

493
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,267
Suddenly?

494
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:40,733
Yeah, I'll stop by there with you, I guess.

495
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,000
No, it's fine.

496
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,167
I'll go alone.

497
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:46,367
You're the top student. You should study.

498
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:48,000
See you later.

499
00:26:57,733 --> 00:26:59,867
So handsome.

500
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:09,133
Even candid shots of my boyfriend
look like magazine spreads.

501
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:11,400
He's so handsome.

502
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:23,700
Gi Jeong.

503
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,833
U Yeon. Hey, don't run, you'll fall.

504
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,467
Huh?

505
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,744
Why are you here so fast?

506
00:27:35,744 --> 00:27:38,033
Just wanted to see you sooner.

507
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,033
We're such a pair of fools, right?

508
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:43,067
No.

509
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:44,800
I'll be the only fool here. Just me.

510
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,500
You can't be a fool, it'll ruin your studies.

511
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,233
Your dream is to get into college, right?

512
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:51,433
Oh, wait.

513
00:27:51,433 --> 00:27:52,933
Did you say I'm your dream?

514
00:27:52,933 --> 00:27:54,467
No, I didn't.

515
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:56,600
Let's go together, Miss Piggy.

516
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,767
I'm home.

517
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:09,533
Song U Yeon, stop!

518
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:11,633
Hey, take this trash out first.

519
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,267
Why? Hurry up.

520
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:17,033
Mom, why do I always get these chores?

521
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:19,500
Anyone could do this, it's not just you.

522
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,600
- Hurry up.
- Fine.

523
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,667
Anyone can take out trash, why always me?

524
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,000
What's up with you again?

525
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,267
You apologized last time,
and now pulled this again.

526
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:29,000
It wasn't a one-sided apology.

527
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,133
I apologized for disrespecting you.

528
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:33,800
I thought you would apologize too if I went first.

529
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,667
Why would I apologize to you?

530
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:40,300
You always argue back at the end of everything.

531
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,767
Why are you acting like this?

532
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:43,900
You weren't like this before!

533
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,600
Because I used to be a coward!

534
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,800
I did what you said, even if I didn't like it,
because I was afraid you'd hate me.

535
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,633
Now I'm not scared anymore!

536
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:52,267
I don't care if you hate me.

537
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:54,367
I hate it when you play favorites!

538
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,067
What?

539
00:28:58,633 --> 00:29:01,133
Ugh, fine. I'll do it myself.

540
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:02,667
It's either you or me. Who else would do it?

541
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,800
I wouldn't ask if I weren't busy.

542
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,500
I'll take it out.

543
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:12,300
U Seok.

544
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,533
No, U Seok. Don't get your hands dirty.

545
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:16,433
Let go. I'll take care of it.

546
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:18,467
I was going to get some fresh air.

547
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,367
Feeling relieved now?

548
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:28,800
Does it feel good making your brother
do it after two months?

549
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,333
I can't take this anymore.

550
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:49,967
[Gi Jeong: Did you get home safe?]

551
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:54,200
[Sorry I couldn't walk you home because of work.]

552
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,333
[Almost died worrying.]

553
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,100
[Almost died.]

554
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,033
[Almost died.]

555
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:05,267
How many times will you type that?

556
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,700
[Don't worry, got home perfectly fine.]

557
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,433
[Glad to hear. Thanks.]

558
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,067
[What's there to thank?]

559
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:22,400
[Just grateful you are here.]

560
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,333
[Here we go again. Stop saying that.]

561
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:29,067
[Talk later. Eun Gi's calling me.]

562
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:30,112
[Okay, work hard.]

563
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:39,833
<i>Gi Jeong, you know what?</i>

564
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:41,900
<i>Sometimes,</i>

565
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,800
<i>I used to find comfort in dark rooms.</i>

566
00:30:47,267 --> 00:30:50,637
<i>I don't have to see the blurry floor</i>

567
00:30:50,637 --> 00:30:52,533
<i>because of tears.</i>

568
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:58,367
<i>But these days, it's different.</i>

569
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:02,833
<i>Whenever the floor starts to get blurry,</i>

570
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:06,867
<i>someone mysteriously appears to wipe my tears.</i>

571
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,367
You see,

572
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,467
I'll become an amazing man.

573
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:12,433
No need to stress about it now.

574
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:16,067
I just feel destined for greatness, you know?

575
00:31:16,067 --> 00:31:19,300
<i>Such reckless confidence</i>

576
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,000
<i>strangely calmed me down.</i>

577
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,933
<i>Is it some kind of spell?</i>

578
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:27,053
<i>Whatever it is,</i>

579
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:29,433
<i>I'll always believe you.</i>

580
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:32,768
<i>And I</i>

581
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:35,133
<i>keep liking you more.</i>

582
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,433
<i>But</i>

583
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,432
<i>sometimes</i>

584
00:31:50,432 --> 00:31:52,900
<i>you feel too good to be true.</i>

585
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,667
<i>I just like you.</i>

586
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,667
<i>I'm behind you.</i>

587
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,333
<i>You're special to me.</i>

588
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:07,233
<i>You are super duper extra special to me.</i>

589
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:10,208
<i>You</i>

590
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,867
<i>should like me back.</i>

591
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:14,300
<i>To someone like me,</i>

592
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,400
<i>you're something that could never happen.</i>

593
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:22,700
<i>So sometimes,</i>

594
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:28,433
<i>I can't help but feel afraid,</i>

595
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,600
<i>that one day,</i>

596
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,767
<i>I'll wake up and you'll be gone.</i>

597
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:01,333
Ugh, kill me now.

598
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:04,300
Here I go again.

599
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,100
But Koo Seon Ho,

600
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,200
I'm not ready to answer you yet.

601
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,367
I'm truly sorry.

602
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:11,400
Why?

603
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,967
It's because it's not easy for me.

604
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,267
Seon Ho.

605
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,167
You've started

606
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,133
avoiding me again, huh?

607
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:28,100
Avoiding you? What are you talking about?

608
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,067
Hey, did I do something wrong to you?

609
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,400
Why are you like this?

610
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,333
Is it the first time I've avoided you?

611
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,100
This is the second time.

612
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,667
The first time was when I confessed,

613
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:45,167
and the second time is

614
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:47,433
after what happened last time.

615
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,633
Have you really never felt

616
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:53,833
your heart flutter for me?

617
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,963
Is your 'Acaprio'

618
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,867
still blonde?

619
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:12,567
No.

620
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,000
Got it!

621
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,267
What's the big deal?

622
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:17,300
Never felt a flutter?

623
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,500
Hey... Who is this?

624
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,400
I missed you.

625
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,000
Rin Rin.

626
00:34:31,867 --> 00:34:33,667
I'm back.

627
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,750
Koo Seon Ho,

628
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,533
how have you been?

629
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:42,433
You two are still close, huh?

630
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:46,267
Take your hands off her, senior.

631
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:47,633
Huh?

632
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:49,400
Your hands.

633
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,967
Hands?

634
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:56,700
Rin Rin!

635
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,333
Rin Rin!

636
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,933
Does it have to be like this?

637
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:15,433
Nam Gi Jeong would call U Yeon
beautiful even if she looked homeless.

638
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:18,500
That's Nam Gi Jeong. The real problem
is the people around him.

639
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,400
- Group model shoot today, right?
- Yeah.

640
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,767
They might even compare you to them.

641
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:25,800
You need at least a little protection.

642
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,200
I'm not sure if that's right.

643
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,000
Ah, the lens.

644
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,100
You prepared the mystic teal color I requested?

645
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,333
No.

646
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,767
Can't be helped.

647
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:39,133
This is my favorite dress. Be careful wearing it.

648
00:35:40,512 --> 00:35:42,433
Thanks.

649
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:44,867
Okay, don't forget the live chat update.

650
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:46,633
Yeah, see you at the study room later.

651
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:48,267
Okay.

652
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,933
Should we catch a movie after so long?

653
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:56,600
You came with Song this morning, huh?

654
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,300
Ah, she slept over at my place.

655
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,433
I think she had something
going on with her mom again.

656
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:04,567
Song always runs to you
when that happens, doesn't she?

657
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:06,267
- Huh?
- Well...

658
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:08,467
I'm not exactly the most helpful friend.

659
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:10,533
That's not true.

660
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:14,533
Song felt bad that I've been
sleeping alone these days.

661
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,433
Let's watch movies another time.

662
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:20,500
I have loads of homework.

663
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,100
Let's go.

664
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:31,967
Wait.

665
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:33,667
This wasn't the original plan, right?

666
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:34,800
It's my decision.

667
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,133
You did whatever you wanted too, right?

668
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:37,167
No, seriously.

669
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:38,800
This isn't okay.

670
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,233
Can you iron and hang that properly?

671
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:43,400
I didn't even tell you to wear it,
but why are you freaking out?

672
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,367
Fine, then I'll wear it too.

673
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:46,967
No need. You have your own outfit.

674
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:49,133
No, I don't want that.
Then I'll wear the same thing.

675
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:51,000
I don't want that too. This is my studio.

676
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Are you the boss here?

677
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,267
I'll do as I please, okay? Stop it.

678
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:56,167
Come on. Just hear me out once.

679
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:58,433
Why is Gi Jeong acting like that?

680
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:02,000
Group shoot today.
He called Miss Piggy accordingly.

681
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,600
And?

682
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,800
The outfits changed.

683
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,167
- Gi Jeong's clothes?
- No, the models'.

684
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:10,800
How?

685
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,500
I think it's here?

686
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:32,033
She's a model?

687
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:35,933
Mi Rae was right.

688
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:38,267
It makes me feel intimidated.

689
00:37:40,933 --> 00:37:42,300
No.

690
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,433
I'm me and she's her.

691
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:49,233
If Gi Jeong saw this, he would lecture me again.

692
00:37:54,068 --> 00:37:55,667
Yo.

693
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:57,800
Hello.

694
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,867
U Yeon! Why are you here already?

695
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:03,500
Go, go. Come back later.

696
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,467
You told me to come straight after school.

697
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:06,967
Anyway, you can't be here now.

698
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,000
- Should we call in the model?
- Do it.

699
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,667
- Let's go.
- Gi Jeong. Shoot's starting.

700
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:13,400
Models, please come out.

701
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:17,033
Hey, darn it!

702
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,000
U Yeon, stop watching.

703
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,667
Just look at me.

704
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,400
Are you okay?

705
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,567
Even your hiccups are cute.

706
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,133
Ah, nice.

707
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:35,100
Keep the wild energy till the end.

708
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,533
Push through to the finish.

709
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:37,967
Tension, tension!

710
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:40,833
Three, two.

711
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:41,900
- Great.
- U Yeon.

712
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,933
Sit here.

713
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:45,533
Don't look there.

714
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,467
Don't turn around

715
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:49,167
until I come out.

716
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:50,667
This place is full of wolves,

717
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:53,167
and pretty girls like you are in danger.

718
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:56,500
Stay like that, okay.

719
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,200
It came out great.

720
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,733
Can you hold their pants for a second?

721
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:01,367
- Dae O.
- Yeah?

722
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:03,333
Tell that traitor to get ready.

723
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,967
Say he's up next.

724
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,367
Hey, you heard him, right?

725
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:09,167
Okay, please go.

726
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:11,333
Ah, this is making me anxious, seriously.

727
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,500
Come quickly.

728
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,067
Why'd you dress up so nicely again today?

729
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:21,333
- Don't look back, got it?
- Okay, okay.

730
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,933
Please wait a moment.

731
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,367
My friend's embarrassing. I'll apologize for him.

732
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,933
Me too.

733
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:34,100
This situation is...

734
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,467
Like 'comrades in misery'?

735
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,967
'Shared suffering.'

736
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:42,233
Okay!

737
00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:43,433
Ah, nice.

738
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:44,467
Cut.

739
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:46,633
Now prepare for the next outfit.

740
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:48,233
Tell Gi Jeong to come.

741
00:39:48,233 --> 00:39:49,833
Gi Jeong!

742
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,633
<i>Why am I so nervous?</i>

743
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,200
You got this.

744
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,600
Keep your eyes on me.

745
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,100
Okay, strike a pose.

746
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,367
Cue.

747
00:40:28,367 --> 00:40:29,833
Set the mood.

748
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,433
Good.

749
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,033
<i>I've never seen him so serious before.</i>

750
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:40,500
<i>Different from how he is at SF.</i>

751
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,700
Right, turn slightly.

752
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,367
Half-step back, okay.

753
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:46,333
Perfect.

754
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,333
Even just dressing him up
brings out something in him.

755
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:04,600
Let's keep going.

756
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:08,367
Great, good.

757
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:09,533
Excellent.

758
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:12,400
Like you're looking at something comfortably.

759
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:19,033
<i>♫ You make me understand ♫</i>

760
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:25,100
<i>♫ You make me find myself ♫</i>

761
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,233
<i>♫ 'Cause you're a star ♫</i>

762
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,033
<i>♫ 'Cause you're a star ♫</i>

763
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:45,933
Crazy...

764
00:41:45,933 --> 00:41:48,867
I actually fell for that act back then.

765
00:41:58,133 --> 00:41:59,767
Rin Rin.

766
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,167
It's hot. Let's talk inside.

767
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:08,000
Want me to break your arm?

768
00:42:10,433 --> 00:42:12,128
You are

769
00:42:12,128 --> 00:42:14,067
really mad at me.

770
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:16,300
I've been reflecting hard.

771
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,033
Leaving like that.

772
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:20,067
Cut me some slack.

773
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:21,467
To be precise,

774
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:24,800
you didn't leave, but I dumped you.

775
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Did you?

776
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,533
Right. We're nothing now.

777
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:31,600
Stop acting like this.

778
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,867
I came back because of you.

779
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,867
I thought about you a lot.

780
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:41,933
You're the only one I could think of.

781
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,167
Your acting's improved. I admit it.

782
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,767
But your act doesn't work on me anymore.

783
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,733
So get lost.

784
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:53,664
Since when

785
00:42:53,664 --> 00:42:56,500
did you and Seon Ho become so close?

786
00:42:57,233 --> 00:43:00,400
Were you lonely without me?

787
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,733
See you around, Rin Rin.

788
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,367
Why wait outside? You should've stayed in.

789
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:30,267
Huh?

790
00:43:30,267 --> 00:43:32,967
Ah, it's too crowded inside.

791
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:35,167
It was a bit crowded today.

792
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:36,433
How was it?

793
00:43:36,433 --> 00:43:38,533
I was the only one you had eyes for, right?

794
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,267
Yeah.

795
00:43:40,267 --> 00:43:42,967
Let's go. I'll buy you something tasty.

796
00:43:42,967 --> 00:43:44,867
Wait.

797
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:46,656
I think

798
00:43:46,656 --> 00:43:49,133
I need to head home early today.

799
00:43:49,133 --> 00:43:50,967
What?

800
00:43:50,967 --> 00:43:52,800
You never mentioned that.

801
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,000
I forgot about tomorrow's pop quiz. Sorry.

802
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,633
Oh, really?

803
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:03,000
Can't be helped, I guess.

804
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,100
I'll walk you home.

805
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,700
No.

806
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:10,200
I have to meet my mom.

807
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,900
Huh?

808
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,267
She wants to visit the department store.

809
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:16,867
Your mom?

810
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:20,433
I should get going.

811
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:21,967
Thanks for inviting me today.

812
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:23,567
I'll text you.

813
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,667
What's this? Weren't you
all excited to go out on your date?

814
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:37,500
She says she forgot she has a pop quiz tomorrow.

815
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,033
What? A pop quiz?

816
00:44:39,033 --> 00:44:40,267
Do they still do those nowadays?

817
00:44:40,267 --> 00:44:42,533
Guess her school still does.

818
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:44,533
But why did you let her leave alone?

819
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,567
She had plans with her mom.

820
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:50,867
'Is she a kid?'

821
00:44:50,867 --> 00:44:52,767
'What's with the pop quiz?'

822
00:44:52,767 --> 00:44:54,400
[Is she a kid? What's with the pop quiz?]

823
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,833
Jo Mi Ryo said this.

824
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:20,733
Welcome.

825
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:28,900
You could've taken your time with the homework.

826
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,133
I finished it all.

827
00:45:30,133 --> 00:45:31,733
Really?

828
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:34,567
Sit down.

829
00:45:43,467 --> 00:45:46,067
Tell me.

830
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:48,100
The reason I like you...

831
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,833
I was just drawn to you.

832
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,767
I thought there'd be some grand reason.

833
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,733
Because you're bold and honest.

834
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:57,467
With anyone, anywhere.

835
00:45:57,467 --> 00:46:01,267
I like how you don't worry about others
and stay focused on yourself.

836
00:46:01,267 --> 00:46:02,767
Yeah?

837
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:05,467
What if I'm different outside SF?

838
00:46:05,467 --> 00:46:07,633
- Huh?
- Would you still feel the same?

839
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:10,700
What if I were a timid mess
who can't even make eye contact?

840
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:15,167
What if I'm someone who always
blames myself for everything?

841
00:46:15,167 --> 00:46:16,233
That's impossible.

842
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:18,233
Right, it couldn't be.

843
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:21,267
But I'm also not the woman you imagine.

844
00:46:21,267 --> 00:46:24,500
Meaning, I'm a fantasy you built.

845
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,633
A version of me that only exists inside SF.

846
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:28,667
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

847
00:46:32,133 --> 00:46:33,767
Hyuk.

848
00:46:37,667 --> 00:46:39,700
If the me you like is your fantasy,

849
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,533
then don't try to get it through
someone else, make it yours.

850
00:46:43,533 --> 00:46:47,000
If I pretend to fall
for your flirting here just for fun,

851
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,933
I become a witch seducing an innocent boy.

852
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:54,533
I'm not that irresponsible with my life.

853
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,400
What's with that look?

854
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:05,100
If that look means you understood
nothing and like me even more,

855
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,867
I'll kill you.

856
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,500
<i>Where are you?</i>

857
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:32,600
You have class.

858
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,767
- I'll skip it. Let's hang out.
- Are you a kid?

859
00:47:34,767 --> 00:47:36,067
Why?

860
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:38,333
Let's get something tasty, okay?

861
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,267
Ah, tasty food!

862
00:47:40,267 --> 00:47:41,867
Let's go!

863
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:53,667
Not eating?

864
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:55,533
Then I will.

865
00:47:55,533 --> 00:47:58,433
Ah, that's petty.

866
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,467
I'm stressed.

867
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:07,633
Heo Zero.

868
00:48:07,633 --> 00:48:08,767
Oh, jeez.

869
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:13,067
I was finally forgetting everything,
and then he shows up and messes me up again.

870
00:48:13,067 --> 00:48:14,733
Messes you up?

871
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:17,000
Huh?

872
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,100
Did he stir your feelings?

873
00:48:20,352 --> 00:48:22,167
No, that's not what I meant.

874
00:48:26,133 --> 00:48:27,533
Why the sigh?

875
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:29,833
It doesn't bother you, right?

876
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:30,900
It does.

877
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,167
Seon Ho.

878
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:35,567
Is it normal to not care
when my girlfriend's ex keeps hovering?

879
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:37,200
Koo Seon Ho.

880
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,367
This is driving me crazy.

881
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,333
Wait a second.

882
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:48,967
Koo Seon Ho.

883
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:53,133
Why care about Heo Zero?

884
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:55,633
You think I'd waver because of him?

885
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:57,033
That's insulting.

886
00:48:57,033 --> 00:48:58,233
Nam Geu Rin.

887
00:48:58,233 --> 00:49:01,267
Which one did you just tell that you're stressed

888
00:49:01,267 --> 00:49:03,600
because your ex keeps bothering you?

889
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,467
Male friend Koo Seon Ho? Or...

890
00:49:05,467 --> 00:49:07,400
Boyfriend Koo Seon Ho?

891
00:49:08,867 --> 00:49:12,800
Are you dating me, or are you playing pretend?

892
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,367
Think seriously again.

893
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:00,633
<i>Gi Jeong was shining.</i>

894
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:05,500
<i>Brighter than anyone else there.</i>

895
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,667
<i>He didn't even have to try,</i>

896
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:13,400
<i>but it came naturally to him.</i>

897
00:50:15,733 --> 00:50:19,200
<i>People who effortlessly have it all.</i>

898
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,000
<i>Born with everything from the start.</i>

899
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,533
<i>And me, who believed every word</i>

900
00:50:25,533 --> 00:50:28,733
<i>those people said.</i>

901
00:50:32,067 --> 00:50:35,600
<i>All the things Gi Jeong told me.</i>

902
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,967
<i>Words sweeter</i>

903
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:40,767
<i>than 'I like you.'</i>

904
00:50:46,033 --> 00:50:48,767
<i>Words that reassured me</i>

905
00:50:50,533 --> 00:50:52,133
<i>are now</i>

906
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:55,733
<i>turning into lies that come back</i>

907
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:57,433
<i>to hurt me.</i>

908
00:51:00,033 --> 00:51:02,500
<i>When you fall for someone,</i>

909
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,433
<i>you end up discovering yourself,</i>

910
00:51:05,433 --> 00:51:07,300
<i>not them.</i>

911
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,900
<i>Hidden parts of my heart.</i>

912
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:15,072
<i>The raw truth</i>

913
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,067
<i>about me.</i>

914
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,167
<i>What should I do, Gi Jeong?</i>

915
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:29,800
<i>I'm...</i>

916
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:34,033
<i>I'm starting to hate you.</i>

917
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,067
<i>Delulu</i>

918
00:51:57,967 --> 00:51:59,633
<i>has returned.</i>

919
00:52:05,433 --> 00:52:07,200
Am I that embarrassing to you?

920
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,833
I wish you'd stop acting so confidently.

921
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:12,067
If you hate it, I'll quit. It's not a big deal.

922
00:52:12,067 --> 00:52:14,233
If you betray our Song, I'll skin you alive...

923
00:52:14,233 --> 00:52:16,233
I've got my own problems right now.

924
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:19,000
Those two walked in like Moses
parting the Red Sea.

925
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,567
All of this is because of Acaprio.

926
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:24,467
Then we should crush that punk.

927
00:52:24,467 --> 00:52:26,100
You acted all high and mighty in front of me,

928
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,600
and this is all you're capable of, lying?

929
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,633
Don't you hate my mom?

930
00:52:28,633 --> 00:52:30,933
All parents are like that.
They're just worried about you.

931
00:52:30,933 --> 00:52:33,600
I don't hate your mom, but she scares me.

932
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,800
I'm thinking of breaking up with Gi Jeong.

933
00:52:40,767 --> 00:52:42,000
So tell me.

934
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,367
Tae Seon, you're the one among us
who thinks the most.

935
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:49,033
Hey, does thinking always hurt this much?

936
00:52:50,464 --> 00:52:51,488
Darn it!

937
00:52:51,488 --> 00:52:53,333
These darn thoughts!

938
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:55,700
How do I get them out of my head?

939
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,033
Then stop thinking!

940
00:52:59,098 --> 00:53:00,767
Darn it.

941
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:03,967
I can't. They keep coming!

942
00:53:03,967 --> 00:53:05,300
You little punk!

943
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,167
Since when did you become such a deep thinker?

944
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:09,800
You're barely Homo erectus,
trying to act like Homo sapiens.

945
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,233
That's why your head's exploding!
