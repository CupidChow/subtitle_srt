00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:36,933
Since your hands are small,

546
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:38,867
this might be better.

547
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:48,767
<i>How did he know I have small hands?</i>

548
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,500
An eraser?

549
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,767
When doing croquis, even if you draw a wrong line,

550
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,800
it's better to draw a new line over it.

551
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,700
No time to erase.

552
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,300
But sometimes you want to
erase everything and start fresh, right?

553
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,933
That's when you use this to wipe it all away.

554
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:39,100
It's the best eraser I've ever used.

555
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:43,000
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

556
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,600
Take care on your way back.

557
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,200
See you at the club meeting.

558
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:05,633
Are you all better now?

559
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,433
You...

560
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,500
Why are you here...

561
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,867
Wow, your voice sounds great.

562
00:30:13,867 --> 00:30:17,967
You said you lost your voice
eating those peanut snacks.

you were

lying?

566

Hey.

575
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,400
Hey, you're really funny.

576
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,233
You always get scared easily,
but why are you acting like this now?

577
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:00,233
You're not scared at all?

578
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:01,700
You told me not to be scared!

579
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,700
Hey, you only listen to half of what I say?

580
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,667
I said don't cower unless you did something wrong.

581
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:09,700
But you did wrong me!

582
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,700
You lied!

583
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,933
You did it before too!

584
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:13,400
Ignoring my messages!

585
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,233
You keep wronging me.

586
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,900
Right? Am I wrong?

587
00:32:17,633 --> 00:32:19,533
If you didn't want to meet me,
you should've just said so.

588
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:21,200
Why would you lie?

589
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,233
If you're going to lie,

590
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:24,100
at least don't get caught!

591
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,367
You said you wanted us to get along!

592
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:26,867
No,

593
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:28,867
I take back my offer to be friends!

594
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:31,167
- What?
- You're so self-centered.

595
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:33,233
Glaring intimidatingly at people over nothing.

596
00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:35,633
You enjoy scaring me?

597
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,000
Now that I think about it,

598
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
when did we become friends?

599
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,067

And that's how friendships deepen.

Truthfully, I fought constantly
with Koo Seon Ho at that age too.

635
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,233
You've been friends since middle school, right?

once seen Seon Ho as a guy?

I swear, not even once.

We're super-duper genuine besties.

- You asked why I should stay friends with you.

00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:53,800
- What?
- Is the correct spelling 'wana'

663
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,000
or 'wanna,' you make me think.

669
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:13,100

- Nope.
- No worries?

671
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,700

- But you're bad at studying.

00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:20,233
Your parents don't say anything?

00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,900
While organizing my photos,

727
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,600
I found those subway creep shots we talked about.

728
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,433
Crazy, right?

729
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,433
You're still doing this?

730
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:39,067
So immature.

731
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:40,867
What's the big deal? It's just a joke.

732
00:40:40,867 --> 00:40:42,667
Why are you so down?

733
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:44,000
What's going on?

734
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,500
No idea. I don't know, maybe he got a girlfriend.

735
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,800
Something feels off.

736
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,833
No way. Seriously?

737
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,733
You said that guy was cute
being an eternal single.

738
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:55,333
Hey.

739
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:59,233
What did you just say?

740
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:01,300
'That guy'?

741
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,367
Wait, you just...

742
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:03,600
Park Lee Jin.

743
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,500
You've grown some nerves, huh?

744
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:10,633
Back in middle school,
you couldn't even look me in the eye.

745
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:14,367
But now, because I'm being nice to you,
you think I'm an easy target?

746
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,533
- Sorry.
- Ugh, why's it so tense?

747
00:41:17,533 --> 00:41:19,533
I'm telling you, watch your mouth, Lee Jin.

748
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:20,667
This darn mouth of yours.

749
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:22,100
The mouth's the problem.

750
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,633
Ye Rim, you cool it.

751
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:26,033
This drama queen always does this.

752
00:41:31,433 --> 00:41:34,033
[Gi Jeong, what are you doing?]

753
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:43,467
What exactly did we do today anyway?

754
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,600
- Huh?
- Well, we had lunch,

755
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,067
went to a bookstore, then to a gaming room.

756
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:50,467
Wait, what did you want to do with me last time?

757
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:53,733
You're the one who asked to meet today.

758
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:55,267
What?

759
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:58,167
Well, that's true, but...

760
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:00,267
This is ridiculous.

761
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:03,467
Hey, from what you're saying...

762
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:04,833
What is this?

763
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:06,600
Is this a date or something?

764
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,300
You wanted to date me?

765
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,833
Do you like me?

766
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,100
What are you saying?

767
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,767
Why would I go on a date with you?

768
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:16,633
Hey, don't talk like that again,

769
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:18,200
or I'll think again about

770
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,533
why I should go on a date with you.

771
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:23,467
So don't just ask random questions.

772
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:26,200
This isn't a question.

773
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,633
You didn't ask me, did you?

774
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:29,900
What's your Korean score?

775
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,967
It depends on the day,
but I keep it between the low to mid 40s.

776
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:37,000
- Welcome.
- You've grown some nerves.

777
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,400
Who does she think she is?

778
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,000
Enough. Want a drink?

779
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,933
I'll have iced americano.

780
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:44,967
Same.

781
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:47,800
I'll have three iced drinks
and one of these, please.

782
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,333
Insert your card at the front.

783
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,367
All set. I'll call when ready.

784
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:54,400
Thanks.

785
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,233
Let's go now.

786
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:59,267
Go where?

787
00:42:59,267 --> 00:43:00,867
Sit.

788
00:43:07,967 --> 00:43:10,100
Thought you forgot what I said,

789
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,033
but you didn't.

790
00:43:12,033 --> 00:43:14,033
Why are you pretending like you forgot?

791
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,567
Don't be scared.

792
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:20,933
You did nothing wrong.

793
00:43:23,933 --> 00:43:27,800
What do you regret most about that day?

794
00:43:31,367 --> 00:43:32,400
Backing down.

795
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,433
<i>You glared at me again, right?</i>

796
00:43:35,433 --> 00:43:37,800
<i>No, just looking.</i>

797
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,467
<i>Why did you stare at me like that?</i>

798
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:43,667
<i>I just thought the tint looks pretty.</i>

799
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:44,800
<i>She said your tint looks pretty.</i>

800
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,467
I said that because I was scared of them,

801
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,800
it wasn't what I really meant.

802
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:53,400
<i>Satisfied, Miss?</i>

803
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,800
<i>Whoa, goddess appeared.</i>

804
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,033
<i>- Amazing.
- I can post this online, right?</i>

805
00:43:58,033 --> 00:44:00,167
The fact that I couldn't say anything

806
00:44:01,633 --> 00:44:04,000
even after ending up like that,

807
00:44:07,133 --> 00:44:10,333
that's what I regret the most.

808
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,900
Let's go to the bathroom.

809
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,200
I need to fix my makeup.

810
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,667
What if drinks pop up then?

811
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:21,767
We'll get them later or something.

812
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:24,333
Go finish everything now.

813
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,233
No, I won't.

814
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:28,800
- Go and tell them everything.
- I don't want to.

815
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,500
I wouldn't have spoken up anyway.

816
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,500
What's different between then and now?

817
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:42,333
I'm right behind you.

818
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,167
Huh?

819
00:44:52,867 --> 00:44:54,800
You again?

820
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,967
I guess we're really connected to the bathroom.

821
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:04,433
No makeup today, loser?

822
00:45:04,433 --> 00:45:06,100
Why didn't you do your makeup?

823
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,600
Didn't you like the makeup I did last time?

824
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,833
Hey.

825
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:13,467
Ignoring me?

826
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,000
Guys.

827
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,800
She's gone crazy.

828
00:45:19,267 --> 00:45:20,300
Can't you hear?

829
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,867
Are you deaf?

830
00:45:22,867 --> 00:45:26,100
You just want me to do your makeup again, huh?

831
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,800
Fine, this time,

832
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,067
I'll make it way prettier than last time.

833
00:45:30,067 --> 00:45:31,867
Come over here.

834
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,467
See this?

835
00:45:34,467 --> 00:45:35,867
Did you just hit me?

836
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:36,867
Yeah.

837
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,500
'Yeah'?

838
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,600
What did you just say?

839
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:43,533
What's with those eyes?

840
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,800
You glaring at me?

841
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,667
Yeah.

842
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:49,267
You guys

843
00:45:51,733 --> 00:45:53,900
shouldn't live like this.

844
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,833
Hey, loser! Come back here?

845
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,633
Hey, loser.

846
00:46:11,633 --> 00:46:12,967
Who's that? Someone you know?

847
00:46:12,967 --> 00:46:14,067
I don't know.

848
00:46:14,067 --> 00:46:15,467
You don't know? Let's go.

849
00:46:15,467 --> 00:46:17,700
Everyone's watching. Cut it out.

850
00:46:23,233 --> 00:46:25,067
Hey, she's not coming.

851
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,600
Ah, my bag.

852
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:32,300
Ah, that felt so good.

853
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,500
It wasn't anything special, right?

854
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,600
Yeah, totally nothing.

855
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,367
Why couldn't I do this before?

856
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:39,600
Today's the most satisfying day of my life.

857
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,500
Right, keep doing that.

858
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,200
Say everything you want to say.

859
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,200
Swear when you're pissed.

860
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,433
Next time, I'll teach you
how to curse properly. Okay?

861
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:50,467
Okay.

862
00:46:50,467 --> 00:46:52,567
Okay, let's go.

863
00:46:59,467 --> 00:47:00,633
Hurry up!

864
00:47:00,633 --> 00:47:02,267
Yeah.

865
00:47:13,367 --> 00:47:15,000
Hello.

866
00:47:19,267 --> 00:47:22,167
Bigfoot, you doing okay?

867
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,667
You feel good today, huh?

868
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,033
The yellow room, please.

869
00:47:28,033 --> 00:47:30,967
Bigfoot, guide her.

870
00:47:47,633 --> 00:47:50,133
Was there a place like this?

871
00:47:51,033 --> 00:47:52,800
Bigfoot, let's go.

872
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:08,467
Feels like stepping into a fairy tale.

873
00:48:09,367 --> 00:48:14,600
A storybook with colorful paper worlds.

874
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:23,600
Good job, Bigfoot.

875
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:28,967
[Spirit Fingers, Fourth Meeting]

876
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:43,500
Alright, three minutes up.

877
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:53,133
What?

878
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:54,967
Why do you draw so well?

879
00:48:58,167 --> 00:48:59,800
What?

880
00:49:05,033 --> 00:49:08,200
Okay, okay. I won't laugh.

881
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,233
Show me your drawing.

882
00:49:09,233 --> 00:49:10,833
- Don't laugh.
- Got it.

883
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:16,400
Hey, there's no face.

884
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,767
Even if the time is short,
eyes, nose, and mouth are essential.

885
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:23,533
What? Last time was chaos.

886
00:49:23,533 --> 00:49:25,533
Now they are so close?

887
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:26,600
They're kids.

888
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,433
At that age, you could kiss
and still stay friends.

889
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:30,500
Unnie.

890
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,400
Why keep bringing up kissing since last time?

891
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,200
Hold the pencil like this.

892
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,733
You drew the boots well.

893
00:49:35,733 --> 00:49:37,133
- Really?
- Yeah, kinda.

894
00:49:37,133 --> 00:49:40,367
Hey, I can't let this slide,
next time when I have time,

895
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:43,667
I'll teach you about drawing, how's that?

896
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:44,933
U Yeon.

897
00:49:44,933 --> 00:49:46,667
How do you like the croquis book?

898
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:49,300
Is it good?

899
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:53,133
Yes, the lines are really bold and I love it.

900
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:55,933
Thanks for picking such a good one.

901
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,400
Bigfoot.

902
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,200
What is it?

903
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,567
Wow, looks delicious.

904
00:50:35,567 --> 00:50:37,933
Thank you.

905
00:50:37,933 --> 00:50:39,900
Please eat.

906
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,533
Please eat.

907
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,533
Here.

908
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,433
- I won't eat it.
- Why?

909
00:50:51,433 --> 00:50:53,800
I don't know. My stomach feels queasy and weird.

910
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,433
You eat it.

911
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,033
Hey, you punk! Slow down.

912
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:45,033
What's wrong with him?

913
00:51:45,033 --> 00:51:47,167
There's barely any left. Are you hogging it all?

914
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:49,800
Share it.

915
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,033
Your boyfriend?

916
00:51:57,033 --> 00:51:58,467
No, just asked me to grab drinks.

917
00:51:58,467 --> 00:52:00,667
Wow, our Mint here's quite popular, huh?

918
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:01,867
Tell me about it.

919
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,367
I'm dead exhausted.

920
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:05,233
Same here.

921
00:52:05,233 --> 00:52:06,900
Have some of this.

922
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,300
I'll take this call and be right back.

923
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,900
Go ahead.

924
00:52:13,533 --> 00:52:14,733
Who said anything?

925
00:52:14,733 --> 00:52:16,400
I'm starving, starving.

926
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,200
Unnie, should I introduce you to a junior I know?

927
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,067
Nah, it's better to meet naturally.

928
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,000
Huh? Hello?

929
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,600
Yeah.

930
00:52:38,433 --> 00:52:40,833
There's an error in the computer?

931
00:52:42,767 --> 00:52:44,367
What about our project?

932
00:52:45,267 --> 00:52:48,867
First, stay calm and explain slowly.

933
00:52:50,933 --> 00:52:51,967
Yeah, about 20 minutes?

934
00:52:51,967 --> 00:52:54,033
Then I'll head to the department room now.

935
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,600
Around 20 minutes?

936
00:52:57,433 --> 00:52:59,100
Yeah.

937
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,867
Okay, got it.

938
00:53:05,733 --> 00:53:07,333
Who are you talking to?

939
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,900
Hey.

940
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,167
Nam Geu Rin, you okay?

941
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:14,567
Hey, even if you claim to not see me as a woman,

942
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:16,467
I'm still a woman!

943
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,467
I'm leaving.

944
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,733
Just draw it as big as possible.

945
00:53:42,067 --> 00:53:43,133
What's wrong?

946
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:45,467
Something happened outside?

947
00:53:52,267 --> 00:53:55,367
I need to go handle something at school.

948
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:57,433
Group project?

949
00:53:57,433 --> 00:53:58,800
Yes.

950
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,833
I'll head in first.

951
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:02,633
Get back safely.

952
00:54:24,267 --> 00:54:25,333
Mint.

953
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,833
Yeah?

954
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:29,533
If you're feeling down, should we
send the kids home and grab a drink?

955
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:32,200
No, I need to go teach Koo Seon Ho a lesson.

956
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,833
I'll get going.

957
00:54:35,133 --> 00:54:37,767
I'll go too. See you next week.

958
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,100
Me too, then.

959
00:55:09,733 --> 00:55:11,567
You startled me.

960
00:55:11,567 --> 00:55:13,333
Are you not going home?

961
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:20,367
Nah, I already ate.

962
00:55:26,967 --> 00:55:28,933
Huh? What's this?

963
00:55:28,933 --> 00:55:30,167
Not here either?

964
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:33,833
Ugh, that stingy punk.

965
00:55:59,467 --> 00:56:02,133
[Koo Seon Ho, you punk!]

966
00:56:09,067 --> 00:56:12,067
[Koo Seon Ho, you punk!]

967
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:25,933
<i>To you, is Nam Geu Rin</i>

968
00:56:26,733 --> 00:56:28,100
<i>a woman?</i>

969
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,900
[Myeong Hun: I like you]

970
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:35,567
<i>Your boyfriend?</i>

971
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:38,100
<i>No, just asked me to grab drinks.</i>

972
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,300
To me, you're a girl.

973
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,100
That's the problem.

974
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,500
Why keep following me?

975
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,867
Got something to say?

976
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,233
Hey, why are you...

977
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:55,867
<i>♫ Tell me, you already know ♫</i>

978
00:57:55,867 --> 00:58:00,133
<i>♫ You know exactly what I'm trying to say ♫</i>

979
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:02,300
Do you like Seon Ho?

980
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,100
Do you?

981
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:18,133
Why can't I like Seon Ho?

982
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:19,133
Wait, you like Seon Ho?

983
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:20,567
So that's why you were upset?

984
00:58:20,567 --> 00:58:22,200
That's it, the anger, it's the anger.

985
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,400
Or mad because he likes U Yeon.

986
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,833
You two actually look good together.

987
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:27,667
There's no decent man in my life.

988
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:30,200
Let's try it once before we die, girl crush.

989
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,233
What? This was supposed to be
a girl crush concept!

990
00:58:32,233 --> 00:58:33,500
You look cute in anything.

991
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,067
How long have you been staring at this chapter?

992
00:58:36,067 --> 00:58:37,824
What's making you so nervous all the time?

993
00:58:37,824 --> 00:58:38,880
Just go bold.

994
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,968
U Yeon.

995
00:58:39,968 --> 00:58:42,167
I'll keep my feelings for him
to myself like before.

996
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:43,867
Stop worrying.

997
00:58:43,867 --> 00:58:46,233
Quit crushing quietly.

998
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,467
Darn it!

999
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:01,000
Keep your eyes open!

1000
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,267
Sorry.

1001
00:59:02,267 --> 00:59:04,933
You are wearing trashy clothes, loser.

1002
00:59:04,933 --> 00:59:07,833
- Darn it.
- So annoying.

1003
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:08,867
Exactly.

1004
00:59:08,867 --> 00:59:10,700
Even Class 3 losers wouldn't wear
something like that, right?

1005
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,867
Hey!

1006
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:12,933
What!

1007
00:59:12,933 --> 00:59:13,967
Is she insane?

1008
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,267
- Hey, stop her.
- Hold on, hold on.

1009
00:59:17,233 --> 00:59:18,933
Don't live like that.

1010
00:59:18,933 --> 00:59:20,567
Got it?

1011
00:59:22,033 --> 00:59:23,767
Sorry.
