I can't make it then.

What?

14

Got it.

Hey, Koo Seon Ho.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,533
Can't we just stay friends

Oh, seriously...

But how much longer will you keep liking Seon Ho?

37
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,700
Totally forgot.

38
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,167
Need to return this.

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,200
Hey.

40
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,900
Isn't that Seon Ho's?

41
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,967
Why do you still have that?

42
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:31,267
Hey. Be honest with me.

43
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,267
This looks better on me than on Seon Ho, right?

44
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:36,000
Why are you wearing it? Take it off.

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,133
Answer me and I'll give it back.

51

56

Hey, how long are you going to keep doing this?

- No, give it to me.

63

It's not even yours, why did you wear it?

64
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:32,233
What? Is Seon Ho's cardigan
more important than my head?

65
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:33,333

Enough! Get lost!

72
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,467
I'm more handsome!

73
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:06,048
I'm undeniably hotter!

74
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,600
You're more handsome!

75
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:16,267
I'll erase him.

76
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,600

I'll erase him for sure.

80
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,633
I'm going to erase everything, completely!

81
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,467

Yeah, to the point

What will you do now?

86
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,368
Are you going to give up on Seon Ho?

87

Or will it turn into a love triangle with Geu Rin?

88
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,992
I know it's right for me to step back.

89

you've changed, haven't you?

94
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:19,936

Oh, right.

101
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:56,767
I unfollowed my work friend and we fought.

102

She was like, 'Hasn't 'Legend' passed its prime?'

103

What? Is she insane?

104
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:01,400
I know.

105
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,633
So I got mad, and she was like,

106
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:05,100
'It's just a joke, why are you getting serious?'

107
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,767
If it hurts someone, even as a joke,
it's not a joke anymore.

108
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:08,767
Exactly.

109
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:10,100
Hey, don't meet her.

110

- We're not even close.
- Then why is she like that?

<i>Even if it's a joke, if the listener gets hurt,
it's not a joke.</i>

112
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,633
Why do you always talk to me that way?

113
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:17,033
Do you know how hurt I feel every time?

114
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:19,833
Just because I laughed it off
doesn't mean I wasn't hurt.

115
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,967
I held back because I didn't
want to fight with my friend over this.

116
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,833
You should've said something! Why endure?

117
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,400
Because you're my friend.

118
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,400
Actually, I almost called Mi Rae last night.

119
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,767
Why?

120
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:44,600
After seeing this,
I thought I should just apologize.

121
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,267
Stay firm.

122
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:48,367
If you apologize, it'll just
be the same all over again.

Hey, friend!

Wow, he's ridiculously good-looking.

00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,544

00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:17,067
Ah, why? Where are we going?

135
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:20,967
What's wrong with you? Why do you keep
showing up at school without telling me?

136
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:22,933
Here.

137
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,367
You bought this?

138
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:34,592
You think I found it on the street?

139
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,256
You are grateful, right?

140
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,600
Yeah, thanks for this.

141
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,933
But,

142
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:45,533
I never said I'd give this to you.

143
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,867
- What?
- I'll deliver it to Seon Ho for you.

144
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:52,567
Then why come all the way here?
You could just text me.

145
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,733
Someone headbutted me yesterday.

146
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:58,700
My head's been throbbing all day,

147
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,733
and I feel nauseous.

148
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:06,133
Look, I even have a bruise.

149
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:07,167
You seem fine to me.

150
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,633
Fine? Come on, look closer. Closer.

151
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,367
I said look closely, huh?

152
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,000
Miss Piggy,

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,167
I'll give you a chance to apologize
to my handsome forehead.

154
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,800
What?

155
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Guys.

156
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,167
My female friend is buying us a treat.

157
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,333
Really? Let's go!

158
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,367

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,200
I'll have Big Monster Truffle

Urgh.

00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,200
How much was it?

- This.
- This can't be right.

00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:51,200
No, it's correct.

184
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,167
Scoring over 100
on a name compatibility test is rare.

185
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:05,267
You two are really meant to be,
just go ahead and date already.

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,633
You and I are meant to be.

189

She doubts this, huh?

190
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,200
See this?

191
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,233
You need to calculate it once more here.

192
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:31,300
1 plus 2 is 3, 2 plus 6 is 8,

193
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,167
so not 126...

194
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,467
38?

195
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:39,008
We only scored 38 points?

196
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:42,933
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

197
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:44,633
I think the math is wrong.

198
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:47,600
See? Name tests are unreliable.

199
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Right, right, right.

200
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,900
Let's try a scientific approach.

201

What are your blood types?

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,400
I'm type B!

203

Hey, that doesn't matter.

207

What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

208
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:04,300
You're not supposed to mix saliva
from different blood types.

209
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,600
- You're AB type, right?
- Yeah.

210
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,067
AB can safely mix with both A and B types.

211
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:12,300
- Oh, really?
- You didn't even know that?

212

<i>- Idiot.
- Probably all of them.</i>

213

What blood type are you?

214
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,533
Doll type maybe?

215
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,033
Sorry.

216

Why are you getting serious
over something like that?

Actually, I used to think
I was a bit better than you, Song.

00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:24,567
Or did I give up from the start because of her?

542
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,167
I've thought about it.

543
00:29:27,456 --> 00:29:32,133
Still, I don't think
I could've confessed to Seon Ho.

544
00:29:32,133 --> 00:29:35,167
I'm not good enough to be by his side.

545
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:37,633
Hey, what's wrong with you?

546
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:39,467
You're genuinely awesome, you know?

547
00:29:40,933 --> 00:29:43,567
Should I go tell Seon Ho?

548
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:44,667
That I like him?

549
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,833
Ugh, stressful.

550
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,067
Apparently I only look good in your eyes.

551
00:29:55,433 --> 00:29:56,500
That's enough, right?

552
00:29:57,733 --> 00:29:59,067
Huh?

553
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:03,467
Miss Piggy, you just need to look good to me.

554
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:05,367
No, you have to.

555
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:11,467
With all the spoilers gone,

556
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:13,467
shall we go to the gallery first or eat first?

557
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:14,533
U Yeon!

558
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:15,533
What?

559
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:18,200
Oh, right!

560
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,100
I came here to meet Mi Rae.

561
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,933
Hey, where are you going?

562
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:23,867
We were supposed to meet inside the bookstore.

563
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:27,000
Why did you bring him along?

564
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,864
Sorry, Mi Rae, it's just...

565
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:32,100
This reminds me of
our high school days, doesn't it?

566
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,267
We went to that art academy
and tteokbokki place so often back then.

567
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:37,200
Wonder if they're still around.

568
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:41,633
- Here.
- Nah, you drink it.

569
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:42,667
Take it.

570
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:47,500
- Fine.
- It's hot, careful.

571
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,467
Your boyfriend's so attentive.

572
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:51,033
He's not my boyfriend.

573
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,267
- Ow, hot.
- Hey!

574
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:57,600
- You're really...
- Your boyfriend told you to be careful.

575
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:00,300
He's not my boyfriend.

576
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,600
Then what is he?

577
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,867
- Situationship?
- Friends. Just friends.

578
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:06,048
We're obviously just friends. Come on.

579
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
Are you okay?

580
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,400
Seon Ho.

581
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:17,733
What? Are you feeling unwell?

582
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:20,167
Should we go to the hospital?

583
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:21,233
We're

584
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:24,533
ruined.

585
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:28,900
It's so awkward. So awkward I could die.

586
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,933
We can't go back to how we were.

587
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:34,933
Why was I even born a girl?

588
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:37,467
- Nam Geu Rin.
- If I were a guy,

589
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:39,328
you wouldn't like me like this,

590
00:31:39,968 --> 00:31:42,000
and I wouldn't have to agonize.

591
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,467
We could just be lifelong fun friends.

592
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:46,867
- Geu Rin.
- Why?

593
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:50,100
- Go home and rest.
- Huh?

594
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,833
Tomorrow, things will feel normal again.

595
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:57,000
You think so?

596
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,200
Can we really act normal tomorrow?

597
00:32:01,856 --> 00:32:05,600
Yeah. Tomorrow, we'll be fine.

598
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,667
We can do it.

599
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:10,000
I can't lose you like this, okay?

600
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm going crazy.

601
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,700
I've gotta go next month too.

602
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,033
Feels like there's a reason it's limited edition.

603
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:21,733
I want to go tomorrow. I really do.

604
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,367
Ugh, we need to see the artwork.

605
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:26,867
The gallery's about to close.

606
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:33,033
I was supposed to meet U Yeon first.

607
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:34,300
You're the intruder here.

608
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,233
Huh? Intruder?

609
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:38,467
I'll leave anyway, but remember this...

610
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:40,200
Oh, you're leaving?

611
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,072
I'm letting it slide
because you're handsome, Poo Gi Jeong.

612
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:46,467
- See you tomorrow, Song. I'm leaving.
- Mi Rae, wait a sec.

613
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:48,133
Bye, Miss Piggy's friend.

614
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,167
Thank you.

615
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,267
Let's go see the art.

616
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:55,000
I never actually agreed to
go to the gallery with you.

617
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,384
The situation earlier was different.

618
00:32:56,384 --> 00:32:58,133
Now you're backtracking again?

619
00:32:58,133 --> 00:32:59,767
Last time you touched my chest
and pretended nothing happened?

620
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,400
Stop bringing that up.

00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:08,033

624
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:09,767
Yes!

625
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:14,600
Sounds fun.

626
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,700
I'd go too if it weren't for exams.

627
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Don't worry.

628
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:22,880
Even if you can't come,
I'll make it feel like we're together.

629
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:27,567
If you like it, we'll go see the art together
after your exams, okay?

630
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:29,000
What are you talking about?

[Spirit Fingers, 7th Meeting]

632
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:48,400
Wow.

633
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:52,067
The vibe's different today, huh?

634
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:56,233
Call me Black Finger today.

635
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:59,267
But no one's here yet?

636
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:01,300
There's one person here.

637
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,567
- Is it Blue Finger?
- No.

638
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:04,300
Phew, what a relief.

639
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,567
Why is that a relief?

640
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,480
Why would that be a relief?

641
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,100
Lately, I don't even understand myself.

642
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,992
Why am I like this?

643
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:30,700
Hi, Geu Rin.

644
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,833
Yikes!

645
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:33,000
Jeez, creepy.

646
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,533
- Huh?
- I feel sick.

647
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:36,833
I have goosebumps.

648
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,700
What's so scary?

649
00:34:40,033 --> 00:34:41,867
Ah, I almost threw a punch.

650
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:43,133
Can you at least make some noise when you move?

Suddenly startling people from behind.

654
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,133
When did I ever?

655
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:52,233
- Did I?
- Huh?

656
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:53,633
Seon Ho, your socks don't match.

657
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,433
What's with the mismatched kiddie socks?

658
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:57,667
It's your usual fashion style.

659
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:59,367
Even copied Nam Green's speech style.

660
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:00,700
What's he saying?

661
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,367
It feels natural.

662
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,367
Hey, Koo Seon Ho, you were right!

663
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:07,200
We're getting comfortable with each other again!

664

- What?
- Keep using that speech style for now.

Who's there? Why aren't you coming in?

Oh.

669
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:23,767
Don't take photos. The colors are too flashy.

670
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:25,267
This is embarrassing.

Are you ashamed of our school uniform?

Men need confidence. Confidence.

674
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,733
Confidence!

675
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:35,033
That goes for women too.

676
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,600
Today's theme is pure blue.

677
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:50,300
- How do I look?
- It suits you perfectly.

678

So we just need Khaki and Black here?

680
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:58,233
I'm here though.

681
00:35:58,233 --> 00:35:59,433
When did Black Finger arrive...

682
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:06,300
Black, your hair...

683
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,067
Oh, the wig didn't match
today's concept, so I took it off.

684
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,467
This is my real hair.

685
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,467
- Khaki?
- Hello.

686
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,067
Why are you staring?

687
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,200
- Because you look cool.
- Yeah?

688
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,167
I guess I should take it off more often then.

689
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:27,367
This is weird...

690
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:29,633
You took off the hat,
but why does nothing look different?

691
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:31,333
Am I the weird one here?

692
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:35,800
I wish Baeblu had come.

Don't worry.

00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,400
Even if she's not here,
I'll send photos to make her feel included.

Did you take my photos earlier though?

00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,600
I don't recall you did.

Let's pretend you didn't come today.

Wow, you look awesome.

704

Really? Do I look like you?

705
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:17,267
An innocent girl who grows flowers.

706
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,800
Is this what you meant?

707
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,533
It really feels like we're together.

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,033

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,267
No umbrella,

900
00:52:06,267 --> 00:52:09,344
no money, no phone.

901
00:52:09,344 --> 00:52:10,667
Are you crying?

902
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:11,900
I'm sorry.

903
00:52:14,112 --> 00:52:19,033
I was so excited thinking about dating you
that I stayed up for three days,

904
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:21,533
so I passed out a bit.

905
00:52:21,533 --> 00:52:25,367
My friends are so stupid like me.

906
00:52:25,367 --> 00:52:29,367
I told them to set my alarm for 8 AM,
but they set it to 8 PM.

907
00:52:29,367 --> 00:52:33,267
So I rushed over right after waking up
and even left my phone behind.

908
00:52:33,267 --> 00:52:35,233
And it was raining, but I didn't have an umbrella.

909
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:38,267
I'm sorry.

910
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,800
I only understood half of it, but it's okay.

911
00:52:43,433 --> 00:52:47,600
You're not... mad, are you?

912
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,567
I was angry at first,

913
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:53,088
but then I thought about it, and you're
not the type to do that without saying anything.

914
00:52:54,033 --> 00:52:56,000
I was worried something happened to you.

915
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,733
Worried?

916
00:52:58,733 --> 00:52:59,767
Yeah.

917
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,784
I was scared while waiting for you.

918
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,767
I rushed over and you weren't here.

919
00:53:09,767 --> 00:53:12,100
Waited in front of your house, but you never came.

920
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:16,767
I was trying to erase Seon Ho from your mind,
but I was afraid I'd be erased instead.

921
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,800
You can't erase things that way.

922
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,033
Your presence is too strong to be erased.

923
00:53:21,033 --> 00:53:22,133
Really?

924
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,267
I really can't be erased, right?

925
00:53:25,967 --> 00:53:26,967
You.

926
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:31,567
If you spill tteokbokki sauce on your uniform,
does it wash off easily?

927
00:53:31,567 --> 00:53:33,400
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You're a Red.

928
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,067
- Gochujang-colored.
- Hey.

929
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:36,700
What kind of metaphor is that?

930
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:41,500
Hey, did you catch a cold?

931
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,800
No, I don't get sick easily.

932
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,567
Go home now, take some medicine, and sleep.

933
00:53:48,567 --> 00:53:50,367
- I don't want to.
- Come on, hurry.

934
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,067
I'm not going home.

935
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,376
Let's stay together a bit longer.

936
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,200
Okay?

937
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,600
Why do you even like me?

938
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,733
What?

939
00:54:17,733 --> 00:54:20,900
Don't say nonsense like
'because your earlobes are pretty.'

940
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,936
Honestly, it doesn't make sense for someone

941
00:54:24,733 --> 00:54:26,976
as amazing as you to like someone
as average as me.

942
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,272
There's no special reason or anything.

943
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:33,533
Who said you're average?

944
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:35,300
You're super unique.

945
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,400
Among all the girls I know,
there's no one like you.

946
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,167
That kinda sounds like an insult?

947
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:44,367
It's a compliment.

948
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:45,633
It's not.

949
00:54:45,633 --> 00:54:46,733
It is.

950
00:55:05,633 --> 00:55:06,667
I just like you.

951
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,533
Just?

952
00:55:13,067 --> 00:55:16,600
When someone likes someone else,
does there have to be a reason?

953
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,933
Feelings just happen suddenly, that's all.

954
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:24,667
Just...

955
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,833
Are we still friends?

956
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:29,867
Huh?

957
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,133
I don't know.

958
00:55:46,067 --> 00:55:47,133
Then...

959
00:55:48,033 --> 00:55:49,067
Huh?

960
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,300
Then...

961
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,300
What?

962
00:56:02,133 --> 00:56:03,567
Should we try kissing?

963
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,167
What?

964
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:07,167
A kiss.

965
00:56:16,033 --> 00:56:20,300
<i>♫ Tell me, you already know ♫</i>

966
00:56:21,733 --> 00:56:26,528
<i>♫ You know exactly what I'm trying to say ♫</i>

967
00:56:27,168 --> 00:56:28,600
You were excited, no?

968
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,600
Oh my god, you're insane, absolutely insane!

969
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,833
Let's change tactics. It's time to stop chasing.

970
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,400
Harley Quinn. The icon of vengeance.

971
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,633
Today's our date.

972
00:56:35,633 --> 00:56:36,967
Unless you're a stalker?

973
00:56:36,967 --> 00:56:38,500
I didn't do anything wrong.

974
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,800
But because of you,
people call me ugly and a stalker.

975
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,233
It's a gift. Pretty, right?

976
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:44,100
- Oh, you're matching.
- Matching, my foot!

977
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,400
- You look cute today.
- Don't be silly.

978
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,168
What kind of pathetic club is that?

979
00:56:47,168 --> 00:56:49,700
Just because you don't like it
doesn't mean you should belittle it.

980
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,567
Pretending to be fine
and acting like nothing's wrong.

981
00:56:52,567 --> 00:56:54,233
Keeping a poker face is easier anyway.

982
00:56:54,233 --> 00:56:55,367
- Hey.
- You!

983
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:56,567
I'll take full responsibility.

984
00:56:56,567 --> 00:56:57,967
You'll take responsibility?

985
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:04,448
Hey, hey.

986
00:57:04,448 --> 00:57:06,400
- Why did I do that?
- Hey, what?

987
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,033
- Why?
- Why's he like that?

988
00:57:09,033 --> 00:57:10,800
Why? Why?

989
00:57:11,467 --> 00:57:12,633
Why?

990
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:14,600
Let's leave, let's get out.

991
00:57:15,767 --> 00:57:18,267
- Darn it.
- Let's go now.
