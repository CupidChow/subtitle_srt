00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:12,433
Hello.

181
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,133
Oh, you're matching.

182
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,767
- Matching, my foot!
- Matching, my foot!

183
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,900
Unbelievable, seriously!

184
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,167
My thoughts, exactly.

185
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,233
Why are you so tense? It was a compliment.

186
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,033
- I need a bathroom break.
- Okay.

187
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,200
Can you even see through that?

188
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:48,267
You look cute today.

189
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,167
Don't be silly.

190
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,467
- Hello.
- Hi.

191
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:03,500
Hey, there.

192
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,033
You're matching like a couple.

193
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,433
You should pose like a couple today.

194
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:10,433
That'd be so adorable.

195
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:12,433
- Stop saying that!
- Couple, my foot!

196
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:16,233
Wait, where's Gi Jeong?

197
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,933
I doubt he'll show up today.

198
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:22,267
He's cooped up again like a larva for some reason.

199
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:25,833
What's this?

200
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:30,000
Isn't this a video of Red?

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Huh?

202
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,133
- What's this?
- Wait, that's definitely Red.

203
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,767
It is him.

204
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:40,600
[Live, Subway Line 2, Harley Quinn]

205
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,267
What on earth is wrong with him?

206
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,067
That crazy...

207
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,667
You're a total lunatic!

208
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,433
Did you really take the subway like that?

209
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,200
Yes.

210
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
That's our Red. So brave!

211
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,600
Wow, I'm so envious.

212
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,064
If I had half that courage...

213
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:05,367
No.

214
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:09,967
Hi.

215
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,100
Wow, he looks so cool.

216
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:22,000
What on earth are you supposed to be?

217
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:27,967
Harley Quinn. The icon of vengeance.

218
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:30,400
Hey, today, we're supposed to
dress up as animals...

219
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,900
Hush!

220
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,733
You didn't let me finish.

221
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:40,500
I'm portraying a bird
caught in Harley Quinn's trap.

222
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,733
Trap?

223
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,167
What trap?

224
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:44,267
There's one

225
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,300
that's set up

226
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,100
by the cold and heartless Blue Witch.

227
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:54,633
What's this punk babbling about?
That's nothing like a bird...

228
00:12:56,128 --> 00:12:57,310
Oh my.

229
00:12:58,767 --> 00:12:59,767
A crow?

230
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,667
You look like a real bird.

231
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:02,800
You prepared thoroughly.

232
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,056
You look just like one. Really.

233
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,567
What about you, Baeblu?

234
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:10,567
Sorry?

235
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:14,233
Well, I...

236
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,933
Roar!

237
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,067
- So cute!
- Adorable!

238
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,800
- So cute.
- You look so adorable.

239
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,000
What's that? Are you supposed to be Bigfoot?

240
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
- Yes.
- Oh, I see.

241
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,633
- You look just like Bigfoot. What a great idea.
- Isn't she so cute?

242
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:39,400
You look super cute. It suits you.

243
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:41,833
Did you perm this?

244
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,200
- Cute.
- They're stuck together.

245
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,567
Shall we begin?

246
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:45,933
- Sure.
- Okay.

247
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,100
Cutie Baeblu, would you like to go first?

248
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,200
Sure.

249
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
No, I'll go first.

250
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,867
It's called, 'A Wounded Bird.'

251
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:01,000
Seriously, what's with this wounded bird crap?

252
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,533
You're just a lunatic, full of crap.

253
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,733
Get out of my way.

254
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:07,000
Do it right or die.

255
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:09,300
U Yeon, you can go later.

256
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:14,300
Okay, one minute starts now.

257
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,700
Time's up. Next.

258
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,467
Time's up. Next.

259
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:38,167
Time's up. Next!

260
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:39,433
Next person, go.

261
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:41,433
Next. Next person!

262
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:42,433
Stop!

263
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,567
Enough! How many more poses are you doing?

264
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:48,133
What's the problem? I haven't even done 100 yet!

265
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:49,300
Let go, seriously!

266
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,867
Other people need a turn too!

267
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:57,800
What are you looking at, ugly?

268
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,833
You punk! Have you lost your mind?

269
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,200
Why did you hit me?

270
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,467
U Yeon, I'll avenge you!

271
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,533
Don't mess with me.

272
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,833
I'll do the next pose.

273
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,067
One minute starts now.

274
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,333
Oh, you're using charcoal?

275
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,433
Yes, I thought it'd be fun.

276
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:41,600
Charcoal art needs smudging all over the face.

277
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,467
Is that right?

278
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:49,667
Like this?

279
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,300
Yes, that's right.

280
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,633
Hey, that's a great pose!

281
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:02,167
Don't mock me.

282
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:04,767
Everyone, what are you
waiting for? Let's stand up!

283
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,467
Come on, rabbit! Dinosaur!

284
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,400
Except you, Seon Ho! Let's go, animals!

285
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,633
Follow me!

286
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:11,433
Come on.

287
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:14,100
Let's go. Follow me!

288
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:21,500
Wow, fresh air.

289
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:26,133
Everyone, watch your step and follow me closely.

290
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:29,033
Both of you, watch your heels so you don't fall.

291
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:30,867
Wait up!

292
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,067
That's the prettiest rabbit I've ever seen.

293
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:39,133
Everyone, applaud!

294
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,367
Wow, Dong Geon.

295
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:53,400
You should shoot a carrot commercial.

296
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,600
You worked hard today,
so I give you some special hearts!

297
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:02,700
Dinosaur in the forest!

298
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,633
That was three minutes.
Baeblu, do you want to go next?

299
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:08,667
Sure.

300
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,067
What's a puppy doing here?

301
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,200
Hey, where are you going?

302
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:21,800
To take a dump.

303
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:33,300
Why's he acting like that today?

304
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,467
Your overreacting doesn't
even seem bad these days.

305
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:38,067
He's just taking it out on Baeblu today.

306
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:39,800
Raging hormones, perhaps?

307
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,367
He's especially unpredictable today, right?

308
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:43,933
Did something happen between you two?

309
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:45,333
No way.

310
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,367
Sorry, Baeblu.

311
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:49,767
It's my fault for having such a pathetic brother.

312
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:50,767
No worries.

313
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,600
But you siblings are the most entertaining.

314
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,867
Don't suddenly start getting along, okay?

315
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,367
I'll quit coming here then and there.

316
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,467
- Geez.
- Geez.

317
00:17:58,467 --> 00:17:59,933
That won't ever happen.

318
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:01,033
What a relief.

319
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:17,633
Bigfoot.

320
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:21,200
I followed the plan. Why isn't it exciting at all?

321
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,833
I'll go get Bigfoot.

322
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,200
Hey, Gi Jeong.

323
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:36,833
Hey, listen.

324
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,400
About the other night...

325
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,200
Baeblu! Is Bigfoot here?

326
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:43,733
Oh, yes. He's right here.

327
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,367
Bigfoot, where are you going?

328
00:18:56,467 --> 00:19:00,300
Today's special guest Bigfoot
has declined our invitation.

329
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:02,967
Let's wrap up today's croquis session.

330
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:04,067
Jeez, it's so hot.

331
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:05,900
Let's go get a big bowl of ice cream.

332
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,000
- All right.
- Sounds good.

333
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,333
Then, Red. Can you go get some?

334
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,200
Baeblu, please go with him.

335
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,167
- Sorry?
- No way.

336
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:15,200
I'll go then.

337
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:20,300
Go with Baeblu now

338
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,467
while I'm asking nicely.

339
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:30,848
Geez.

340
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:35,872
Then I'll pay.

341
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:38,533
Pick something tasty, okay?

342
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:41,367
We'll be back soon.

343
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:42,433
I want the Skeleton Bar.

344
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,900
Hey, Khaki. Yes, that one.

345
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,600
- It's too hot.
- I cast my vote that they make up.

346
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,467
It's clearly a lovers' quarrel.

347
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:58,467
I sincerely apologize for my pathetic brother.

348
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,467
But his Harley Quinn dress-up was spot-on.

349
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:04,000
What are they doing?

350
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,200
Go on, do it.

351
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,300
Roar!

352
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,333
Khaki Dragon!

353
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,067
Roar!

354
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,867
Make it more realistic!

355
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,133
Roar!

356
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:14,867
That's enough, Seon Ho.

357
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:17,600
You can count on them to embarrass us anywhere.

358
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
Khaki Dragon, roar!

359
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,700
Oh?

360
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,500
This is terrible. Do they really not have it?

361
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,167
What are you looking for?

362
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,467
They don't have the ice cream Black mentioned.

363
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:48,700
Step aside.

364
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:02,267
[Skeleton Bar]
Found it!

365
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:03,867
Wow! Where was it?

366
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:05,467
I found the last one hiding on the bottom.

367
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:07,033
How come I couldn't find it?

368
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,800
You have to believe it's there to find it.

369
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,500
If you don't believe it's there,
you won't be able to find it.

370
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,100
But I believed it was there when I was searching.

371
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,900
No, you were distracted.

372
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,967
That's like searching
without believing it's there.

373
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:34,400
I see.

374
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:40,200
I'll go pay.

375
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Stay here.

376
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:43,867
I'll handle the payment.

377
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:07,400
That's the guy from the crosswalk, right?

378
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,433
Yes, it is.

379
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,067
He still looks gorgeous at second glance.

380
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:12,067
Check out those shoulders.

381
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,767
Was that his girlfriend then?

382
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,000
No way.

383
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,133
She was so ugly.

384
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,367
It must be his sister then.

385
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:20,867
That's even less likely.

386
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:23,300
Perhaps a stalker?

387
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,633
Hey, she's right there.

388
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,733
It's fine.

389
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,167
So what if she hears us?

390
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:32,000
Excuse me!

391
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm not a stalker, okay?

392
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,100
The real stalker is actually him over there.

393
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,667
He's been obsessing over me one-sidedly.

394
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,200
Your payment is processed.

395
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,333
We weren't talking to you.

396
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,267
- Why are you picking a fight? You don't know me.
- Stop it.

397
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:49,333
You don't know me, either.

398
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,633
So why are you judging me?

399
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:52,067
How old are you?

400
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:53,433
Hey, cut it out.

401
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:55,067
She keeps talking back to me.

402
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:56,600
What's wrong with you people?

403
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,767
How dare you touch my girl?

404
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:00,933
Hey, do you like me or not?

405
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:04,100
I like you! I totally like you so much!

406
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,533
Are you the stalker, or am I?

407
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:08,167
I'm the stalker. I'm a total stalker.

408
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,933
- Did you hear that?
- What's wrong with these lunatics?

409
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:14,267
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,400
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

411
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,933
You little punks!

412
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:18,567
'My girl?' How pathetic!

413
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:19,933
Gosh, seriously!

414
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:21,900
How dare you call us punks!

415
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,300
This is exactly why we can't be together.

416
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,933
- What?
- I didn't do anything wrong!

417
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,800
But because of you,
people call me ugly and a stalker.

418
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,533
Your existence alone makes me
feel inferior and lowers my self-esteem!

419
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:37,533
So stop liking me.

420
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:39,648
I won't like you, either.

421
00:23:39,648 --> 00:23:40,736
N-No...

422
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,700
And I'm not ugly, you fool!

423
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,533
<i>♫ I run toward you ♫</i>

424
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:01,600
<i>♫ Until I'm breathless ♫</i>

425
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,533
<i>♫ Even if I forget everything, it doesn't matter ♫</i>

426
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:05,933
She's so cool.

427
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:19,933
How about a team dinner today?

428
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:21,033
That sounds good.

429
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:24,500
Geu Rin and I have to do something today.

430
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,533
What's up with you two? A date?

431
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:27,667
No, it's a school project.

432
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:30,567
I think I should head out early today too.

433
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:33,267
Hey, but exams are over. Why?

434
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:35,467
Then let's just go home today.

435
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:37,533
Okay, see you next time then.

436
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:39,333
- I'm heading out.
- See you later.

437
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,967
- I'll go first.
- Okay, see you later.

438
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:44,000
- Have fun on your date.
- It's not a date. We're doing homework.

439
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,167
Come here. You haven't been beaten enough.

440
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,467
Why did you act like that toward U Yeon today?

441
00:24:46,467 --> 00:24:48,167
- That hurts, Green Pig!
- Hey, stop it.

442
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:49,533
You little!

443
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:52,000
- Seon Ho!
- Seon Ho.

444
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,533
Green Pig, you're in big trouble now.

445
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:57,600
Hey, you made Seon Ho's nose bleed.
You need to take care of him now.

446
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,667
Seon Ho.

447
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,700
It's okay.

448
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,700
My nose stopped bleeding.

449
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,867
I'm sorry, Seon Ho.

450
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:11,667
Just hit me instead, okay?

451
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:13,133
I said it's okay.

452
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:15,000
I'll take full responsibility, okay?

453
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,300
If your nose is broken, I'll pay for your surgery.

454
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,833
Will you really take responsibility for me?

455
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:25,067
What?

456
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,967
Then take responsibility for my grades first.

457
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:29,867
Where were we supposed to go first?

458
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:39,700
- Hey!
- It worked!

459
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,500
Did it open? Did we escape?

460
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
There's more.

461
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,700
What? We weren't done?

462
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,833
<i>♫ You're shining brightly, like a star ♫</i>

463
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,033
Hey, let's try that.

464
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:57,600
Give me some money.

465
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,667
Oh, what's happening?

466
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:04,600
<i>♫ With your own light, your own color ♫</i>

467
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,133

00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:12,833
<i>♫ You, who fill my dreams ♫</i>

469
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,267
<i>♫ I really want to reach you ♫</i>

470
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:20,333
This is the right way. Put this on the right side.

471
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:21,667
That's not how you do it!

472
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:22,800
Back off if you're just going to nag.

473
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,900
I'm telling you, that's not how you do it.

474
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,867
This is how you do it.

475
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:27,424
- You're going to regret it.
- Oh.

476
00:26:27,424 --> 00:26:28,433
Oh, right.

477
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:29,867
Let's take a proof photo.

478
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:31,567
Ready?

479
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:35,333
One, two, three.

480
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:39,700
I was actually worried.

481
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,900
That working on this project today
might make us awkward again.

482
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:47,267
I wonder what you'll write in the report.

483
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:49,933
I'm going to write honestly.
Exactly how I felt today.

484
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:51,933
'Koo Seon Ho, my date for the day,

485
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:55,933
is kind and fun to be with,
and makes people feel comfortable.

486
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:59,033
And he keeps his promises.'

487
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,367
When you said you'd go back to being
my guy friend, I didn't believe you.

488
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:04,733
I thought it'd feel awkward forever.

489
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:09,700
- Geu Rin.
- Yes?

490
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,133
What?

491
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:21,633
Why are you looking at me like that?

492
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:23,533
Are you going to say something weird again?

493
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:24,700
- Geu Rin.
- Hold on.

494
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,100
Every time you say my name like that,
I get super anxious

495
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,500
that you might blurt out something again.

496
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,600
I said, you're kind and fun to be with,
and make people feel comfortable.

497
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,833
But don't overthink it
because it's nothing special.

498
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:36,167
I know I rushed you.

499
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,967
I also know I shouldn't pressure you.

500
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:42,333
Then why did you? That was out of character.
Do you know how much I...

501
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,433
I'm enlisting.

502
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,833
What did you say?

503
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,433
I'm leaving after this semester.

504
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,867
So I felt rushed.

505
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,733
Geu Rin.

506
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,133
This place just opened recently.
I heard it's really good.

507
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:28,133
Oh, really?

508
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:29,467
What kind of food do you like?

509
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:31,300
I like everything you like.

510
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,933
Your reservation is confirmed.
Please follow the host.

511
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:36,500
Welcome. Do you have a reservation?

512
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,833
- Yes.
- Your name, please?

513
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:39,967
- Kim Na Yeong.
- Ms. Kim Na Yeong.

514
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,584
- Tae Seon, over here.
- Okay.

515
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,600
Excuse me.

516
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,033
Why are you so late?
I thought I was going to starve to death.

517
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:14,144
Mom, you like Aglio e Olio, right?

518
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:17,700
Mom, you became even prettier.

519
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,533
- Se Ra!
- Mom...

520
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,833
Oh, I know you like it.

521
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:27,167
Your favorite.

522
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,767
Yummy.

523
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,900
Ju Ni kept saying she misses you,
so I brought her along.

524
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,700
Are you happy now?

525
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,833
- Yes, Mommy.
- Yes, you are.

526
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:40,833
Isn't your sister so pretty?

527
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:42,667
Isn't she?

528
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,600
Should we order steak too?

529
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,767
Whatever you want.

530
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,633
What do you think of the ambience here?

531
00:29:58,867 --> 00:30:00,067
Seems nice.

532
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:02,667
I'm sorry, Se Ra.

533
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:06,567
She is very weak,
so her stomach gets upset very easily.

534
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:08,433
Get going now. She seems to be in pain.

535
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,400
I'm sorry, Se Ra.

536
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:13,533
I'll call you.

537
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:14,767
Let's meet up again.

538
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:16,833
We can go eat something even better. All right?

539
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:17,833
Get home safely.

540
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,400
I'm sorry.

541
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,433
Say bye.

542
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:40,033
Tae Seon.

543
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:42,367
What? Are you daydreaming again?

544
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:44,100
What's wrong with you today? This isn't very fun.

545
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,133
You're right.

546
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:50,533
This isn't fun for some reason.

547
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,100
<i>Hey, where'd you go?</i>

548
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,833
<i>If you were leaving, you should've told me.</i>

549
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:59,700
<i>Are you messing around
just because you're good-looking?</i>

550
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,600
<i>Do you think I'm a pushover
because I paid for things?</i>

551
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,733
<i>Do you think I'm your friend?</i>

552
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:05,567
Oh, I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.

553
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:06,867
<i>Hey!</i>

554
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,100
<i>What's with these awful manners?</i>

555
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,733
<i>It's over between us!</i>

556
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:13,733
I got dumped.

557
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,000
Pretending to be fine
and acting like nothing's wrong.

558
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:26,567
Keeping a poker face is easier.

559
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:34,267
But it's better not get too used to it.

560
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:39,500
You'll end up forgetting what you're truly like.

561
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,500
They were selling this over there.

562
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:45,600
I need to catch my bus on the other side.

563
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:48,467
Bye.

564
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:53,567
You'll get punished if you waste food.

565
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:54,600
So eat it.

566
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,700
Did I do the right thing?

567
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:36,000
Sorry I'm so handsome.

568
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,900
You're not ugly.

569
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:42,400
I was just saying that earlier.

570
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:45,567
You're pretty.

571
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,467
You're the prettiest in the whole world.

572
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:13,333
Green Pig is drinking alcohol under the moonlight.

573
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Something wrong?

574
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:40,567
Hey!

575
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:43,800
Darn it.

576
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,000
What's going on?

577
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:08,100
Fine. I wasn't really expecting an answer anyway.

578
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,767
But please, answer my question.

579
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:17,667
You're bothering me. Get lost.

580
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:20,767
Why was I born so unnecessarily handsome?

581
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,667
Green Pig, we came from the same womb.

582
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,933
Perhaps, we had different parents?

583
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:36,300
You.

584
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,933
What?

585
00:34:41,233 --> 00:34:42,867
How long until you enlist?

586
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:45,833
Gosh, is that your new way to curse?

587
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,533
That's creative indeed, but why would you...

588
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:52,753
Someone like you should be enlisting.

589
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:55,200
Someone like you.

590
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,033
Oh.

591
00:35:04,933 --> 00:35:07,400
Wow, Baeblu's improved so much.

592
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,167
The birth of a monster rookie.

593
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:11,467
It's not that good.

594
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:13,300
Should we take a short break then?

595
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,967
Those who haven't seen the drawings yet,
please take a look.

596
00:35:14,967 --> 00:35:16,933
Let's take a ten-minute break,
and then do a five-minute croquis session.

597
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:18,900
- Understood.
- Okay.

598
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:24,633
<i>Nam Gi Jeong's croquis book?</i>

599
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,800
<i>What? He didn't draw me at all.</i>

600
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:39,600
Hey, I saw your drawing.

601
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:45,867
- Are you crazy?
- I said I saw your drawing!

602
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:48,400
You drew Brown Finger quite well.

603
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Of course, I would.

604
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,667
But how come you didn't draw me?

605
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
Hey!

606
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,000
Answer me. Stop pretending to sleep!

607
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,400
Stop bothering me, seriously!

608
00:35:58,133 --> 00:36:00,133
I didn't want to draw you
because you're painfully ugly. So what?

609
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:07,967
Hey!

610
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,367
I'm terribly sorry for being so ugly.

611
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:17,400
What's with that absurd dream?

612
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:28,267
But it's not his fault.

613
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:30,733
If he were at fault,

614
00:36:30,733 --> 00:36:32,833
it's just that he's overly handsome.

615
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:35,367
I know that too.

616
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:50,272
But why are you hiding?

617
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:53,267
I don't know.

618
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:58,816
I feel like there's some
distance between us lately.

619
00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:01,033
What?

620
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,400
Delulu.

621
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:09,200
Delulu!

622
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,000
[I'm ugly, right? Like really ugly, right?]

623
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,333
Hey, he's trying so hard.

624
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:23,200
Your boyfriend's ready to do anything for you.

625
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,033
Hey, what boyfriend? It's not like that.

626
00:37:26,033 --> 00:37:27,933
Of course, it's not.

627
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:29,933
Wow, how could he be so handsome?

628
00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:32,167
- Is he?
- Yes, totally.

629
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,500
Even more so than Legend?

630
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,000
Hey, don't you dare compare them!

631
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,267
- But you said he's handsome.
- Gosh, Se Ra. Stop it.

632
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:38,333
There you go again.

633
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:46,467
Stop sending pictures!

634
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:47,567
Hey.

635
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:49,367
Which one of these is the ugliest?

636
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,933
What now?

637
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:54,267
This, this, and this.

638
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:55,300
Should I punch you?

639
00:37:57,967 --> 00:38:00,767
Or do you know how to make
yourself uglier? You must know.

640
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:02,967
I should just punch you. Seriously.

641
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,800
How is it that you don't know?

642
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,100
Hey, Byeon Soon, do you know?

643
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,467
Hey, don't disrespect Byeon Soon.

644
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:10,200
He's quite popular with older girls too.

645
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,433
Oh right, how did your date go
with Na Yeong yesterday?

646
00:38:12,433 --> 00:38:14,267
- It's none of your business.
- You got dumped again?

647
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,633
You don't know how to keep
your relationships last.

648
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:18,933
Guys.

649
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:21,500
Now I'm completely ignored.
She won't even look at my messages.

650
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,867
If you have something to say,
say it now. Stop interrupting.

651
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:33,000
I've got you a gift.

652
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
A gift?

653
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,233
No thanks, I don't need it.

654
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:45,533
I told my grandma it's for a friend
and she picked them out for me.

655
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:52,467
Aren't they pretty?

656
00:38:52,467 --> 00:38:53,667
- Try them on.
- No thanks.

657
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,433
Let me help you put them on.

658
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,833
I said no!

659
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,900
Make sure you wear them tomorrow, okay?

660
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,067
Gosh, I said no!

661
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:01,167
Look at them goofing off.

662
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:02,333
Bong Gu, the idiot.

663
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,267
Why does he keep being nice to him?

664
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:06,233
My mom said,

665
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:09,467
Song U Dol's mom is really awful too.

666
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:10,767
Right. I heard that too.

667
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:14,600
Oh my, U Dol's mom.

668
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,067
You have an amazing figure.

669
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:21,033
Oh, please. Everyone does nowadays.

670
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:25,400
I really hate being told that
I don't take good care of myself.

671
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,100
If I can't care for my own body,
how can I care for the kids?

672
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:32,500
- You're right.
- That's true.

673
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,133
U Dol's mom and we are fundamentally different.

674
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:38,667
You were a very famous ballerina
in your prime, right?

675
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,667
Which performances did you do?

676
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:42,267
Swan Lake? Giselle?

677
00:39:42,267 --> 00:39:43,633
I did many.

678
00:39:44,433 --> 00:39:45,900
What's the use of being successful in the past?

679
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,533
Now I'm just a housewife
with only two sons to my name.

680
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:53,667
Come on! One son goes to Seoul National University
and the other is a prodigy. Don't be modest!

681
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:57,767
I'm a housewife who doesn't even have
sons like that to show for. I feel bad.

682
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:00,767
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

683
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,067
Great! Nice!

684
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:09,633
Give it a cooler vibe. Yes, cool vibes.

685
00:40:09,633 --> 00:40:11,033
Okay, focus here.

686
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,200
Think of seagulls. Squawk, squawk!

687
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,267
Yes, hold still.

688
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,800
What's wrong with him today? Has he lost his mind?

689
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,833
So stop liking me.

690
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,433
I won't like you, either.

691
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:28,733
We're done here, right? I'm leaving.

692
00:40:28,733 --> 00:40:29,767
No, you can't.

693
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:32,867
Hey, it was going quite well.
Why are you stopping without my permission?

694
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:34,567
[Miss Piggy]
Put down your phone and go stand there!

695
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:36,467
Hey! I'm your boss.

696
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:37,700
Can't you hear me?

697
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,200
[Miss Piggy]

698
00:40:45,533 --> 00:40:46,600
What's wrong with him?

699
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:51,867
No.

700
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,667
That's not what I meant to do. No!

701
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:56,200
I didn't mean to reject the call!

702
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,567
- That lunatic.
- That lunatic.

703
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:02,067
Why is he so out of it?

704
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,267
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

705
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:13,933
I didn't mean to reject your call.

706
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:17,433
I just got nervous, I mean, startled
when the phone rang suddenly.

707
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:21,767
Anyway, why did you call?

708
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:23,867
<i>Oh, well...</i>

709
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:24,900
You know what?

710
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:28,167
I have good news.

711
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,833
I look really ugly today.

712
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:31,867
Do you want to meet up?

713
00:41:35,633 --> 00:41:36,667
U Yeon!

714
00:41:45,133 --> 00:41:47,833
<i>What? Don't come this way!</i>

715
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:52,967
Aren't I right? I look ugly, right?

716
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:53,967
What?

717
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,233
But I thought I looked ugly.

718
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:03,633
I'm sorry.

719
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,767
About what?

720
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:10,467
I took it out on you yesterday.

721
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,433
It's not even your fault, you know?

722
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,167
Don't sweat it.

723
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,933
Remember what I told you before?

724
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,136
Some days I feel worthless like a 10-won coin.

725
00:42:28,133 --> 00:42:29,933
Yesterday was one of those days.

726
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,367
It's because of my messed-up thinking,

727
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:35,500
but I took it out on you.

728
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,167
I'm sorry.

729
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:52,967
So then,

730
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,600
I can keep liking you, right?

731
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,533
- What?
- You told me to stop liking you out of anger.

732
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:02,600
Why are you talking about that again?

733
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,900
That's not what's important now.

734
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,300
It's important to me.

735
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:08,933
If I keep liking you when you don't
want me to, that'd make me a stalker.

736
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:10,600
They even came up with anti-stalking laws.

737
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:13,567
I can keep liking you then, right?

738
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:14,833
I don't know. Do whatever.

739
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,267
Stop asking things like that.

740
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:18,300
Yes!

741
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:23,867
So you'll start liking me too now?

742
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:24,867
What?

743
00:43:26,067 --> 00:43:30,533
Well, you told me not to like you
because it lowers your self-esteem.

744
00:43:30,533 --> 00:43:32,067
But you said that was wrong.

745
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,867
That means, we're back to square one.

746
00:43:34,867 --> 00:43:36,100
I can keep liking you,

747
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,200
and you can start liking me too, right?

748
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,200
<i>What's happening?</i>

749
00:43:40,933 --> 00:43:43,967
<i>Why does this strangely make sense?</i>

750
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:45,300
You still don't get it?

751
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:49,633
Then,

752
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,344
should we try kissing?

753
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:54,900
There you go again!

754
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:00,767
Hey!

755
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,800
Hey!

756
00:44:17,267 --> 00:44:18,267
Hey!

757
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,700
Hey, I fell down!

758
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,267
So... sorry.

759
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,800
You're good at playing hard to get.

760
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,667
You're such a player, aren't you?

761
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:33,633
I'll go get drinks for us.

762
00:44:34,733 --> 00:44:38,433
Hey, don't bother. I don't need it!

763
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,600
Why did I hug him from the back out of nowhere?

764
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,233
Gosh, it's so embarrassing.

765
00:45:13,067 --> 00:45:14,233
What is he doing?

766
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,567
Are you here alone?

767
00:45:21,567 --> 00:45:22,633
What?

768
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:23,767
Did you come to see flowers?

769
00:45:23,767 --> 00:45:26,633
Yes, of course. I came to see flowers.

770
00:45:26,633 --> 00:45:28,267
What about you?

771
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,467
I came with a friend to see flowers too.

772
00:45:31,467 --> 00:45:33,533
She went to get some drinks.

773
00:45:33,533 --> 00:45:36,867
My name is Gi Jeong from Class 2-3 of Chiwon High.

774
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:39,033
What? Diapers?

775
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,933
It's Gi Jeong. Gi Jeong!

776
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:47,367
Granny, this is my gift for you.

777
00:46:00,767 --> 00:46:01,833
U Yeon.

778
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:28,033
You look beautiful, Granny.

779
00:46:28,033 --> 00:46:30,367
An old lady looking beautiful?

780
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:34,933
This reminds me of my childhood.

781
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:40,100
I used to make flower crowns when I was young.

782
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:17,800
I'm done!

783
00:47:23,033 --> 00:47:24,033
Hey.

784
00:47:34,867 --> 00:47:39,000
It seemed like you were feeling nostalgic
about your youthful days. I couldn't help it.

785
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,467
I'm sorry.

786
00:47:46,467 --> 00:47:47,933
I did a terrible job, right?

787
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,700
You must've been much prettier.

788
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,900
Not at all.

789
00:47:53,233 --> 00:47:54,867
It looks just like how I used to look.

790
00:47:58,133 --> 00:48:00,367
Thank you, dear.

791
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,667
<i>The drawing I made from my imagination</i>

792
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,733
<i>took Granny down memory lane,</i>

793
00:48:11,067 --> 00:48:14,560
<i>and we listened to her stories,
as precious as treasures,</i>

794
00:48:15,633 --> 00:48:19,600
<i>for a very long time.</i>

795
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,267
Granny, watch out for cars!

796
00:48:28,967 --> 00:48:30,833
<i>Her voice</i>

797
00:48:33,033 --> 00:48:34,567
<i>is as warm as spring breeze.</i>

798
00:48:53,467 --> 00:48:56,100
Hey! It improved!

799
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,333
It improved!

800
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:00,667
Hey, yours improved too.

801
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:03,300
Hey, it's nothing compared to Song's.

802
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,667
You'll finally get your mom's permission
for the drawing club?

803
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:07,000
I'll ask today.

804
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,500
With this, I think my mom should allow it.

805
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,733
Gosh, you finally get to end
your risky double life.

806
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,267
Thank you. Thank you!

807
00:49:16,267 --> 00:49:17,267
- U!
- Mi!

808
00:49:17,267 --> 00:49:18,272
Se!

809
00:49:18,272 --> 00:49:20,167
Cross!

[Report Card]
See?

811
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,333
You can do well too, my goodness.

812
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:27,300
Would I have pushed you for nothing?

813
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:32,033
All right. Let's add
another tutoring session while at it.

814
00:49:32,767 --> 00:49:36,267
Let's see. The Sunday class...

815
00:49:37,567 --> 00:49:39,467
- Mom.
- Yes?

816
00:49:39,467 --> 00:49:41,667
Since I improved my grades, grant me one wish.

817
00:49:41,667 --> 00:49:42,800
Fine.

818
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,433
What do you want?
Shopping at the department store?

819
00:49:44,433 --> 00:49:45,467
No.

820
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:49,000
There's a club I really want to join.

821
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,367
What club?

822
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:51,967
Book club? Essay writing?

823
00:49:51,967 --> 00:49:53,000
No.

824
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,733
It's a drawing club...

825
00:49:57,633 --> 00:49:58,633
What?

826
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:00,833
What nonsense are you talking about?

827
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,633
- What club?
- What?

828
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:05,333
What do you mean, you want to draw out of nowhere?

829
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,033
Art majors are only for those who
have been training since childhood.

830
00:50:10,033 --> 00:50:11,733
No, it's not like that.

831
00:50:11,733 --> 00:50:14,033
It's a croquis club. Skill doesn't matter.

832
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:15,500
We just gather to draw
with people who enjoy art...

833
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:19,133
So why would someone
who can't draw join a drawing club?

834
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:21,500
You'll just be fooling around there!

835
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,200
What kind of pathetic club is that?

836
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,433
There's no law that says
only the skilled can join such a club.

837
00:50:25,433 --> 00:50:28,267
Of course, there is!

838
00:50:28,267 --> 00:50:29,933
That's how the world works.

839
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:32,267
Even if you stick only with what
you're good at, it's still hard to survive!

840
00:50:32,267 --> 00:50:33,300
Look at your dad.

841
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,133
He works all night
and doesn't even get to come home.

842
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:38,167
Stop spouting nonsense, U Yeon.

843
00:50:38,867 --> 00:50:40,333
While everyone else is studying hard,

844
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:43,700
will you waste your time on useless drawings?

845
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,500
Your grades aren't even that good!

846
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,333
Even if you study to death,
you'd barely be able to keep up.

847
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:51,067
How could you be saying all this nonsense?

848
00:50:52,033 --> 00:50:53,667
Stop talking nonsense and study!

849
00:50:55,967 --> 00:50:57,600
Don't call it useless!

850
00:50:58,633 --> 00:50:59,633
What?

851
00:51:00,367 --> 00:51:03,333
Don't belittle it just because you don't like it.

852
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:05,433
Who did I belittle?

853
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,367
Me.

00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:10,367
What?

855
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,640
You've been belittling me, Mom!

856
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:16,400
You look down on me and compare me
to others every single day!

857
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,667
I'm not someone you can just disrespect.

858
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:21,567
I'm not some trash can you can kick around!

859
00:51:21,567 --> 00:51:22,767
Stop disrespecting me!

'Hang up.'

883
00:52:42,933 --> 00:52:45,300

No.

I wonder if school's open yet.

898
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:33,600
But it'd be better to wait there than facing Mom.

899
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,533
Who left this blanket here?

900
00:55:57,867 --> 00:55:59,133
It moved.

901
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:11,467
I must've dozed off.

902
00:56:15,267 --> 00:56:17,000
What are you doing here?

903
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,500
Are you heading to school now?

904
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,567
But the sun isn't even up yet.

905
00:56:20,567 --> 00:56:22,033
Why on earth are you here?

906
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:23,700
What do you mean why? Seriously.

907
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,667
Why did you ghost me and make me suffer?

908
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:27,967
Why didn't you answer my calls?

909
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,024
Were you too nervous to answer...

910
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,933
What's wrong with your face? What happened?

911
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,100
Did someone hit you?

912
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,900
No one hit me. It's not like that.

913
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,933
Hey.

914
00:56:42,267 --> 00:56:43,267
Did you cry?

915
00:56:44,433 --> 00:56:45,733
I said it's not like that.

916
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:47,267
Geez!

917
00:56:47,267 --> 00:56:49,000
That punk must have some guts to make you cry.

918
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,667
Hey, who was it? Just tell me.

919
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:52,867
I'll make sure they regret making you cry.

920
00:56:57,367 --> 00:56:58,367
Why are you smiling?

921
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,800
You think I can't do it?

922
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,633
You're the only one who would
dare call my mom that.

923
00:57:05,933 --> 00:57:07,933
You're seriously the only one.

924
00:57:09,433 --> 00:57:10,467
What?

925
00:57:11,433 --> 00:57:13,120
You can't make my mom cry.

926
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,700
Do you know how tough she is?

927
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,367
How intimidating she is?

928
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,533
How ruthless...

929
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:51,133
<i>♫ I'm not sure what to say ♫</i>

930
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:53,800
<i>♫ Even when I just look at you ♫</i>

931
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,433
<i>♫ Even if our fingertips just touch ♫</i>

932
00:57:57,433 --> 00:58:01,567
<i>♫ What if you hear my pounding heart ♫</i>

933
00:58:01,567 --> 00:58:04,300
<i>♫ I'm holding it tight with my hands ♫</i>

934
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:10,967
<i>♫ I've kept it safe right here ♫</i>

935
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:16,667
<i>♫ Right here ♫</i>

936
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:22,367
<i>♫ You've waited so long, I'm late, I'm sorry ♫</i>

937
00:58:22,367 --> 00:58:24,320
Since Miss Piggy and I did that...

938
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,376
Is this it? Does it look right?

939
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:26,400
Don't come within 100 meters of me.

940
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,967
No matter what you say, I'll take responsibility.

941
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,600
Don't ever miss me.

942
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,267
Don't ever think about how charming I am.

943
00:58:31,267 --> 00:58:32,867
Don't ever think of me in a new light.

944
00:58:32,867 --> 00:58:34,967
Wait, have his eyelashes
always been this beautiful?

945
00:58:34,967 --> 00:58:36,433
Has his nose always been this prominent?

946
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:37,633
His lips...

947
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,700
You're too young to have money.

948
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,733
I have money.

949
00:58:40,733 --> 00:58:42,033
He doesn't even consider you a friend.

950
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:43,167
He probably threw away the socks you gave him.

951
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:44,800
Why are you acting out of character?

952
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,133
I am Baeblu Finger!

953
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:47,967
A guy like you has never had a girlfriend?

954
00:58:47,967 --> 00:58:49,133
Gosh, never!

955
00:58:49,133 --> 00:58:51,700
Gi Jeong is my ex-boyfriend.

956
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,733
What?

957
00:58:56,867 --> 00:59:00,467
You should've seen Poo-Gi Larva, you know?

958
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,900
Here. Look at this.

959
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,500
Whenever he does that, it drives me nuts.

960
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,200
This larva cover was
his middle school entrance gift from my dad.

961
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,133
Why did my dad get a pink one for a boy?

962
00:59:11,133 --> 00:59:13,933
But he treats it like a security blanket.

963
00:59:13,933 --> 00:59:14,933
Hey.

964
00:59:14,933 --> 00:59:17,500
Do you think he'd kill me
if I burned it behind his back?
