Yezi, your father is calling you.

Did you make a mistake

43
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,850
with the beef noodle order?

44
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:10,489
I was thinking of preparing food

45
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,129
for the animals in the rescue shelter.

46
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,849
I may have messed it up.

That's not it.

Okay, father.

59

I'm on it.

60
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:38,450
Let me do it.

61
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,250
New order?

62
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,090
Yezi asked me to make
a large portion of fried noodles

63
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,970
to take away later.

64
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:53,929
Put more beef for her.

00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:54,769
Okay.

66
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,330
Why don't you eat first?

67
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:05,450
No, thanks.

68

I'm not hungry.

69
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:08,769
By the way, did you put eggs?

70
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,530
Yes.

71
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:10,769
I put two eggs

72
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,090
and extra beef.

73
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:12,970
Thanks, father.

74

different cat food?

Most of these cats

101

were abandoned.

102
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,130
They were also abandoned by the city.

103
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:59,489
There are many more

in case they would say
I was a fake persona.

127
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,730
Now,

128
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:25,090
I can come out in the open.

00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:01,970
Have a seat.

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,690
Mr. Han.

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,410
Take a look.

146
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:13,850
This is the situation
at the shelter now.

147
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:16,889
The number of people
who donate is decreasing.

148
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,010
The shelter was doing better

149
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,769
when you were popular.

150
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,929
The adopters even

151
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,850
have returned their pets.

152
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,449
They should be responsible,

153
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,049
how could they return the pets?

154
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,130
Returning the animals is better

155
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:35,970
than to leave them on the street.

156
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,530
It's just that there are
more and more stray cats.

157
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:41,250
Plus the previous ones,

158
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,169
we can't take care of all of them.

159
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:45,570
I started this shelter

160
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,209
after I retired.

161
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,889
Now, as I get older,

162
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,489
my strength is limited.

00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,410
Don't say that. It's not your fault.

00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,169
You're doing a good thing,

167

setting an example for your fans.

168
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,449
It's a very meaningful thing.

169
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,730
She's right. It's not your fault.

170
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:09,489
I'm old.

171
00:08:09,609 --> 00:08:10,609
I don't follow celebrities.

172
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,090
I don't understand anything

173
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,850
about the so-called character setting.

174
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,889
I only know you are a nice person.

175
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:21,810
Other celebrities come here

176
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,090
for show,

177
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,329
but you are the only one who is serious

178
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,730
about helping this animal shelter.

179
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,489
Sir.

180
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,129
How long do you estimate

181
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,090
the shelter will last?

182
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,090
It might last a year.

183
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:42,490
If that's the case, I won't be worried.

184
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,530
I estimate

185
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,090
at most a half month and ten days.

186
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:49,329
By then,

187
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:51,170
if no one comes to adopt them,

188
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,009
they will remain on the streets.

189
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,009
Some may also be disposed of.

190
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,610
- What? Disposed?
- Yes.

191
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,290
Don't we have any other way?

192
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,290
In the next couple of days,

193
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,850
we're going to an animal shelter
in a neighbouring city

194
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,090
to see if they can help us

195
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:10,129
take in some of the animals.

196
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,569
However, they're having
difficulties as well.

197
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:16,090
So I don't expect much.

198
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,569
It's all right. Don't worry.

199
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,170
We can do something about it.

200
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:31,889
We won't

201
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,449
let the stray animals

202
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:35,689
lose their homes.

203
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,850
Yes, don't worry.

204
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:41,410
We'll help.

205
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:42,490
Okay.

206
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:43,649
Good.

207
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:47,850
Students,

208
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,329
please close the windows,

209
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,050
doors and electricity before leaving.

210
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:53,170
Also,

211
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,329
during the holidays,

212
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,730
please actively participate in
community support activities

213
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,170
and social practice activities.

214
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,090
Okay. Wish you all have a nice holiday.

215
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:10,410
Are you sure about the fundraising?

216
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:19,889
I thought you were
at least a millionaire,

217
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,090
but you're as poor as we are.

218
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:25,490
Yes.

219
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:27,610
Since I stopped performing,

220
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,889
I've been so poor.

221
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,370
That's tragic.

222
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:34,050
Of course.

223
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:37,009
I might even have to beg
for money on the street.

224
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:39,410
I suggest

225
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:41,249
we just sell

226
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,569
everything we have

227
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:44,730
to help the animal shelter.

228
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:47,850
Idiot. There must be a way.

229
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,129
No need to sell everything.

230
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,329
Besides, I'm here.

231
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,649
You can have faith in me.

232
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,689
I can't do that.

233
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,370
Looks like I have to work hard

234
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,050
to win my master's approval.

235
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:02,610
Go for it.

236
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:09,090
Ziwen.

237
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:10,930
Stop following me.

238
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,850
Ziwen.

239
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,129
I'm not following you.

240
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:16,209
Ruofei called me.

241
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:18,129
I don't understand why he called you.

242
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:20,290
Because I have a lot of ideas.

243
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,209
My foot!

244
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:23,170
Girls should not be so rude.

245
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,769
Besides, I finished the barbecue

246
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,129
at your behest.

247
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:27,249
Aren't you on a diet?

248
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,649
Why do you blame me?

249
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,809
I did ask you to eat,

250
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,689
but I didn't ask you to finish it all.

251
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,850
You didn't even leave me a bite.

252
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,730
Okay.

253
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,290
I'll feed you next time.

254
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,410
I won't eat a single bite, okay?

255
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,129
Okay?

256
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:40,730
Don't cry.

257
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:42,050
That won't do.

258
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,129
I want to lose weight,

259
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,449
yet you always want to sabotage me.

260
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:49,809
Okay, I'm sorry.

261
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:50,769
My queen.

262
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:52,290
Wait for me, my queen.

263
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,809
Wait for me!

264
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,009
Ruofei, I'm here.

265
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,889
Where have you been?

266
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:02,850
You kept us waiting.

267
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,449
Hello.

268
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,889
Ziwen, where's Yuling?

269
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,809
She studies in the dormitory.

270
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,610
So she didn't come with us.

271
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,769
But she texted that
she would be here soon.

272
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,530
I see.

273
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:15,930
It's not what you think.

274
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,930
I just met him by chance.

275
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,170
By chance?

276
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:22,490
I didn't say anything.

277
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,730
Yezi is bullying your fans.

278
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,569
Do something.

279
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,689
I can't do anything about her.

280
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:28,090
She usually controls me.

281
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:30,290
We're here!

282
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,050
Cutie, I miss you.

283
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:40,009
Mengmeng, you guys are too cheesy.

284
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,569
You kiss me in front of Jiang Yanjun.

285
00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:45,490
Aren't you afraid he'll be jealous?

286
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,689
Too bad, it's a one-sided love.

287
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:53,329
But he will be mine sooner or later.

288
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:55,850
Yanjun.

289
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,410
Yanjun, look here.

290
00:12:58,249 --> 00:12:59,290
Are you blushing?

291
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:01,009
Guys, listen up.

292
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,090
I have an announcement.

293
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:04,889
In fact, I feel bad for

294
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,850
inviting you all here today

295
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,249
because the animal shelter

296
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,209
is supposed to be
my responsibility alone.

297
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,370
No.

298
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:14,050
It should be both our responsibility.

299
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,090
This is my idea after all.

300
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,970
Many hands make light work.

301
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:22,050
So please help us.

302
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:22,490
Please.

303
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,129
Don't worry.

304
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:24,930
Your business is my business.

305
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,009
Just tell me.

306
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:28,850
I am at your service
anytime and anywhere.

307
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,889
Me, too.

308
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,610
I can hand out leaflets

309
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,649
with this idiot.

310
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:33,809
Idiot?

311
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:35,329
Then Yanjun and I

312
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,009
can find people

313
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:40,129
to adopt those pets.

314
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:42,410
Yanjun, what do you think?

315
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,329
Can you?

316
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:43,689
Okay?

317
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:44,410
Yanjun.

318
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:45,889
Yanjun?

319
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:46,850
As usual,

320
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:48,730
I'll take charge.

321
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:50,410
Okay.

322
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,290
Since everyone is so enthusiastic,

323
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,290
let's split up

324
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:55,290
and get moving.

325
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:56,490

- Sir.

343
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:12,970
Sr.

344
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:19,530
Hello, take this.

345
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,410
This is for you.

346
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:30,050
Don't be silly.

347
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,569
They are scammers.

348
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,129
No, we're not!

349
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,649
Forget it.

350
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:36,490
- Let's go.
- No.

351
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,610
I don't want to leave.

352
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:38,930
I want to stay.

353
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:39,769
Let's go and buy toys.

354
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:40,769
- Come on.
- No.

355
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:44,209
Why does everyone

356
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:45,249
think so badly of others?

357
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,329
Forget it.

358
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:47,930
There are indeed a lot
of scammers nowadays.

359
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,410
People are warier.

360
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,649
Never mind.

361
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,769
There are still a lot of
caring people out there.

362
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:55,889
I'm still so upset.

363
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,370
Me, too.

364
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:04,209
Don't get discouraged.

365
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:05,930
There must be someone
who will believe us.

366
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,930
But there isn't any now.

367
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:23,490
Hello, is Mr. Wang here?

368
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:28,689
Hello, is Mr. Wang here?

369
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,649
Did you make an appointment?

370
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:33,209
No.

371
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:34,329
Then can I make an appointment now?

372
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,249
My surname is Han.

373
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:37,930
Mr. Wang is not back yet.

374
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,050
Come again next time.

375
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:43,769
He's not here. What now?

376
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:46,410
Let's wait.

377
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,530
I'll see how long he can keep hiding.

378
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:49,850
Let's go.

379
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,010
Do you think

380
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:07,809
he will show up?

381
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:09,689
I've looked into it.

382
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,090
He'll return to his office

383
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:12,409
every day at this time.

384
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,850
He hasn't

385
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,850
paid my endorsement fee yet.

386
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,770
Endorsement.

387
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,130
Do you mean

388
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:27,890
the endorsement of the swim trunks?

389
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:38,850
I won't laugh at you.

390
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,890
Don't you?

391
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:42,890
I can see through your expression.

392
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:46,370
Okay, I'll stop.

393
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:49,010
By the way, we should get

394
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,049
a lot of money for
the endorsement, right?

395
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,010
Well, it's worth...

396
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,090
Two million?

397
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,010
Two thousand.

398
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,180
(Charity fundraising)

399
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:16,730
Are you hot?

400
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:19,049
Very hot.

401
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,329
I'm so thirsty.
Buy me a bottle of water,

402
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,370
a cup of milk tea

403
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:25,770
and some fried chickens.

404
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,090
I want to eat the family bucket.

405
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,010
In your dreams.

406
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:29,569
I already have it ready.

407
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,329
Ziwen, don't forget.

408
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:32,850
You are on a diet.

409
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:37,409
Losing weight is truly challenging.

410
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:39,169
I just don't get it.

411
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:41,770
How can a cutie like me have fat?

412
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,010
Maybe only fat people

413
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:45,650
are called cute.

414
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,809
You mean I'm not cute when I'm skinny?

415
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:50,850
No.

416
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,809
You're cute in any way.

417
00:18:57,689 --> 00:18:59,329
Ziwen? What a coincidence.

418
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,929
Long time no see.

419
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:02,289
You've changed a lot.

420
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,169
I almost didn't recognise you.

421
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,329
Yes, it's me.

422
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,689
Are you surprised?

423
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:15,049
After leaving the useless guy,

424
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:17,010
I become so much prettier.

425
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,490
Unlike you,

426
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,130
you're still as ugly as ever.

427
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,209
You haven't changed a bit.

428
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:28,250
I didn't expect you to be
so miserable now.

429
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,689
After breaking up with me,

430
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,850
you're now handing out
leaflets on the street.

431
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,490
Baby, I bought milk tea.

432
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,730
This is my girlfriend.

433
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,970
Is she your ex-girlfriend?

434
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,409
She's kind of ugly.

435
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:40,970
Your taste was so bad.

436
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:43,730
You are interrupting my work.

437
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,890
Please leave.

438
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:46,449
Don't get in my way.

439
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,610
Are you doing street performances?

440
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,049
Why don't we donate her some money?

441
00:19:51,209 --> 00:19:53,130
She needs money to eat at least.

442
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,370
Baby, you are too kind.

443
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,689
Where did these two wild dogs come from?

444
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:00,689
Who are you?

445
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,689
Stay out of it.

446
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:02,569
What?

447
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:03,850
Do you want to fight?

448
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,329
Are you sure?

449
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:08,010
We're civilised people,

450
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:09,970
unlike you, big bully.

451
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,370
What are you good at besides fighting?

452
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:12,049
Exactly!

453
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:14,010
You guys are incompetent.

454
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:15,569
Don't underestimate us.

455
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,209
Not only are we good with our fists,

456
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:18,809
we can also talk sense.

457
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:21,529
After all, we're not like some people

458
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,929
who just spout rubbish.

459
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:26,569
What? Do you envy our fists?

460
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:28,809
This is what we get from training

461
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:29,850
day and night.

462
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,970
What do you two idiots know?

463
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:33,049
Also,

464
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:35,409
don't make my girlfriend angry again.

465
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:38,209
After all, I am
a very protective person.

466
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,169
He's right.

467
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,610
My boyfriend is a hundred times
better than you.

468
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,289
No, ten thousand times.

469
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,490
I advise you to leave

470
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,770
before I...

471
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:52,049
Baby, leave this to me.

472
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,689
In my spare time,

473
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,090
I like to do boxing.

474
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:57,409
Scram!

475
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:58,890
I've got things to do. I'll be off.

476
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,329
Hey, wait for me!

477
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:02,970
How is it?

478
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,770
Did I do well?

479
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:05,809
Thank you.

480
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:08,529
Why don't you repay the favour?

481
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,689
I'll think about it.

482
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,650
Ziwen.

483
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,650
Here.

484
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:20,770
What took you so long?

485
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:21,929
I'm starving.

486
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,409
Sorry, we went the wrong way.

487
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:24,689
So it took a while.

488
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:34,569
Are you the one who adopted the dog?

489
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,289
Yes, is there anyone else around?

490
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,370
It's fine.

491
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,209
Sir, this dog is claustrophobic.

492
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:44,569
Please try not to

493
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,169
put it in a confined space.

494
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,090
Also,

495
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,929
we'll make a return visit
after one month.

496
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:51,370
It's just a dog. What's all the fuss?

497
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:52,130
Hey!

498
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:52,929
Mengmeng.

499
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:55,209
Don't worry.

500
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:58,490
Sir, this puppy

501
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,809
is a precious creature.

502
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:02,010
And it's cute.

503
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,370
Enough.

504
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:04,490
I have signed all the formalities.

505
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,289
Give me the dog.

506
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,130
Sir, please show some respect.

507
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:10,090
Why? Do I need to salute you?

508
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,370
Please be nice to it.

509
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,409
Guys, I got the dog.

510
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:31,329
This one is too small.

511
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:32,610
It was quite big in the photos.

512
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,090
- This is disappointing.
- Yanjun.

513
00:22:34,552 --> 00:22:36,513
Something doesn't seem
right about this guy.

514
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,010
I agree.

515
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:40,209
Call the other guys.

516
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,169
We'll have a drink tonight.

517
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,289
Yanjun!

518
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:47,770
Wait!

519
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,329
What?

520
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:53,010
Sir.

521
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:54,090
I forgot to tell you.

522
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:55,449
This dog has just recovered
from a disease.

523
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:56,650
Please watch its diet.

524
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,809
What?

525
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,130
It had a disease?

526
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:01,929
Yes.

527
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,049
Please take extra care.

528
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:08,169
Take it back.

529
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:10,970
Young man.

530
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:12,970
Can you get me another one?

531
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:15,010
No way. You won't get any.

532
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,010
Seriously?

533
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,850
It's fine. Cheer up.

534
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:29,929
It can find a good family.

535
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:39,610
Hop on.

536
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:48,890
Ready?

537
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:50,970
Let's go.

538
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,370
Here we go.

539
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,370
Hello, Mr. Wang.

540
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,490
Hello, Mr. Wang.

541
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,010
Yezi, wait for me here.

542
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:14,890
I'll be back in a while.

543
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,209
Okay. Fighting!

544
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:17,409
Fighting!

545
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,409
Mr. Wang.

546
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:23,049
A minute, please.

547
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,329
Who are you?

548
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,850
I am Han Jiangshuo.

549
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,250
Han Jiangshuo? Who's that?

550
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:31,569
No idea.

551
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,890
They say they don't know.

552
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:35,929
Mr. Wang, you are really forgetful.

553
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,169
Here's the thing.

554
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:38,850
Not long ago,

555
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,329
I endorsed one of
your branded products.

556
00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:48,650
I remember.

557
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,730
That seems to be the case.

558
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,289
Mr. Wang.

559
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,490
You haven't paid me the endorsement fee.

560
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,650
How dare you come and ask me for money?

561
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,529
You've made such a big mess.

562
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,250
Do you have no idea?

563
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:04,049
Mr. Wang.

564
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:07,130
I have fulfilled all
the obligations in the contract.

565
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:08,289
Listen.

566
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:10,250
I'm doing you a favour

567
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:11,850
by not suing you for

568
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,490
bringing our brand into disrepute.

569
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:14,929
Mr. Wang.

570
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,569
I won't leave until

571
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,049
I get my money today.

572
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:21,689
You can wait.

573
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:25,010
Mr. Wang.

574
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:26,610
Scram!

575
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,010
You want to fight, is that it?

576
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:44,010
Bring it on!

577
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,130
Han Ruofei, don't move.

578
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,850
Han Ruofei, don't just stand there.

579
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:10,929
Let's go.

580
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:13,529
After him!

581
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:14,809
- Quick.
- Come on.

582
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:16,169
Hey!

583
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:17,890
Stop right there!

584
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:20,010
Please come again.

585
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:21,650
Please come again.

586
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:23,529
Please come again.

587
00:26:23,689 --> 00:26:25,730
Please come again.

588
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,850
Why?

589
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,970
This is all we got.

590
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,209
I'm too embarrassed to face them.

591
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,770
Me, too.

592
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,970
Why are there so few
caring people nowadays?

593
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:56,610
The world is so cruel.

594
00:26:58,209 --> 00:27:01,049
Do we really have to go back?

595
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,529
We can't avoid it.

596
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,449
What are you doing?

597
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,770
What is that?

598
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,529
Here's our chance to make a fortune!

(Dream Animal Shelter)

600
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:40,730
That's all?

601
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,650
We contributed our money as well.

602
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:50,850
What about you two?

603
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,929
We failed

604
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:55,329
to find the adopters.

605
00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:56,770
We even rescued a few more.

606
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,929
What about you two?

607
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,409
I...

608
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,209
Han Ruofei and I also failed.

609
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,090
Then do we

610
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:20,329
have any other way?

611
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:26,370
Cheer up, guys.

612
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:28,490
I've figured out a good
way to make money.

613
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,890
Are you curious?

614
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:36,209
Come on.

615
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:39,650
I gave you a chance.

616
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:42,169

(Recruiting actor and actress)

622
00:28:58,689 --> 00:28:59,689
What?

623
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:01,180
(Master, please bless us)
(Recruiting actor and actress)

624
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:03,449
Let me see.

625
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:08,970
This poster is too cliched.

626
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:11,730
Yezi, why do you bother?

627
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:13,809
The point is high-paying.

628
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,130
If we can get this money,

629
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:16,929
there's hope for the animal shelter!

630
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:21,289
But we don't know how to act.

631
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,890
She's right.

632
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,770
No need to worry.

633
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:28,130
We have an idol!

634
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:29,809
Han Ruofei, what do you think?

635
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:32,449
Yes, we have Ruofei.

636
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,010
Well,

637
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:40,770
I've been acting in
big international films.

638
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,890
So I'm a bit of an actor.

639
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:44,890
Besides, my fans love

640
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:45,890
my acting.

641
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,730
Perfect.

642
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:51,850
Still,

643
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,890
I can't act.

644
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:00,010
Ruofei, don't you know?

645
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:01,569
It's all about the looks, okay?

646
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,650
Good acting

647
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:03,569
is pointless.

648
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,529
Don't you agree?

649
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:06,890
You are handsome.

650
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,569
You don't need acting skills.

651
00:30:11,449 --> 00:30:14,809
But without the agency's help,

652
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:17,650
I'm afraid I won't
even pass the audition.

653
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:25,730
You've undergone systematic training.

654
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:27,370
So why not

655
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:29,250
give it a try?

656
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:43,929
How about this?

657
00:30:44,449 --> 00:30:45,850
Since no one can act,

658
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:47,650
why don't we just play ourselves?

659
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,049
The more realistic, the better.

660
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,529
One of us might have passed.

661
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:54,809
Yanjun is right.

662
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:56,569
Let's all get ready.

663
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,850
I've already contacted
the actor's assistant director.

664
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:00,650
Let's do our best tomorrow!

665
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:02,809
Mengmeng.

666
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,529
Are we going to debut?

667
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,770
So that means

668
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,490
I get to work with
the cute and sweet actor,

669
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,730
Lu Yu!

670
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,490
I'll give in,

671
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:15,090
but Ke Bolun is mine.

672
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:17,010
Okay, no problem.

673
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:20,049
This is great!

674
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,449
Hooray!

675
00:31:21,449 --> 00:31:23,289
We can walk the red carpet together!

676
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,890
There they go again.

677
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,970
We can walk the red carpet!

678
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:28,449
Let's go.

679
00:31:30,409 --> 00:31:31,770
Red carpet!

680
