Perhaps he did.

That's not good.

00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:12,019
Not bad, you guys!

34
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,980
You're getting better it seems.

One minute and 37 seconds.

You're embarrassing the school!

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,099
How can you join the competition?

38
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:28,500
Stop dreaming,

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,260
especially you guys.

You can't even keep up with the girls.

Is everyone here?

42

Who didn't turn up?

00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:45,179
Where is Han Ruofei?

44
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,420
I'm not too sure.

45
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,860
You're not sure?

46
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:54,739
I'll need to punish him.

47
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,379
Hello, guys!

48
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,700
I'm here, fellow classmates.

49
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:03,980
So you're here.

50
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,260
So you're looking pretty cool, right?

51
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:08,099
I guess so.

52
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,340
What is this nonsense?

53
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,780
Look at the dark circles
under your eyes!

54
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:15,420
Where did you go last night?

55
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,379
Coach!

56
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,620
Have you seen the ring road
at 4 a.m. in the morning?

57
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,700
What are you talking about?

58
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,539
A ring road? 4 a.m?

59
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:27,420
What are you up to?

60
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,939
Are you running a stall?

61
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,780
Coach.

62
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:34,140
I was practicing
long-distance running last night.

63
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:35,700
The whole night?

64
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,099
Do you like running that much?

65
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,739
You can join the athletics team then.

66
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:41,019
No, coach.

67
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,579
I love archery.

68
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,060
Archery is what makes me happy.

69
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,340
Even if the athletics team
tried to recruit me,

70
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:47,700
I wouldn't join them either.

71
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,420
Stop this nonsense right now.

72
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,860
Hit the fifth circle

73
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:55,459
with the 36-pound arrows.

74
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,379
If you can do that, I'll let it slide.

75
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:58,459
If you miss it,

76
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,060
don't even think about eating.

77
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,179
Keep training!

78
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,700
Train until you hit the bullseye!

79
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:06,099
Coach, why are you making
things difficult for me?

80
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,379
Aren't you just sending me to my death?

81
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,980
I'll add on five pounds if
you don't stop complaining.

82
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,500
This hurts to watch.

83
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:51,780
This isn't working.

84
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,139
Why don't you use a lighter one?

85
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:57,459
Are you joking?

86
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,848
Look at how relaxed I am.

87
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:00,560
Do I look like I need a lighter one?

88
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,540
Why wouldn't this bow work?

89
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,500
Is it spoilt?

90
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,620
Is there something wrong
with the bow sight?

91
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,220
(What a fool.)

92
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,220
(I'll help you out this time.)

93
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,459
Han Ruofei.

94
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:28,739
You're not too shabby, it seems.

95
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,660
You hit the seventh ring!

96
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,620
Now you know

97
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:43,739
what natural talent looks like.

98
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,579
The coach only asked for the fifth ring
but I gave him the seventh ring.

99
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:49,419
Congratulations!

100
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,780
You completed the mission today.

101
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:54,299
You can go back and rest now.

102
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,299
No.

103
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,579
I must hit the tenth ring today

104
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,979
so that the coach can see it.

105
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,500
Yezi! Come here!

106
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,859
The Yanjun is back!

107
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,380
The Yanjun!

108
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,220
The Yanjun?

109
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,500
Who's that?

110
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,259
Yanjun, have a seat.

111
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:22,660
Yanjun.

112
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,139
How was your international competition?

113
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,380
I was training. So I couldn't
catch the live broadcast.

114
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:29,620
What a pity.

115
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,540
Why don't you guess the result?

116
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,940
I'll give you a prize if
you guess it correctly.

117
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,500
We don't have to guess.

118
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:37,859
You'd definitely get the first place.

119
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,019
Of course I know he'd get first place.

120
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,259
I'm just a little disappointed

121
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,780
not being able to watch him live.

122
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,299
The competition went quite well.

123
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,060
We broke the youth team's record.

124
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:53,299
The competition went so well.
We broke the youth team's record.

125
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:54,940
What...

126
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:57,019
Han Ruofei, do you have anything to say?

127
00:06:57,299 --> 00:06:58,820
Why are you being so sarcastic?

128
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,380
What do you mean?

129
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,179
I'm good at impersonation.

130
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,380
That's true.

131
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,979
Ruofei is the best when
it comes to performing.

132
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,179
How did you manage to turn
that into a compliment?

133
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:10,620
You're so exaggerating.

134
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,179
Who is he?

135
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,900
This is our newest team member.

136
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,019
Han Ruofei.

137
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,660
Han Ruofei.

138
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,259
Listen carefully.

139
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,220
This is

140
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,340
our swim team's golden boy.

141
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,699
Jiang Yanjun.

142
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,540
Nice to meet you.

143
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,620
What are you doing?

144
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:36,820
Don't you have manners?

145
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,500
Just ignore him, Yanjun.

146
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:42,380
It's all right, Yezi.

147
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,340
Oh, yes.

148
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,660
I got something for you
from my trip overseas.

149
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,380
What is it?

150
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:54,340
I met your idol

151
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,259
and got this for you
when I took part in the competition.

152
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:58,220
There's his autograph on it, too.

153
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,500
You're amazing, Yanjun!

154
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,220
I'm a little jealous.

155
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,540
I know. Me too.

156
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,100
I wish I had a childhood friend, too.

157
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,220
It's just a small gift.

158
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,220
Don't touch it! You might dirty it!

159
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:31,459
It's just an arrow.

160
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,660
Was that really necessary?

161
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,499
I could even buy a lot of arrows.

162
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:36,379
How is that the same?

163
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,259
This is a gift from Yanjun.

164
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,619
What's the difference
between an arrow from him

165
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,780
and the ones we use for training?

166
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:49,459
With this arrow autographed by my idol,

167
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:51,300
I'll definitely be able
to hit the bullseye.

168
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,139
Thank you so much, Yanjun.

169
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,059
No problem.

170
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,900
It's just a small gift.

171
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,100
Take a look, guys!

172
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:03,699
Isn't this arrow the same

173
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:05,780
as the ones we use for training?

174
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,980
There's no difference!

175
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,300
Han Ruofei!

176
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,540
What are you doing?

177
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,499
Han Ruofei, are you crazy?

178
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,819
Do you know you could've injured
someone just now?

179
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:33,379
Yezi, don't be mad.

180
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,139
Han Ruofei didn't do it on purpose.

181
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,139
No excuse.

182
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,459
The bow and arrow must never
be directed to a person.

183
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,220
That's the first rule in archery.

184
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:43,259
Han Ruofei!

185
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,180
What are you doing?

186
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,740
Someone said you were pointing
the bow and arrow at people?

187
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,740
Cai Jinye! Didn't you tell him?

188
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:49,860
You don't have to explain!

189
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:52,259
He's been here for so long

190
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,420
but he doesn't even know
the basic rules of the archery.

191
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,459
What have you been
teaching him, Cai Jinye?

192
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:00,619
Coach Wang.

193
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,420
I don't think he did it on purpose.

194
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,819
None of us is injured.

195
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,860
Jiang, don't make excuses for him.

196
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,139
I must deal with this strictly.

197
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:12,220
You guys went too far!

198
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:19,619
Jiang, come over here.

199
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,939
Jiang.

200
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,660
On the way here,

201
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:29,540
I bumped into your swimming coach.

202
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:31,059
Have you not reported to him yet?

203
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,100
Oh yes, I should report now.

204
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,540
Coach, calm down.

205
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,259
I apologise for my outburst.

206
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:39,699
It's all right.

207
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,420
I didn't teach my student well.

208
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,300
Coach Wang, it was just an accident.

209
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,499
It's just a small misunderstanding.

210
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:47,499
That's right.

211
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:49,019
Just an accident.

212
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,019
Jiang.

213
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,499
Look.

214
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:57,540
The college sports day is
just around the corner.

215
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,780
They've been training for so long.

216
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,420
It's hard work indeed.

217
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,379
If there's

218
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:05,180
any accident at this moment,

219
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:06,579
it would mean trouble for everyone.

220
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,139
That's true.

221
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:08,499
About that situation just now,

222
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,900
could you just

223
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:10,540
keep it

224
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,900
a secret?

225
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,019
Of course, coach.

226
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,100
I understand.

227
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,900
All right.

228
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,019
I'll go off then.

229
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,740
Okay, take care.

230
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,300
Okay.

231
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:22,699
Yezi, bye!

232
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:27,579
Han Ruofei, you're late for classes.

233
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:28,939
You're lazy at training.

234
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,780
You created this mess.

235
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,019
I need to study your problem.

236
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:41,499
Cai Jinye.

237
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:56,499
I'm sorry

238
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:58,139
for what I did just now.

239
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,100
Have a look at this.

240
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,459
Is this all right?

241
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:20,100
Hold on, I need to make a call.

242
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:21,100
Sure.

243
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:22,980
Come and take a look.

244
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:23,740
Okay.

245
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,819
What's going on?

246
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,699
Are you having fun, Han Ruofei?

247
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:37,819
Don't you know

248
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
how much trouble you've caused?

249
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,740
Your coach just called me.

250
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:42,900
No.

251
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:43,660
No.

252
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,939
I don't want any excuses.

253
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,780
In short,

254
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:46,900
you should know

255
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:47,939
what should you do.

256
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,579
Look for your coach to resolve it,

257
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:50,459
understand?

258
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,059
Miss Qiu, is that really necessary?

259
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,180
You think it's unnecessary?

260
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,619
Excuse me.

261
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:57,699
Your coach is considering

262
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,340
expelling you from the team.

263
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:00,660
Han Ruofei.

264
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,619
You're making me mad.

265
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,980
Is it that serious, Miss Qiu?

266
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:06,139
Han Ruofei, this is my
last warning for you.

267
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,780
If this goes on,

268
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,300
terminate your contract
with the company.

269
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,139
Miss Qiu? Hello?

Brother.

282
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:51,100
How come you're here?

283
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:52,699
Look.

284
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,619
Yanjun gave me these swim trunks.

285
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:55,459
It looks good, right?

286
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:57,259
Why don't you try?

287
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:58,660
What are you doing?

288
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:00,819
Just have a try, you'll look good!

289
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,699
Get lost. Try it yourself.

290
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:10,019
Brother.

291
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:12,259
Why do you look a little upset?

292
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,379
It's nothing.

293
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:17,579
You look rather happy.

294
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:20,619
Why are you so happy all the time?

295
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,459
Yanjun won the first place
at an international tournament.

296
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,660
He's taking us for a campfire
picnic this weekend.

297
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,019
You call everyone "brother".

298
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,860
How many brothers do you have?

299
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:33,259
Brother.

300
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:34,780
I promise.

301
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:36,340
You're my only brother.

302
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,340
Did you just say

303
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,579
there's a campfire picnic this weekend?

304
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,939
Listen.

305
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:50,819
Oh, that's for me, Yezi
and the rest of them.

306
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:52,300
You're not included.

307
00:14:56,819 --> 00:14:57,939
I'm not free anyway.

308
00:14:58,619 --> 00:14:59,139
Oh, yes.

309
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,819
Is that guy

310
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,059
very close to Cai Jinye?

311
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:05,139
Yes.

312
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:07,139
I heard they grew up together.

313
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,340
Brother, are you okay?

314
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,900
They grew up together?

315
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:24,340
No wonder they're so annoying.

316
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,860
Brother, it seems that

317
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,420
you don't like him.

318
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:31,180
He just rubs me the wrong way.

319
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:33,139
He's too nice.

320
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,540
Out of ten nice guys, nine of them
usually turn out to be bad guys.

321
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:38,340
He's really quite decent though.

322
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,900
Brother.

323
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:45,459
Is something bothering you?

324
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:51,579
I need your help.

325
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:52,819
Just say it.

326
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,100
If I can help you,

327
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,900
even if it means climbing mountains
and going through fire,

328
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,300
I'll do it.

329
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,939
Don't worry, it's not that bad.

330
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:01,660
Do you know the archery team's coach?

331
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,180
Archery team's coach?

332
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:06,579
No, I don't.

333
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,540
What about him?

334
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,939
I made him angry during training today.

335
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:14,420
I need to figure out how
to get on his good side.

336
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,819
Get on his good side?

337
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:17,379
Don't worry, brother.

338
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,420
You need to leave this
to someone like me

339
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,100
to come up with a brilliant plan.

340
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,000
(To professor of Jianghang University of Sports.
A skill can help one for life.)

341
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,340
Han.

342
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,300
This tea

343
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,740
is honestly not great,

344
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,459
but it's still much better

345
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:52,459
than your archery skill.

346
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:53,699
You're right, coach.

347
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:54,860
I know what I did wrong.

348
00:16:56,619 --> 00:16:57,939
You do?

349
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,499
Next time, you don't need to

350
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,980
bring me tea.

351
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:04,099
As long as you stay out of trouble,

352
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:07,060
I'll be happy.

353
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,499
It's all right, coach.

354
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,780
Don't be polite to me.

355
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,780
This tea is from my friend.

356
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,219
It invigorates the body
and helps one to sleep.

357
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,739
It's really good stuff.

358
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:17,900
There's ginger, goji, almond...

359
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,859
What did you say was inside?

360
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,420
Ginger, goji, almond.

361
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:27,180
Almond?

362
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,460
Oh no.

363
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,460
What's happening? Coach!

364
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:39,420
Are you asleep?

365
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:42,180
I told you the tea

366
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,820
was good for sleep.

367
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:46,820
Coach.

368
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,540
Coach, you have a class now.

369
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,499
Why don't you continue
sleeping at night?

370
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,420
Coach.

371
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:56,499
Coach!

372
00:17:59,379 --> 00:17:59,820
Hey!

373
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,780
Help! The coach needs help!

374
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,200
(Shizu Supermarket)

375
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:11,339
(Shizu Supermarket)
Sure.

376
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,379
(Shizu Supermarket)
Of course it can be done.

377
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:13,940
(Shizu Supermarket)
Don't you trust me?

378
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:17,660
Tonight you and your idol
will have a meal together.

379
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,820
(Shizu Supermarket)
For real!

380
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,099
(Shizu Supermarket)
For real, I promise.

381
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,580
Make sure it's organised well.

382
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:24,900
If anything goes wrong,

383
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:26,139
I'll make you pay.

384
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:26,940
Of course.

385
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,460
Okay.

386
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,499
Of course it'll work.

387
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,859
Definitely.

388
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:37,420
Brother, come on.

389
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,219
Have a seat.

390
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,259
Sit down.

391
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:41,460
Brother, I have something to tell you.

392
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,940
I tried to generate publicity for you

393
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:45,180
by organising a fan feedback campaign

394
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,940
on social media for you.

395
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:47,979
There was a lucky draw, too.

396
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:50,099
Whoever wins the lucky draw
will get a free meal.

397
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,019
Then,

398
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:52,859
I did something

399
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:54,339
and let insiders win the draw.

400
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,099
Firstly, we'll get our desired outcome.

401
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:56,700
Secondly,

402
00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:59,660
we can protect your privacy as well.

403
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,180
Isn't it brilliant?

404
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:03,660
You can praise me, brother.

405
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:05,099
Come on, praise me!

406
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:06,339
Praise me!

407
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,259
Praise me now!

408
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,859
Praise you?

409
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:09,499
That's right.

410
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,259
Here, take this!

411
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,940
Brother, why are you hitting me?

412
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:19,660
The coach ended up in the hospital
because of your tea.

413
00:19:20,979 --> 00:19:22,900
Hospital? No way.

414
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:24,660
There's nothing wrong with my tea.

415
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:26,379
Nothing wrong?

416
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,940
It's almond!

417
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:30,660
The coach is allergic to almond.

418
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,660
I had hopes,

419
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:38,219
but it's all gone now.

420
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,019
What do I do?

421
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,859
Brother, I have an idea.

422
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:51,900
You still have ideas?

423
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:52,940
Yes.

424
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:54,060
Cai Jinye!

425
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,139
The coach's favourite team
member is Cai Jinye.

426
00:19:57,499 --> 00:19:59,619
If we can get her to plead for you,

427
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,540
then we'll solve the problem.

428
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,259
Cai Jinye?

429
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:06,139
Are you sure about this?

430
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,540
This time, for sure.

431
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,580
Well, I guess I'll have to

432
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,940
attend your gathering as well now.

433
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,979
You don't have to, brother.

434
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:17,619
I can talk to Yezi for you.

435
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:19,580
You still need to have a meal
with your fans.

436
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:20,540
I'm not going for that!

437
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:22,420
I never agreed to this.

438
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,099
Solve it on your own.

439
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:23,940
Brother!

440
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,060
Brother!

441
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,460
If Ziwen knows he's not coming,

442
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:34,060
she'll bury me alive.

443
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:52,219
Yezi.

444
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:54,300
You've got a whole new outfit!

445
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,660
What do you think? Does it look nice?

446
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:05,300
It does look nice.

447
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:07,460
Why don't you try a skirt?

448
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,940
I don't have any skirt in my wardrobe.

449
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:17,060
Oh yes.

450
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,259
What about Ziwen?

451
00:21:18,979 --> 00:21:20,900
She says she's not joining tonight.

452
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:23,259
She's not?

453
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,499
What is she up to?

454
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,339
She has a date.

455
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:28,379
I'm not sure with who, but

456
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,180
whoever that can make Ziwen

457
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:32,739
dress up and put makeup
on for an entire hour.

458
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,619
I admire her so much.

459
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:39,379
So it's just the both of us today?

460
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,060
That's right.

461
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:42,219
We already agreed with the Yanjun.

462
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,339
We'll leave once you're ready.

463
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,460
Okay.

464
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:56,420
All right, it's done.

465
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,060
It's lit up now.

466
00:21:58,099 --> 00:21:59,580
We're just waiting for Jiahao.

467
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,820
He might've been delayed.

468
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:05,379
Let's wait for a while.

469
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,339
I can't wait much longer.

470
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,099
If he doesn't come soon,
I'll die of hunger.

471
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:11,660
All the food is with him.

472
00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:19,739
To go or not to go?

473
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:22,499
If I go,

474
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,859
she'll eat me alive.

475
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,580
Hello.

476
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,820
Hello, Jia Hao.

477
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,979
When are you coming?

478
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:39,339
Everyone is waiting for you.

479
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:42,259
Yanjun.

480
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:44,660
I have something urgent to do tonight.

481
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,060
I've gotten someone

482
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:48,300
to bring the food over.

483
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,700
Oh, I see.

484
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:51,619
All right, don't worry about it.

485
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,619
Settle your things.

486
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,940
We can meet another day.

487
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,820
I may not be able to.

488
00:22:58,099 --> 00:22:59,499
Did anything happen to you?

489
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:01,339
I'm fine, Yanjun.

490
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,139
Oh yes.

491
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,499
I have a bunch of snacks there, too.

492
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,300
If I don't make it back,

493
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,180
please enjoy it for me.

494
00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:12,099
What's going on with you?

495
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:13,580
I'm fine, seriously.

496
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:15,379
Goodbye.

497
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:45,859
Han Ruofei?

498
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:51,499
Well,

499
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,499
why are you dressed like that?

500
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,180
I couldn't recognise you.

501
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,700
You don't want anyone to recognise you.

502
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,139
I understand.

503
00:24:20,219 --> 00:24:21,339
Good evening, everyone.

504
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,900
Why are you here?

505
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,580
Jiahao had something urgent to do.

506
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,619
I'm helping him to
bring some stuff over.

507
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:28,460
You can put the food here

508
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:29,300
and be on your way.

509
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,060
Since you're already here,
why don't you join us?

510
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,540
Of course I'd love to join you!

511
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,580
Why else would I be here?

512
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,139
To work for you?

513
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,859
Are you okay?

514
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,940
Are you having a flu?

515
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:46,540
There's a flu going around lately.

516
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,180
Do you want me to bring
you to the hospital?

517
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:52,219
(Is she that caring to him?)

518
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,499
Is your training very exhausting?

519
00:24:57,859 --> 00:24:59,900
You must take good care of your body.

520
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:02,460
(Something is not right.)

521
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:04,700
(I need to make excuses to leave.)

522
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:08,700
Little Master.

523
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:11,379
Are you surprised to see me?

524
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:14,300
Don't call me that.

525
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,940
It's gross.

526
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,139
Let's begin now then.

527
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,460
Sure.

528
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,300
Little Master.

529
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:28,339
As the saying goes,

530
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,780
the beauty of a gift lies
in its meaning.

531
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:33,420
I brought all these for you.

532
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:35,540
Shouldn't you be grateful?

533
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,219
Here.

534
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,420
Pour a drink for me.

535
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,859
Is there anything nice?

536
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:50,580
Let's see.

537
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:53,739
Han Ruofei.

538
00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:55,420
Han Ruofei!

539
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,339
Are you listening to me?

540
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,219
To be honest,

541
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:06,940
I didn't become a fan of yours

542
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,900
after your debut.

543
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:11,820
Even when you were a trainee,

544
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:13,300
I already noticed you.

545
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,499
Do you remember the gifts you received

546
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,739
before you debuted?

547
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:22,540
Don't you remember?

548
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:24,979
That shouldn't be.

549
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,619
You posted about it on Weibo, right?

550
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,300
We still haven't eaten anything yet.

551
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:35,619
What would you like to eat, my idol?

552
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
It's on me today.

553
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,379
Here, Master, try this.

554
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:50,019
It's freshly grilled by me.

555
00:26:50,219 --> 00:26:50,940
Enjoy it while it's hot.

556
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:54,780
Yanjun.

557
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,859
Don't just grill it all night.
You should eat as well.

558
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:57,700
Here, this is yours.

559
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,219
Thank you.

560
00:26:58,379 --> 00:26:59,060
Thank you, Yezi.

561
00:26:59,259 --> 00:26:59,859
Yuling, have some, too.

562
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,499
Thank you.

563
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:05,060
It's delicious!

564
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,060
Master.

565
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:26,780
The one I just grilled

566
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:28,979
is exceptionally flavorful.

567
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,739
No, don't eat it!

568
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,339
What's wrong, Yezi?

569
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:45,219
Are you okay, Yezi?

570
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:46,060
What's wrong?

571
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,540
It's so spicy, I'm choking.

572
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,379
Get some water.

573
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:50,339
What's going on?

574
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:51,739
Here, have some water, Yezi.

575
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:56,499
Drink more.

576
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:04,060
Han Ruofei, did you do that on purpose?

577
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:05,460
You did that to me on purpose!

578
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:07,019
Of course I wouldn't! I...

579
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,099
Of course you did!

580
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:09,979
No, I didn't!

581
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:10,979
I didn't do it intentionally!

582
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:11,940
Stop right there!

583
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,580
I...

584
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,219
Han Ruofei!

585
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:14,180
Listen to me, please.

586
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:17,499
Please enjoy your meal.

587
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:23,060
Han Ruofei.

588
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,900
Most customers have already left.

589
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:29,099
You can take your mask off now.

590
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:42,540
This voice is...

591
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:45,540
I knew it.

592
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:47,739
Surprise!

593
00:28:48,379 --> 00:28:50,139
Li Jiahao.

594
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,339
How dare you trick me!

595
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,339
I skipped the picnic with Yezi

596
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,060
for a meal with you?

597
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,900
No.

598
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,099
Don't cry.

599
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,859
I didn't go there either.

600
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,420
Ziwen, don't cry.

601
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,460
Listen to my explanation.

602
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:08,499
Something went wrong.

603
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,820
Let me compensate you.

604
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,339
How are you going to do that?

605
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:20,099
You broke a girl's innocent heart.

606
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:23,900
You're not all that innocent
and fragile anyway.

607
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,540
Li Jiahao, you're dead meat.

608
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:33,099
Ziwen.

609
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,979
Ziwen, listen to me.

610
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,060
Ziwen!

611
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,940
Here, have more.

612
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:49,859
Here, Yezi.

613
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:50,780
Thank you, Yanjun.

614
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,780
No problem.

615
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,859
It's delicious.

616
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,940
Master, try this grilled chicken wing.

617
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,300
Here, try this.

618
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,540
Thank you, Yanjun.

619
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:05,259
It's a huge piece of chicken.

620
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,420
It smells so good!

621
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:17,660
Here, Master, let me fill your drink.

622
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,940
Yezi, have more orange juice.

623
00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:19,859
Don't drink too much alcohol.

624
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,060
Thank you, Yanjun.

625
00:30:34,979 --> 00:30:35,739
Are there mosquitoes?

626
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,099
Yezi, I have...

627
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:38,460
Luckily, I brought some
mosquito patches today

628
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,099
or we'll all get bitten.

629
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:40,700
Here.

630
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,900
Yuling, you're thoughtful.

631
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,780
What are you doing?

632
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:54,660
Yezi.

633
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,460
Don't move, all right?

634
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,460
There's something down here.

635
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,180
What is it?

636
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:00,379
There's a snake.

637
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,259
It hurts!!

638
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:06,460
Han Ruofei!

639
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,259
Are you okay, Han Ruofei?

640
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:07,859
Han Ruofei!

641
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,940
Oh no, please wake up!

642
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,700
Are you all right?

643
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,099
I'm fine, Master.

644
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,339
It's just a small wound.

645
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:20,219
As long as you're happy, I'm good.

646
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,780
Just enjoy your food and drinks.

647
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,300
You don't have to care about me.

648
00:31:26,139 --> 00:31:27,300
Han Ruofei!

649
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:28,420
Han Ruofei!

650
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,660
Han Ruofei!

651
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,619
Wake up, please!

652
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,499
It's all right, Yezi.
The snake isn't venomous.

653
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,180
It's not venomous?

654
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:38,219
Why am I in pain?

655
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:39,940
Idiot.

656
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,499
Of course a bite hurts.

657
00:31:42,219 --> 00:31:44,219
Han Ruofei, let me
take you to a hospital.

658
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,300
No, I...

659
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,580
I want Cai Jinye to go with me.

660
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,499
Yezi, go with him then.

661
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,739
Fine.

662
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,660
Let's go.

663
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,540
Well then, it was a nice picnic, guys.

664
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,540
I'll go then.

665
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:06,700
Continue eating and drinking.

666
00:32:06,979 --> 00:32:07,580
Don't mind me.

667
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,820
Yezi, wait for me!

668
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,739
Why don't we go to the hospital?

669
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:20,739
There's no need for that.

670
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,099
Thanks for your concern.

671
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,619
This cream should work just fine.

672
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,820
It's just a minor wound.

673
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:26,580
Since you got this cream,

674
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,619
it'll definitely be effective.

675
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,060
Since you're afraid of pain,

676
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:32,940
why did you try to catch the snake?

677
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,700
Compared to being expelled,
this pain is nothing.

678
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,259
If Miss Qiu finds out about this,

679
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,660
she'll definitely kill me.

680
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,379
Expelled?

681
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,180
What did you do this time?

682
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,379
It's a long story.

683
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:48,099
Master.

684
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:51,940
Since I saved you just now,

685
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,300
can you return the favour?

686
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,540
Why don't you

687
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,979
plead with the coach for me?

688
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:02,859
Plead with him for you?

689
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,940
So you only helped me just now

690
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:09,300
because you needed my help?

691
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:10,420
Of course!

692
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,979
I helped you

693
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,259
so that you'd help me in return.

694
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,460
It's a sign of our bond.

695
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,499
It's only been a few days.

696
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,700
We're not that close.

697
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,219
Master.

698
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,660
Are you really heartless?

699
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:28,900
Why don't you find a less
heartless master then?

700
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:33,339
Why are you angry again?

701
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,979
What's the situation?

702
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,480
♪Know everything
about me. Never retreat♪

703
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,320
♪Place it tightly on my shoulders♪

704
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,640
♪The waving cloak♪

705
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,259
Brother, are you in trouble, too?

706
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,859
You're such a troublemaker.

707
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:07,580
Life is so hard.

708
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,460
Brother.

709
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:12,059
What happened to your hand?

710
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,299
Don't talk about it.

711
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,779
Cai Jinye wouldn't help me.

712
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,339
I should just pack up and leave.

713
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,460
Brother, no!

714
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,500
Jiahao.

715
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,020
Our brotherhood

716
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:26,819
ends here.

717
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:28,779
Brother, no.

718
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,700
What am I going to do without you?

719
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,660
Who's going to eat with me?

720
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,779
Brother.

721
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:36,980
Brother.

722
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,220
Jiahao.

723
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:41,059
When I'm gone,

724
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,220
take care of yourself.

725
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:46,940
Brother, I have another idea.

726
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,460
If I believe you one more time,

727
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,859
I am a fool.

728
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:01,619
Are you sure this will work?

729
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:04,779
The College and University Sports Day
is coming up.

730
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:07,700
The host is our school,
Jianghang Sports Academy.

731
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,579
Before every tournament,

732
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:12,420
there will be closed training.

733
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:14,220
And?

734
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,460
Here's the important part.

735
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:19,099
Closed training,

736
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:21,579
in other words, means

737
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:23,619
the competition will be gruelling.

738
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:26,379
It'll be tough to even have
a decent meal or a drink.

739
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,059
During this time,

740
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,020
if you offer anything heartwarming

741
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,139
to Cai Jinye,

742
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:34,779
you can solve your problem.

743
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:37,980
I'm just afraid that

744
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,579
she'll think I have
an ulterior motive again.

745
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,740
No, we'll do more than that.

746
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,539
She might think so if you send
her things once or twice.

747
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,139
If you keep doing it,

748
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:49,260
she'll think that you
truly care for her.

749
00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:51,180
Why do I have a feeling

750
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,379
that this won't work?

751
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,579
Brother.

752
00:35:56,819 --> 00:35:59,379
What's the most important
thing between two people?

753
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:01,260
It's trust.

754
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,220
If you can't even trust me,

755
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,020
then I'm better off dead.

756
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,779
Go ahead and jump then.

757
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:08,859
I'm not stopping you.

758
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:14,740
Jump then!

759
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,980
Are you really not stopping me?

760
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:20,260
Fine.

761
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,379
Brother.

762
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:25,139
Men are indeed more
heartless than women.

763
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:26,460
You're heartless!

764
00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:29,900
Am I heartless?

765
00:36:30,779 --> 00:36:32,900
The heartless one is Cai Jinye.

766
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,819
I'm not like that.

767
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:38,700
I'll trust you one last time.

768
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,099
That's more like it.

769
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:42,099
You're making a wise choice, brother.

770
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,900
I don't know if it's wise

771
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,539
but we've got to try.

772
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:48,579
Cheers!
