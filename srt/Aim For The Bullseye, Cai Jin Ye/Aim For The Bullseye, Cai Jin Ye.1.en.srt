Han Jiangshuo will come today, right?

171
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:57,860
As a temporary lifeguard,

172
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,860
can you let me take a photo with him?

173
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,819
Han Jiangshuo is my idol, too.

174
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:04,340
I won't simply let in

175
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:05,939
an outsider.

176
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,139
If there's a scandal,

177
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,019
the swimming center will...

178
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,379
Don't you think so?

179
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,780
I'm not an outsider.

180
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,220
You should know how I feel.

181
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:20,459
As a longtime fan,

182
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,660
when I see my idol,

183
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,860
I'll feel my beating heart...

184
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:24,660
Listen.

185
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,180
Tu-tum.

186
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,180
Tu-tum.

187
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,939
Stop.

188
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,499
I think you'll have a sudden death
if you go on like this.

189
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:32,499
I have to go.

190
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,900
It's fine if I can't get a photo.

191
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,980
Can I at least have an autograph?

192
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:44,100
I'm afraid it won't be easy

193
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,579
with your current attitude.

194
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,579
I apologise.

195
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,900
We'll get along from now on.

196
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:57,860
An autograph is possible.

197
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,459
However...

198
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:02,220
However?

199
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:04,660
I'm in a bad mood.

200
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,379
I'll buy you a meal.

201
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,420
Crayfish.

202
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,619
Nice try.

203
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,059
Forget it then.

204
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,059
Fine!

205
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,499
Fine.

206
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,259
It's a deal.

207
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,619
You have my word.

208
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,300
Bye.

209
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,340
She's certainly from the archery team.

210
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,139
Her grip...

211
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:34,340
Awesome.

212
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,379
What?

213
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:00,579
What?

214
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:03,220
My goodness!
What's happened to your shirt?

215
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,980
Did you fight someone on the way?

216
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:07,619
I was chased by a crazy dog.

217
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:08,980
Listen, Han Jiangshuo.

218
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:09,939
It's very expensive.

219
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,019
I'll include it in the bill. You...

220
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:12,579
You need to pay for it.

221
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:14,860
Gosh! You're a problem for me.

222
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,459
I know, Miss Qiu.

223
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:17,740
Stop nagging.

224
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,540
Excuse me.

225
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,379
How dare you talk back to me.

226
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,540
Okay.

227
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:24,459
Let's talk about this.

228
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:26,579
How many times have you been in trouble?

229
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,540
Han Jiangshuo.

230
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,220
You're named as "Shuo".

231
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,540
You know, "Shuo"?
[*Shuo: means sparkling in Chinese]

232
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,660
I hope for you to become
popular one day.

233
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,579
Look at what's happening.

234
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,619
Forget about popularity.

235
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,059
You should at least make me happy.

236
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,300
Understand?

237
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:46,939
Okay, well,

238
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,660
it is truly not my year.

239
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,139
I run into a mess like you.

240
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,980
With the salary of a manager,

241
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:56,019
I even have to babysit you.

242
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,939
You didn't hire an assistant
when I told you so.

243
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,819
I don't know what you're thinking.

244
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,379
Miss Qiu.

245
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:03,619
I even accepted a 2,000-yuan job.

246
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:05,819
Do you think I can afford an assistant?

247
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:07,780
Okay, fine.

248
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,059
Let's familiarise yourself
with the venue.

249
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,220
I'll repeat it to you.

250
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,259
This is your one and only chance.

251
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,780
Seize it, okay?

252
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,700
I don't expect them to
get a has-been instead.

253
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:30,420
It's really disappointing.

254
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,540
Han Jiangshuo?

255
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,060
I woke up so early in weekend.

256
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,099
Who would want to see him?

257
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,739
I've wasted money on the props.

258
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,820
Forget it. Let's go back.

259
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:42,060
Han Jiangshuo?

260
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,499
Stop.

261
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,099
There's a weekend event here.
You can't enter.

262
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,859
I want to go to the archery center.

263
00:17:55,979 --> 00:17:57,379
I have a training today.

264
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:58,300
There's an event at the swimming center.

265
00:17:58,379 --> 00:17:59,219
For safety reasons,

266
00:17:59,499 --> 00:18:01,739
all connected venues
have been closed temporarily.

267
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,580
I really have a training.

268
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,139
Can you let me in?

269
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,499
No. Go back.

270
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:12,859
This is my student card.

271
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:13,739
It doesn't work.

272
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:14,660
Go back.

273
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,499
It'll be serious if anything goes wrong.

274
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:22,820
Go back.

275
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,580
Girl, go back.

276
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,660
Stop standing here.

277
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:55,420
Why are you here?

278
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,700
Are you familiar with the venue?

279
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,660
Listen.

280
00:18:57,859 --> 00:18:59,060
When the journalists come,

281
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,580
you must act like you're very familiar

282
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,700
with every corner,

283
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,619
understand?

284
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,339
Miss Qiu, I've never heard

285
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,780
of this brand.

286
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,460
You haven't heard of many brands.

287
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:11,259
Wait.

288
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,019
You aren't popular anymore.

289
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:14,940
You should be thankful
for getting a job.

290
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:16,460
Stop being picky.

291
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,460
Listen.

292
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,139
This endorsement
is very important to the company.

293
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,219
As you know,

294
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,379
if you don't promote it good enough,

295
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,700
you will be on your own.

296
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:41,780
Is that all?

297
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,499
Why? Is there a problem?

298
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:46,420
Miss Qiu.

299
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,180
I used to attend international events.

300
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,700
You prepare this for me?

301
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,060
I think it's good enough.

302
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,379
Good enough?

303
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:56,060
This is absolutely not.

304
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:58,660
Yellow and green.

305
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:01,139
Am I going to perform square dance
on the stage?

306
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,339
Anyone with aesthetic sense

307
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,420
knows it can't be paired like this.

308
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:06,979
Miss Qiu.

309
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,339
I've lost my popularity,

310
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,580
but I can't give up on myself.

311
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,379
Come on.

312
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,979
You haven't had any endorsement
for half a year.

313
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:17,660
You know how realistic the industry is.

314
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,219
No exposure, no traffic.

315
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:21,580
No traffic, no value.

316
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,219
Without value, you can...

317
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:24,979
Fine, Miss Qiu.

318
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,099
I'm fine with the attire.

319
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,019
Look at the colours.

320
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:33,420
Bold and flashy.

321
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:35,940
I can tell that the designer
has a unique personality.

322
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:39,060
It can be deemed a work of art.

323
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:41,099
I like it.

324
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,900
This is more like it.

325
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:44,619
As you know,

326
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,700
the company won't waste its effort.

327
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,420
You should know that.

328
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:52,420
I know.

329
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:56,060
Be good.

330
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:57,339
At this moment,

331
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,379
you should accept more of
this kind of endorsements.

332
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:01,379
Build an image of a cool guy.

333
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:03,139
When the journalists come,

334
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:03,739
remember

335
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:06,019
to show off your body.

336
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,019
It'll be better if you can swim.

337
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,420
Miss Qiu, you know that

338
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,820
I don't know how to swim.

339
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:14,940
Yes.

340
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,820
You haven't accepted
any jobs for half a year.

341
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,339
I forgot about that.

342
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,700
Yes. You don't know this and that,

343
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,019
yet you want to become popular again.

344
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,859
Miss Qiu, I...

345
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,139
All right. Stop talking.

346
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,339
Just remember this.

347
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,379
The endorsement

348
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:30,460
is very important to the company.

349
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,820
You mustn't ruin it.

350
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:37,580
Also, show off your perfect body,

351
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,540
understand?

352
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:39,700
I have to go.

353
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,700
Bye.

354
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:06,139
Miss Qiu, the size is incorrect.

355
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:25,060
Coach.

356
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,660
Coach.

357
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,339
How do you warm up?

358
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,420
When you do a lunge,

359
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,460
stretch further out.

360
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:36,300
You slack when you train.
I have no choice but to scold you.

361
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,660
What are you doing?

362
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,739
I've told you countless times.

363
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,099
Don't place the bow on the floor.

364
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:01,460
Are you deaf?

365
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:02,700
Got it, coach.

366
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,060
You don't listen at all.

367
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,060
Good.

368
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,060
Stretch your back.

369
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,499
Make it horizontal.

370
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,460
Very well.

371
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,379
Straighten your arm.

372
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,099
Where is Cai Jinye?

373
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:43,739
Come on!

374
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,700
Where is Cai Jinye?

375
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,700
Coach.

376
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:54,300
Yezi has stomach pain.

377
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,580
I suppose she is still in the washroom.

378
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:00,979
I see.

379
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:02,780
Carry on.

380
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,780
I have a big secret to share with you.

381
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,580
Let's talk later.

382
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:16,339
I want to focus and train well.

383
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:19,900
I can't wait.

384
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,420
Do you know Han Jiangshuo?

385
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,139
Han Jiangshuo.

386
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:24,700
He has come to our university.

387
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,979
Han Jiangshuo.

388
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:28,219
Who is he to you?

389
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,859
He's very popular on Weibo last year.

390
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,660
The one I talked about
every day to you and Yezi.

391
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:35,859
It's him.

392
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:37,780
I don't know.

393
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:40,379
You're too much.

394
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,499
How can you not know my idol?

395
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,859
No way. I need to talk about him.

396
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:45,859
I don't want to listen.

397
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,660
I don't want to listen.

398
00:24:49,219 --> 00:24:51,300
Yuling. Yuling.

399
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:53,940
You don't love me anymore.

400
00:24:58,099 --> 00:24:59,019
I loved you before this.

401
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:01,859
I did. Go back to training.

402
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:28,099
Why is it so frightening?

403
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:34,540
(Cai Jinye, you can do it.)

What are you doing?

408
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,060
I'll just take a glance!

409
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,540
Take her away.

410
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
My idol, Han Jiangshuo, is inside!

411
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,979
- Let me go!
- Come on.

-Let me in.
-Take her away.

413

Let me in! Just a glance will do!

414

Go away!

Let me go!

Go.

Let go! Let me go!

419
00:25:58,979 --> 00:25:59,940
Let me go!

420
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,219
Just wait and see!

421
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,739
Han Jiangshuo, I must see you.

422
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,139
Watch closely.

423

(Nadee Sports works with
Han Jiangshuo for an endorsement.)

Yes.

426
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,019
Mr. Wang?

427

Let's start.

428
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,259
Let's invite

429
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:59,660
our mysterious spokesperson.

430
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,499
He is the famous idol, Han Jiangshuo.

431
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:05,379
Dear fans,

432

Welcome.

What do you think, Mr. Wang?

436

Does he impress you?

437
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,859
Let's look at the product sales
when it's over.

438
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,619
You have nothing to worry about.

439
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,739
He has strong marketing skills.

440
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,019
Every product that he promotes

441
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:42,339
becomes popular.

I don't care as long as I've
received the detergent.

Hurry and think of an idea.

All right. This is a surprise session

specially added for today's event.

I've come to the wrong place.

stunning swimming pose.

So it's a performance.

485
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,300
He works so hard.

486
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,300
This is a session

487
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,540
when Mr. Han demonstrates

488
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,379
dynamic breath holding.

489
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,019
How can we not to be touched

490
00:31:17,139 --> 00:31:18,619
by such a dedicated actor?

491
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,619
Am I right?

492
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,180
Right.

493

He is drowning, apparently.

498
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:47,660
My idol, I'm coming to save you.

499
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:51,780
He is drowning.

500
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:05,460
He doesn't know how to swim actually.

501
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:06,499
He is drowning.

502
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,820
Take it easy.

503
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:13,739
Jiangshuo is playing a joke.

504
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,180
It's clearly an accident.

505
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:16,339
It's so dangerous.

506
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:17,859
No. No. No.

507
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:18,900
Don't make up stories.

508
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,739
We did it on purpose.

509
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:21,900
Yes, we did it on purpose.

510
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:23,580
Didn't Han Jiangshuo claim
to be an all-round sportsman?

511
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:24,780
We have a headline here.

512
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,339
Let's take photos.

513
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,420
My idol, please be safe.

514
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:33,420
Don't go.

515
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:34,460
Don't go.

516
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,780
How should we put this?

517
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,219
An accident for endorsement
of our product.

518
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,780
I'll ask for a compensation if it causes

519
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,259
a negative impact on the brand.

520
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:44,219
Mr. Wang.

521
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,460
Could I explain to you later?

522
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:46,540
You want to explain it?

523
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:48,300
Explain to my lawyer later.

524
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:48,979
Mr. Wang!

525
00:32:58,339 --> 00:32:58,820
My idol.

526
00:32:59,139 --> 00:32:59,780
My idol.

527
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,780
Han Jiangshuo!

528
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,060
Are you okay?

529
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,379
Han Jiangshuo is there.

530
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,780
Let's go there and see.

531
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:12,739
My idol.

532
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,420
I'm sorry.

533
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:26,259
That's great.

534
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,739
You've finally regained consciousness.

535
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:29,859
Am I alive?

536
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:30,940
You were almost dead,

537
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:32,660
but I saved you.

538
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,940
I would rather die.

539
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:43,259
Come on. Go.

540
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:45,259
(Infirmary)
Hurry to the changing room.

541
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,180
I'll cover for you.

542
00:33:46,219 --> 00:33:46,780
Thank you, buddy.

543
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,820
Hurry. Go.

544
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:50,259
There's no way out.

545
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,700
Just come to me!

546
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,300
(Compose the song of life.
Showcase the spirit of archery.)

547
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,739
You shouldn't have said
she went to the washroom.

548
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:04,660
I didn't know

549
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,379
she'd be this late.

550
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:10,020
Has Cai Jinye

551
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,619
fallen into the toilet bowl?

552
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:15,500
Why don't you go to save her?

553
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,099
Aren't you good friends?

554
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,660
Coach.

555
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,339
Girls normally take a long time

556
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,139
in a washroom.

557
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:24,139
Yes.

558
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:47,020
I'll give you ten seconds.

559
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,859
If she has yet to show up,

560
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,660
join her in the toilet bowl,

561
00:34:50,819 --> 00:34:51,460
okay?

562
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,779
Coach.

563
00:34:53,779 --> 00:34:54,460
Ten.

564
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:56,220
- Ten seconds are too short.
- Nine.

565
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,379
- Give us a little bit more time.
- Eight.

566
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:57,940
Seven.

567
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,579
Coach.

568
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,020
- Please.
- Six.

569
00:35:00,379 --> 00:35:01,539
- What should we do?
- Five.

570
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,819
Four, three.

571
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:06,940
Two, one.

572
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:15,539
You've climbed out

573
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:17,660
of the toilet bowl, right?

574
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,460
I'm sorry, coach.

575
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:22,539
I'm late

576
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,539
because there's a small accident.

577
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:27,940
I promise I won't be late next time.

578
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:30,059
You may punish me, coach.

579
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:34,099
Go. Be more self-conscious.

580
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:35,819
Train for another three hours.

581
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:37,420
You mustn't stop.

582
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:41,180
Got it, coach.

583
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:43,900
Don't think it's over.

584
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:48,619
Take a ten-minute break.

585
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,859
Thank you, coach.

586
00:35:54,579 --> 00:35:55,740
Be safe, coach.

587
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:56,940
See you, coach.

588
00:36:01,379 --> 00:36:02,460
Where did you go?

589
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,900
Why did you take so long?

590
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:06,539
It's really strange.

591
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,619
There's an event at
the swimming center downstairs.

592
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:10,059
All entrances have been sealed.

593
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:12,980
Did you enter the swimming center?

594
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,260
I passed through the air duct.

595
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,460
Did you know Han Jiangshuo was there?

596
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:24,460
I was rushing. So I didn't notice.

597
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:27,339
No way.

598
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,059
I need to verify it.

599
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:29,980
Who is it?

600
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:31,379
My idol.

601
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,859
Forget it. You won't
know even if I tell you.

602
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,819
I have to go.

603
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,740
Why is she in such a hurry?

604
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,460
It's only because

605
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,339
she's obsessed with that idol.

606
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:46,339
I really don't understand her.

607
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:47,740
Anyway,

608
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,660
I'm quite jealous of her sometimes.

609
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,900
She has so many favourite things
to do apart from archery.

610
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:56,260
I'm only jealous of you.

611
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,539
You're focused.

612
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,339
You just want to get it done.

613
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:02,740
All right. Go to rest.

614
00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:03,619
I'll go to practise.

615
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,500
Go for it.

616
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,260
Bye.

617
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,379
Bye.

618
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,579
Mr. Han, open the door!

619
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:17,260
Mr. Han, open the door!

620
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,900
Can we interview you?

621
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,059
Did you almost drown, Mr. Han?

622
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,339
Do you not know how to swim?

623
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:26,180
Go away!

624
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,460
Han Jiangshuo isn't inside!

625
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,539
He ran in just now.

626
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:30,379
Stop taking photos!

627
00:37:30,379 --> 00:37:31,180
Open the door, Mr. Han!

628
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,180
Open the door!

629
00:37:33,379 --> 00:37:35,020
He isn't inside. You saw it wrongly.

630
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,260
He isn't inside!

631
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:38,900
He isn't inside!

632
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:42,900
Stop taking photos!

633
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,660
Go back and stop taking photos!

634
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:51,180
He seems to be fleeing
through the air duct.

635
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,460
Hurry and stop him at the exit.

636
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:53,299
Don't let him get away.

637
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:55,460
Let's stop him.

638
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:42,980
