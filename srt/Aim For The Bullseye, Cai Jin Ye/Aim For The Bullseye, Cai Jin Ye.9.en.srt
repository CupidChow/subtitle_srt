Here's what happened on that day.

I can't go on. I'm so thirsty.

Wait.

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,750
Why didn't you ask me?

59
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,160
I'm not buying anything for you.

60

Why would I ask you?

61

Can't you walk?

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,280
Why don't you buy it yourself?

63

Whatever.

64
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,510
I'm not thirsty anyway.

Wait, Ruofei.

Why do I have a feeling
that you're disappointed?

Do you want to gossip about me, too?

74

No, Ruofei.

75

I'll pour a glass of water for you.

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,510
Lin Ziwen, open the door!

170
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,550
What's the matter, Mengmeng?

171
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Lin Ziwen, you'd better explain to me

172
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,430
what's going on!

173
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,800
No. It's...

174
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,920
I won't listen to you!

175
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,920
I won't listen to your explanation. No.

176
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,430
It's not...

177
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,430
I won't listen to you!

178
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,600
What are you staring at?

179
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,120
Say something.

180
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,510
I don't want to listen
to your explanation.

181
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,480
I don't want to hear it.

182
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,040
Say something. I don't want to hear it.

183
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,680
I don't want to listen
to your explanation.

184
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,870
That's what happened.

185
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,550
It's the doing of Curvy Corgi.

186
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,280
Why did you turn to us?

187
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,310
That's right.

188
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,600
We didn't do it.

189
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,480
Corgi?

190
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,070
Yes.

191
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,240
Do you mean the person

192
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,390
who almost caused you to be
caught by the security guard?

193
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,870
Mengmeng.

194
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,480
It's unnecessary.

195
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,280
Calm down.

196
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,950
Don't be so mad

197
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,630
It's unnecessary.

198
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,310
That's right, Mengmeng.

199
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,870
How dare she pair
Yanjun with someone else

200
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,800
other than me.

201
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,550
She must have a death wish.

202
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,430
I...

203
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,430
Watch out.

204
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,160
You're famous in the school now.

205
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,800
Corgi!

206
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,550
Ziwen went to swim with Yanjun.

207
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,070
They even hugged each other.

208
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,800
Calm down

209
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,630
and drink some water.

210
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,120
I worked so hard

211
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,550
to help her to lose weight

212
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,280
and jogged with
her regardless of weather.

213
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,240
She ended up turning to
someone else for swimming.

214
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,800
Why do you sound so upset?

215
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,280
I know why.

216
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,630
Jiang Yanjun is tall, handsome,

217
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,950
gentle and understanding.

218
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,680
No wonder so many girls are into him.

219
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,840
Ruofei, you...

220
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,120
All right, I was teasing you.

221
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,950
It's all fake.

222
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,160
Why are you taking it seriously?

223
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,870
Have you forgotten what I told you

224
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,360
about camera angles?

225
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,920
You're right.

226
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,190
I almost forgot.

227
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
However, Curvy Corgi

228
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,800
took great photos.

229
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,550
You've read Copycat Magazine, right?

230
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,040
I regret not getting her then.

231
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,390
My idol, thanks to you,

232
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,680
I make the headline of Copycat Magazine.

233
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,840
Ruofei.

234
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,840
What should we do?

235
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,430
Ruofei.

236
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,480
It's time to seek justice for everyone.

237
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,120
Ruofei, I knew you'd have a way.

238
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:44,870
What is it?

239
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,160
My way

240
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,120
is to get everyone to find a way.

241
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,600
Jiahao, what's wrong with you?

242
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,950
Is Han Ruofei here?

243
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,720
Who's there?

244
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,390
Your parent is here.

245
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
My mother?

246
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:02,720
(Academic and Student Affairs Office)
Mother!

247
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,870
(Academic and Student Affairs Office)

248
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,310
(Academic and Student Affairs Office)
Ruofei, why are you so late?

249
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,550
Come over.

250
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,070
Come here.

251
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,070
Don't just stand there. Come here.

252
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,310
What are you doing? Stand straight.

253
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,950
All right.

254
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,360
Dear guardian of Han Ruofei,

255
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,480
I'm sorry to have asked you
to come to school today.

256
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,190
I want to communicate with you in time

257
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,510
so that you, as his guardian,

258
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,630
can guide him properly.

259
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,950
Yes.

260
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,680
It's been tough on you, sir.

261
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,720
You've been caring

262
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,480
for Ruofei in school.

263
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,920
Am I right, brat?

264
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,550
Did you stir up trouble in school again?

265
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,160
Sir.

266
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,280
((Han Jiangshuo secretly dates)
Look, we'll contact

267
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,390
(a fan from a sports school.))
his management about this gossip.

268
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,510
We'll settle it.

269
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,280
Don't worry.

270
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,280
We'll fully support you
in whatever you do.

271
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,950
However, regarding this matter,

272
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,550
the school needs to answer

273
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,990
to other schoolmates,

274
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,430
as well as the society and the public.

275
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,990
Dear guardian of Ruofei,
please understand that

276
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,630
Han Ruofei will be given a demerit.

277
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,240
A demerit?

278
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,990
Okay.

279
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,630
Sir, you're always right.

280
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,990
We support you fully.

281
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,870
Go on and give him a demerit.

282
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,840
He must get that.

283
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,120
Okay.

284
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,480
That's all.

285
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,990
Don't do it again.

286
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,510
Yes, of course.

287
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,480
Sir, don't worry.

288
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,310
We'll go back now.

289
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,360
Thanks, sir.

290
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,360
Sir. Thank you.

291
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,720
My apologies.

292
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,510
We'll go now.

293
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,840
Thanks, sir.

294
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,160
No worries.

295
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,870
Thanks.

296
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,510
We'll go now.

297
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,310
Bye, sir.

298
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,550
Take care.

299
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,430
You don't have to see us off.

300
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,280
Hurry up.

301
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,390
Hurry up.

302
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,070
Please behave in school.

303
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,160
If you stir up trouble again,

304
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,390
I can't defend you in
the management company.

305
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,360
I got it, Miss Qiu.

306
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,630
I know it's been tough on you.

307
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,240
Hang in there for some time.

308
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,510
You can make a comeback.

309
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,840
Also,

310
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,630
your mother wanted to come today.

311
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,360
She suddenly had something on.

312
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,310
So I'm here instead.

313
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,870
It's okay, I'm used to it.

314
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,720
Brat.

315
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,550
I'll go now.

316
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,040
I have a lot of things
to do in the office.

317
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,480
Take good care of yourself,

318
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,390
understand?

319
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:37,920
Thanks, Miss Qiu.

320
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,360
Mother.

321
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,040
Mother, we're going home.

322
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,550
What are we having tonight?

323
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,840
Your favourite food, of course,

324
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,160
my precious son.

325
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,120
My favourite is sweet
and sour pork ribs.

326
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,280
I want to have sweet and sour pork ribs.

327
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,310
All right.

328
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,310
I'll cook it when we're back.

329
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,310
Mother, you're the best.

330
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,430
I love you the most.

331
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,480
As long as you behave,

332
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,310
I'll cook it for you every day,

333
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:05,840
okay?

334
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,750
Okay.

335
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,800
Thanks, mother.

336
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,840
Let's go home.

337
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,480
Come on.

338
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,430
Mother, you're the best.

339
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,120
Be good.

340
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,680
Everything

341
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,870
happened because of me.

342
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,390
I want to apologise
sincerely to all of you.

343
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,840
I'm sorry

344
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,990
that you have to take the blame.

345
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,550
It's all right.

346
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,630
We're not affected in any way.

347
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,630
Yes, don't blame yourself.

348
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,360
Thanks for comforting me,

349
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,430
but the priority

350
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,720
is to get the culprit.

351
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,950
We almost got her last time.

352
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,630
If Jiahao didn't...

353
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,390
That's a misunderstanding.

354
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,920
I suggest

355
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,510
thinking of a way

356
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,360
to catch her in the act.

357
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,070
What do you think?

358
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,120
That's right.

359
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,630
Do you have any good idea?

360
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,990
I

361
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,430
don't have any.

362
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,840
The purpose of this mission

363
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,750
is not just to get the culprit

364
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,950
and clear everyone's name.

365
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,430
More importantly,

366
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,870
we'll get to the source of the gossip

367
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,950
so that others won't be perturbed.

368
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,720
Let's

369
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,840
stay united to overcome the crisis.

370
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,310
Okay.

371
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,160
Hello.

372
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,240
Corgi.

373
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,310
Hurry up.

374
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,190
Understood.

375
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,190
I'm already writing
an article for this issue.

376
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,800
I just need more time.

377
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,390
The camera and photographs.

378
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:53,950
Got it.

379
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,630
She's the one.

380
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,040
They almost got me last time.

381
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,800
Watch me.

382
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,950
I won't be detected next time.

383
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,720
Let's act.

384
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,190
Rest assured,

385
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
I can get more breaking news.

386
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,070
Yes.

387
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,550
I promise I'll give you

388
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,360
clearer photos of Han Ruofei.

389
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,480
Don't worry.

390
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,190
Come on.

391
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,030
Are you mistaken?

392
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,400
Are Cai Jinye Han Ruofei

393
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,600
seriously on a date at
a lane of the school?

394
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,880
It's true.

395
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,000
I wouldn't have been mistaken.

396
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,840
I didn't expect Han Ruofei
to be flirting with Cai Jinye.

397
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,950
Is Han Ruofei that kind of a person?

398
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,910
So you and Han Ruofei...

399
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,150
He told me

400
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,670
he only loved me.

401
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,950
Seriously?

402
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,600
Did he seriously say that?

403
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,240
I don't care. I'll go there

404
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
and get him to make things clear

405
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,480
in front of Cai Jinye.

406
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,670
He can only choose
between me and Cai Jinye.

407
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,550
Come on.

408
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,310
Here comes the fodder for gossip.

409
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,670
You acted so well.

410
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,430
You can win an acting award.

411
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,240
You're not bad, too.

412
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,310
You're good, too.

413
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,790
Hurry up, keep up.

414
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,480
Okay.

415
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,240
They're over there.

416
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,760
Done. She's here.

417
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,950
- She's here?
- She took the bait.

418
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,070
Corgi is on her way here.

419
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,070
Are you ready?

420
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:38,840
Yes.

421
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,310
Okay.

422
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,150
Okay, let's go.

423
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,880
Hurry up.

424
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,360
Hurry up.

425
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,030
I don't think

426
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,400
we look convincing.

427
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,400
We don't look convincing?

428
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,760
What should we do?

429
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,120
Have you watched an idol drama?

430
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,030
Lovers don't act like
this in an idol drama.

431
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,880
They...

432
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,030
Lovers?

433
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,360
It's not right.

434
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,240
According to the script,
we have yet to go steady.

435
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,670
We are not lovers.

436
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,120
Fine.

437
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,720
I think

438
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,310
we should joke around

439
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,430
and hit each other playfully.

440
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,120
That will look convincing.

441
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,430
Joke and hit each other playfully?

442
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,480
Sure, I'll hit you.

443
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,400
You're a guy and I'm a girl.

444
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,120
How can you hit me?

445
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,480
Why can't I hit you?

446
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,360
I'll hit you.

447
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,030
I'm your master.

448
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,430
Corgi.

449
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,550
Just you wait.

450
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,720
How dare you do that to Yanjun.

451
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,640
I'll show you.

452
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,480
Clear my name.

453
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,190
Jiahao.

454
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,310
When Corgi takes out the camera,

455
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,240
you'll take a photo.

456
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,600
We'll catch her in the act.

457
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:30,670
Ruofei.

458
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,880
Ruofei.

459
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,240
The prey has taken the bait.

460
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,000
Begin acting.

461
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,880
How dare you hit me.

462
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,640
We're counting on you.

463
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,840
Stop it.

464
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,600
The prey is showing up.

465
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,480
Got it.

466
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,760
That's right, I forgot about that.

467
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,000
Han Ruofei.

468
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,270
I want to ask you a question.

469
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,600
Go on.

470
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,910
That day, you said

471
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,030
you wouldn't let anyone bully me.

472
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,070
Did you mean it?

473
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,880
Of course.

474
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,480
Why?

475
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,950
It's because you're a hardworking,

476
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,270
ambitious

477
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,310
and brilliant girl.

478
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,360
I feel like protecting you.

479
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,880
Well,

480
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,480
how are you going to protect me?

481
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,360
What are you doing?

482
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,790
I forgot the battery.

483
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,310
What to do? I'll use my mobile phone.

484
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,840
Hurry up, come here.

485
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,240
Look.

486
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,030
Ruofei, not bad.

487
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,000
It's blissful

488
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,070
to have such sweet love.

489
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,840
No.

490
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,600
Their faces won't be shown clearly.

491
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,360
She's there.

492
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,520
- Over there.
- Come on, let's get her.

493
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,600
- Come on.
- Hurry up.

494
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,430
What were you doing?

495
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,120
You almost kissed me.

496
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,310
I was trying to make our performance

497
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,360
more convincing.

498
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,600
Who asked you to do that?

499
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,430
Why did you get so close to me?

500
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,790
It's the camera angle. Don't you know?

501
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,360
I didn't actually kiss you.

502
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,240
What's wrong? Are you mad?

503
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,240
Of course I'm mad.

504
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,480
All right, stop being mad.

505
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,790

Wait.

I'll take a good look at you.

No.

I can't stand you.

No.

Do you think you can escape?

You deserve it.

Why did you pretend to lie down there?

520

Get up.

521
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,360
You made up stories about me, right?

522
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,310
A cat?

523
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,480
What's...

524
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,520
It's all my fault.

525
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,950
I fell down from the tree

526
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,640
and hurt it.

527
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,640
Give me the cat.

I'm sorry.

529

It's all my fault.

530
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,910
Corgi, stop shedding crocodile tears.

531
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,000
What's wrong with it?

532
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,880
Luckily the cat is not badly injured.

533
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,070
I have a way to save it. Follow me.

You make money through what you write.

Yanjun took advantage of Ziwen?

You didn't just hurt me.

You hurt so many innocent people

that Cai Jinye is pretty.

674
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,190
Han Ruofei.

675
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,600
Are you going back?

676
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,880
Even if you aren't, I'll go back now.

677
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,950
Wait for me.

678
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,640
By the way,

679
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,760
how did you know about
this rescue centre?

680
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,310
I was a spokesperson
for this rescue centre.

681
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,120
So the stray cat's surgery

682
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,310
will be cheaper here.

683
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,640
Do you like small animals?

684
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,790
Of course.

685
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,640
What are you doing?

686
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,190
Hold this.

687
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,190
Done.

688
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,190
I don't need this.

689
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,840
Enough, just wear it.

690
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,910
What are you waiting for?

691
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,030
Let's go.

692
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,030
Han Ruofei, relax

693
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,550
like what I've taught you.

694
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,360
Han Ruofei.

695
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,190
Good luck, you're the best.

696
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,360
Why are you so happy?

697
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,070
You practised for so long

698
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,430
and merely passed the test.

699
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,880
You're really lousy.

700
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,430
Coach, you're right.

701
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
You're really lousy.

702
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,670
You're simply lousy.

703
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,760
Don't ever take leave and slack again.

704
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,400
Okay.

705
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,600
Coach, am I...

706
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,600
Han Ruofei.

707
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,400
Stay in the team after the holiday.

708
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,240
Thanks, coach.

709
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,360
I'll work hard.

710
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,070
Thanks, coach!

711
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,150
Okay, listen to me.

712
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,120
This is the final assessment

713
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,550
before the holiday.

714
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,000
Enough.

715
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,950
There's another important mission,

716
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,240
social practice.

717
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,990
Do a meaningful social welfare activity.

718
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,470
This will be included in your credit.

719
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,550
No.

720
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,470
Seriously, coach?

721
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,640
- This is crazy.
- I know, right?

722
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,030
Spare us.

723
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,790
Coach.

724
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,200
What's the point of
making all this noise?

725
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,070
The end of the class.

726
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,160
I'm exhausted.

727
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,180
(Yuanlong)

728
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
What's the matter?

729
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,990
You're acting mysteriously.

730
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,920
Actually I have no idea.

731
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,440
I think my father is
treating you to a meal

732
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,840
to thank you for helping me last time.

733
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,120
He may want to thank you
personally for that.

734
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,120
Am I finally meeting the parents?

735
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,200
What are you talking about?

736
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,360
The soup is served.

737
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,310
We can eat really soon.

738
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,400
Yezi.

739
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,750
- What's the matter?
- Yezi.

740
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,600
It's Han's first meeting
with your father today.

741
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,400
Tell him to behave well.

742
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,680
It's his first time meeting
his future father-in-law after all.

743
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,510
Father-in-law?

744
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,310
Aunt.

745
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,680
You got the wrong idea.

746
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,470
We're just classmates.

747
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,790
Little girl.

748
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,440
Don't be shy.

749
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,070
I've been through it.

750
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,440
I know how it feels.

751
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,790
Sit down.

752
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,510
Come on, sit down.

753
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,510
Are you Han Ruofei?

754
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,360
Look at what you've done.

755
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,230
What is it?

756
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,750
Han Jiangshuo is a spokersperson
for the rescue centre.

757
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,680
Reported by Curvy Corgi.

758
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,400
It's a good thing.

759
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,070
Kid,

760
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,470
you set a good example for young people.

761
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:27,750
Yes.

762
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,360
Yezi is so smart.

763
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,880
Yes.

764
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:37,120
It's said that Han Jiangshuo's
popularity dwindled

765
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,470
and his income dropped,

766
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,310
but he still insists on raising money
for the rescue centre

767
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,880
and participating in events
of the rescue centre regularly.

768
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,920
Through his actions, Mr. Han Jiangshuo

769
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,550
is setting a great example
for celebrities.

770
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,550
Not bad.

771
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,840
Not bad.

772
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,030
- Yezi, you make a good choice.
- It's a positive impact.

773
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,200
Come on.

774
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,920
Cheers.

775
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,200
Why are you staring at me?

776
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,880
Come on, dig in.

777
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,680
What's the matter?

778
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,880
You're a celebrity.
Can't I stare at you?

779
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,640
Cai, dig in, too.

780
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,990
Stare all you want.

781
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,160
Don't just stare.

782
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,470
Will you continue to go
to the rescue centre?

783
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,200
Of course.

784
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,360
What's the matter?

785
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,310
