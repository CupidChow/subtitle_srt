170
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,880
Why would a professional
paparazzo focus on you?

171
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:26,720
No. I mean that you've been

172
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,959
keeping a low profile these days.

173
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,440
You don't get exposed much.

174
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,199
Why would the busy paparazzi

175
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:33,440
focus on you? Am I right?

176
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,320
That makes sense.

177
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,919
Also,

178
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,080
according to my analysis,

179
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,320
Curvy Corgi is familiar
with your schedule.

180
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,440
This is a bad camera angle.

181
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,599
The composition and
the colour tones are off.

182
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,799
The resolution is very low.

183
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,679
No matter how I look at it,

184
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,760
the skills are an amateur's.

185
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:56,279
Go on.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,479
According to my analysis,

187
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,599
I am sure the writer, Curvy Corgi,

188
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:05,599
is our schoolmate.

189
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,679
You're finally being useful.

190
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:17,679
I'm very glad.

191
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,760
Really?

192
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,560
Hold my bag.

193
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:26,120
You are finally appreciating my talent.

194
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,560
(Breaking News. The has-been is
dating a girl in a sports school.)

195
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,000
Captain, are you reading a magazine?

196
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,760
When did you two get together?

197
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,440
What do you mean?

198
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,919
Why don't I understand you?

199
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,080
Stop pretending.

200
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,000
Do you think we didn't see this?

201
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:11,120
How could you hide your
relationship from your best friends?

202
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,440
Lower your voice.

203
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,000
What are you talking about?

204
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,359
It's in Copycat Magazine.

205
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:19,359
The whole school knows by now.

206
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,960
Yezi, you're blushing.

207
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,200
Enough of your nonsense.

208
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,960
Are you still not admitting it?

209
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,239
I feel that our friendship

210
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,239
is facing a unprecedented setback.

211
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,440
I'm seriously not dating him.

212
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:36,359
It's just fake news.

213
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,159
Is the part on the hotel fake, too?

214
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,320
That's true.

215
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,799
Then, the fact that
he touched your face

216
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,479
must be true, too, right?

217
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,440
It's fake.

218
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,440
Give that back to me.

219
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:56,520
Gather around!

220
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,120
Let's take a look.

221
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,560
- What's there to see?
- It's time to gather.

222
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,080
Let me take a look.

223
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,239
Don't snatch it.

224
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,159
Let me take a look.

225
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,200
What are you all doing?

226
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:04,679
- Coach.
- Coach.

227
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,279
Hurry up.

228
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,080
Hurry up.

229
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,919
Hurry up.

230
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,080
Hurry up.

231
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,000
I'll say one thing.

232
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,479
Recently, some students

233
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,080
are not focusing on their training.

234
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,359
They're busy thinking

235
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,560
of other things.

236
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,200
Starting today,

237
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:27,560
everyone here must

238
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,000
focus all attention

239
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,000
on unlimited training.

240
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,320
I announced that starting today,

241
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,799
the guys and girls
will train separately.

242
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,080
Train separately?

243
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,080
Why?

244
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,719
Please ensure appropriate

245
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,239
contact between students.

246
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,000
Got it?

247
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,479
Yes, coach.

248
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,839
Cai Jinye, especially,

249
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:56,080
cannot leave

250
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:57,960
school premises without my permission.

251
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,359
Dismiss.

252
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,279
Cai Jinye.

253
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,599
Coach.

254
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,400
Come with me to my office.

255
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,760
Ziwen and Yuling.

256
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,520
I feel like my world

257
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:22,520
is about to crumble.

258
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,279
You can do this.

259
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,039
Take care.

260
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,080
No.

261
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:32,120
Don't leave me.

262
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:37,560
Let's go.

263
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Have some water.

264
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,880
Thank you, coach.

265
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:03,719
Yezi.

266
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:05,919
In certain matters,

267
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,279
I'm sure you know better
without me saying it.

268
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,039
Currently, the most important thing is

269
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,479
for you to focus all your effort

270
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,599
on the training and the competition.

271
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:23,279
Don't be affected

272
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,159
by complicated matters
like relationships.

273
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,960
Otherwise, you will have
waste all your effort.

274
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,359
Yezi, do you understand?

275
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,279
there are someting

276
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,400
you may handle it in the future.

277
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,919
Certain feelings

278
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,520
can only be protected properly

279
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,719
when you're more mature.

280
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,200
Back then,

281
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,320
I was young and frivolous, too.

282
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,839
And I was innocent and naive.

283
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,919
I lost everything in the end.

284
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,039
Yezi, do you understand?

285
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,359
That year,

286
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:17,400
as the flower petals fell, apricot blossom rain.

287
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,880
We've known each other
since we were nine or ten.

288
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,960
We talked about the future, too.

289
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,960
We were very much in love.

290
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,159
However,

291
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,120
it was all unreal.

292
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,159
She pretended to be my girlfriend

293
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,799
to distract me from training

294
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,279
and cause me to lose my position.

295
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,239
Lv,

296
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,679
you're so cruel.

297
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,679
Coach,

298
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,400
who is Lv?

299
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,839
Lv.

300
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,159
That's none of your business.

301
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
What are you still doing here?

302
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Go for training.

303
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,000
I...

304
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,080
(Weren't you lecturing me?)

305
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,479
All right, coach.

306
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,479
What's going on?

307
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,560
I'm so annoyed.

308
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,080
(Non-training hours.
Only open to students.)

309
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:33,479
I'm exhausted.

310
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,000
We've been doing it for a day. Let's go.

311
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,560
You swam well earlier on.

312
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,359
Do you have water?

313
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:37,400
No.

314
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,320
I'm so thirsty.

315
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,239
- Let's buy some.
- You'll go.

316
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,000
You should go.

317
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,000
Me?

318
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,880
I'm not going.

319
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
What a nice figure.

320
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:56,359
Yanjun.

321
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,279
What are you looking at?

322
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,479
Have you never seen
a beautiful girl before?

323
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,919
Help!

324
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:44,279
Senior!

325
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,279
Help! Senior!

326
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,880
(She was swimming well earlier on.)

327
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,279
(Why can't she swim suddenly?)

328
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,159
Give me your hand.

329
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,239
(How dare you try to
pretend in front of me.)

330
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,080
Go forward.

331
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,799
Jiang Yanjun, help me.

332
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,120
I have a leg cramp.

333
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,079
Someone is drowning.

334
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:06,839
Yanjun.

335
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,839
Get on first.

336
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:08,559
Help!

337
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,120
What are you doing?

338
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,160
- Let me go.
- We're coming.

339
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,239
Let me go.

340
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,160
Yanjun.
Jiang Yanjun.

341
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,719
- Let me go.
- Be careful.

342
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:17,880
- Be careful.
- Here.

343
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,599
Are you all right?

344
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,120
Let me go.

345
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,959
Go away.

346
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,439
I don't want you to save me.

347
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,800
We were just being nice.

348
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,640
Yanjun, thank you.

349
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,280
Jiang Yanjun,

350
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,439
please agree to accept

351
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,079
the one-on-one interview.

352
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,120
(Reject her.)

353
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,599
(Reject her.)

354
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,920
Fine. No problem.

355
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,680
I knew the stupid bloke
wouldn't reject anyone.

356
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Let me help her.

357
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,800
Aren't you going too far
just for an interview?

358
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,559
That's my assignment.

359
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,800
Why don't you interview me instead?

360
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,280
What do you think?

361
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,400
Mengmeng, are you all right?

362
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,479
I'm fine. Don't worry.

363
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,640
I'll take good care of her.

364
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,239
All right.

365
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,400
Let's go.

366
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,120
Why is Han Ruofei not here yet?

367
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,400
What is he up to?

368
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,400
(It's an expensive phone
yet it's not ringing.)

369
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,920
(I tickled head of Narcissist Han.)
(I like you.)

370
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,920
(Recall the message.)

371
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,959
Who would fall for you?

372
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,920
You're so cute.

373
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,520
Are you looking for me?

374
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:43,000
Are you here to sell chocolate?

375
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,280
No, thank you.

376
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,800
I don't eat chocolate.

377
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,319
It's not because I don't like it.

378
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,839
I'm watching my weight.

379
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,559
So, I'm trying to stay away

380
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,920
from high-calorie food

381
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:57,120
like chocolate.

382
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,880
Anyway, thank you for the thought.

383
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,359
I love it actually.

384
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:09,040
Can I take a picture with you?

385
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,959
Thank you.

386
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:21,680
What's wrong?

387
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,439
Are you inviting me to the riverside?

388
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,760
No. I'm waiting for someone.

389
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:44,079
Me? You?

390
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,160
Do you mean I'm waiting for you?

391
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,800
You...

392
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,559
A little bird?

393
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,199
Fly?

394
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,400
Are you Han Ruofei?

395
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,359
Why are you dressed like that?

396
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,400
I... No.

397
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,040
You...

398
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,920
Han Ruofei, it's really you.

399
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,479
Lower your voice.

400
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,239
I'm sorry for what happened these days.

401
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,239
It's all my fault.

402
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,559
I've caused you so much trouble.

403
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
To prevent further trouble,

404
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,599
I've asked for

405
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,160
two days of medical leave.

406
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,400
What?

407
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,120
No.

408
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:47,199
You're taking medical leave
because of this?

409
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,839
I don't feel troubled at all.

410
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,920
I've decided.

411
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,559
No. What did you decide on?

412
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,079
You stopped going for training.

413
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,719
You stopped going for
cultural lessons, too.

414
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,239
You didn't reply to
texts nor pick up calls.

415
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,439
Do you know how worried I was?

416
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,439
I thought something happened to you.

417
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,000
Are you worried about me?

418
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,640
I...

419
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,040
Were you worried about me?

420
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,040
That's not the point.

421
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:21,280
The point is

422
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:24,160
you skipped classes.

423
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,199
Do you know

424
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:28,599
how the cultural classes
change every day?

425
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:30,239
They won't wait for you.

426
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:31,239
I know.

427
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:32,800
I...

428
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,920
What's so funny?

429
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,160
Be serious.

430
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:38,079
Fine. I'll be serious.

431
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:41,920
I'll get that paparazzo.

432
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,199
I'll restore your reputation.

433
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,239
I won't let anyone

434
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,880
bully you.

435
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,160
Oh, no. I forgot to turn off flash.

436
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,319
Is that...

437
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,160
Get her!

(Shizu Supermarket)

439
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:06,400
Stop!

440
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,199
Don't run!

441
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,719
Han Ruofei!

442
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,599
Han Ruofei, are you all right?

443
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:30,760
Are you all right?

444
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,640
I'm fine.

445
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:33,599
Take the alley.

446
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,479
I'll take this lane.

447
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,599
Be careful.

448
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,359
All right.

449
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,439
The training was so tiring today.

450
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:41,000
Let's have something nice.

451
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,239
All right.

452
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,319
What do you want to eat?

453
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,599
Stop there.

454
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,959
Help!

455
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,359
Someone is molesting me!

456

Help!

Someone is molestting me!

458

Senior, something happened.

459

Help!

461
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,520
- What are you doing?
- Stop!

462

- Let go!
- Stop!

463
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,359
Let go!

464

Stop hitting me! It's me!

I'm hitting you!

466

You're quite strong.

467

You won't be able to
take it anymore, Jiahao.

Leave it to me!

469
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:22,120
Stop! He's Han Ruofei.

470
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:22,719
What?

471
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,079
- Han Ruofei?
- How can that be?

472
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:25,400
He is really Han Ruofei.

473
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:27,520
Han Ruofei.

474

Han Ruofei.

00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,479
Where are we?

480
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,239
Get up.

481
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,199
Help him up.

482
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:36,680
Ruofei.

483
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:40,719
Are you all right?

484
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,719
Ruofei, are you all right?

485
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,760
Han Ruofei, are you all right?

if not for you,

488
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,479
I would've gotten Curvy Corgi.

489
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:54,920
Where did she run off?

490
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,439
That way, I think.

491
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,160
- Get her!
- Stop!

492
00:24:58,439 --> 00:24:59,160
Don't move.

493
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,079
Don't move.

I'm Mr. Zhang, a security guard
at Jianghang University of Sports.

495
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,559
I received a report that

496
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:09,640
a bear and a girl

497
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,120
were causing a commotion.

498
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,760
It must be you two.

499
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:15,439
Please come to
the security office with me.

500

Let's talk at the office.

Let's go.

Let's go.

Han Ruofei.

506
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,160
Sir, it's all a misunderstanding.

507
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,880
The both of you

508
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:27,640
are the witnesses.

509
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,559
Go back and wait.

510
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,239
Go on.

511
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,439
Let's go.

512
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,599
I've caught the suspects.

513
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,160
We're done. Over.

514
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,920
Han Ruofei. Cai Jinye.

515
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,239
You don't have to say
anything if you don't want to.

516
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,160
ou have the right to remain silent.

517
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,239
Anything you say may be used against you

518
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,199
in a court of law,

519
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:16,839
understand?

520
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,040
Sir.

521
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,839
Must we be this formal?

522
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,760
Do you have any idea

523
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:36,079
how many reports

524
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,359
we have received so far?

525
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:43,040
You've messed up the entire
back alley of the school.

526
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,839
You've disrupted
the discipline in the school.

527
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,239
Got it.

528
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,680
Han Ruofei, do you know what you did?

529
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,319
Sir,

530
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,199
give us a chance.

531
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,079
How should I give you a chance?

532
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,040
I didn't have a choice before this.

533
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:09,359
I want to be a good student now.

534
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,959
Fine. Tell the principal that.

535
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,839
I'll let him decide.

536
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,120
Are you saying I'll be punished?

537
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,920
I'm sorry. I'm just a guard.

538
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,199
Be serious.

539
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,599
Dear sir,

540
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,880
we were framed.

541
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,079
Framed?

542
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:35,199
You will eventually pay
a price for what you did.

543
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,120
Nobody can save you.

544
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:38,839
Nobody can help you either.

545
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,479
You're the one who can save yourself.

546
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,280
I believe the school's rules are fair.

547
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:48,199
Sir,

548
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,959
I caused the commotion
in the back alley.

549
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,000
Can you let Cai Jinye go first?

550
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:55,839
Also,

551
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,040
I hope you won't record her name.

552
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,880
She is innocent in these things.

553
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,000
Innocent?

554
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,160
That's not up to you.

555
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,839
We must investigate it.

556
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,680
What are you doing this time?

557
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,959
You must have been too bored.

558
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,120
Hurry up.

559
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,359
Take down all these messy posters

560
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,479
from the wall.

561
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:33,760
Han Ruofei and Cai Jinye, right?

562
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,880
We've got to know now

563
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,520
what has happened.

564
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,439
Ms. Cai can leave first.

565
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:47,719
Mr. Han, please stay back.

566
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,160
Will you be all right by alone?

567
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,400
Yezi,

568
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,079
we're buddies.

569
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,439
When you're out, remember
to get a good lawyer for me.

570
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,479
Also,

571
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,959
tell Jiahao

572
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,719
to forget me.

573
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:07,920
Are you still messing around?

574
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,079
Are you leaving?

575
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,920
You can stay here with him.

576
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:13,439
Fine.

577
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,520
All right, I'll wait for you in class.

578
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,000
Don't skip class anymore.

579
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:18,599
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

580
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,400
Goodbye.

581
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Move aside.

582
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,280
