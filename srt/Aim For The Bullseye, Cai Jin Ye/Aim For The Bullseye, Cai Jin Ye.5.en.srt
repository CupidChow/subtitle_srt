(Strengthen your willpower.)
and don't be lazy.

32
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:49,459
Our school is the host
of this competition.

33
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:51,419
So everyone of you

34
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,980
ought to have the winning spirit.

35
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,139
We must do our best.

36
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,580
Boys and girls need
to pay attention to social distance.

Please obey the rules.

Let's continue our practice.

41
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:09,140
One more thing.

42
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,299
Some students are selling things

43
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,459
in a live stream in school.

44
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,099
Stop doing that

45
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:17,099
or you'll be punished
by having no Internet.

46
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:19,819
You must be kidding me.
I just accepted a live stream job.

47
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,860
You'll be punished severely
if you disobey the rule.

48
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:22,900
Lastly,

49
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:24,420
you'd better

50
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,900
watch your diet.

51
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,019
Don't take snacks.

52
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,340
No food delivery is allowed.

53
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,179
Otherwise,it will deliver
directly to Discipline Office.

54
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,099
Nonsense.

55
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,340
Han Ruofei, what are you doing?

56
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:42,099
I...

57
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:43,539
Nothing.

58
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,340
Why do you have so much food?

59
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,060
Are you hungry, too?

60
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,420
Yes.

61
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:51,860
My idol.

62
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,539
You're my idol

63
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,539
and Brother Ruofei.

64
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,379
Since I'm your diehard fan,

65
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,019
shouldn't we

66
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,939
share this together?

67
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,019
Ziwen. Ziwen.

68
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:04,939
You can't have this.

69
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,179
Come on. It's just a packet.

70
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:08,900
Not even a packet.

71
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,099
Don't be stingy.

72
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,299
Come on. One packet, please.

73
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:12,620
Wait. Listen to me.

74
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:13,379
Just a packet.

75
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:14,579
No, seriously.

76
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,780
Just a packet.

77
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,819
Is this classic wrestling or what?

78
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,420
Didn't you listen

79
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,500
to what the discipline master

80
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
said in the broadcast?

81
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,220
How dare you!

82
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,140
Stand up!

83
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,620
Han Ruofei.

84
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,459
You've been breaking the rules.

85
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,980
Maybe I'm too striking.

86
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Han Ruofei

87
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:45,900
You're not excused because of

88
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,659
Cai Jinye's plea.

89
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,579
She really did that?

90
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:53,980
Stop pretending.

91
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,980
I just cancelled your punishment,

92
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,900
yet you stirred up trouble here.

93
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:00,099
Listen.

94
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,579
If you can't hit the sixth ring
in the assessment,

95
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,620
I'll send you away.

96
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:06,060
Coach.

97
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,780
Isn't this a little hard to achieve?

98
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,980
Exactly.

99
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,500
Ms. Lin Ziwen.

100
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:14,500
If you didn't speak,

101
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,419
I almost forgot you're here.

102
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,340
Are you feeling sorry for him?

103
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,820
Not really.

104
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,540
He's a beginner after all.

105
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,940
Why don't you feel sorry for yourself?

106
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,299
Be prepared to stay

107
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:28,620
in this archery center day and night

108
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:31,139
if you're still overweight this month.

109
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,340
Coach, I can't do it.

110
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,540
What a drama queen.

111
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:40,859
Stop joking.

112
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:43,900
You two, practise at once!

113
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:45,660
Yes.

114
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,100
The coach is mad again.

115
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:53,500
I think he saw Han Ruofei
bringing some snacks.

116
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,940
He's an adult.

117
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,900
Why is he so childish?

118
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:00,900
Poor Ziwen.

119
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,019
People have died for food and wealth.

120
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,100
She deserves it for ignoring
us over the guy.

121
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:07,940
Exactly.

122
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,100
It serves her right.

123
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,900
The stupid Jiahao didn't even

124
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:23,620
invite me for barbecue with Ruofei.

125
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,419
I'll teach him a lesson.

126
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:02,100
Mengmeng?

127
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,540
Why are you here?

128
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:31,380
I...

129
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,179
Jiang Yanjun!

130
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,100
Yu Mengmeng!

131
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,259
What are you doing?

132
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,940
Don't get the wrong idea!

133
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,699
I got it.

134
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,500
You know nothing.

135
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:45,780
I can choose to know nothing.

136
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,820
Jiahao.

137
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,979
- Listen...
- Yanjun!

138
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,220
I got it.

139
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,139
You're a true warrior.

140
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,100
Li Jiahao.

141
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:55,739
Don't tell anyone

142
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,660
or I'll make you pay.

143
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,979
You can trust me totally,

144
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:01,459
I will!

145
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,220
-Guys!
-Li Jiahao,

146
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,660
-I have hot news!
-stop there!

147
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:05,019
Stop right there!

148
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,220
It won't work.

149
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,459
Cai Jinye.

150
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,780
Coach? Why are you here?

151
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,579
The lights at the archery center

152
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,500
are still lit at this hour.

153
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
I knew it'd be you.

154
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,299
So I'm here.

155
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:00,660
Coach.

156
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,380
I haven't been able

157
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,940
to concentrate while I'm shooting lately.

158
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,500
So I hope to overcome it

159
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,660
by practising more.

160
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:14,739
Yezi.

161
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:18,419
Accuracy has been your strength.

162
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,620
However, now you tend to hesitate

163
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,579
while aiming.

164
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:26,500
This has worked against you.

165
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:28,060
Come on.

166
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:29,820
One more time.

167
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,780
Sure, coach.

168
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,699
You still missed it.

169
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:53,220
Yezi.

170
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:54,699
All top athletes

171
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,579
are almost similar

172
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,220
technically and tactically.

173
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:01,699
What separates them is mentality.

174
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,300
I know, coach.

175
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,340
I've been under stress

176
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:13,180
and having insomnia lately.

177
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:19,459
It's all right.

178
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,220
Be patient.

179
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,459
It takes time to overcome
the psychological problem.

180
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,860
The thing is you must get enough rest.

181
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,699
Forcing yourself

182
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,180
might get yourself injured.

183
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:36,220
I got it.

184
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:40,180
I'll try to adjust myself.

185
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,220
Good.

186
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:44,579
That's the girl I know.

187
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,019
Just call it a day.

188
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:50,220
Rest well for the trial tomorrow.

189
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:52,459
Adjust your mentality, okay?

190
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,019
Come on.

191
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:55,139
How about this?

192
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:57,340
Let me show you my skills.

193
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:11,100
That was awesome!

194
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,819
You're as good as ever.

195
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,139
Of course.

196
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,139
I've never ever

197
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,780
lost any competition.

198
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,540
Very well.

199
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,780
Go back to rest soon.

200
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,100
Coach.

201
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:34,340
Are you all right?

202
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,900
Why are you still here?

203
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,100
Why don't you go back to your dorm?

204
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,619
Be quick. Leave here.

205
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:39,340
Go back to your dorm.

206
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:40,860
Rest early.

207
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:41,459
Sure.

208
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,699
Move it.

209
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,480
(Female Dorm)

210
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,939
It's really tough on me.

211
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,100
The coach wants me
to lose 5kg in a month.

212
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,379
Seriously? How can I achieve it?

213
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:06,540
Just don't eat too much.

214
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:08,900
Worst comes to worst,

215
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,180
training with Yezi will do.

216
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,100
Exactly, Ziwen.

217
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,780
Why don't you learn from me, too?

218
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:16,459
I'll create for you

219
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:18,139
a customised reward.

220
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,499
You'll lose more than 5kg.

221
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,379
No, thanks. Let me go.

222
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:24,379
I'd rather sleep in the archery center

223
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:25,980
with all my fat.

224
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,300
I'll sleep next to you in a tent then.

225
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:31,059
Come on, Yezi.

226
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:32,220
Are you seriously?

227
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,860
Of course.

228
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,220
I'll go through thick and thin with you.

229
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:38,499
Enough.

230
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:39,819
Tomorrow is the trial.

231
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,059
We should sleep.

232
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:42,939
Yezi, turn off the light!

233
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,300
Yes, madam.

234
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:58,540
One braised leg of lamb.

235
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,019
Two braised legs with cumin.

236
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:06,740
Make three braised legs spicy.

237
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:15,939
Cai Jinye.

238
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,619
I wish you luck for tomorrow.

239
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:19,740
Don't embarrass me.

240
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,059
Why does it sound weird?

241
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,900
This is not the way to cheer one on.

242
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,340
Why does it sound weird?

243
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:38,459
This is not the way to cheer one on.

244
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,980
Are you sleeping or not?

245
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,340
Why are you still up?

246
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:50,819
I can't sleep. I suffer from insomnia.

247
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,220
Insomnia?

248
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,300
I have an idea.

249
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,180
Just a moment.

250
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:01,660
♪Go to sleep♪

251
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,980
♪My dear baby♪

252
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,300
♪Go to sleep♪

253
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,660
You're nuts, Li Jiahao.

254
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,300
Cai Jinye.

255
00:13:58,259 --> 00:13:58,860
Go to bed.

256
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,220
Gosh.

257
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,459
What's going on?

258
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:24,540
Why can't I sleep now?

259
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,100
Stop snoring.

260
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,459
It's so noisy.

261
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,139
Come on.

262
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,780
Don't you

263
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,579
let me down at this critical moment.

264
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,540
I woke up late.

265
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,819
How is Cai Jinye doing?

266
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:21,699
It's her last round.

267
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,660
The last round.

268
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:56,100
Why hasn't she shot it?

269
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:19,699
It'll be over soon.

270
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,300
Shoot.

271
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:23,340
Yezi.

272
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,459
Cai Jinye exceeds
the time limit. Zero ring.

273
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:34,420
Zhou Yuling and Lin Ziwen
have the top two highest scores

274
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:36,540
and qualify for the University Sports Day.

275
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,980
The rest will enter the playoff.

276
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,139
What happened to her today?

277
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,860
I have no idea.

278
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,699
What's wrong with you?

279
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,300
That was an elementary mistake!

280
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,780
Why didn't you shoot?

281
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,540
Is this your first time shooting?

282
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,300
That was so stupid.

283
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:56,459
I never expected you...

284
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,619
What are you staring at?

285
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,699
Is this funny?

286
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:03,540
Let's go.

287
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,379
Yezi.

288
00:17:16,379 --> 00:17:16,979
Yezi.

289
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:18,940
What happened to you?

290
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,660
Why didn't you shoot the last arrow?

291
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,660
Yes.

292
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,180
What's wrong?

293
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,259
What's the matter?

294
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,540
I don't know.

295
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,060
Why are you quiet?

296
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,619
Aren't you talking if I'm quiet?

297
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,979
I'm so sorry, coach.

298
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:03,219
I failed to perform this time.

299
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,420
You can punish me

300
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,580
whatever way you want.

301
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,139
This wasn't just that.

302
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,499
You made a stupid mistake!

303
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:15,940
You got 30 seconds.

304
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,099
Why didn't you shoot the last arrow?

305
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,060
The bow sight wasn't working.

306
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:26,780
I kept adjusting it

307
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:30,780
without realising the time.

308
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,580
Cai Jinye.

309
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,660
What should I even say?

310
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,660
It's a competition.

311
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,540
Even if your bow sight was spoilt,

312
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,660
you should've shot the last arrow.

313
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:50,259
Coach.

314
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:55,180
I wanted to make it perfect.

315
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:59,180
So I used up my time.

316
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:05,460
I know what's wrong.

317
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,979
You placed too much pressure on yourself

318
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:10,780
as you wanted to win so badly.

319
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,339
Hence the problem, right?

320
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:24,379
Yezi.

321
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:29,099
Fix your bow sight for
the playoff tomorrow.

322
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:32,259
Don't mess up again tomorrow.

323
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:39,139
Coach.

324
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,540
Are you really disappointed in me?

325
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,180
Don't think too much.

326
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,859
I picked you personally.

327
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:49,420
I have faith in you.

328
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,060
Thanks, coach.

329
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,139
By the way,

330
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:57,460
go back to practice.

331
00:19:58,019 --> 00:19:59,499
I don't want to see you now.

332
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,139
If you create another problem tomorrow,

333
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,300
I might have a heart attack.

334
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:07,660
I got it.

335
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:09,379
See you, coach.

336
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,460
Why don't you...

337
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,180
Why are you guys here
instead of training?

338
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,619
What else? Let's fix your bow sight.

339
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:43,259
Fix...

340
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:46,139
There's nothing wrong with it.

341
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:48,460
Do you think we're stupid?

342
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,379
We could tell your bow was problematic.

343
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:52,540
Let's get it fixed

344
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,780
for the important playoff tomorrow.

345
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:58,859
I can take care of it alone.

346
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,580
I'm not a kid.

347
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:02,060
You're careless.

348
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,700
We're worried.

349
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,619
What's the matter?

350
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:07,820
Do you think I'll get lost?

351
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:09,420
You absolutely right.

352
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:10,739
Let's go. Hurry up.

353
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,540
Slow down.

354
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:24,859
Sir.

355
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,619
Please fix this bow sight.

356
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:27,700
Just leave it here.

357
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:29,900
My hands are full

358
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:31,580
as there're many competitions lately.

359
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:32,619
Wait for your turn.

360
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:34,660
Sir.

361
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,859
Can you fix this first?

362
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:38,259
We have a competition tomorrow.

363
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,420
It's urgent.

364
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,060
What's wrong, sir?

365
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:49,580
Does the screw not fit?

366
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:51,859
The bow sight's gap is old.

367
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,859
We run out of screws for it.

368
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:55,259
They'll only be

369
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,580
available next week.

370
00:21:57,339 --> 00:21:58,379
What should we do?

371
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,499
We have a competition tomorrow.

372
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,940
Yes, sir.

373
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:04,139
Surely there must be a way.

374
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:05,099
There isn't.

375
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,700
You must always maintain this
competition equipment properly.

376
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,300
Try finding it online.

377
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,259
This is the fastest way.

378
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,139
What should we do?

379
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:22,540
Let's go.

380
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,700
Come on.

381
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:39,619
Drink milk tea.

382
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:44,339
Yezi.

383
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:46,460
The milk tea will make you feel better.

384
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:48,300
Yes, Yezi.

385
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:49,619
Don't feel bad.

386
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:51,339
If you're really upset,

387
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,780
vent it then.

388
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:54,099
Take a big sip.

389
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,820
Don't worry, girls.

390
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:03,300
I can still win

391
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,019
without the bow sight.

392
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:06,099
That's right.

393
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,420
With your capability, Yezi,

394
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,700
you'll surely win.

395
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:11,099
Nevertheless,

396
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,940
you'll lag behind

397
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:16,300
your opponent without it.

398
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,739
You can't possibly compete.

399
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:21,099
I'd take back

400
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,460
the spare bow from

401
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,180
Han Ruofei if I were you.

402
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,379
Why aren't you siding
with your idol now?

403
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:34,180
He has an assessment tomorrow.

404
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,060
Yes.

405
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,099
Your idol will have an assessment tomorrow.

406
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,780
Having a bow sight or not

407
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,019
won't make a difference for him.

408
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,900
Just forget it.

409
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:52,900
The assessment is important to him.

410
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:56,780
It's either do or die for him.

411
00:24:01,219 --> 00:24:03,619
Both of you need

412
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,660
the bow sight to survive.

413
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,300
Either of you will be doomed

414
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,379
without it.

415
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:12,339
You're in a dilemma.

416
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,979
Oh god.

417
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:16,379
Please give us a bow sight!

418
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,499
Yes.

419
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,339
Yanjun,

420
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,780
this is the situation.

421
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:32,540
Do you have a solution?

422
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:33,940
This competition

423
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,099
is really important to Yezi.

424
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:37,499
Just leave it to me.

425
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,580
Don't worry.

426
00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:39,420
All right.

427
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,739
Thanks for your help.

428
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,420
No worries.

429
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,580
What's the matter with you?

430
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:12,979
You're making

431
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,339
my head spin by pacing.

432
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:16,379
Just go to sleep.

433
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,859
Don't keep it to yourself.

434
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:21,259
Tell me.

435
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:24,139
Are you worried about
the assessment tomorrow?

436
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:25,660
No.

437
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:28,420
That's right.

438
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:30,300
The assessment

439
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,619
is never your concern.

440
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:34,219
Why do you talk so much?

441
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:35,660
Can't you go to sleep?

442
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:39,660
Is it because of Cai Jinye?

443
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:41,820
Why do you talk so much?

444
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,660
Go to sleep!

445
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,660
I'll go to bed then.

446
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:52,499
Good night.

447
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,820
It'll be over for her

448
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,700
for the competition tomorrow

449
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:16,820
without the bow sight.

450
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:20,940
She didn't even ask me for it.

451
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:23,420
Should I just send it to her?

452
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,379
Forget it.

453
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,940
She did plead with the coach

454
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:32,180
for me after all.

455
00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:33,460
I'll just do her this favor.

456
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,900
Li Jiahao. Jiahao.

457
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:38,460
Li Jiahao. Wake up.

458
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,460
You asked me to sleep.

459
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,940
Let's go to the girls' dormitory.

460
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,680
(Female Dorm)

461
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,259
Brother.

462
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,420
Why are we sending it here?

463
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,820
Can't she just come to you?

464
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,379
You know nothing. This is sincerity.

465
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,339
You got me?

466
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,540
Brother. You're good at flirting.

467
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,700
This isn't the point.

468
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:34,859
How do we get in? Tell me.

469
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,019
Don't worry.

470
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,019
I know this place well.

471
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,739
You're familiar with
the girls' dormitory?

472
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:44,219
This isn't the point.

473
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,460
The thing is

474
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,540
the ground floor is totally unoccupied.

475
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:53,300
It's a cat.

476
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:56,259
It's all right.

477
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,580
All we have to do

478
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,940
is to pass through the ladies

479
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,099
to get to the first floor,

480
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,540
where Yezi and others are staying.

481
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,420
Are you sure?

482
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:08,339
Don't you trust me?

483
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,420
Come on.

484
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,660
Let's go.

485
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:21,499
I told you so.

486
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:22,660
Look.

487
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,139
The ladies and gents are the same.

488
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,219
Hit the perverts!

489
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,460
Hit the perverts!

490
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:36,700
Hit the perverts!

491
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,339
Pass the stuff to them.

492
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:38,339
I'll distract her.

493
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:39,820
Aunt.

494
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:40,820
Hit the perverts!

495
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:43,660
Stop!

496
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,060
Come and get me!

497
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:46,139
Hit the perverts!

498
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:46,660
Come here!

499
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,660
Stop right there! Come back!

500
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,540
It's scary.

501
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:51,780
It's too scary.

502
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:53,379
I must go back first.

503
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,420
Wait.

504
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:01,019
He'll kill me if I go now.

505
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:05,580
Stop!

506
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,420
Come back!

507
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:08,940
Stop!

508
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:11,180
Pervert!

509
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:11,979
Come back!

510
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:13,060
Stop!

511
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,619
Help!

512
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:17,259
There's a pervert!

513
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:17,820
Help!

514
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:18,460
(Oh no.)

515
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:20,859
(Am I exposed for
buying snacks outside?)

516
00:29:57,139 --> 00:29:57,900
Someone is in the ladies.

517
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,019
Let's find out.

518
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,900
Okay, come on.

519
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,139
Why are you here?

520
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,379
There's a sound here.

521
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,139
Girl.

522
00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:14,700
Help me.

523
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,580
Did anyone enter?

524
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:16,099
Please.

525
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,780
It's me.

526
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,060
I came in to pee

527
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:20,580
and had a stomach ache.

528
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,540
Strange.

529
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,700
I saw someone entering.

530
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:26,460
Did you see any guy entering?

531
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:30,060
No.

532
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:32,379
You might have been mistaken.

533
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:33,420
Was I?

534
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:34,540
Do I have poor eye sight?

535
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,379
It's okay. Just go.

536
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,499
Go to bed. There's a competition tomorrow.

537
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,700
Let's continue to search elsewhere.

538
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,180
Come on.

539
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:49,700
Li Jiahao.

540
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:54,219
Why are you at the girls' dorm
in the middle of the night?

541
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,739
Let me tell you the truth.

542
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,259
Frankly,

543
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:04,099
I have no choice.

544
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:05,900
I have

545
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:07,739
something for you.

546
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:09,460
(Oh dear.)

547
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,700
(Something for me?)

548
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,180
(Is it a surprise?)

549
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:14,219
You know what?

550
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:18,379
Pass this to Cai Jinye.

551
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,540
That's all?

552
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,259
Yes. Ruofei insists to give this to her.

553
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,379
I have to do this.

554
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:27,060
Make sure give it to Cai Jinye.

555
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,780
Just stay here.

556
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,979
I shouldn't have saved you.

557
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:35,180
You deserved to be beaten up.

558
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:43,940
What?

559
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,180
(Female Dorm)

560
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,060
Stop, pervert!

561
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:49,339
Stop right there!

562
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:50,820
Stop! Stop there.

563
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:52,139
I think he went out from there! Come on!

564
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:52,979
Hurry!

565
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,859
Hurry, this way!

566
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,820
Where is he?

567
00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:00,139
Stop, pervert!

568
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:01,339
Is he in front?

569
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:01,940
Come on!

570
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,460
Let's get the pervert!

571
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:07,940
Where is he?

572
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,979
Would he get into the trash bin?

573
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:14,979
It stinks.

574
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,099
I don't think so he is there.

575
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,580
Let's go over there.

576
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,339
Let's go.

577
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:18,660
Okay.

578
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:25,019
Why didn't you

579
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,180
tell me this?

580
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:27,739
Did you plan to shoulder it alone

581
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:28,820
and go to the competition like that?

582
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:31,180
Yanjun, you knew it?

583
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:33,859
You've always made me worried.

584
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:40,379
How could you possibly get

585
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,139
this bow sight?

586
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,139
I finished training early.

587
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,420
So I sought help

588
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:46,619
from someone I knew

589
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,739
at the neighbouring sports school.

590
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,379
Thank you for

591
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,099
helping me always.

592
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,300
That's okay, save it.

593
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:56,540
Rest well tonight.

594
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,379
I'll treat you to dinner

595
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,619
when it's over.

596
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:01,540
Sure.

597
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:02,940
All the best for tomorrow.

598
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,379
It's late now.

599
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,700
Go back and rest.

600
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,739
Okay, bye.

601
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,499
Bye.

602
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,940
I wonder what

603
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,339
they chatted about so happily.

604
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:24,259
I have to endure this

605
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,219
for helping you,

606
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:27,660
yet you're

607
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:29,780
having a secret meeting with him.

608
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,820
Yezi, Han Ruofei gave you this.

609
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,460
What's going on?

610
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,540
Are you mad at anyone?

611
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:44,619
Nothing.

612
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,259
He's such a fool!

613
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:47,259
A fool?

614
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,739
What happened?

615
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:51,460
Leave me alone.

616
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,379
I'm going to sleep. I'm dizzy!

617
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,940
Are you sure you're all right, Ziwen?

618
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:57,940
Your rage has almost

619
00:33:58,099 --> 00:33:59,339
lit up your quilt.

620
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,019
I'm fine.

621
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:02,499
Leave me alone.

622
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,820
I have to sleep.

623
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:05,099
Stop talking.

624
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:09,379
Let's sleep.

625
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,420
Fine.

626
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:15,379
Yes, Your Highness.

627
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:17,700
Rest well, Your Highness.

628
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:27,900
I wonder what

629
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,579
Han Ruofei gave me at this hour.

630
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,940
Why did he give me snacks in midnight?

631
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:42,779
Have you received it?

632
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,220
Yes.

633
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,920
(Have you received it? Yes.)
(Good night.)

634
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,779
What's her attitude?

635
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,020
I took risk to give you
something this important

636
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:19,099
and you didn't even thank me.

637
00:35:22,379 --> 00:35:24,420
Do you want to take a shower together?

638
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,500
Get lost!

639
00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:08,779
Cai Jinye

640
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,420
has come out top

641
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,020
in the playoff

642
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:14,299
and qualified for
the University Sports Day.

643
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:19,420
Yezi, you're great!

644
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,500
Awesome!

645
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,339
All bullseye!

646
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:23,139
I just knew you could.

647
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,299
I told you so, Yuling.

648
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:40,059
Here I am, coach.

649
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:45,379
Why don't you come at 12 midnight instead?

650
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,260
Why am I the only one?

651
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,900
Am I doing the assessment alone?

652
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,740
You must be kidding me.

653
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,900
Do you see anyone else here?

654
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,579
Get ready.

655
00:36:57,779 --> 00:36:59,220
Stop wasting time. Hurry up.

656
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:19,660
Hurry up.

657
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:24,260
How about some words
of encouragement, coach?

658
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,099
Do you think encouragement

659
00:37:27,299 --> 00:37:28,740
will help your results?

660
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,180
Come on. Hurry up.

661
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:31,299
Make haste.

662
00:37:48,379 --> 00:37:50,500
What an eventful day.

663
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,539
Cai Jinye passed her trial.

664
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,139
And it'll be all over for you.

665
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:56,220
Bye.

666
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,099
Coach.

667
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:00,660
Give me a few chances, please.

668
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:02,500
You want chances now?

669
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,900
What were you doing earlier on?

670
00:38:04,379 --> 00:38:05,819
It's too late.

671
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,260
Tell me.

672
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,700
Where you want to hold

673
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:10,299
a farewell party.

674
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,700
Don't be shy. Tell me.

675
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,260
Coach.

676
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:17,660
According to the rules,

677
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:19,420
the assessment by the end of a month

678
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,180
is automatically merged

679
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:22,660
for the semester assessment of the year.

680
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,819
So Han Ruofei still has time to train.

681
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,460
Miss Cai Jinye, what's the matter?

682
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:33,020
Are you reluctant to part
with your stupid student?

683
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:35,220
No, coach.

684
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:38,020
You've taught us

685
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,020
that rules are rules.

686
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,220
Everyone must adhere to the rules.

687
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,539
No one is an exception.

688
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,660
Exactly.

689
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,660
The rules...

690
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,579
Have water, please, coach.

691
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,139
It's a little hot.

692
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,500
How is it?

693
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,420
Fine.

694
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,660
This is for your sake.

695
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,260
Mr. Han.

696
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,379
You get to stay for now.

697
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:23,379
You won't be so lucky

698
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:24,579
at the final trial.

699
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,139
I happen to need

700
00:39:26,819 --> 00:39:27,900
a sweeper.

701
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:31,779
Thanks, coach!

702
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,339
Thanks, coach.

703
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:39,619
Thanks, little master, for helping me.

704
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:42,139
I wasn't helping you.

705
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,059
I was just following the rules.

706
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:48,420
You didn't even bring

707
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,779
your bow sight for the assessment.

708
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:54,900
I lent it to someone else.

709
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,059
What?

710
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:00,859
The competition equipment

711
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:02,940
is your closest companion.

712
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:05,020
Would you lend it to others?

713
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:06,779
Seriously.

714
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,539
Hang on.

715
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:10,099
What do you mean?

716
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:11,539
Didn't I...

717
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,660
Okay, fine.

718
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:13,539
Save it.

719
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:17,539
It's my fault, too.

720
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:20,740
I've been too busy

721
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,579
to guide you.

722
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:26,779
Rest assured

723
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,500
you'll pass the assessment

724
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,460
under my guidance.

725
00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:34,260
So?

726
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,059
So

727
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:40,020
you need a new training plan.

728
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,940
That's all?

729
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,900
She should at least officially thank me

730
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:49,220
by treating me to a meal.

731
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:52,339
Maybe she's shy.

732
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:54,059
If I treat her to a meal,

733
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,819
she'll surely thank me.

734
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,740
Then it'll seem natural.

735
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,139
Your EQ is simply perfect,

736
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,139
Han Ruofei.

737
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,020
Madam,

738
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,099
please don't serve this yet.

739
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,020
I'll give you a signal

740
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,180
when it's ready to be served.

741
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,660
I'm very busy.

742
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,099
Wait, wait.

743
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:24,539
How about this.

744
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:26,859
I can actually pay you for that.

745
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:30,180
Young people nowadays are dramatic.

746
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,139
It's so troublesome.

747
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,059
Thanks a lot.

748
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,579
You're here.

749
00:41:43,779 --> 00:41:44,500
Come here

750
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,700
and sit down.

751
00:41:48,779 --> 00:41:50,220
Master, listen.

752
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,339
I'm treating you to Western food today.

753
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,660
Western food?

754
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,339
Han Ruofei.

755
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:57,819
Are you out of your mind?

756
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,099
This is a cafeteria.

757
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:01,859
You have no idea, right?

758
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:03,579
I'll show you what swag is.

759
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:05,900
Waiter!

760
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:10,059
Waiter!

761
00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:13,139
Madam!

762
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,740
I'm getting off from work.

763
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,940
Stop calling me if it's not important.

764
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:25,099
She's in a rush.

765
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:28,339
How's that?

766
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,940
Aren't you surprised?

767
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:31,539
This is fusion food.

768
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,619
I'm not surprised.

769
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:36,460
I am scared, actually.

770
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:37,940
Can you tell me

771
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,460
why you asked me to come here?

772
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,260
(Come on. Stop pretending.)

773
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:51,099
Can't I just treat you to a meal?

774
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,660
Yes, but you have to

775
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,299
tell me what all this is about.

776
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,859
Be patient, Master.

777
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,139
Let's enjoy our meal

778
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,579
as we talk.

779
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:11,700
Let's have

780
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,379
apple juice instead of wine.

781
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,020
What's so special about having steak?

782
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:17,539
You have no idea.

783
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:19,099
It's all about the ambience.

784
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,500
Come on.

785
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,020
I don't buy that.

786
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,339
Aren't you being too nice today?

787
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:32,460
I'm not as nice as the time
I gave you the gift.

788
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,139
Yezi, you guys are here, too.

789
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,579
You're even eating...

790
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,500
Jiang Yanjun.

791
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,260
Why are you everywhere?

792
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,420
What are you doing here
instead of pracitising?

793
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:49,180
Yanjun.

794
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,700
Han Ruofei is bad with words.

795
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,900
Forgive him.

796
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:52,660
It's okay.

797
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:54,059
I'm bad with words?

798
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,220
I'm trained, okay?

799
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,859
Enough.

800
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:59,900
Congratulations

801
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:01,020
for qualifying for
the competition, Yezi.

802
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,940
It's all thanks to you.

803
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:03,859
Hang on.

804
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,900
Aren't you supposed

805
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,460
to thank me for that?

806
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:10,420
What?

807
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,579
I wouldn't have passed

808
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:15,420
if it wasn't for his bow sight.

809
00:44:17,299 --> 00:44:18,940
I would do anything to help Yezi

810
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,460
as long as she could pass it.

811
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:24,460
Wait.

812
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:27,379
Jiang Yanjun.

813
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,339
Why have you been in our way every time?

814
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,740
Knock it off. Han Ruofei.

815
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:37,539
What are you talking about?

816
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:40,779
You've been acting weird today.

817
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:43,220
Fine, Cai Jinye.

818
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,980
Keep pretending.

819
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:47,900
You're more suited for
the showbiz than I am.

820
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,660
Have a nice dinner time.

821
00:44:50,379 --> 00:44:51,180
You...

822
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,460
