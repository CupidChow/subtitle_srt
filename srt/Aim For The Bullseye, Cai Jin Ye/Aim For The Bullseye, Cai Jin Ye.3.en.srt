Yezi,

30
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,220
you seem a bit strange lately.

31
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,340
Yezi, effervescent tablets again?

32
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:31,860
Yezi has been

33
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,819
obsessed with effervescent
tablets lately.

34
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,819
Is there any magical support

35
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:38,900
after eating the effervescent tablets?

36
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,379
Maybe it's the support of love.

37
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,620
Which cute boy gave you?

38
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,420
No such thing.

39
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:51,260
I get them through Dr. Xu.

40
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:54,620
Don't gossip about it.

41
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,539
Dr. Xu is handsome and kind.

42
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:02,819
Many girls in our university like him.

43
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:03,939
Excuse me.

44
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,459
Ruofei is more handsome than Dr. Xu.

45
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,099
Dr. Xu only knows about Vitamin C

46
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,620
and asks us to drink more hot water.

47
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,220
He is just a straight guy.

48
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,900
No!

49
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,700
I think Dr. Xu is quite good.

50
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:20,459
However, it seems

51
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,179
Ziwen's words are right.

52
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:23,500
Anyway, Yezi,

53
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,299
do you notice anything special about Han Ruofei

54
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,459
when you're with him?

55
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,140
I'd like to know.

56
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,659
No.

57
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,220
His physical fitness

58
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,659
is extremely bad.

59
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,260
I don't understand

60
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:40,099
why he wants to

61
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,780
be a sportsman.

62
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:44,819
Really?

63
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,980
He's too weak.

64
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,420
An idol is not suitable
to be a sportsman.

65
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,500
He is here for hardship

66
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,620
and training.

67
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,220
It's inspirational!

68
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:00,860
I like it!

69
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,379
Sit down.

70
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,700
She's indeed biased.

71
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,220
What else?

72
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:07,700
Nothing.

73
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,379
Yezi, please tell me more about him.

74
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:14,700
No! I'll pass!

75
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,859
Then I'll take away
the effervescent tablets!

76
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,220
Are you going to tell me now?

77
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,380

78

Why are we wearing masks?

103

a sense of crime.

I'll try hard to win a new trophy.

174
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:29,699
Okay.

175
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:35,619
Guide Han Ruofei in his training.

176
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,780
Make sure he can hold the bow!

177
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:40,740
All right, coach.

178
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,420
Move.

179
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:44,660
At least train for five hours daily!

180
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,340
Hurry up!

181
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:46,860
Run!

182
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,019
I'm so mad.

183
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,540
(It's archery.)

184
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,540
(However, bows are not allowed.)

185
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:18,459
(I have to practise this the whole day.)

186
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,540
What are you doing?

187
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:24,459
Keep training.

188
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:25,980
Come on.

189
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,059
Please!

190
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:28,660
I'm so tired.

191
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,740
Please don't torture me.

192
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,619
Let's give in to each other.

193
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,579
Turn a blind eye, okay?

194
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,379
I'll

195
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:41,459
extend it for another ten minutes

196
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,980
if you say one more word.

197
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,379
All right, I'll continue.

198
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,059
You still have half an hour.

199
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,300
Keep training.

200
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:12,059
Where is my tumbler?

201
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:12,939
It's here.

202
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,619
The water for youth and friendship.

203
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,379
May you become prettier.

204
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:28,699
It's nothing.

205
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:29,819
You don't need to thank me

206
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,860
for this small matter.

207
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:31,740
However,

208
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:33,699
can you reduce the amount of training

209
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,740
for my sake?

210
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,180
Don't flatter yourself.

211
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:43,660
I'm going to clean up.

212
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,819
Keep training.

213
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:47,740
That's it?

214
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,540
She is ruthless.

215
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,540
I'll get the goods on her.

216
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,900
Aren't you obsessed?

217
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,819
What's your horoscope? Virgo?

218
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,540
Why are you here?

219
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,860
Is time up?

220
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:38,019
It passed a long time ago.

221
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,180
When will you

222
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,139
officially start my archery training?

223
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,379
I'm bored of physical training.

224
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,980
Archery training?

225
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,499
You're trying to reach

226
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:50,660
beyond your grasp.

227
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,499
You can't even hold the bow

228
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,379
with your fitness.

229
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,059
What's wrong with my fitness?

230
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:58,499
How do you know without trying?

231
00:12:58,619 --> 00:12:59,819
I must have archery training today.

232
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:01,740
All right.

233
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,100
I would love to see you learn.

234
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,619
Where's my bow?

235
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,259
Your bow?

236
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,819
Are you asking me for your bow?

237
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:20,259
There are training bows
in the equipment room.

238
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,660
You can get one on your own.

239
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:22,699
How dumb.

240
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:29,220
Your bow looks good.

241
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:30,740
Can you lend it to me?

242
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,540
Why should I lend it to you?

243
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:35,860
You're my Little Master.

244
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,780
Don't touch it!

245
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:39,819
Why?

246
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:42,459
Isn't it just a bow?

247
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,860
You will use this.

248
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,259
This is my spare bow.

249
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,259
Make a record for your bow

250
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:52,980
in the equipment room later.

251
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:54,420
What is it for?

252
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,619
I'll just use this.

253
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,420
You're so impolite.

254
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,259
This is an extremely great bow.

255
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,939
Do you want to train or not?

256
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,619
You stare at it for a long time.

257
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:39,340
Of course I do.

258
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:41,740
First,

259
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:45,220
use the first knuckle of your index,

260
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,740
middle and ring finger to pull.

261
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:53,100
Thumb close to the pulp
of the index finger.

262
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,379
The arrow is

263
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,340
on the left side of the bow.

264
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,499
Just like this.

265
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,139
Grassland militia!

266
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:04,660
I...

267
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,059
Hold it vertically.

268
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:09,340
Hold it vertically?

269
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,259
Isn't it cool to hold it horizontally?

270
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,100
You must hold it vertically!

271
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:18,540
All right.

272
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,340
I'm not angry.

273
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,540
Wait!

274
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,300
I told you to use

275
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:40,579
the first knuckle of your finger.

276
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:43,459
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

277
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,139
Who wants to take advantage on you?

278
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:50,420
Cut the nonsense.

279
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:51,259
Got it?

280
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:52,900
Of course.

281
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:54,379
I'm a clever learner.

282
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,900
Pull the bow.

283
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,340
The bow center is parallel to your view,

284
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,740
understand?

285
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:10,379
Where's the arrow?

286
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:15,540
Maybe it sneaks out.

287
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,699
Again.

288
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,459
You can't even pull a 36-pound bow.

289
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,900
How to train?

290
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,780
What a joke.

291
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,540
I would've shocked you
if I was too good.

292
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,459
Again.

293
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,499
I want to prove myself!

294
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,100
My hand broke.

295
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,499
It's just hit by the bowstring.

296
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:09,979
It's a small matter. Let me tell you,

297
00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:12,979
it's a common incident for all archers.

298
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,099
You're not the one who got hurt!

299
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
I don't care. Bring me to the infirmary.

300
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,019
Go by yourself.

301
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,540
You know the way there.

302
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
Why?

303
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,019
You have to accompany me.

304
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,820
You're not a kid.

305
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,739
Go by yourself.

306
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:32,460
I am your student.

307
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,300
You must be responsible when I get hurt.

308
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:35,339
Wait!

309
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,979
Be careful with your words.

310
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,820
Who should be responsible for you?

311
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,540
Didn't the coach hand me to you?

312
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:47,060
Am I your student?

313
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:48,820
You...

314
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:52,660
(Very well.)

315
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:54,979
(I can meet Dr. Xu.)

316
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:58,420
Why are you laughing?

317
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,060
You're still laughing when I get hurt.

318
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,619
All right.

319
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:06,460
Since you're still new,

320
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,460
I'll go with you.

321
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:21,580
Why can't you wait for me?

322
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,019
Is this how you treat the wounded?

323
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:25,660
Should I get a wheelchair for you?

324
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:26,780
Okay.

325
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,940
A gentleman never fights with women.

326
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,580
Can't you come and help me?

327
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,739
You hurt your hand, not your leg.

328
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,420
- You're affectation.
- Okay,

329
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:35,900
you said that.

330
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,540
Help!

331
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,139
Everyone, look!

332
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,060
Cai Jinye, the captain of archery
team, abuses her member.

333
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,940
Sir, stay here

334
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,979
and listen to me.

335
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:50,300
Cai Jinye, the captain of archery team,

336
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,660
doesn't care about her member's life.

337
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,219
Look, I'm hurt

338
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:57,339
yet she's not taking me to a doctor.

339
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,979
Han Ruofei, what are you doing?

340
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,099
Look, she's here!

341
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:04,339
The captain of archery team, Cai Jinye.

342
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:06,540
She is ruthless for abusing her member.

343
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,379
She didn't even let me have a meal.

344
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:10,660
My hand hurts.

345
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,420
Nobody cares.

346
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,300
Get up.

347
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:15,540
It's so embarrassing.

348
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,660
Get up.

349
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:17,700
Okay. It's fine.

350
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,460
Let's go.

351
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,139
It's a misunderstanding.

352
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:20,099
- Sorry.
- I'm acting.

353
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:22,700
Why didn't you do it earlier?

354
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,379
Is this how you always deal with men?

355
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:29,979
I know.

356
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:31,979
You don't have many men around you.

357
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:40,300
Even if

358
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,540
I just joined showbiz,

359
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,180
I know many handsome men.

360
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,460
Let's have a deal.

361
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,979
I'll introduce a handsome man to you.

362
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,420
I'm not interested.

363
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:52,180
Are you not interested

364
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,420
or do you think you don't deserve one?

365
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,060
You...

366
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,379
Shut up!

367
00:19:57,139 --> 00:19:57,979
Look.

368
00:19:58,339 --> 00:19:59,859
A woman is always angry

369
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,379
when her secret is figured out.

370
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:05,700
It hurts.

371
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,739
Forget it.

372
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:13,619
She's ruthless.

373
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,060
Hurry up!

374
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:42,660
Where are you going?

375
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,460
Dr. Xu is in a consultation.

376
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,339
Sit down and wait.

377
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:50,300
Okay.

378
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,139
What are you doing?

379
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:08,339
A selfie? You're narcissistic.

380
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,420
I'm not taking a selfie.

381
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:12,660
I'm

382
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:14,739
fixing my hair.

383
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:18,099
Fixing your hair?

384
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,780
Who are you meeting?

385
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:21,339
I...

386
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,580
There's something fishy behind this.

387
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:26,859
I...

388
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,139
Dr. Xu,

389
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:31,580
thank you so much.

390
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,219
Don't worry. You'll get well soon.

391
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,060
I feel

392
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:37,660
I recover faster

393
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,219
whenever I meet you.

394
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:41,019
Go back and rest well.

395
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,219
Okay. I'm leaving.

396
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:43,820
Okay.

397
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:46,540
Bye. Be safe.

398
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,780
Cai,

399
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:57,259
why are you here?

400
00:21:58,139 --> 00:21:59,099
Dr. Xu.

401
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:00,660
Is it your old injury?

402
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:02,540
No.

403
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,660
After I used the method

404
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,859
you recommended,

405
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:08,460
it won't hurt even on a rainy day.

406
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:10,019
Today,

407
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,139
I'm here for his hand injury.

408
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:14,540
We meet again.

409
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,499
Yes.

410
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:20,300
It's terrible to get hurt so often.

411
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,259
Watch your training intensity.

412
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:23,619
You should tell her.

413
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:24,660
She's my master.

414
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,780
Nobody can handle the intense training.

415
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,339
Cai,

416
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:30,979
don't be too harsh on the new student.

417
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,940
I didn't.

418
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,499
It's an accident.

419
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:36,859
Okay.

420
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:39,139
Please follow me to the office.

421
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:41,619
Let's go.

422
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,060
Hurry up!

423
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,099
She's good at acting.

424
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:54,780
She should've joined the showbiz.

425
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,019
(So this is the kind of man)

426

(when he's working seriously.)

430

Even if it's swollen,

431
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:28,180
it'll recover soon

432
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,180
after you use the medicine.

433
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,019
Okay.

434
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:36,099
Dr. Xu, is that all?

435
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:40,300
It seems badly hurt.

436
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:43,300
Can you check it again?

437
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,859
Why?

438
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:47,379
It's just a small matter. Let's go.

439

Han,

440
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:54,739
is it your foot hurt again?

441
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,700
No, I'm good.

442
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:02,540
I'm fine.

443
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,739
It's good to hear that.

444
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:05,019
Oh. Cai,

445
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,139
you need to

446
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:08,300
make his training less intense.

447
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,499
(He wasn't so gentle)

448

Cai.

453
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,540
Do you hear him?

454
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,700
He said you needed to make
my training less intense.

455
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:38,700
What's wrong?

456
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:40,780
Is the training tiring today?

457
00:24:41,219 --> 00:24:42,420
No.

458
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:44,700
I'm just wondering

459
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:47,499
if you are tired

460
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,180
after meeting so many patients every day.

461
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:50,099
No.

462
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,339
It's pleasant

463
00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:54,219
to deal with all of the kids.

464
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,099
What are you doing?

465
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,019
Nothing. I'm looking at the view.

466
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,139
An interesting view.

467
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:08,420
You two are cute.

468
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,060
Have you been friends for a long time?

469
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,099
- No.
- No.

By the way,

we run out of the prescribed
spray medicine.

You'll need to buy it at the pharmacy.

I have prepared an order for you.

Also, be careful with your wrist

during the training.

482
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:48,540
You should protect yourself

as a girl.

484
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,379

Isn't it just a flower?

493

I can buy a bouquet for you.

494

I don't want yours. Return it to me!

I don't what are you saying.

00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,420
This is the proof.

514
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,660
Delete it!

515
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,060
Why should I?

516
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,940
I want to make more copies.

517
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,259
A photo

518
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:34,979
can't prove anything.

519
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:36,739
It's okay.

520
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,379
Everyone will see it tomorrow.

521
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,139
What do you want?

522
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:43,820
Nothing.

523
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,660
It depends on my mood.

524
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,460
How can you be in a good mood?

525
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:49,499
It's easy.

526
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:51,379
Accompany me to the pharmacy

527
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,540
after I get changed at the dorm.

528
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,660
It hurts.

529
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:36,900
Don't touch me!

530
00:28:37,979 --> 00:28:39,060
What are you doing?

531
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:41,139
Your leg hair is so long.

532
00:28:50,739 --> 00:28:51,499
Jiahao.

533
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:56,259
I bought you snacks.

534
00:28:56,379 --> 00:28:57,580
Come on. Hurry up.

535
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:00,859
So much?

536
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:02,460
Are you secretly in love with me?

537
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:04,300
Nice try.

538
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:09,300
I'm here to seek your help.

539
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,859
Can you

540
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:14,619
ask my idol to have dinner with me?

541
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:16,940
You directly

542
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:18,940
expressed your true intent.

543
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,300
Why not?

544
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:22,300
Do you think

545
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,900
I'm interested in you?

546
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,219
You... What are you doing?

547
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,300
Why?

548
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,580
Are you shocked by my handsome swimsuit?

549
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,820
Are you a psycho?

550
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:40,019
You didn't have a big reaction

551
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:41,219
when you passed by

552
00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:42,700
during our training.

553
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:44,300
It's not the same.

554
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:46,139
It was a group of people at that time.

555
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:48,259
A group of people?

556
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,820
There's no difference now.

557
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:53,180
Hurry up and get your clothes on.

558
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:55,019
Are you sure

559
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,859
you should dress this way
when we're alone?

560
00:29:58,019 --> 00:29:58,979
What a shame.

561
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,499
I advise you

562
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,580
to treat me nicer.

563
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,420
Then I'll fulfill

564
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:07,700
your request.

565
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,460
Are you threatening me?

566
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,979
Am I threatening you?

567
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:16,540
I'm his assistant now.

568
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,580
I like this.

569
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,859
Buy more next time.

570
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:26,379
Okay.

571
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:27,700
Eat more

572
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,339
and choke.

573
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:31,900
You're fierce.

574
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:34,420
Someone would be unlucky
to be your boyfriend.

575
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:35,780
He'll be extremely unlucky.

576
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,700
It hurts.

577
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:50,540
Why am I so unlucky?

578
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,700
Something feels wrong.

579
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,180
It's strange.

580
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,739
Does your watch have diamonds?

581
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,219
Why do you keep looking at it?

582
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:23,859
You're still talking nonsense even
after I bought medicine with you.

583
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:34,859
Should I frame

my medical record and send you?

585

586
00:31:40,219 --> 00:31:40,859
Why?

587
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,339
Aren't you into Dr. Xu?

You...

589

Who says?

590
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:50,739
It's hard to hide it
when you like someone.

591
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,619
Whatever.

592
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,420
We can attend the free practice

593
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,780
after we go back.

594
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,139
Free practice?

595
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,420
My hand is hurt.

596
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,180
No, I can't attend it.

597
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:05,820
It's okay, I have make arrangements.
