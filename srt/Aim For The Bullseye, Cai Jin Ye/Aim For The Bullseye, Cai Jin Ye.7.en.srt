Don't worry.

00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:46,600
I'm fine.

30
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:48,401
I'll just be admitted for several days.

31
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:50,640
What did the doctor say?

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,201
It's the same old problem.

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,600
I didn't want to come to hospital.

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,560
Your Aunt Chen insisted on asking me
to stay and rest for several days.

35
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:59,041
Dad, I'll go to the hospital
to keep you company later.

36
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,201
It's not necessary.

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,801
Your Aunt Chen

38
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,801
has to take care of me

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,041
and the noodle shop in the same time.

40
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:06,161
Why are you still thinking of
the noodle shop when you're unwell?

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,201
Our noodle shop can't close down.

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,440
That's all for now.

43
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:10,960
The doctor is starting his rounds.
I'm hanging up.

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,960
Get some rest.

45
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,121
Hello?

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,281
What?

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,281
You gave Ziwen the bow sight?

48
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:36,841
Yes.

49
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,680
Was Cai Jinye already using it?

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,401
Why do you get all worked up?

51
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,680
What do you mean
she's already using one?

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,761
The bow sight she used was not mine.

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,960
No way.

54
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:49,800
Didn't Cai Jinye treat you to a meal

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,001
to show her appreciation?

56
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:53,960
Appreciation?

57
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,960
This was an important thing.
You couldn't even get it done.

58
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:58,680
Was it that important?

59
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,481
You two already went on a date.

60
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,121
Why do you care about the bow sight?

61
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,761
I'm really mad.

62
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,080
I must confirm it right now.

63
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,160
Now?

64
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,761
Ruofei, it's nearly lights out.

65
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:18,401
Quit stalling, let's go!

66
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,520
Yezi,

67
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:34,401
are you sure you want to
withdraw from the contest?

68
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:39,600
This is your hard-won opportunity.

69
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:45,041
However,

70
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,041
Aunt Chen is the only one left

71
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,761
to take care of
my family's noodle shop now.

72
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:53,960
Someone must deliver food to my dad.

73
00:03:57,481 --> 00:04:00,041
It's all right. We understand you.

74
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:02,600
Between your family and contest,

75
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,281
I think your family is more important.

76
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,281
Thank you.

77
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,481
I will not participate in the contest.

78
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,720
You must bring honor to our school,

79
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,921
especially you, Ziwen,

80
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,801
little foodie.

81
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,801
Since Yezi has said this,

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
then I must work hard.

83
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,201
However,

84
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:32,481
if you don't participate in the contest,

85
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:35,400
it'll be a waste of my idol's effort
to break into Female Dorm at night

86
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:37,120
to give you the bow sight.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,720
Han Ruofei gave me a bow sight?

88
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:42,840
Yes.

89
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:45,361
It was in the bag that I put

90
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:46,840
on your bed last time.

91
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,241
However, I opened the bag.

92
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,681
There were only snacks in it.

93
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,921
Shouldn't you thank me

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,521
for helping you to advance
to the next round?

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,560
Thank you?

96
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,681
Thanks to Yanjun's bow sight,

97
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:05,840
I got to make it

98
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:07,361
to the next round.

99
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,641
(No wonder he said I should thank him.)

100
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,400
(It seems I've misunderstood him.)

101
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:21,000
It's my fault.

102
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:23,361
I mixed up the bags
that Ruofei gave you.

103
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
His effort is wasted.

104
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,280
Stop blaming yourself.

105
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:30,320
Maybe Han Ruofei wanted
to take this chance

106
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,521
to please Yezi.

107
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:34,160
After all, Yezi is his master.

108
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,440
However, I think

109
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:37,560
Han Ruofei cares a lot about Yezi.

110
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,400
I don't think he's only
trying to please her.

111
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:41,720
If he was still popular,

112
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,921
this matter might have
gotten on Hot Search.

113
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,801
Our Yezi might have become famous.

114
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,160
You become energetic as soon as you see

115
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,400
Han Ruofei.

116
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:53,761
Of course.

117
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,840
You don't understand the fun
of being a fangirl.

118
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,481
Let's just continue to
drink and eat meat.

119
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,320
You won't understand.

120
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:05,041
You girls are far behind the times.

121
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Yuling,

122
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,041
Ziwen looks down on us.

123
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:13,400
Let her be.

124
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:20,641
I've got a good idea.

125
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,880
Let's go to the balcony
and feel the breeze.

126
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,961
Let the wind blow away Yezi's sadness.

127
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,120
I'm all for it.

128
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:30,761
Lin Ziwen, why didn't you
answer the phone?

129
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:33,681
I seem to hear
someone calling for Ziwen.

130
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,320
Lin Ziwen!

131
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,921
Who is it?

132
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,481
Why don't we go out and take a look?

133
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,400
Lin Ziwen!

134
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:41,961
It's late. What's going on?

135
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:42,681
Let's go.

136
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:44,481
Lin Ziwen, come out!

137
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:47,280
We're toast.

138
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,000
Who is it?

139
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:49,400
Who's there?

140
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:50,641
Run.

141
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,361
Stop right there!

142
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,761
Stop!

143
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,320
Li Jiahao, you are a lousy teammate.

144
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,720
Stop right there!

145
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,041
Stop!

146
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
I'm so happy.

147
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,241
Cai Jinye, you can do it!

148
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,961
- You got it!
- I got it!

149
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,201
Nonsense!

150
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,160
How dare you simply give up!

151
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,361
Have you asked me about it?

152
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,961
What is wrong with you?

153
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,840
Sorry, coach.

154
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,720
My father falls sick and gets admitted.

155
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,560
No one is managing the shop.

156
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,361
I'm worried about him.

157
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,081
When did this happen?

158
00:07:44,201 --> 00:07:45,440
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

159
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:48,641
It happened a few days ago.

160
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:56,120
Fine.

161
00:07:56,921 --> 00:07:57,840
Just this once.

162
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,361
Sorry, coach.

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,921
Right.

164
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,761
Go back and take care of your family.

165
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,000
Your family is more important
than your result.

166
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:13,000
If you need help,

167
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,440

She doesn't even reply to me.

What's different about her?

There's no air-conditioner here,

334
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,241
but it's not that warm.

335
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,921
Boss.

336
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:20,321
Coming.

337
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,121
Han Jiangshuo.

338
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:26,921
Sir,

339
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:29,041
are you Han Jiangshuo?

340
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:31,001
I'm not.

341
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,600
Do you like him a lot?

342
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,600
Yes, he's good at singing.

343
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,241
Is he?

344
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,720
Here, little girl.

345
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:39,840
You can have this candy.

346
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:42,361
Thank you.

347
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,001
You're welcome. Have a seat.

348
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:55,200
Dad, look.

349
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:57,001
He gave me a lollipop.

350
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:58,001
Great.

351
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,121
You can eat it after having the meal.

352
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:01,600
Coming up next is the final
of men's 200m freestyle.

353
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,600
The two top contenders of this final

354
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,841
are Fan Te, the former champion,

355
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:08,120
and Jiang Yanjun, who just won

356
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:09,041
a foreign championship.

357
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,520
The competition between them

358
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,760
is the highlight of this game.

359
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,441
Okay, now we have

360
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,601
Jiang Yanjun at Track 9,

361
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:18,480
Li Jiahao at Track 8,

362
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,041
Jiahao.

363
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,081
- Please succeed.
- Fan Te

364
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,081
at Track 7,

365
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:26,480
Li Xiaofei at Track 6

366
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:28,240
and Zhang Long at Track 5.

367
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:31,240
Okay, the contest is about to start.

368
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:33,640
Go get it!

369
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,880
You go, boys!

370
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,921
You got this!

371
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,240
Ready.

372
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,321
Someone made a false start.
The game is halted.

373
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:49,360
- You go, boys!
- Go get it!

374
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,961
While facing such an important race,

375
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,760
it's inevitable for the contestants
to feel nervous.

376
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:56,400
I hope that the athletes could
adjust their mindsets

377
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,961
and present a wonderful
match for the viewers.

378
00:17:59,081 --> 00:18:01,120
Fan Te, you're the best!

379
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,801
Girls,

380
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:02,921
we must show them Nanhu team's momentum.

381
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:03,601
Start.

382
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:07,280
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

383
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,880
Jiang Yanjun must win!

384
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,721
Fan Te, if you win,

385
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:34,400
I'll be your girlfriend!

386
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:37,120
Why isn't anybody cheering me on?

387
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,441
Seriously? Come on.

388
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,360
You deserve a beating.

389
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:43,640
Jiang Yanjun, if you win,

390
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:45,961
I'll marry you!

391
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:51,961
What are you doing here?

392
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:52,841
The contest is in progress.

393
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:53,561
Just leave.

394
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,480
Go.

395
00:18:57,441 --> 00:18:59,000
On your marks.

396
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,841
Okay, play resumes.

397
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Fan Te at Track 7
is in a good condition.

398
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,760
Go get it, Yanjun!

399
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,801
Go, Team Fan Te!

400
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,400
Team Nanhu must win!

401
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:17,201
You got it!

402
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,240
Jiang Yanjun at Track 9
starts to accelerate.

403
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,160
He gradually shortens the distance.

404
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:23,760
Go get it!

405
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,201
Yanjun, you're the best!

406
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:26,120
You can do this!

407
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,120
Come on!

408
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:32,760
Nice.

409
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,240
Jiang Yanjun rapidly exceeds
Fan Te on his way back.

410
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,841
He's currently in the first place.

411
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,321
He continues to widen the gap.

412
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,441
Go get it!

413
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:45,441
Go!

414
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,921
You can do this!

415
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:50,961
Li Jiahao at Track 8

416
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:52,321
seems to have a situation.

417
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:53,441
Go get it!

418
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:55,681
Yanjun, you can do this!

419
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,240
Jiahao?

420
00:19:57,721 --> 00:19:59,360
Li Jiahao seems to
have a cramp in his leg.

421
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,841
This accident has affected Jiang Yanjun

422
00:20:01,841 --> 00:20:03,681
in the next track who's
about to reach the finishing line.

423
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,561
The staff will rescue Li Jiahao.

424
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:07,760
Please don't worry.

425
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:12,120
Jiang Yanjun who has reached the
finishing line turns back to help him.

426
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,961
It seems he's trying to rescue
Li Jiahao a step ahead of the staff.

427
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,120
The game is over.

428
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,201
We'll announce

429
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:27,681
the winner of this game later.

430
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,000
Look.

431
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:30,561
Well done.

432
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:32,081
It's too dangerous. Look.

433
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,480
Luckily, he's rescued.

434
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:34,601
Right. He's lucky.

435
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,360
I can't believe Fan Te is the winner.

436
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,841
We've lost the game.

437
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:41,041
No, we didn't lose.

438
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
Are you feeling better?

439
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:45,360
I'm feeling better.

440
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,160
The champion is

441
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,640
Fan Te from Team Nanhu.

442
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,961
We won!

443
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,760
Fan Te!

444
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:52,721
Yanjun,

445
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,961
I'm sorry.

446
00:20:54,081 --> 00:20:54,640
It's all right.

447
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
Fan Te!

448
00:20:56,841 --> 00:20:58,601
Between his teammate and honour,

449
00:20:58,601 --> 00:20:59,721
he chose his teammate.

450
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:02,480
This is so-called sportsmanship.

451
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,961
Jiang Yanjun is already the champion

452
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,480
in my heart.

453
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,400
Come on.

454
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:09,721
Well done!

455
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:10,601
Be careful.

456
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,280
Jiang Yanjun,

457
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:21,400
you're really something.

458
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:24,601
Nice one.

459
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:36,681
Jiahao!

460
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,240
Li Jiahao?

461
00:21:38,801 --> 00:21:39,721
Where are you?

462
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Don't come over.

463
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:43,721
I'm naked here.

464
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:45,681
What are you doing? Are you a pervert?

465
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,441
You're one to talk.

466
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:48,760
What are you doing in the changing room?

467
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,240
I'm changing my pants.

468
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:53,360
I heard that you nearly drowned

469
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,760
during the swimming competition.

470
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:56,160
So I came to visit you.

471
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:57,240
Are you all right?

472
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,120
Who's spreading the rumour?

473
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,321
I got a cramp in my leg, okay?

474
00:22:03,961 --> 00:22:05,841
You sound energetic.

475
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,201
I was worried about you.

476
00:22:07,321 --> 00:22:09,041
So I rushed here to see you.

477
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:11,721
I think

478
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,921
you're here to make fun of me.

479
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,360
Don't be so blunt.

480
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:20,640
I'm just concerned about my friend.

481
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,120
Did you go to the infirmary?

482
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,841
No.

483
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Why isn't anyone here?

484
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,201
Everyone is busy with the contest.

485
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,640
They have no time for me.

486
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:35,801
The school doctor went
to the athletic field.

487
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,400
You're so pathetic.

488
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:41,961
Yes, I'm pathetic.

489
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:43,201
So what if I am?

490
00:22:43,561 --> 00:22:45,640
That's why I'm here to see you.

491
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:46,561
Does your leg still hurt?

492
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:48,880
Do you want me to give you a massage?

493
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:50,841
I don't need that! You're annoying.

494
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,520
If you didn't help me to lose weight,

495
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,921
I wouldn't have cared about you.

496
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,000
(Ziwen,)

497
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,041
(thank you.)

498
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,160

(Closed today. Please
come again tomorrow.)

500
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:33,801
Han Ruofei, the noodles are ready.

00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:35,120
Coming.

502
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:38,520
You've worked hard today.

503
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,081
Just consider this a reward for you.

504
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,801
Sure.

505
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,801
What's wrong? Are the noodles hot?

506
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,000
No.

507
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:02,880
No?

508
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:04,681
Then, just hold it.

509
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,000
What are you waiting for?

510
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,000
Aren't you hungry?

511
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,841
I am.

512
00:24:38,921 --> 00:24:39,601
How is it?

513
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,240
Miss Cai, you're a good cook.

514
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,081
I was worried that it might taste bad.

515
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,480
Unexpectedly, you're
not only good at archery,

516
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:52,000
but also talented in cooking.

517
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:56,240
However, you must not be conceited.

518
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,041
Keep working hard.

519
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,120
Of course.

520
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:02,841
That's why I'm your master.

521
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,721
Eat slowly.

522
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:10,961
After the meal,

523
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,480
I'll go to the hospital to visit my dad.

524
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:13,921
Thanks for what you did today.

525
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,520
I would've become much busier
in the shop if you weren't here.

526
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,120
You're welcome.

527
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:20,880
I'll visit Mr. Cai with you later.

528
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,880
Nevermind.

529
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,201
Hurry back and check on Jiahao.

530
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,000
I saw that you kept texting him.

531
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:30,000
Besides, my dad will be
discharged soon. He's fine.

532
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:31,201
Okay.

533
00:25:36,841 --> 00:25:37,640
Li Jiahao.

534
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:40,160
Where are you?

535
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:42,601
you don't text me back
and you are not here.

536
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Jiahao, what's wrong?

537
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,201
It's embarrassing.

538
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:05,120
I might as well kill myself.

539
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,640
It was just a swimming competition.

540
00:26:14,321 --> 00:26:16,441
Ruofei, you know.

541
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,921
Jiahao.

542
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,801
Come out first, okay?

543
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:32,561
I'm fine with being alone.

544
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,961
Jiahao,

545
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,041
trust me.

546
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,360
Come out first.

547
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:45,880
Come on, give me your hand.

548
00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:58,721
Jiahao, listen to me.

549
00:26:59,081 --> 00:27:00,601
I've watched

550
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,721
the entire swimming competition.

551
00:27:02,841 --> 00:27:04,360
You did a great job.

552
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,240
Listen to me, Jiahao.

553
00:27:10,721 --> 00:27:12,601
It's not a big deal to lose a game.

554
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:14,561
Let's just win the next one.

555
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:16,160
Win the gold medal.

556
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:19,360
Our university could
have been the champion.

557
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,760
If it wasn't because of me,
Yanjun wouldn't have...

558
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:24,280
It's fine that I embarrassed myself.

559
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,360
However,
Yanjun lost the champion because of me.

560
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,760
No one will blame you
for losing this competition.

561
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:33,321
We lost the gold medal this time.

562
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,880
Let's just win it next time,

563
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:35,921
okay?

564
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,561
However, this incident makes me realise

565
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,801
that Jiang Yanjun is not that annoying.

566
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:44,961
Yanjun is a nice person.

567
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:47,640
I was embarrassed back then,

568
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,921
but today,

569
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,640
I'd never been this disgraced.

570
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,400
Jiahao, listen to me.

571
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:57,081
Pull yourself together, okay?

572
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,201
Enough, stop crying.

573
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,601
If you're doing a live stream again,

574
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:01,841
I'll be...

575
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,961
I'll be there with you,

576
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,841
okay?

577
00:28:05,841 --> 00:28:07,640
Can't you get over it, Jiahao?

578
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,961
Would you really do it?

579
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:12,280
Of course.

580
00:28:12,921 --> 00:28:14,280
I've always kept

581
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:15,480
my promises.

582
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:17,441
Why don't we go live now?

583
00:28:17,601 --> 00:28:18,280
Look.

584
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,240
This is the latest edition of this lamp.

585
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
We don't have to use
the beautifying filter anymore.

586
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,120
This microphone is impressive.

587
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,561
We can be the mic controller together.

588
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,921
One minute 54 seconds.

589
00:28:50,201 --> 00:28:51,280
One minute 55 seconds.

590
00:28:51,441 --> 00:28:52,561
One minute 56 seconds.

591
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,841
One minute 57 seconds.

592
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:55,201
One minute 58 seconds.

593
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,760
One minute 59 seconds.

594
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:57,841
Two minutes.

595
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,441
Two minutes and one second.

596
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:02,681
You're amazing, Yanjun!

597
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:03,841
Yanjun, you're impressive!

598
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,240
Great!

599
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,561
Awesome! Two minutes and one second.

600
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:08,841
How did you do this?

601
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,880
When I was studying abroad,

602
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:12,160
a senior taught me this.

603
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,681
I'll teach you when I have the time.

604
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,880
Yanjun, you're simply humble.

605
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:17,760
Yanjun.

606
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,601
Jiang Yanjun,

607
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:20,561
I want to marry you!

608
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:21,721
Jiahao, help me.

609
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,321
Yanjun!

610
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,760
Yanjun!

611
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,321
Where is my Yanjun?

612
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Miss Yu, what are you doing here?

613
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:33,280
Why do you care?

614
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,120
I'm here for my Brother Yanjun.

615
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:39,120
Brother Yanjun? It's gross.

616
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,760
What has it got to do with you?

617
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,520
When he becomes my boyfriend,

618
00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:44,160
I can call him what I like.

619
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,041
What are you looking at?

620
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,921
Dismiss.

621
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:51,520
Leave.

622
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,721
Li Jiahao, stop right there.

623
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:57,721
Come here.

624
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,360
I'm certain that I heard

625
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,480
you talking to Jiang Yanjun just now.

626
00:30:03,921 --> 00:30:04,561
Tell me.

627
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:06,280
Did you hide him away?

628
00:30:06,441 --> 00:30:08,561
How is it possible? How
could I possibly hide

629
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:09,801
anyone you're looking for?

630
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:11,321
Just now, Yanjun

631
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:12,640
went over there.

632
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:19,360
I don't know if you
would dare to do this,

633
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:20,480
anyway,

634
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,681
my intuition tells me

635
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,841
that you're lying to me.

636
00:30:25,081 --> 00:30:26,240
I swear

637
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,441
I, Li Jiahao, wouldn't
dare to lie to you.

638
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:29,360
Am I right?

639
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,160
Don't move.

640
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:37,201
I suddenly notice that you and Yanjun

641
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,441
look good together.

642
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:43,601
Really?

643
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,640
Yes.

644
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,280
Don't you know

645
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:49,640
I, Li Jiahao, am good at judging people?

646
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,760
I'll help you out with
the matter of Yanjun.

647
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:52,601
Go back first.

648
00:30:54,441 --> 00:30:55,760
However...

649
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,681
What is it?

650
00:30:57,681 --> 00:31:00,160
Yanjun said you're
the best-looking cheerleader.

651
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:03,240
Really?

652
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:05,120
Did he really say that?

653
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,160
Yes, you know what?

654
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:07,880
That day, Yanjun said

655
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:10,081
Yu Mengmeng was
the one who knew him best.

656
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:13,280
So I've got great taste.

657
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:20,961
Is Yanjun really not here?

658
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,321
Why would I lie to you?

659
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,201
Look at my sincere gaze.
Do I look like I'm lying?

660
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,360
Just go back first.

661
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,321
If you don't go back now,

662
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,880
Yanjun won't be able to get up anymore.

663
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:30,000
Fine then.

664
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:31,841
He won't be able to get up?

665
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:33,240
What's wrong with him?

666
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
I'm saying

667
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:37,561
