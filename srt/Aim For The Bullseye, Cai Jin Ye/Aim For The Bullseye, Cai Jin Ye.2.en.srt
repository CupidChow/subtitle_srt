27
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:43,179
Good morning, Miss Sheng.

28
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,300
Good morning.

29
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:09,299
Madam, what are you doing?

30
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,179
Why do you take it down?

31
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:17,019
I heard the company inked a contract
with a young boy last week.

32
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:20,019
He is so handsome.

33
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,700
Give it to me.

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,780
How handsome can he be?

35
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,060
Look carefully.

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,099
Is he as handsome as this guy?

37
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,060
Does the company want to replace

38
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:31,299
my portrait after having a new artist?

39
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,939
Aren't they getting rid
of me after using me?

40
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,019
You mustn't talk about
yourself like this.

41
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,579
You...

42
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,659
What are you doing?

43
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,220
Is there any problem with the portrait?

44
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,700
Miss Qiu.

45
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,700
I've been with the company
since my debut.

46
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:53,099
Isn't it disrespectful to
take my portrait down?

47
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,299
If the company does this to me,

48
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,980
I have no reason to stay.

49
00:02:58,659 --> 00:02:59,220
The company

50
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,579
has put in great effort to
stop the journalists

51
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,700
from reporting that farce.

52
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,019
You, however,

53
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,620
want to leave the company

54
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:07,539
and the mess behind.

55
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:08,780
Han Ruofei.

56
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:10,860
Are you taking the company as your home?

57
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,819
What do you want, Miss Qiu?

58
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,780
Go to University of Sports.

59
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,220
Continue to live up to
your sportsman character.

60
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,459
Didn't you ruin the last endorsement?

61
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:24,739
You'll go to University of Sports

62
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,780
and rebuild your image

63
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,819
as a sports student.

64
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:28,819
After that,

65
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,539
there might be hope for you

66
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,459
to return to the entertainment industry.

67
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:33,939
Go to University of Sports

68
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,659
and be a sports student?

69
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,459
Why?

70
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,579
Is there a problem?

71
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,019
Listen.

72
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,179
We've put in great effort

73
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:42,459
to fight for your chance.

74
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,220
You know what?

75
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,340
The company has arranged it.

76
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,140
Archery team at Jianghang
University of Sports.

77
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,939
You'll practise well over there.

78
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,099
Don't ruin it.

79
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,939
What's that place?

80
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:53,780
I won't go.

81
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:56,220
What did you say?

82
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:57,019
Excuse me.

83
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,939
Terminate the contract?

84
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,980
I'm so happy to think
of the liquidated damages.

85
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,700
Prepare a contract for the breach.

86
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:07,420
Han Jiangshuo wants
to terminate the contract.

87
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,739
50 million. I'm so happy.

88
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,780
Pay it.

89
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,179
No, Miss Qiu.

90
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,819
Don't get it wrong.

91
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,660
I like archery actually.

92
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,940
No problem. I'll go.

93
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,419
This is more like it.

94
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,540
Breaching the contract is nothing.

95
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,419
Think about it.

96
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,940
Will any company accept you
after you terminate the contract?

97
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:25,739
Am I right?

98
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:27,419
Miss Qiu, the truth is...

99
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,019
Let's not talk about the nonsense.

100
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,780
Seize the opportunity.

101
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,660
Here are the rules I need
to make clear to you.

102
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,620
Firstly,

103
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:36,220
you mustn't expose your identity.

104
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,820
You'll use your real name, Han Ruofei.

105
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,259
Secondly,

106
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,780
you mustn't have any scandal.

107
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,100
Thirdly,

108
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:45,900
you mustn't fall behind in your grades,

109
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:46,859
understand?

110
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:49,459
Miss Qiu.

111
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:51,100
Isn't the third rule too difficult?

112
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,900
Difficult?

113
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,780
I do think so.

114
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,259
The contract for the breach.

115
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,179
Han Jiangshuo's breach of contract.

116
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,340
No, Miss Qiu.

117
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,340
I can do it.

118
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,340
This is it.

119
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:02,500
Learn to be smart.

120
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,380
It's good for you, isn't it?

121
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,299
All right, I get it.

122
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,620
I have to go.

123
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:13,820
Wait.

124
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,820
Take it.

125
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,139
What's this, Miss Qiu?

126
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:26,699
Open it and have a check.

127
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,940
Thank you, Miss Qiu.

128
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:42,859
Why are you thanking me?
I simply prepared it.

129
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:45,699
By the way,

130
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,820
take care of yourself in the university.

131
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:50,100
I have to go.

132
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:16,019
Gather up.

133
00:06:17,859 --> 00:06:18,820
Hurry up!

134
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:19,780
Coming.

135
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,380
Stand still.

136
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,620
You should train hard

137
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,299
in this period of time.

138
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:32,739
University Sports Day

139
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,380
will begin soon.

140
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,780
The archery team of
Jianghang University of Sports

141
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,340
has always been the champion.

142
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,100
You mustn't fail.

143
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,459
There's no exception this time.

144
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:42,419
Do you understand?

145
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,979
Yes.

146
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,179
Are you still sleepy?

147
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:54,859
Coach. I slept well.

148
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:55,940
I have no problem at all.

149
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,820
I don't need additional hours of training.

150
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,820
You're smart enough.

151
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,179
Is there any other problem?

152
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:05,780
No.

153
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:08,139
Coach, I have another question.

154
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,900
It's you again.

155
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:10,940
What is it?

156
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,620
Yezi has been running on
the field the whole morning.

157
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:16,139
Could you let her take a break?

158
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,340
I agree.

159
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,500
The pervert got

160
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,259
to the archway the other day.

161
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,340
It caused Yezi to almost
hurt him by mistake.

162
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,620
Yezi shouldn't be blamed.

163
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:28,900
Coach.

164
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,299
Could you cancel her punishment?

165
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:32,500
Yes.

166
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,540
Who can withstand punishment every day?

167
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,100
You're very close.

168
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,500
Who's the coach? You or me?

169
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,179
If you carry on,

170
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:45,540
I'll let her run another half a day.

171
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:46,859
No.

172
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:48,019
I'm wrong, coach.

173
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,179
You know you're wrong.

174
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,579
This is the end of the training

175
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:55,340
in the morning.

176
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,139
Before dismissal,

177
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,060
I'll make one announcement.

178
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,380
We have a new student.

179
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,500
He'll join the archery team

180
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:05,979
as a refresher student.

181
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,739
Let's welcome him with
a round of applause.

182
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:15,419
Do it.

183
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:22,900
He makes a high profile.

184
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,459
He has yet to come out.

185
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:27,979
Here's the thing.

186
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:32,019
The new student may be a little shy.

187
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:33,900
Let's encourage him.

188
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,819
You're so enthusiastic.

189
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,420
You don't need to go so far.

190
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:49,699
I only came to deliver food.

191
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:53,619
Who's Han Jiangshuo's Pretty Wife?

192
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,059
Not bad.

193
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,379
You've gained courage.

194
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:04,180
How dare you get food delivery
to the training hall?

195
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,340
Pretty Wife?

196
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,619
Who ordered it?

197
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:12,780
Did you order it?

198
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,259
Have you made a mistake?

199
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,180
I always keep good discipline here.

200
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,900
No one would dare to order food delivery

201
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:23,860
during training.

202
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:24,980
It can't be.

203
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:27,379
I've delivered food to
this person for many times.

204
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,340
Wait. I'll make a call.

205
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,379
Are you choking?

206
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,139
A bit.

207
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,660
A bit?

208
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:54,420
So here's the Pretty Wife.

209
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:56,139
Tell everyone.

210
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:57,699
When did you get married?

211
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:00,139
Why didn't you let me
give you a red packet?

212
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,819
If you want to give it to me now,
it not too late.

213
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:08,340
Do you still want your food?

214
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,619
Send it to the coach's office.

215
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,459
Are you hungry?

216
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,660
Are you tired of training?

217
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,220
Coach.

218
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:28,980
I'm not tired.

219
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:30,900
Why did you order food then?

220
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,459
Have you passed the body fat test?

221
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:35,900
Don't forget,
I'm monitoring your weight.

222
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,139
If it stays out of control,

223
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:38,980
stop the training.

224
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,499
Do planking for half an hour.

225
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,740
Coach...

226
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:46,139
If you make excuses,

227
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:47,259
add another half an hour.

228
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,259
Go! Now!

229
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:51,939
Dismiss.

230
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,019
Thank you, coach.

231
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,259
Don't look at me.

232
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:00,100
I can't help you.

233
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,100
Let's go to eat.

234
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,259
No, Yuling.

235
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:04,780
No.

236
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,180
Hello, I've completed the procedure.

237
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,860
I don't get to eat after half a day.

238
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,220
I'm starving.

239
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,340
You must be tired after
running so many laps.

240
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,699
Eat more later.

241
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,660
Don't worry.

242
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:42,180
I'll register after lunch.

243
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:43,139
Do it slowly.

244
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:45,259
Okay.

245
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:46,740
Sit. Sit there.

246
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,939
You've had bad luck recently.

247
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,860
It's all because you
bumped into that pervert.

248
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,220
I feel so sorry for you.

249
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:02,819
Stop talking about that.

250
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:04,220
It's sickening.

251
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,780
Dig in.

252
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:06,819
I'm starving.

253
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,740
Does this guy lose his mind?

254
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,499
He's even wearing
sunglasses while eating.

255
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:26,540
It's very likely.

256
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,619
(Gosh! Why her again.)

257
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,939
What's wrong with you?

258
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:53,740
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

259
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:56,100
It's you.

260
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,340
You pervert.

261
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,059
Don't get it wrong.

262
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:04,819
It's definitely not me.

263
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,420
It's him. Listen to me.

264
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,300
It's him the other day.

265
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:10,780
He was naked...

266
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,619
Listen to me.

267
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:17,459
I'm going to join the archery team.

268
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,540
What did you say?

269
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,139
I've joined the archery team.

270
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,220
Are you serious?

271
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:27,259
Yes.

272
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,980
I even got the uniform.

273
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:29,860
See for yourself.

274
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,139
Gather up.

275
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,220
Stand still.

276
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:44,780
Let me introduce

277
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,019
the new member
who will join the archery team.

278
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:48,579
Han...

279
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,939
What's your full name?

280
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,019
Han Ruofei.

281
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,019
Han Ruofei.

282
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,740
Hi, I'm Han Ruofei.

283
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,340
Calm down. Calm down.

284
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:06,259
Stay calm.

285
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,139
What's the matter?

286
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,540
My idol.

287
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,980
Pinch me now. Am I dreaming?

288
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,420
Isn't he Han Ruofei?

289
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:20,660
He's not your idol, Han Jiangshuo.

290
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,740
It's him.

291
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,379
I would recognise him
even if he's turned into ashes.

292
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:26,220
Why are you saying that?

293
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:27,420
Did he rob you?

294
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:30,300
He's the best-looking person

295
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:31,420
in the world.

296
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:34,259
Come on. You're so biased.

297
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:35,619
You don't understand.

298
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:36,900
It's him anyway.

299
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:39,660
Yes, we don't understand.

300
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:41,540
Ziwen is right in everything.

301
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,740
Ziwen is right.

302
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:46,139
Thank you for making time

303
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:47,259
to entertain me.

304
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,379
Enough. Be quiet.

305
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,420
It's just an introduction
of a new member.

306
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,059
Look at you.
You can't stop talking about it.

307
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,420
Is your coach not handsome enough?

308
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:55,980
Is the training not intense enough?

309
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,180
You're the most handsome in the world.

310
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,540
What's the point of being handsome?

311
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,379
Can it help you to win a championship?

312
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,540
I'm very annoyed.

313
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,900
Go back to training.

314
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:08,860
Coach, we've just done it.

315
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,459
Why do we need to do it again?

316
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,059
Yes, coach.

317
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,660
I'll die if I continue to practise today.

318
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:17,740
You'll die if you don't practise now.

319
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,619
You make excuses.

320
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,300
Go back to training. Dismiss.

321
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:24,139
Yuling, he is looking at me.

322
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,459
Yezi, come on.

323
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:26,660
Ouch!

324
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,740
He is looking at me.

325
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,780
Cai Jinye

326
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,300
is the captain of our archery team .

327
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,340
She'll take charge of your basic training.

328
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,939
Yezi.

329
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,699
You should let the new student

330
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:45,540
experience the charm of archery.

331
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:49,059
-Understood, coach.
-Wait, coach.

332
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:51,740
There's no need to do so much for me.

333
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:54,100
There's a need.

334
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:55,579
Go ahead.

335
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:01,379
Are you fooling around?

336
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:02,499
You're hugging each other.

337
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,699
Go to training.

338
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:05,300
Coach, we'll practise right away.

339
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:06,540
Go.

340
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,059
Let me take another glance of him.

341
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,980
Move. Come on.

342
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,540
Just another glance.

343
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,619
I didn't lie to you.

344
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:16,420
I've really joined the archery team.

345
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,740
Oh.

346
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,059
What do you mean by that, Little Master?

347
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,259
Just call me "Master".

348
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:26,740
No need to add "little".

349
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:28,619
What's your name then?

350
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:31,220
I'm Cai Jinye.

351
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,259
Cai Jinye.

352
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,980
Which "Cai"? "Cai" for rookie?

353
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,499
Stop the nonsense.

354
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,819
I want to start telling you

355
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:41,499
the rules of the archery team.

356
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:43,980
Are you kidding me?

357
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,740
You start with the rules.

358
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,059
Can't you be friendlier
to a new student?

359
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,220
Sports is a serious matter.

360
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:57,740
Friendliness and following the rules
are two different things.

361
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:00,900
Go on then.

362
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:03,459
Rule number one.

363
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:07,619
Archery comes with sportsmanship.

364
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:09,619
I hope you can take it seriously.

365
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,099
What's next?

366
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:13,900
Since you've chosen archery,

367
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:15,700
don't give up halfway.

368
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,060
Carry on.

369
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,060
Also,

370
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:24,580
practise well when it's time to train.

371
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:26,339
Get your attitude right.

372
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,339
Don't be cheeky and impudent.

373
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,739
Otherwise,

374
00:17:31,979 --> 00:17:33,619
don't blame me for being unkind to you.

375
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:38,259
Little Master,
I see that you're quite fierce.

376
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:41,219
Start training then.

377
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:45,099
Wait.

378
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,780
Why do I feel like
you want to take revenge?

379
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,780
Wait for me.

380
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,339
Why did you bring me to the field?

381
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,820
Exercise.

382
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:00,139
I'm new to the archery team.

383
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:01,099
Shouldn't you teach me

384
00:18:01,219 --> 00:18:02,660
about bow and arrow?

385
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,219
At the beginning,

386
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:08,300
you should first be familiar
with basic exercise.

387
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,859
Basic exercise?

388
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,099
Running.

389
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:16,619
Why?

390
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:24,499
Are you ready?

391
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:25,979
Yes.

392
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,259
How many laps?

393
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:34,060
One.

394
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:35,820
It's a piece of cake.

395
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,979
Keep running.

396
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:40,619
Keep running?

397
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,739
Why are you spacing out?

398
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,180
On your mark, run.

399
00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:48,619
You're so mean.

400
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,300
One, two, three, four, five.

401
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:08,979
When do we have such a handsome man

402
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:10,420
in our university?

403
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,499
Right. Which sports is he in?

404
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,780
My heart is suddenly beating fast.

405
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:16,219
My goodness!

406
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,979
Isn't that my idol?

407
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:19,460
Captain, do you know him?

408
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,019
It's more than that.

409
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:22,940
His height, weight and gossips.

410
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,139
I know all of them by heart.

411
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:25,540
Tell us, captain.

412
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:26,060
We want to know.

413
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,180
-All right.
-Yes.

414
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,139
Why are you so curious?
Haven't you seen a man before?

415
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,460
Go back to practice.

416
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:37,019
Carry on.

417
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,700
Practise well.

418
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,979
(I want to thank my mother)

419
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,420
(for sending me to this university.)

420
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,580
(I get to see my idol.)

421
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,820
(I love this university.)

422
00:19:59,019 --> 00:19:59,859
(I love sports.)

423
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,540
(I love study.)

424
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,300
Ziwen. Ziwen.

425
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Ziwen, come on.

426
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,180
What are you doing

427
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,979
in broad daylight?

428
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,900
Has your team received a new student?

429
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:38,700
It's none of your business.

430
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:40,739
You ate a lot of my food last time,

431
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:41,979
but you didn't keep your promise.

432
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:43,660
How dare you ask for information.

433
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:46,379
Last time, it was an accident.

434
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,379
I'm here to apologise.

435
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,139
The latest night cream.

436
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:52,580
It works like a charm.

437
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:56,820
Apply it on your face
and that's love from my heart.

438
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,139
Is it for me?

439
00:20:58,619 --> 00:20:59,460
Leave it.

440
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,019
I knew you're up to no good.

441
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:03,739
Tell me what you want to ask.

442
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,379
Is Han Jiangshuo the new member

443
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,300
of your team?

444
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,339
Why do you care?

445
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,700
What's your intention?

446
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:15,259
I surely want to know

447
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,859
first-hand information of my idol.

448
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:20,979
No. All information.

449
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:23,499
Do you want to know?

450
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:26,460
Plead with me.

451
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:32,460
Don't go too far.

452
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,339
Suit yourself.

453
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:36,580
You're forcing me.

454
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,460
Angel Ziwen.

455
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,660
Please do me a favour.

456
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,420
I'll buy all skincare products, facial
masks and night cream for you,

457
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,420
-okay?
-Stop.

458
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,859
I'll obey you from now on.

459
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:51,339
Stop. You'll break my arm.

460
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:53,499
This is more like it.

461
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:56,259
Let me go and get some information.

462
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:57,619
I'll reply to you soon.

463
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:00,180
Have a safe trip.

464
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:02,660
Stop playing up to me.

465
00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:16,940
Is it not over yet?

466
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,099
I can't run anymore.

467
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,580
Do you want to end it

468
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,019
when it's not even 15 minutes?

469
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,660
I can't do it anymore.

470
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,460
I feel like I'm going to faint.

471
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,060
Han Ruofei.

472
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,420
I stopped using this trick
since I entered junior high school.

473
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:49,219
Han Ruofei.

474
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,780
Han Ruofei.

475
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:52,739
Han Ruofei, wake up.

476
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:54,900
Are you serious, Han Ruofei?

477
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,300
Han Ruofei.

478
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,739
It's useless

479
00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:13,420
to pretend to faint in front of me.

480
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,739
I'll count to three.

481
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:17,259
If you still don't get up,

482
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,300
don't blame me for being unkind.

483
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:22,259
(I insist.)

484
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:23,859
(You can't do anything.)

485
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:28,219
One.

486
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:30,780
Two.

487
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:34,300
Three.

488
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:38,979
All right.

489
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:41,099
It seems like you've fainted for real.

490
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:44,139
I have no choice but to
send you to the infirmary.

491
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:48,660
I can't carry you.

492
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:51,460
I have to drag you.

493
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,219
(What? Drag me?)

494
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:54,180
(Fine.)

495
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,900
(Being dragged is somehow
better than running to death.)

496
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:04,180
Dr. Xu, hurry and check on him.

497
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,060
He suddenly fainted when he ran.

498
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,739
Why are you so happy about it?

499
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,619
You have no idea, Dr. Xu.

500
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,019
I've been like this since I was little.

501
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:16,339
I'm sad actually.

502
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:19,540
Don't worry. I'll check on him.

503
00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:41,580
He is fine.

504
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,580
Why has he fainted?

505
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:47,660
Is there no problem at all?

506
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,259
You're awesome, Dr. Xu.

507
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,019
He wakes up without you doing anything.

508
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,300
There's nothing wrong with him.

509
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,780
He'll be fine after some rest.

510
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,099
However...

511
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:06,780
How did he bump his head?

512
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,540
(Because I was dragged by this woman.)

513
00:25:09,979 --> 00:25:10,940
Ask her.

514
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:13,619
Look, Dr. Xu.

515
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,420
He is much better now.

516
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:17,619
Let's talk over there.

517
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,019
I have something to tell you.

518
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,900
However...

519
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,019
Come on.

520
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,460
Wait.

521
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:25,780
You...

522
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:27,900
What are you doing?

523
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:33,900
Dr. Xu, are you busy today?

524
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,300
I'm not really busy.

525
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,700
Have you recovered from the flu?

526
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,580
I'm much better.

527
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:42,420
By the way, Dr. Xu.

528
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:45,420
Do you still have effervescent tablets?

529
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:48,060
Yes. I'll bring it to you.

530
00:25:56,219 --> 00:25:57,099
What are you doing?

531
00:25:57,499 --> 00:25:58,940
I'm a patient.

532
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:00,259
Don't go too far.

533
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,859
What kind of inhumane treatment is this?

534
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:04,900
Don't bother.

535
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,339
Stay on the bed.

536
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:35,180
I practised all day and I fainted.

537
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:37,219
You want me to do cleaning here.

538
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,379
I seriously suspect
you're taking revenge

539
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,300
and giving me a hard time.

540
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,219
Han Ruofei.

541
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,499
How dare you mention that you fainted.

542
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:45,420
I can't even bring myself
to expose your lie.

543
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,460
Get back to work.

544
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,139
Can't you let me take a break?

545
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:50,739
Stop fighting.

546
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:54,900
Mr. Han.

547
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:57,180
I have something to tell you.

548
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,499
Go ahead.

549
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,139
I'm actually your fan.

550
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:06,440
(Your world is the most brilliant.)

551
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:10,619
Girl, you get the wrong person.

552
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,019
No.

553
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:13,700
I recognised you at once.

554
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:15,379
I'm really your diehard fan.

555
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,940
Look. I still have your autograph

556
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:19,420
from the fan meeting of last year.

557
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:24,420
You really get the wrong person.

558
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,660
I'm Han Ruofei.

559
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:28,019
Mr. Han.

560
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,420
I'm right. It's you.

561
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,180
Han Jiangshuo's real name is Han Ruofei.

562
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:33,460
You're 21 years old

563
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:34,460
and your height is 182cm.

564
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,099
You debuted when you're 18 years old.

565
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:37,820
You love watching movies.

566
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:39,660
You fear the most...

567
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,420
Stop it.

568
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:41,739
I'm really impressed.

569
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,060
You have comprehensive information.

570
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:43,859
Of course.

571
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:45,300
As a longtime fan,

572
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,019
I know this information by heart.

573
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:50,820
So I wouldn't get it wrong.

574
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,420
Look.

575
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:52,540
There's a photo

576
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,619
of you peeing when you're little.

577
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,499
Look at it.

578
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:56,660
You're so adorable.

579
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,580
Oh no.

580
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,900
Enough.

581
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:06,300
I can't take it anymore.

582
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:07,700
Do you have a pen?

583
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,259
I do.

584
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,700
Here.

585
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,660
From now on,

586
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:23,859
I'm Han Ruofei of the archery team.

587
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,259
Please don't tell anyone.

588
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,219
No problem.

589
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,219
My idol's matter is mine.

590
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,739
I'll keep it a secret for sure.

591
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:35,099
Call me Han Ruofei from now on.

592
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,460
No problem, my idol.

593
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:38,499
I mean Han Ruofei.

594
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,180
Wait. I'll be right back.

595
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:41,979
Wait.

596
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,700
Well,

597
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,820
you don't have other photos
like that, do you?

598
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,979
Of course

599
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,580
not.

600
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,580
Bye.

601
00:28:58,259 --> 00:28:59,940
Is that her idol?

602
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:04,540
Poor stamina. He can't do anything.

603
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:07,660
I wonder how Ziwen fell for him.

604
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:11,619
You can't expect celebrities to meet

605
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,339
standards of sports students like us.

606
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:18,180
However, a celebrity

607
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,339
does look better than Average Joe.

608
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:22,139
Many girls among us

609
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:25,139
become so excited
as soon as he joins us.

610
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,180
Are you moved by him as well?

611
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:31,780
That can't be.

612
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,900
Archery means more than romance.

613
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,540
That's right.

614
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:39,339
I wonder

615
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:41,739
how Ziwen is enchanted by him.

616
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:48,339
My goodness!

617
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,099
What have you done?

618
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:59,060
Do you believe it when I say

619
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,820
I didn't mean it?

620
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:04,300
You didn't mean it?

621
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:07,219
Why do you fail every task?

622
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,259
You know nothing but you
insist on learning archery.

623
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,900
Forget your poor stamina,

624
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:13,780
can't you even handle something

625
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,900
as simple as cleaning?

626
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:16,420
I really didn't mean it.

627
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,300
Why are you so angry?

628
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,379
Isn't it just a trophy?

629
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,060
How could you say those hash words?

630
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,060
You make it sound very easy.

631
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,739
It's just a trophy?

632
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,660
Do you know

633
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,820
how much effort we put in

634
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,499
for the trophy?

635
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:35,259
You didn't sweat for the trophy.

636
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,139
So it doesn't concern you.

637
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,540
Enough, Yezi.

638
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:43,339
Stop being angry.

639
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:46,300
I'll pay you for it.

640
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
Pay me?

641
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,259
How do you want to do it?

642
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:53,259
Do you know

643
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,300
that a trophy is the greatest
acknowledgement

644
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,780
of the sweat put in by an athlete?

645
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:04,700
I'm here, friends.

646
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:05,940
Where's my idol?

647
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:06,780
He's here.

648
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,420
My idol!

649
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:08,940
Enough, Yezi.

650
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,619
Do you know I'm your fan?

651
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:10,660
- Stop being angry.
- My idol.

652
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,300
What's going on?

653
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:20,180
What happened?

654
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,460
The trophy is broken.

655
00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:24,180
Who broke it?

656
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:25,820
Your idol.

657
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:26,780
My idol?

658
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:30,259
That's fine.

659
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,859
I'm sure he didn't mean it.

660
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,859
Stop talking.

661
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:37,139
The trophy is broken.

662
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:38,900
Yezi is upset.

663
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:43,060
Yezi is upset? My idol
is even more upset.

664
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,979
Look at my idol.

665
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:46,540
Don't be upset, my idol.

666
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,019
Turn around, my idol.

667
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:49,139
Idol.

668
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,739
Stop being upset.

669
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:52,259
Stop comforting me.

670
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,900
Cai Jinye.

671
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,619
I'm really sorry for
what happened today.

672
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,339
I apologise.

673
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,339
I don't accept your apology.

674
00:32:06,979 --> 00:32:07,979

You care too much about
the trophy, don't you?

676
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,259
Stop talking, Mengmeng.

677
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,180
Leave her alone.

Mengmeng.

679
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,180
You were too much.

680
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:19,660
Was I?

681
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:20,979
Yezi. Yezi.

682
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,259
I didn't mean it, Yezi!

683
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:23,300
All right, stop talking.

684
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,339
My idol, don't be upset.

685
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:29,660
Shall we treat you to hot pot?

686
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,339
It's not appropriate. Come on.

687
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:32,180
Watching a movie can do, too.

688
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,219
That's even more inappropriate.

689
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:34,339
Don't pull me.

690
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:35,460
My idol!

691
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:15,019
Hello? I'm doing well
in the university lately.

692
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,900
Coach is handsome
and classmates are so nice.

693
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:19,820
My coach has even found me a mentor.

694
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:21,339
She's extremely beautiful.

695
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,139
Yes.

696
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,019
She is beautiful, kind and responsible.

697
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,420
She's very nice to me.

698
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,259
Master, why are you here?

699
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,780
I have to go. We'll talk later.

700
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,780
I've always been here.

701
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,139
As an archer,

702
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:37,379
apart from poor stamina,

703
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,700
you have poor eyes, too.

704
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:43,300
Master, are you still angry with me?

705
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,460
I've come to make an official apology.

706
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:51,820
Stop being angry.

707
00:33:53,219 --> 00:33:54,739
The trophy

708
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,940
isn't that important after all.

709
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,660
What is important

710
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,139
if not the trophy?

711
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,580
You have yet to understand

712
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,139
the importance of
a trophy to an athlete.

713
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,819
Your apology means nothing.

714
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,980
Take it easy.

715
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,139
Let me finish.

716
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:16,460
You say the trophy is very important.

717
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,500
All right.

718
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,020
Some people have never
won a championship

719
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,099
in their lives.

720
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,619
Is their effort meaningless?

721
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:26,900
The trophy

722
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,379
was placed there for a long time.

723
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,539
Even if you haven't won
any championship after that,

724
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,539
you're still training hard every day.

725
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,940
Will you give up if you fail
to win a championship?

726
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,859
It's just like the view before us.

727
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:44,500
It's more than enough

728
00:34:44,779 --> 00:34:46,619
to have someone stopping by to enjoy it

729
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:48,299
for a moment.

730
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,139
Stop feeding me with
lame theories like this.

731
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,379
Stay and enjoy

732
00:34:56,579 --> 00:34:57,859
the view alone.

733
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:08,299
The view is really nice

734
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,900
but the person is really fierce.

Coach, I have something to tell you.

Li Jiahao is quite good.

738
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,700
The facial cream recommended
by him is particularly good.

739
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,339
He's certainly an expert of beauty.

Yezi.

Do you know which dorm
Han Ruofei is staying?

743
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,740
I don't know.

744
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,299
Ask him directly.

745
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:32,420
What's going on?

746
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,460

I didn't register an account.

752

She's still so angry when
she becomes popular.

We can create it ourselves.

You're quite thoughtful.

833
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:32,099
Of course.

834
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,980

Yes.

You're a fighter in women's eyes.

843
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,379
This oven is targeted at women.

844
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:08,220
You are quite thoughtful.

845
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,099
However, I have no interest.

846
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:11,420
Are you done?

847
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,339
Close the door when you leave.

848
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:14,139
Thank you.

849
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,220
I have an ultimate skill.

850
00:41:18,779 --> 00:41:21,220
The best weapon of University of Sports.

851
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,980
Regardless of men or women,

852
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:26,859
no one can resist it.

853
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,420
I'm sorry.

854
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,900
I have no interest.

855
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,420
Take a look.

856
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:33,900
It's the latest massage gun.

857
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:35,260
It works really well.

858
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:45,940
Can I stay with you?

859
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,900
No. Don't get it wrong.

860
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:55,339
Brother.

861
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,299
Take it easy.

862
00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:01,299
Didn't you say you wanted to
give something to Cai Jinye?

863
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,579
Give this to her.

864
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:05,260
Cai Jinye is usually
tired from training.

865
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:06,819
She'll need it.

866
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:10,379
If I stay with you,

867
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,579
I can prepare supper for you,

868
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:13,779
do your laundry and sweep the floor.

869
00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:14,660
Right.

870
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,619
Most importantly, I can prevent
secret filming of obsessive fans.

871
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,020
You're quite like an obsessive fan.

872
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:24,299
It doesn't matter whether
I look like one or not.

873
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:25,379
What matters the most is

874
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,500
I can be your private
assistant for free.

875
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:28,660
I'm very hands-on.

876
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,980
I can do anything.

877
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,819
You're very hands-on?

878
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:32,940
Yes.

879
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,420
There's nothing I can't do.

880
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,460
I can consider staying with you

881
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,059
on one condition.

882
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:44,180
Tell me.

883
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,660
As long as I can help you,

884
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,579
I'll do it

885
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:48,859
no matter how hard it is.

886
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,700
I need to fix a broken trophy.

887
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:54,020
Can you do it?

888
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,220
Forget a trophy,

889
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,500
even if the dorm collapses...

890
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:02,819
I can't really fix it.

891
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:04,139
As for the trophy,

892
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,020
rest assured.

893
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,420
