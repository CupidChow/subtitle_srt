Something is wrong with this diet pill.

I need to use the toilet.

Why does she suddenly
have a stomach ache?

61

Could it be the effect of the diet pill?

I'll check on her.

Is Dr. Xu asking me out?

It seems it's because I've
changed my style.

kind of make sense.

dresses more often.

I'm sure that I can't finish it today.

172
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:31,800
You're on your own.

173
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,600
What? Say it again.

174
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,841
Hello.

175
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,401
Han Ruofei.

176
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:43,920
How dare he act shamelessly.

177
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,521
I can't believe

178
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,120
that you could still go

179
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,480
on a date as it's already late.

180
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,360
Having said that,

181
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:59,240
I'd indeed got him into trouble.

182
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,761
I think I should do it myself.

183
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:12,800
Why are you eating this again?

184
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:24,360
You can do this, Lin Ziwen.

185
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,961
After you've lost your weight,

186
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,720
you can eat anything you want.

187
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,201
In your dreams.

188
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:39,521
It's odd.

189
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:42,560
I can't believe Ziwen is eating
vegetables instead of meat.

190
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:43,961
What are you doing?

191
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm having my meal.

192
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:47,800
It's a big table. Am I
not allowed to sit here?

193
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:50,240
Fine, sit tight.

194
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,641
Let's talk about the matter

195
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:53,201
of you helping me to ask Han Ruofei out

196
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:54,641
for dinner last time.

197
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,001
You still remember that?

198
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:57,281
Can you get over it?

199
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,441
No!

200
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,281
You can have it all.

201
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,841
Get over it, okay?

202
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,961
Take it away! Hurry up!

203
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:15,081
No way, Ziwen.

204
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:18,120
This is the specialty dish
of the canteen.

205
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Braised Beef Brisket.

206
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,800
It'll be sold out if we're late.

207
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Don't you understand?

208
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,720
I don't want to eat it.

209
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,680
Why?

210
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,081
Are you on a diet?

211
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,160
What? Can't you tell?

212
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,521
Forget about it.

213
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,761
Just eat it.

214
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,761
Anyway, you won't lose
weight by skipping meals.

215
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:49,441
What are you doing?

216
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:53,680
Do you have any idea how hard
it is for me to lose weight?

217
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,281
I've had the runs for the whole night.

218
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:01,881
I feel weak,

219
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,961
yet I can't eat too much meat.

220
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,321
Look.

221
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,841
She's ruined her makeup. She looks ugly.

222
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:10,360
I've lost my appetite.

223
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:12,841
Right. Why is she crying here?

224
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:35,641
No.

225
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,001
Stop crying. It's my fault.

226
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,081
I'm such a blabbermouth.

227
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,641
There, there.

228
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:41,360
The prettiest Ziwen Fairy in the world,

229
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:42,201
will you stop crying?

230
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:43,081
Stop crying.

231
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:46,881
The coach said my body fat
percentage didn't pass.

232
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,360
If I don't lose weight this time,

233
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,160
I'm done for.

234
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Okay.

235
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,680
Losing weight is a piece of cake.

236
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,160
Do you have a solution?

237
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,680
I used to weigh 90kg.

238
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:02,600
Now, I weigh 65kg.

239
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,761
I lost weight.

240
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:04,680
Really?

241
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,961
When did it happen?
Why didn't I know about it?

242
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:09,281
I made it up.

243
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,321
No.

244
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,720
I am Just kidding.

245
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:14,881
I mean it.

246
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,961
I can be your weight-loss officer.

247
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:18,120
I'll monitor your weight loss regime.

248
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,961
You can at least lose 5kg.

249
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,240
Really?

250
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:22,081
Of course.

251
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,600
When have I lied to you?

252
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:25,720
How dare you say this.

253
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:27,441
Believe in me for once.

254
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,081
I'm sure you can do it this time.

255
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,001
Here, here.

256
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,441
Take a bite.

257
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,201
Come on.

258
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:43,961
You can only gain strength
to lose weight after eating it.

259
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,961
Here.

260
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,040
Is it delicious?

261
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:51,480
It's delicious.

262
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,600
One more.

263
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:23,201
(Female Dorm)

264
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:30,160
Han Ruofei.

265
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:31,441
Just wait and see.

266
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,360
Yezi, you haven't eaten yet?

267
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,360
I've bought some food for you.

268
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,480
Come here and eat it.

269
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:45,521
I'm late.

270
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,281
This afternoon, I will go to...

271
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:47,081
Where are you going?

272
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,920
What are you doing later?

273
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:54,600
Yezi,

274
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,521
are you really going on a date?

275
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:01,761
It's not a date.

276
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:05,720
I just want to have
a dinner with Dr. Xu.

277
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,480
Little Yezi, you're quite aggressive.

278
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,441
Yuling,

279
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:17,120
I got a big problem now.

280
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,841
What is it?

281
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:22,120
This self-criticism report is too
long. I can't finish it.

282
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,201
I need your help.

283
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,120
I haven't finished my assignment

284
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,081
about sport psychology.

285
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:33,240
You're on your own.

286
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,560
My dear Yuling.

287
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,040
Do you really like Dr. Xu that much?

288
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:51,240
Actually, I don't know
if I like him or not.

289
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,841
I just want to have a dinner with him.

290
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,360
All right then.

291
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,201
I'll help you out this time.

292
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:03,560
Thank you, Yuling.

293
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,641
Just this once.

294
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:09,600
Thank you, Yuling.

295
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,521
Okay, eat up.

296
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,281
I've bought your favourite seaweed.

297
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:14,841
Okay.

298
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:15,401
Try it.

299
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:21,441
I must stop Cai Jinye
from going on the date.

300
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,680
Cai Jinye?

301
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,841
A date?

302
00:15:25,321 --> 00:15:25,920
Who is she going on a date with?

303
00:15:26,081 --> 00:15:27,961
In all probability,
it's the school doctor.

304
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,680
Dr. Xu?

305
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,480
No wonder Cai Jinye always
goes to the infirmary.

306
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:35,521
What do you mean?

307
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:37,001
You have no idea

308
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
how the guy

309
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:39,720
is lusting after Cai Jinye.

310
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,961
Cai Jinye is good at archery,

311
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,360
but she's bad at judging people.

312
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,761
If anyone wrongs her,

313
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,240
she'll take it out on me.

314
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:51,001
I've got to take preventive measures.

315
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,720
I see.

316
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,081
It's not right, Ruofei.

317
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,321
Why do you care so much

318
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:57,281
about Cai Jinye going on a date?

319
00:15:57,281 --> 00:15:57,841
Cut it out.

320
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,920
Our immediate task is

321
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,441
to stop them.

322
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,321
I'll handle Cai Jinye.

323
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:02,201
You'll take care of Dr Xu.

324
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,081
You can't control them.

325
00:16:04,201 --> 00:16:05,720
We can't stop them.

326
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:11,521
Of course it's not impossible.

327
00:16:11,641 --> 00:16:12,401
Who am I?

328
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,761
I'm Little Animal...

329
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:18,160
I'm Little Zhuge, Li Jiahao.

330
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,841
Enough, do you have any solution?

331
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:23,001
I got it.

332
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:33,040
What do you think?

333
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:35,040
You're really something.

334
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,961
Let's go.

335
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:00,961
Han Ruofei.

336
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,161
Han Ruofei.

337
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:11,120
Can you complete
the training for today faster?

338
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,561
Master,

339
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,120
it seems you have no idea.

340
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,281
Do you see my hands

341
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:19,120
trembling so badly?

342
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,881
Do you know why?

343
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,281
It's because I did the self-criticism report for you.

344
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:28,200
Your hands are trembling?

345
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,561
That's great.

346
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:32,120
Then, I'll go to the coach

347
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,801
and apply for early termination
of your training today.

348
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,840
I can go back early as well.

349
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:40,080
Do not do this.

350
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,600
Do you know what the coach said today?

351
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,761
He said "Han Ruofei,

352
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:46,681
if you can't shoot the third ring,

353
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:49,240
neither you nor Cai Jinye can leave."

354
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,001
Listen to that.

355
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,001
Han Ruofei,

356
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:56,881
are you trying to mess with me?

357
00:17:57,801 --> 00:17:59,641
I'm innocent, Master.

358
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:00,761
Tell me.

359
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:02,761
How can I embarrass you?

360
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:03,440
Am I right?

361
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,360
I, Han Ruofei, must shoot
the third ring today

362
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,960
even if I practise to death.

363
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,281
I'll make your life a living hell now.

364
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,401
Don't think that I can't do it.

365
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:12,161
Come over.

366
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,720
What are you doing?

367
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,120
Stand here.

368
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:24,600
Amazing.

369
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:26,041
You've improved.

370
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:28,080
Just consider the remaining five rings

371
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,521
as my random gifts for you.

372
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,240
Bye.

373
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,801
You...

374
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,881
Hello, Jia Hao.

375
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,401
My mission failed.

376
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:46,801
Hurry up and execute plan B.

377
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,921
Jiahao.

378
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,281
Li Jiahao.

379
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,240
Li Jiahao.

380
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:07,960
Li Jiahao.

381
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:12,681
Jiahao.

382
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:29,041
Li Jiahao, what's wrong with you?

383
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:31,360
Come up.

384
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:34,281
Come.

385
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,360
Come up.

386
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,921
Li Jiahao, what's wrong with you?

387
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:48,401
Dr. Xu, my body aches all over!

388
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:49,960
I don't know which part it is.

389
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:52,281
I feel aches all over.

390
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,561
It aches all over.

391
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:55,600
It aches all over.

392
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,681
Don't move.

393
00:19:57,881 --> 00:19:58,641
Your body aches all over?

394
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:00,240
Yes, it aches.

395
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,281
Why is it so odd?

396
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,921
As a safety precaution,

397
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,320
I should call an ambulance.

398
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,480
Dr. Xu.

399
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,360
Dr. Xu.

400
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:12,161
What's wrong with you, Li Jiahao?

401
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:13,960
Why are you acting strange today?

402
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:15,480
Dr. Xu.

403
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,281
I don't need an ambulance.

404
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:18,480
I'm fine.

405
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:19,440
Dr. Xu.

406
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,921
Actually, I want...

407
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,641
So you're pretending

408
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,320
Were you trying to get me to
write an absent-note for you

409
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,960
to skip classes?

410
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:28,001
I'm going to your coach now.

411
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,761
(What should I do now?)

412
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,360
(I got it.)

413
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,840
Dr. Xu, I'm sorry.

414
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:54,641
(Infirmary. Consultation Hours.
Monday to Friday.)

415
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,641
Hello, is Dr. Xu here?

416
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,720
He's not here.

417
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,480
He should be back soon.

418
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,681
Are you feeling discomfort?

419
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:19,840
Why don't you take a seat first?

420
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,161
Sure.

421
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,720
Are you here for Dr. Xu, too?

422
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:34,120
Kind of.

423
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
I need to consult him about
my psychological problems.

424
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,200
(She's young.)

425
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
(How did she have
a psychological illness?)

426
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,681
It's all right.

427
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,521
You'll be cured soon

428
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:47,360
after you meet Dr. Xu.

429
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:50,720
Is he that amazing?

430
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:52,480
Of course.

431
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,360
Dr. Xu is just a trainee doctor

432
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:57,240
in our college,

433
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,720
but he is a highly skilled physician.

434
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,480
Moreover,

435
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,521
he is a nice person.

436
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:07,041
Indeed,

437
00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:08,641
he is a nice person.

438
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,120
It's just that he's a bit forgetful.

439
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,960
He always forgets about
the important things.

440
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,440
No.

441
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,960
Dr. Xu

442
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:18,881
takes things seriously
and he's responsible.

443
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,401
Is he?

444
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:24,001
Dr. Xu.

445
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:25,120
What happened?

446
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:27,521
Nothing, it was just a minor accident.

447
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:32,600
Why did you come back like this?

448
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:35,360
I'll get you towel and dry clothes.

449
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,240
Thank you.

450
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,600
Come on, take it off.

451
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,521
Don't catch a cold.

452
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,360
Wipe it.

453
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,080
It's cold out there.

454
00:22:46,921 --> 00:22:48,001
You're unbelievable.

455
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:49,480
Here, put this on.

456
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,761
You must have waited for so long.

457
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
I'm already used to it.

458
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,720
It's not the first time.

459
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,080
You're busy with work.

460
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:57,480
Wipe it.

461
00:22:57,641 --> 00:22:58,681
All right, I'm fine.

462
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:00,600
After completing my internship,

463
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:01,881
I'm able to apply for it

464
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,440
and return to the provincial city
with you.

465
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:05,521
Really? Is it a promise?

466
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,080
Don't catch a cold.

467
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,161
Cai Jinye?

468
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:12,720
Why are you here?

469
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,761
Dr. Xu.

470
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:17,440
She...

471
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,881
I forgot to introduce her to you.

472
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:22,840
This is my girlfriend.

473
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,641
Hello.

474
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:25,840
You can call me Wanzi.

475
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,681
By the way, she's
here for a consultation.

476
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:29,041
I'll prepare the things for you.

477
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:29,720
Okay.

478
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,120
Dr. Xu.

479
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:40,440
The things you said
to me this morning...

480
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:41,881
This morning?

481
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,641
What happened this morning?

482
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,720
- Xu Ze.
- Dr. Xu.

483
00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:49,561
Right.

484
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,801
I saw you this morning
when I was greeting

485
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,881
Wanzi.

486
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:53,960
I was in a hurry.

487
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,240
So I didn't get to talk to you.

488
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,120
I'm really sorry.

489
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:03,840
Here.

490
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:07,480
Come on, put this on.

491
00:24:07,641 --> 00:24:10,440
(It turns out that he wasn't talking)

492
00:24:11,161 --> 00:24:13,080
(to me this morning.)

493
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,921
Cai Jinye, what's wrong?

494
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:50,561
I...

495
00:25:07,761 --> 00:25:08,281
Yezi,

496
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:10,480
what's the time now?

497
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,401
The movie will be over

498
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:14,761
if we don't leave now.

499
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:16,521
Ze,

500
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:18,320
look at him, he's
more romantic than you.

501
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:20,921
By the way, Cai Jinye,

502
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,001
it is my last day working here.

503
00:25:23,401 --> 00:25:25,200
I've handed over everything
to the next doctor.

504
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,921
If you need effervescent tablets,

505
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,401
you can just get them from him.

506
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,801
It's all right.

507
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,960
From now on, I'll help Yezi to get

508
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,521
the effervescent tablets.

509
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,761
Then, you've got to take
good care of Cai Jinye.

510
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:45,761
Of course.

511
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,200
She is my girlfriend.

512
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,720
Who will care about her if I don't?

513
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:51,641
We're leaving, Dr. Xu.

514
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:52,120
Okay.

515
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:53,080
Bye.

516
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,200
Bye.

517
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,360
Seriously?

518
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,921
Your eyes are swollen.

519
00:26:08,521 --> 00:26:11,600
I really didn't expect

520
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:15,041
that he actually had a girlfriend.

521
00:26:15,761 --> 00:26:17,881
Isn't it normal for him
to have a girlfriend?

522
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,120
Besides,

523
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,521
you didn't even know
he had a girlfriend.

524
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:22,761
What kind of a crush is this?

525
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,281
I was really upset just now.

526
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,801
You were upset because
you were disillusioned

527
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,801
and got disappointed in the reality.

528
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,881
It's nothing.

529
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,881
It sounds like you've got a point.

530
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,921
Indeed, I don't know

531
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:53,720
what's on my mind.

532
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:59,281
However, thank you for
what you did just now.

533
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:02,881
If it weren't for you,

534
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,401
I wouldn't have known what to do.

535
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,281
Enough, stop crying.

536
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,801
I'll take you to a place.

537
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,440
What's the place?

538
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:16,840
A place that can make you feel happy.

539
00:27:17,921 --> 00:27:18,521
Come on.

540
00:27:19,401 --> 00:27:19,960
Come on.

541
00:27:21,521 --> 00:27:23,200
What are you doing?

542
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,600
See for yourself.

543
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:27,600
Can you walk while wearing this?

544
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,921
Come up, I'll carry you.

545
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:34,440
Hurry up.

546
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,440
This is delicious.

547
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:07,840
Why aren't you eating?

548
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,320
I don't want to eat.

549
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:13,281
I don't feel like eating.

550
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:17,041
You know what?

551
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,960
Hunger breeds discontentment.
Food always comes first.

552
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,681
We all have our moments
with a broken heart.

553
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:24,600
Besides, this is not even a breakup.

554
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:28,681
You make yourself sound like a Feeling Saint.

555
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,001
I wonder if you have experienced
any heartbreaking

556
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:31,960
love story.

557
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,041
Tell me about it.

558
00:28:33,281 --> 00:28:34,041
Are you sure?

559
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,840
Okay.

560
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:39,681
Then, I'll tell you about my story.

561
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,480
When I was in primary school,

562
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,120
I fell in love with a girl.

563
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,840
She transferred to another school.

564
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,001
What happened then?

565
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,161
If you want to know what happened,

566
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,600
I'll tell you after you take a bite.

567
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:57,720
Go on.

568
00:28:58,401 --> 00:28:59,480
Then...

569
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,240
Nothing happened then.

570
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:06,041
I thought you were amazing.

571
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,001
What kind of a story is this?

572
00:29:08,801 --> 00:29:09,521
It seems

573
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,561
you and me are at about the same level.

574
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:13,720
You've heard the story.

575
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,001
Dig in, the food will get cold.

576
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,281
Do you still love her?

577
00:29:26,561 --> 00:29:27,681
How is it possible?

578
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:28,681
It's been years since I met her.

579
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,440
I've already forgotten
the way she looked.

580
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,041
It seems

581
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,120
I'll slowly forget how
Dr. Xu looks as well.

582
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,521
You shouldn't remember his face.

583
00:29:37,681 --> 00:29:38,480
Give me your phone.

584
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:40,881
What are you doing?

585
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:46,320
Just remember this handsome
face if you want.

586
00:29:50,521 --> 00:29:51,320
You're a narcissist.

587
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:53,360
How is it?

588
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:54,921
Do you feel better now?

589
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:57,001
So-so.

590
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,801
My effort of dressing up
is wasted today.

591
00:30:00,641 --> 00:30:01,840
It's not wasted.

592
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,641
Aren't you on a date with me now?

593
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:06,801
However, I think you look better

594
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,281
the way you were.

595
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
