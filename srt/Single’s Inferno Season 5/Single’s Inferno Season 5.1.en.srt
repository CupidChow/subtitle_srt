1
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,308
<i>Here lies a peculiar island.</i>

2
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,603
<i>Really? I have to find everything?</i>

3
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,980
<i>Stop lying.</i>

4
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,314
<i>We have to get water, too.</i>

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,899
<i>This is becoming a hike.</i>

6
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,609
<i>Are we really hunting chickens?</i>

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,069
<i>Wait a second.</i>

8
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,529
<i>Is the food underwater?</i>

9
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:40,165
<i>All sorts of people flock to this island.</i>

10
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,833
<i>He's such a sexy guy.</i>

11
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,793
<i>Am I too open-minded?</i>

12
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,086
Then, we should kiss.

13
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,589
<i>They fall into all kinds of love.</i>

14
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,883
I've been wanting to talk to you.

15
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,135
<i>Do you want to sleep together?</i>

16
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,596
<i>But there are cameras. Geez.</i>

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,392
<i>When did you start falling for me?</i>

18
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,393
<i>Wasn't it obvious?</i>

19
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,897
<i>They play all kinds of games.</i>

20
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,690
<i>I'll absolutely win.</i>
<i>I'll take first place.</i>

21
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,693
<i>I was sure I'd be in deep s***</i>
<i>if I didn't win first place.</i>

22
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,113
<i>- This situation is insane.</i>
<i>- I just might win first place.</i>

23
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,700
<i>Then, they feel</i>
<i>all kinds of different emotions.</i>

24
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,161
<i>Is anybody two-timing?</i>

25
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,330
<i>Why me? We just went there together once.</i>

26
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,998
<i>How cute are you?</i>

27
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,382
<i>However, one thing never changes.</i>

28
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,803
<i>Couples get to leave for Paradise…</i>

29
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,932
<i>I actually decided to get drunk</i>
<i>only four times a year.</i>

30
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,558
Today might be the day.

31
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,227
<i>I'm not sexy.</i>

32
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,478
<i>You are sexy.</i>

33
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,941
<i>…and singles will remain in Inferno.</i>

34
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,902
<i>Does he think</i>
<i>he already has me in the bag?</i>

35
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,862
<i>I don't like this situation, not one bit.</i>

36
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,739
<i>All three are on my mind.</i>

37
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,449
<i>Do I have to flirt with everyone?</i>

38
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,909
This guy is way too easy.

39
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:04,290
<i>Can they become couples</i>
<i>and escape this peculiar island?</i>

40
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,334
<i>I really am in love.</i>

41
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,378
<i>I think we'll really start dating.</i>

42
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,883
<i>This is the hottest inferno in the world,</i>

43
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,094
Single's Inferno.

44
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,638
SINGLE'S INFERNO

45
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,224
HANHAE, KIM JIN-YOUNG, HONG JIN-KYUNG,
LEE DA-HEE, KYUHYUN

46
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,475
We're back.

47
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,104
The hottest inferno
that will melt the cold winter away,

48
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,857
<i>Single's Inferno</i> is back yet again.

49
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,402
We launched back in 2021
with the first season,

50
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,697
- and we're now here with the fifth season.
- My gosh.

51
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,366
It's the first Korean program
to do that on Netflix.

52
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,245
- Let's give it up.
- Yes, a round of applause!

53
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,289
I think we can give ourselves
a pat on the back.

54
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,374
We just watched the preview together.

55
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,169
- Right.
- The lines have become feistier now.

56
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,086
- It has.
- Really.

57
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,004
Right?

58
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,755
And the physical contact.

59
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,716
- Exactly.
- As always, something happens in bed.

60
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,633
I know…

61
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,886
Are we going to see people
in bed regularly now?

62
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,887
Yes, it's a given.

63
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,806
Man, I couldn't imagine doing that
back in my season.

64
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,016
You can say that now.

65
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,810
Yes, the men and women
were always separated.

66
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,855
Also, I hear the one thing
to look out for in this season

67
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,149
is their unbelievable bluntness.

68
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,069
The Truth or Dare will bring about
a huge wave of chaos.

69
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,990
So why don't we all just sit back, relax,

70
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,284
- and get immersed in this together.
- Yes.

71
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,286
- Just like the viewers.
- Let's do that.

72
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,990
- It's a guy.
- They're here.

73
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,160
- How intense.
- Look at his shoulders.

74
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,789
<i>Hello, my name is Youn Hyun-jae.</i>

75
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,792
I haven't felt
butterflies in my stomach for a while,

76
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,878
so I came to Inferno
because I wanted that experience.

77
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:19,008
My ideal type is a woman
who has a pure and innocent look.

78
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,596
If I see my ideal type,
I'll probably pursue her until the end.

79
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,433
People often ask me for my number,

80
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,019
and I've had many women
who wanted to pursue me.

81
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,190
I'm competitive when it comes to
physical activities and sports,

82
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,529
so I'll probably win every round
of physical games in Inferno.

83
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,157
Was Korea founded on a lucky site?

84
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,536
How are there
so many good-looking and pretty people?

85
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,413
- The production crew did well.
- Yes.

86
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,113
Hello, my name is Song Seung-il.

87
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,867
I think I'm really competitive.

88
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,871
I hate losing, and when I do,
I can't even sleep at night.

89
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,414
I do whatever it takes

90
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,666
and make a good effort
in an attempt to win.

91
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,461
Hey, not bad. He's quite…

92
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,795
Jin-kyung.

93
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,256
- I'll contain myself. Sorry.
- No, that was good.

94
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,009
I don't fall for people easily.

95
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:47,680
But when I do fall and pursue them,
I usually succeed in dating them.

96
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,433
They all fell for me, too.

97
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,649
Hello.

98
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,526
Nice to meet you.

99
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,737
- They feel different.
- I agree.

100
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,447
- They have different vibes.
- Yes.

101
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,459
- My gosh.
- She's so…

102
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,376
Is she a mannequin?

103
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,045
- Is she Barbie?
- She's like Barbie.

104
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,797
I was just thinking that, too.

105
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,975
- She kind of looks like Son Yeon-jae.
- You're right.

106
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,018
I can see it.

107
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,229
Hello.

108
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:38,940
Hello.

109
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,900
- Hello.
- Hello.

110
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,002
That means…

111
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,754
- He lost just now.
- Yes.

112
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,298
It's one to zero for now.

113
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,304
<i>Hello, my name is Park Hee-sun.</i>

114
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,933
I think I'm enthusiastic.

115
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,477
When I want to do something,
I always follow through.

116
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,273
I love dancing
and getting people's attention,

117
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,734
so I joined the cheerleading team
throughout middle and high school.

118
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,948
I learned many skills back then,
and I still have my game.

119
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,161
I get asked out constantly.

120
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,539
When I go out on the street,

121
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,168
guys come up to me
every three steps I take.

122
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,753
It'll take her an hour to walk 100 m.

123
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,882
How does she go home then?

124
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:51,596
But until today, I've never really
fallen head over heels for a guy.

125
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,139
So I want to meet my ideal type

126
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,516
on <i>Single's Inferno</i>
and make a move on them.

127
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,104
Many people misunderstand and think

128
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,857
that the cast reads a script
made by the production team.

129
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,734
But the production crew does not step in.

130
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,819
Yes, they all are something.

131
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,447
- To be here…
- Seriously, though.

132
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,033
- …you need the flair.
- And the confidence.

133
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,994
- This is for people with high self-esteem.
- That's true.

134
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,342
<i>Hello, my name is Shin Hyeon-woo.</i>

135
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,929
I know I'll do well on games.

136
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,098
I never fall behind

137
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,976
when it comes to my physique or aura.

138
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,229
He must be confident about his strength.

139
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,772
He's a total tough guy.

140
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:48,027
<i>Older women often tell me that I'm cute.</i>

141
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,113
WHY DO THEY SAY THAT YOU'RE CUTE?

142
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,032
They say I shouldn't know.

143
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,867
They would never tell me.

144
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,287
I believe in fate,

145
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,083
so I look forward
to meeting someone I'm meant to be with

146
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,626
here on <i>Single's Inferno.</i>

147
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,099
<i>Hello, my name is Kim Go-eun.</i>

148
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,186
I may have cat-like features,
but I have a puppy-like personality.

149
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,523
I may look cold on the outside,

150
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,986
but once you get to know me,
you'll see that I'm cute and warm-hearted.

151
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,909
My features, such as my eyes,
nose, and mouth,

152
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,953
all look pretty, so I like all of them.

153
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:43,583
Among them, my favorite is my nose.

154
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,961
- Her nose.
- Her profile is stunning.

155
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,338
- She does have cat-like features.
- She does.

156
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,924
I've always had a boyfriend,

157
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,385
so I'm not used to being single.

158
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:58,431
I want to find someone
who'll steal my heart on <i>Single's Inferno</i>

159
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,474
and end this single life.

160
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,476
Bang.

161
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,244
Hello.

162
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,207
Hello.

163
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,797
- The men can't keep a straight face.
- Yes, they're interested.

164
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,051
Hello.

165
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,721
Hello.

166
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,312
Did you see that?

167
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,897
I have a question.

168
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,524
About that moment just now.

169
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,068
What was that soft chuckle?

170
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,653
The thing about this place is

171
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,489
that there's nothing funny,
but they just keep laughing.

172
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,658
That sounded like a forced giggle.

173
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,752
- What's your name?
- I'm Kim Go-eun.

174
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,504
- Go-eun?
- Yes.

175
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,215
My name is Song Seung-il.

176
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,424
- Seung-yi?
- It's Il.

177
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,093
- "Yi?" "Il?"
- Not "yi," but "il."

178
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,429
- Seung-il? Nice to meet you.
- Likewise, Go-eun.

179
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,682
Go-eun. Got it.

180
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,617
- Hands behind his back.
- How relaxed.

181
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,495
- He's the first to appear like that.
- Yes, like he's taking a walk.

182
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,913
- He's so relaxed.
- My gosh.

183
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,962
<i>Hello, my name is Kim Jae-jin.</i>

184
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,591
People often call me immature,

185
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,387
but at the same time,
they say I seem mature.

186
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,932
You might ask,
how do I get both remarks at once?

187
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,310
Well, I'm a guy who's capable of that.

188
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,689
What's that pose?

189
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,317
- I don't think he's a model.
- No, he's not.

190
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,990
<i>My charm is that I'm sweet and funny.</i>

191
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,827
<i>I have a personality</i>
<i>you'd never expect from my cold looks,</i>

192
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,870
<i>a surprising charm.</i>

193
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,082
I promise to spend every moment

194
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,711
with honesty and sincerity
here on <i>Single's Inferno.</i>

195
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:35,880
Let's do this.

196
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,347
- Is he from a nobleman's family?
- "A nobleman's family"!

197
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,559
- "Ahem!"
- He looks laid-back.

198
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,311
"Come hither!"

199
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,944
He looks like he's taking a stroll.

200
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,620
Hello.

201
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,807
- What's he doing?
- Why is he walking around the well?

202
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,309
He actually did that?

203
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,657
Oh, it seems like he made a choice.

204
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,576
Yes, I think he was contemplating
between the two ladies.

205
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,745
- He sat in between those two?
- Yes.

206
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,433
<i>Hello, my name is Ham Ye-jin.</i>

207
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,436
When people first meet me,

208
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,358
they often say I'm kind,
quiet, and pretty.

209
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,736
Because of my name, they think of me
like Lady Ye-jin from <i>Hur Jun.</i>

210
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,073
But once you get to know me,
I'm quirky, honest,

211
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,533
and I can be cute, too.

212
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,120
The more you get to know me,
the more curious you'll become.

213
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,582
Honestly speaking,
I've never flirted with anyone.

214
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:39,295
I just look people in the eye
when I talk to them,

215
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,171
and everything just works out.

216
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,592
Like this.

217
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,478
- Hello.
- Hello.

218
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,396
Hello.

219
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,981
What's your name?

220
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,983
My name is Ham Ye-jin.

221
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,986
Seung-il has a lot of hair.

222
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,989
He won't have to worry about hair loss.

223
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,073
It's a blessing.

224
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,701
Someone's coming.

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,544
<i>Hello, my name is Woo Sung-min.</i>

226
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,214
I don't usually enjoy intense romance.

227
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,885
I prefer relaxed, easygoing relationships,
like those between good friends.

228
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,304
So once I start dating,
it usually lasts quite a while.

229
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,639
DO YOU OFTEN GET ASKED OUT?

230
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,974
No, no one has ever

231
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,018
asked me out.

232
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,978
I always asked girls out.

233
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:42,191
The kind of person I want to meet here
is someone I can banter with

234
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,568
and someone who gives off
the same vibe as me.

235
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,404
Hello.

236
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:02,711
Someone's coming.

237
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,089
It's a woman.

238
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,009
She has an imposing stride.

239
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:09,927
A go-getter girl?

240
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,345
- I think so.
- A go-getter.

241
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,475
- She's definitely a go-getter.
- Definitely.

242
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,395
<i>Hello, my name is Kim Min-gee.</i>

243
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:22,815
She's famous.

244
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:23,941
- Really?
- Who is she?

245
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,567
- A famous track athlete.
- An athlete.

246
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,069
The track and field goddess.

247
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,154
My name is Kim Min-gee.

248
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,908
Unlike my cold look on the outside,

249
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,161
I'm a bubbly and cutesy girl.

250
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:40,290
I'm very athletic,
so I think I'll do well.

251
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,168
I might even be better
than most male contestants.

252
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,170
I'll try to hide that.

253
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,799
When I want to date someone,

254
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:54,221
I keep pursuing that person
and keep trying until they open up.

255
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:58,225
I keep knocking and knocking
until they finally open up.

256
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:02,271
If I'm really into someone,
I'll probably keep following him around.

257
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,900
It's been a while since I've dated,

258
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:11,280
so I decided to join because I want
to date someone who makes me swoon.

259
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,992
I'm not really sure
if anyone here will make my heart flutter.

260
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,747
Hello.

261
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,501
- Hello.
- Hello.

262
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,170
Hello.

263
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,382
Hello.

264
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,636
Goodness.

265
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,930
Nice to meet you.

266
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,185
Hello, my name is Kim Min-gee.

267
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,062
Nice to meet you.

268
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,106
Min-gee was the most memorable.

269
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,942
She walked in with such confident strides.

270
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,530
She has a certain fierce presence.

271
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,907
She's a bit intimidating.

272
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,786
Gosh, how awkward.

273
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,079
I'm Song Seung-il.

274
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,122
I see, Song Seung-il.

275
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:03,957
It's a crowd.

276
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,460
Are there more?

277
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,921
Is this everyone?

278
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,839
I think this is it.

279
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,801
- You are the main character.
- I am?

280
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,803
- You came in last.
- Is that so?

281
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,556
Doesn't that mean I'm in last place?
I hate being last.

282
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,354
She hates being last.

283
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,563
She seems competitive.

284
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,485
We definitely attract a type,
compared to other dating shows,

285
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:35,114
<i>Single's Inferno</i> definitely
attracts strong personalities.

286
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,740
- They're unique.
- And fierce.

287
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,242
They're definitely unique.

288
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,662
This season, I can see
that they each have different vibes.

289
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,122
You're right.

290
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,208
Then among the male cast,
who has caught your attention?

291
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,627
Personally, it's Song Seung-il.

292
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,630
- No, seriously.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

293
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,549
- He's the only one she reacted to.
- Right?

294
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,592
- She said he was handsome.
- He's my type.

295
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,510
That's true.

296
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,679
- You like guys who look easy on the eyes.
- Yes, I do.

297
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,848
I have a feeling he'll show a cute side.

298
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,349
- Unlike his looks.
- Yes.

299
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,602
I think he'll capture
the hearts of older girls.

300
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,812
He'll win them over.

301
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,649
I personally liked
and am curious about Hyeon-woo.

302
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,317
- Really?
- Yes, Shin Hyeon-woo.

303
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,320
- He seems taciturn.
- Yes, he's the serious type.

304
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,197
It's Jae-jin for me.

305
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,992
- Because he keeps leaving you curious.
- That's true.

306
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,660
- And that can drive you crazy.
- Really?

307
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:26,206
"Who is he? Why does he lurk around
with his hands clasped in the back?"

308
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,501
I have a good feeling about Go-eun.

309
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:33,422
- She might play with men's feelings.
- Do you think so?

310
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,382
- I could see it happening.
- I agree.

311
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,302
She's extremely charming,

312
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,972
so I think she'll give
many men a tough time.

313
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,724
- Me too.
- You're right.

314
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,726
And Min-gee was really fierce.

315
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,644
She has an aura about her.

316
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,814
- And athletes tend to be competitive.
- They are.

317
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,276
I want to see Sung-min
get controlled by someone like Min-gee.

318
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,446
- I agree. That'll be fun.
- It sounds fun.

319
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,663
- This is so cool.
<i>- Greetings, singles.</i>

320
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,918
<i>This is the hottest inferno in the world.</i>

321
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,253
<i>Welcome to</i> Single's Inferno.

322
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:18,634
<i>The only way to escape this remote island</i>
<i>is to leave as a couple.</i>

323
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,011
<i>Welcome to Inferno.</i>

324
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:27,226
<i>You are not allowed to reveal</i>
<i>your age or occupation in Inferno.</i>

325
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,688
<i>If you successfully become a couple,</i>

326
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,399
<i>you can escape Inferno</i>
<i>and spend a night in Paradise.</i>

327
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,037
<i>Now, it's time for lunch.</i>

328
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,124
<i>Please make your way to the Cafeteria.</i>

329
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,421
- Shall we?
- Shall we?

330
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,632
Who knows the way?

331
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,513
Where is it?

332
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,683
I guess we'll find it on our way.

333
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,107
I see some carrots.

334
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,110
Is it carrots and chicken breast?

335
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,779
- We literally only have chicken breasts.
- So it's true.

336
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,908
Look, carrots.

337
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,411
- Do you like carrots?
- I do like carrots.

338
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,372
- But only carrots…
- We'll leave this place healthier.

339
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,335
Should we wash the carrots?

340
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,380
I'll wash the carrots.

341
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,510
Can you pass me the carrots?

342
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,433
Where should we put the clean carrots?

343
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,412
- Wait.
- He's just wandering around.

344
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,580
What's Jae-jin doing?

345
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,497
Jae-jin.

346
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,500
You know, when everyone
is doing something as a group,

347
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,377
that behavior can backfire.

348
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,254
- Right.
- It's the first impression.

349
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,922
Everyone else is working hard.

350
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,507
- Nobody enjoys washing carrots.
- Wait.

351
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,302
What if he just didn't have
anything to do?

352
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:29,431
- Still, he should've been ready to help.
- He should've waited next to them.

353
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,558
- He's just watching them.
- Yes, right.

354
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,185
It can come off as negative.

355
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,812
- But it can be captivating for some.
- It could seem intriguing.

356
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,660
He definitely does stand out.

357
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,122
- They're all looking at him.
- What they're showing is not curiosity.

358
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,124
- They're like, "What's he doing?"
- Yes.

359
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,085
- "What's with him?"
- He must be a noble.

360
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,171
- Would you like some?
- I'm allergic to raw carrots.

361
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,547
- You're allergic?
- Yes.

362
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,179
- He was allergic, so he was avoiding it.
- So that's why.

363
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,557
- It's a misunderstanding.
- We're very quick to judge.

364
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,478
We apologize, Jae-jin.
We'll reserve judgment for a bit.

365
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,979
- Let's take our time.
- Yes.

366
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,441
Let me set the table.

367
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,696
Do we need spoons?

368
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,578
How many people do we have?

369
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,872
- Nine.
- Is it nine?

370
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:36,998
There are nine people.

371
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,793
Should we lay out chopsticks?

372
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,294
Shall we use forks?

373
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,840
- Let's wash them.
- Right, we should wash them.

374
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,219
- We should wash these, too.
- You're right. I hadn't thought of that.

375
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,096
Oops.

376
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,186
Can't he at least set the table?

377
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,773
I'm not holding a grudge.

378
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,316
- It's been ten seconds.
- Wait.

379
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,569
- He may be allergic to spoons.
- I'll wait.

380
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,280
- Yes, he may be allergic to metal.
- Those were wooden spoons.

381
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,573
They were?

382
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,497
It's like a salad.

383
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,424
- Shall we eat?
- Let's sit.

384
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,062
Come and eat.

385
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,480
Let's eat.

386
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,066
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy your lunch.

387
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,693
Enjoy.

388
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,613
You cut these very nicely.

389
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,705
Why are you sighing?

390
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,249
- Why did you sigh?
- I'm sorry.

391
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,543
This is just so delicious.

392
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:21,311
<i>Now, we're going to match the couples</i>
<i>who will go on a date in Paradise.</i>

393
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,270
Already?

394
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,147
Oh, gosh.

395
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:30,320
<i>Please write down the name of the person</i>
<i>you'd like to go to Paradise with</i>

396
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,947
<i>on the Paradise-bound ticket.</i>

397
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,950
That was quick.

398
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,160
It's only based on first impressions.

399
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,372
- I want to know if Jae-jin's stunt worked.
- Same.

400
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:46,086
PARADISE-BOUND COUPLE MATCHING

401
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:50,632
<i>Now, we're going to match the couples</i>
<i>who will go on a date in Paradise.</i>

402
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,012
<i>The couples will be matched…</i>

403
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,018
<i>by taking a popularity vote.</i>

404
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,146
<i>A popularity vote.</i>

405
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,072
<i>The person who received the most votes…</i>

406
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,537
<i>will choose who they want</i>
<i>to go to Paradise with.</i>

407
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,878
- So the first place gets to pick?
- Is that so?

408
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,966
<i>I think I'll be in first place.</i>

409
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,719
Aren't I the most charming?

410
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,222
But we haven't had a chance to talk.

411
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,267
<i>I think I would've received</i>
<i>the most votes.</i>

412
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,603
It was awkward, but I tried my best
to start conversations.

413
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,773
It might have piqued
the men's interest in me.

414
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,609
<i>I think it'll be Hee-sun.</i>

415
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:55,155
She seemed to talk the most with the men.

416
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,824
So I think she would be the most popular.

417
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,827
<i>Me? I don't think I'll get any votes.</i>

418
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,537
I'd say Go-eun.

419
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,997
She's freaking hot.

420
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,707
I mean, she's very pretty.

421
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,001
She's so cute.

422
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:12,047
Min-gee is different
from how she seems on social media.

423
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,964
She really is.

424
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,842
- She's even more easygoing.
- She's adorable.

425
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,011
She's honest and doesn't put up a facade.

426
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,222
Who do you think won first place
among the guys?

427
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,099
- Among the men…
- Yes.

428
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:28,688
Sung-min and Seung-il stepped up
and did a lot of work, right?

429
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,484
I think that'll have an impact
in the early stages.

430
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,113
It'll be either the two proactive men
or the quiet one, Hyeon-woo.

431
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,741
- Yes, Hyeon-woo.
- He has this dependable vibe.

432
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,451
Jae-jin didn't talk much either.

433
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,620
- I don't think that's the same.
- What about him?

434
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:48,041
I don't think I would have voted
for Jae-jin just yet.

435
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,709
- Not yet?
- We might see his charm later.

436
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,669
- Yes.
- But so far, I haven't seen it.

437
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,129
- It's still hidden.
- Yes.

438
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,465
What about the ladies?

439
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:59,552
If it were you, who would you have chosen?

440
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,679
If it were me, I would've picked Go-eun.

441
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:05,475
I really liked Min-gee,
but there's something about her tone.

442
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,770
- She speaks in a very honest way.
- Yes.

443
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,523
But she's not the type
men fall for right away.

444
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,482
Maybe not at first.

445
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,694
<i>I will now announce the results.</i>

446
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,907
<i>The woman who came in first place is…</i>

447
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,498
<i>Kim Min-gee.</i>

448
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,125
What?

449
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,128
How? I mean…

450
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,630
How?

451
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,299
My gosh!

452
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,010
- Really?
- She's really shocked.

453
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,304
<i>Kim Min-gee.</i>

454
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:44,931
What?

455
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:47,934
How? I mean…

456
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,938
How?

457
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,150
<i>The person I'd like to go to Paradise with</i>

458
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,235
<i>is Kim Min-gee.</i>

459
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,989
<i>She seemed like someone who works out,</i>

460
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,783
<i>so I thought</i>
<i>we might have a lot in common.</i>

461
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,078
That is why I chose her.

462
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,583
<i>The person I'd like to go to Paradise with</i>

463
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,542
<i>is Kim Min-gee.</i>

464
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,212
<i>She didn't seem pretentious</i>
<i>and looked easygoing,</i>

465
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,131
<i>so I wanted a chance to talk to her.</i>

466
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,717
- Her being honest and carefree…
- Right.

467
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,343
- It's what drew them.
- Being easygoing.

468
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,054
Man, I didn't think
guys would be into that.

469
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,223
- But it worked.
- I have the worst sixth sense.

470
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,648
<i>The man who came in first place is…</i>

471
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,155
- Is it the diligent one or…
- Maybe Seung-il or Hyeon-woo.

472
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,865
- I wonder.
- It's Seung-il.

473
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,949
- Seung-il.
- Yes.

474
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,286
- It'd be shocking if it were Jae-jin.
- Exactly.

475
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,205
- It'd mean he knows his game.
- Truly.

476
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,958
<i>The man who came in first place is…</i>

477
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,430
<i>Kim Jae-jin.</i>

478
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,394
No way.

479
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,605
- What?
- It worked.

480
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,567
- His thing worked.
- His free-spirited vibe worked.

481
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,653
<i>Kim Jae-jin.</i>

482
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,620
<i>The person I'd like</i>
<i>to go to Paradise with is</i>

483
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,288
<i>Jae-jin.</i>

484
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,376
<i>Jae-jin and I continuously</i>

485
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,086
<i>exchanged looks.</i>

486
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,173
That might be a sign of attraction.

487
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,800
That's just my take.

488
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,803
<i>The person I'd like</i>
<i>to go to Paradise with is</i>

489
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,471
<i>Kim Jae-jin.</i>

490
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:54,060
<i>He walked over leisurely</i>
<i>like he was taking a stroll,</i>

491
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,689
<i>so I thought he was a unique character.</i>

492
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,440
He struck my curiosity.

493
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,151
- Here's the thing.
- My gosh.

494
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,737
Everything depends on who the doer is.

495
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,114
- You're right.
- Right?

496
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,824
- Seriously.
- This is so shocking.

497
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,701
I thought there was a possibility.

498
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,828
I'm going to stop being a gentleman now.

499
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,246
Pour your own water from now on.

500
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,206
I'm done setting the table, too.

501
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,292
- I'm going to sit back.
- With hands behind my back.

502
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,336
- But Jae-jin has a killer smile.
- Yes, he has a great smile.

503
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,046
- It surprised me.
- He looks cold…

504
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,923
- But then his smile…
- He smiles like that.

505
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,383
He knows his game.

506
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,262
<i>First, Kim Min-gee.</i>

507
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,850
<i>Please choose the person</i>
<i>you'd like to go to Paradise with.</i>

508
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,853
I think it's Seung-il.

509
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,272
I feel like she chose Hyeon-woo.

510
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,398
- Hyeon-woo?
- Yes.

511
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,108
I also think it's Hyeon-woo.

512
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,702
The person I'd like
to go to Paradise with is…

513
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,497

00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,128
- What?
- What?

516
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,089
- I didn't see that coming.
- I'm done.

517
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,382
Sung-min?

518
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,176
Man, how did that happen…

519
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,985
<i>I like guys who are cute,</i>

520
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,487
<i>and he was cute.</i>

521
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:32,283
<i>I also noticed</i>
<i>how he was proactive in the Cafeteria</i>

522
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,079
<i>and took care of people.</i>

523
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,164
<i>So that intrigued me.</i>

524
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,379
- Go-getter girl and…
- Yes, and soft guy.

525
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,922
- It's a combo.
- You're right.

526
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,508
<i>Kim Jae-jin.</i>

527
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,345
<i>Please choose the person</i>
<i>you'd like to go to Paradise with.</i>

528
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,976
- I think it'll be Ye-jin.
- Ye-jin?

529
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,645
- They exchanged the most glances.
- I say Go-eun.

530
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,397
Go-eun.

531
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,782
The person I'd like
to go to Paradise with is…

532
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,789
Ms. Ham Ye-jin.

533
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,834
Ms. Ham Ye-jin.

KIM JAE-JIN SELECTED HAM YE-JIN

535
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,506
- It was Ye-jin.
- See?

536
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,968
- Really?
- See? I'm on fire right now.

537
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,720
- Yes, you are on fire.
- Yes, I am.

538
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,804
My fire is out.

539
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,141
It's still early, so let's not rush.

540
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,060
Ms. Ham Ye-jin.

541
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,315
<i>I liked how she had a way</i>

542
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,152
<i>of making people feel at ease.</i>

543
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,361
It's like a salad.

544
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:54,741
She was the closest to my ideal type
in terms of looks.

545
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,328
<i>Kim Min-gee and Woo Sung-min,</i>

Hold on.

I'm so nervous right now.

549
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,087
I'm sorry. I'm so nervous.

550
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,005
I can't do this.

551
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,009
I'm so nervous right now. I'm sorry.

552
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,803
This is great. I love it.

553
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,891
- It doesn't feel like she's faking it.
- Yes, it feels real.

554
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,060
I'm so nervous right now. I'm sorry.

555
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,274
- Shouldn't we do it like this?
- My palms are sweaty. May I do this?

556
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,650
- Sure.
- Thank you.

557
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,037
- Thank you.
- No, thank you for coming.

558
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,873
- You got me out of here.
- Don't mention it.

559
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,920
<i>Kim Jae-jin and Ham Ye-jin,</i>

Okay.

562
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,182
Let's hold it like this.

563
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,727
This is so embarrassing.

564
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,278
I can only think of one question.

565
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,988
- What is it?
- Who did you choose?

566
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,241
- Do you want to know?
- Yes.

567
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,162
- I chose you, too.
- Thank you.

568
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,460
- We can slow down.
- I walk fast, don't I?

569
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,796
You seemed uncomfortable.

570
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,592
- Jae-jin has a sweet side.
- He'd be good in a one-on-one setting.

571
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,595
And my feelings are also shifting
from Seung-il to Jae-jin.

572
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,099
- Really?
- He's such a charming guy.

573
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:46,185
- Did you fall for his smile?
- Yes, he has such a cute smile.

574
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,153
We're flying.

575
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,739
Are you having fun?

576
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,535
We're really leaving. This is unreal.

577
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,786
It's all thanks to you.

578
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,419
Gosh, this is scary.

579
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,256
It's hot because of the sunlight.

580
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,099
- Wow, look at him!
- Hey!

581
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,018
- So considerate.
- Without a word.

582
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,227
Not making it obvious.

583
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,770
Gosh, Jae-jin.

584
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,857
I didn't think anyone would choose me.

585
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,817
Me neither.

586
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,903
But you won first place.

587
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,029
Yes, but…

588
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,781
It doesn't make any sense.

589
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,950
Why not?

590
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,332
The women were all so pretty.

591
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,083
You're pretty, too.

592
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,168
Thank you.

593
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,428

My goodness!

598
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,364
My gosh! Is this place really for two?

599
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,201
- For two, it's a bit…
- It's so big.

600
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,288
It's so nice.

601
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,499
This is amazing!

602
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,584
No way.

603
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,587
Look, there's an outdoor pool.

604
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,840
- How nice.
- It's so nice.

605
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,677
It would be nice to have a drink here.

606
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,637
I also like to stay outside.

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,389
- You do? I'm glad.
- Yes.

608
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,016
- There's a hot tub, too.
- Yes.

609
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,769
- It's so nice.
- It's really nice.

610
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,527
Jae-jin must have the straightest back.

611
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,321
It must be comfortable for him.

612
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,240
- It might be a habit.
- I think it is.

613
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,492
It's a great posture, though.

614
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,202
My gosh.

615
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,787
We have welcome amenities.

616
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,458
- Can we eat these?
- Sure, have some.

617
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,668
I prepared everything.

618
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,003
Come on.

619
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,423
That's called a panini.

620
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:26,137
I prepared it with salami and cucumber.

621
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,014
- What about this?
- That one?

622
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:32,727
That is a tart made with flower petals.

623
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,811
You can stop now.

624
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,065
He's so smug.

625
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:42,111

Let me pour it for you.

630
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,040
- I'll cut the meat then.
- Thank you.

631
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,887
- She's cutting meat while standing.
- She's doing it herself.

632
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,724
- I think Min-gee is the innocent type.
- Yes.

633
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,103
Thank you for cutting everything.

634

I was born in 1996.

Or 1998?

648
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,536
That's my take.

649
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,246
How old are you?

650
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,666
- You went lower on purpose, right?
- No.

00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,418
We're the same age.

652
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:26,090

Really?

First of all,
why are you speaking casually?

I'm sorry.

658
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,686
Why did you think so?

659
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,605
First of all,
it was because of your looks.

660
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,608
- Because I looked young?
- Yes, you looked young.

661
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,194
- Really?
- Yes.

662

- I am…
- Yes?

667

I hate myself for saying this,
but take a guess.

Give me a hint at least.

00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,143
That's so cool.

688
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:05,314
When I first saw you,
I thought you might be a dancer at first.

689
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,860
But I can also see you
as a fashion designer.

690
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,489
- A fashion designer?
- Yes.

691
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:16,075
I thought of those two possibilities.

692
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:16,992
I am…

693
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,745
I'm actually an athlete.

694
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,625
I am a track and field athlete.
I'm a competitive runner.

695
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,593
<i>I'm a track-and-field athlete.</i>

696
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:43,060
<i>I've been a professional runner</i>
<i>for the last 17 years, and I still am.</i>

697
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,236
That's so cool.

698
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,780
<i>People call me</i>

699
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,783
<i>Track and Field Goddess,</i>

700
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,201
<i>Goddess on the Track,</i>

701
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,037
<i>and Karina of Track and Field.</i>

702
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,332
- Yes, Karina.
- That's right.

703
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,417
She's famous.

704
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,003
<i>The best achievement of my career</i>

705
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,630
<i>was winning the National Sports Festival</i>
<i>as a defending champion</i>

706
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,340
<i>for four consecutive years.</i>

707
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:20,389
KIM MIN-GEE
BORN IN 1996, TRACK AND FIELD ATHLETE

708
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,141
A female runner is really impressive.

709
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,767
- Right.
- She's really cool.

710
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,561
- How cool.
- Imagine her speed.

711
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,480
Obviously, she will be fast.

712
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,610
- Aren't fast runners amazing?
- Sung-min is good at dispensing glasses.

713
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:33,986
I bet.

714
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,198
- Do you have any questions?
- Questions?

715
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,660
How did you feel
when I said your name earlier?

716
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,454
It took me by surprise.

717
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,082
- When you arrived earlier,
- Yes?

718
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,253
I doubt you made your choice right away.

719
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,421
But I did.

720
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,632
- You did?
- Yes.

721
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,468
- I wrote it right away.
- I see.

722
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,720
- I was probably the fastest.
- Really?

723
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,473
But I saw that everyone was still writing,

724
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,766
so I pretended to write.

725
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,481
Did you have a reason?

726
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:15,944
As soon as we arrived there,
we naturally looked at everyone, right?

727
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,030
I looked around at the men…

728
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,493
and you were the closest to my type.

729
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:25,079
You looked cute.

730
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,038
That's why.

731
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,835
- He must feel great.
- He must be on cloud nine.

732
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,755
- She has a clear taste in men.
- She's set on it.

733
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,840
This is embarrassing.

734
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:37,966
- Is it?
- Why?

735
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,511
- Because I said it to your face?
- Yes.

736
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,560
- So--
- What's your ideal type?

737
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:52,773
- I like someone who's cute and funny.
- I see.

738
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,901
I think dating should be
happy and fun all the time.

739
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:59,446
So I don't really care
about someone's career or looks.

740
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,490
I care more about their sense of humor.

741
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,242
- If you can hit it off?
- Yes.

742
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,327
Sense of humor is what matters most.

743
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,329
It was all in my head,

744
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:11,750
but I thought you would prefer
someone big and manly.

745
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,087
So I thought it wouldn't be me.

746
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,799
I think I look for something
that I don't have.

747
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,095
So I like guys who look cute.

748
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:25,889
- Thanks.
- Sure.

749
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,267
So I thought,

750
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,727
"Was I too focused on looks?"

751
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:36,024
Then what are you like
when you date someone?

752
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,943
- My dating style?
- Yes.

753
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,112
Actually, I'm really playful and sweet.

754
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:44,241
- I'm seriously playful and cutesy.
- That's unexpected.

755
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,701
- Is it?
- Yes.

756
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,578
I really am cutesy.

757
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:48,495
I'm not.

758
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,292
- So you're only cute on the outside?
- I guess so.

759
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,086
At least you look cute.

760
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,006
I have to act cute
because I don't look it.

761
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:02,426
Are there other people
you want to try talking to?

762
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,345
- No, you were the only one.
- No?

763
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,014
- No, you were the only one.
- No?

764
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,646
- My gosh.
- She's dead set on him.

765
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,689
So straightforward.

766
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,236
- I'm flustered.
- Why?

767
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,324
I also tend to speak
very straightforwardly, like you.

768
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:26,241
Yeah?

769
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,495
I feel flustered
to be on the receiving end.

770
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,497
- Like you're seeing yourself?
- Yes.

771
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,956
- How is it?
- It's great.

772
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:41,882
- I like it.
- There was no one else.

773
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:47,346
As I said before,
I don't usually care about looks.

774
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,389
But we had no choice earlier.

775
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,018
When it comes to looks,
you're exactly my type.

776
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,144
Am I drunk?

777
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,939
- No you're not.
- No, I'm not.

778
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,649
You really aren't.

779
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:04,821
Cheers.

780
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:18,669
- Thanks to you, I got to come to Paradise.
- Right?

781
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,754
I didn't expect to be here on day one.

782
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,506
I'm so happy.

783
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,551
- It's great.
- It is.

784
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,266
I was flustered.

785
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:37,813
I always thought I was straightforward,
but then I met someone even more blunt.

786
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,649
I was flustered at first, but I liked it.

787
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,650
It was great.

788
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,738
It's a bummer that Sung-min
doesn't seem interested.

789
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,658
- Yes, because he didn't vote for Min-gee.
- He didn't.

790
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,868
- Right.
- He doesn't seem interested.

791
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:55,414
And if she shares
her feelings from the start,

792
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,748
it's not a lot of fun.

793
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,251
- Is it because she's a sprinter?
- I think Min-gee…

794
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,460
- Hey.
- Straight to the point.

795
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,838
- Maybe she likes things fast.
- Come on!

796
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,259
But as a viewer, Min-gee is very charming.

797
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,302
- Yes, to us.
- Yes.

798
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,013
As a third party,
Min-gee is really charming.

799
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,975
PARADISE
KIM JAE-JIN & HAM YE-JIN

800
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,393
Gosh, these look great.

801
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,273
- You must be hungry.
- Shall we start with cheese?

802
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,818
Thank you.

803
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,821
Let's start with salad.

804
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,950
- Thank you for the food.
- Enjoy.

805
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,669
- May I ask for your age?
- My age?

806
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:44,921
I'd say 32.

807
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,006
34.

808
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,299
35.

809
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,722
I was born in 1998.

810
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,058
Really?

811
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,810
- He's full of surprises.
- He's the youngest?

812
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,355
So the youngest guy
didn't even set the table?

813
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,440
- How dare he?
- Right?

814
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,233
- And he walks like that?
- Tell me about it!

815
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,401
He's too young to do that.

816
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,487
- This may be a problem.
- That punk.

817
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,323
I would've said something
if I knew how old he was.

818
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,367
"What are you doing?"

819
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,869
I was born in 1998.

820
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,500
You're lying.

821
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,669
Why do you say that?

822
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,878
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

823
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,463
I'm asking since you're a jokester.

824
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,091
Well, I might be lying.

825
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,717
Come on!

826
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:34,262
- I was born in 1998.
- Seriously?

827
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,264
- Why are you surprised?
- Really?

828
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,933
Did you think I was younger or older?

829
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,524
Why are you shocked?
Why did you think I was lying?

830
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,317
I'm older.

831
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,116
- I was born in 1996.
- In 1996?

832
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,617
I'm two years older.

833
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,372
I love it.

834
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,666
Oh, I'm relieved.

835
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,751
- I thought--
- It's as I wanted.

836
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,837
- Really?
- I wanted a two-year gap.

837
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,674
- Or maybe I wanted that.
- I see.

838
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,301
- For me to be older?
- For you to be older.

839
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,721
Goodness, I guess
it's only good news for me.

840
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:16,847
But it's all right.

841
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,016
It's fine as long as you don't act young.

842
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:22,894
I will

843
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,480
show more of myself.

844
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:29,860
What do you do?

845
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,405
- Should we take things slowly?
- Slowly? Sure.

846
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,074
You talk casually right away.

847
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,870
- I didn't.
- I didn't say you could do that.

848
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,538
I won't.

849
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,001
I'll continue to call you Ms. Ham Ye-jin.

850
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,336
- I like calling you that.
- "Ms. Ham Ye-jin?"

851
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,631
Doesn't that sound too distant?

852
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,258
"Ye-jin" is too…

853
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,509
- Ordinary?
- Yes.

854
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:56,762
What about "Ms. Ham"?

855
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,556
- Ms. Ham Ye-jin? Okay.
- Ms. Ham Ye-jin.

856
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,692
You don't have a poker face.

857
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,778
- What do you mean?
- You suddenly seem gloomy.

858
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,696
- No.
- Ever since we revealed our age,

859
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,699
- No way.
- you've lost that glow.

860
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:21,328
- Well, we're basically the same.
- Age is just a number.

861
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,496
It is.

862
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,872
Tell me what you do.

863
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,291
You keep beating me to it.

864
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,584
I wanted to ask first.

865
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,754
I'm going to make you guess.

866
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:31,713
- You are?
- Yes.

867
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,883
I think it has to do with talking.

868
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:37,677
Why?

869
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,346
You're good with words.

870
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,599
- I am?
- Yes.

871
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:44,893
Yes, you're correct.

872
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,521
I'm a freelance announcer.

873
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,856
- Really?
- Do you know me?

874
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,192
Not at all.

875
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,571
<i>I'm a freelance announcer.</i>

876
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,283
<i>I work for many corporations</i>
<i>as an in-house announcer,</i>

877
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,451
<i>read the city news,</i>

878
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,787
<i>and even host events and occasions.</i>

879
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:09,042
HAM YE-JIN
BORN IN 1996, FREELANCE ANNOUNCER

880
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,586
I was just… Wait…

881
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,422
You're flustered.

882
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,091
- I surprised myself.
- Exactly.

883
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,634
I'm surprised that I got it right.

884
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,386
I'm in shock.

885
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,014
But now I see it.
You look like an announcer.

886
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,892
- It's an honor.
- Stop it.

887
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,853
- Ms. Ham Ye-jin.
- Pleased to meet you.

888
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,984
It's now your turn.

889
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,694
I majored

890
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,030
in modern dance,
and I work as a professional dancer.

891
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,323
- Really?
- Yes.

892
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,533
- You're a dancer?
- Yes.

893
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,952
- A dancer?
- Really?

894
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,245
- My gosh.
- What a huge twist.

895
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,496
That's so cool.

896
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,123
I would've never imagined.

897
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,418
<i>I am a professional dancer.</i>

898
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:58,592
<i>I work in modern dance</i>
<i>and teach dance lessons.</i>

899
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:04,055
<i>I like dances that are not forced,</i>

900
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:07,058
<i>dances that</i>
<i>naturally express raw emotions.</i>

901
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,855
<i>Despite tough days,</i>

902
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:15,108
<i>many dancers before me</i>
<i>have continued on this journey,</i>

903
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:19,613
<i>and the artists I look up to</i>
<i>help me stay on track.</i>

904
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:24,117
KIM JAE-JIN
BORN IN 1998, DANCER

905
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,660
That's so cool.

906
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:29,539
Close your mouth.

907
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,667
Can we do
a group dinner after episode one?

908
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,506
I've never met a professional dancer.

909
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,675
- That's so cool.
- Hardly.

910
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,349
Do you have a dating style?

911
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,434
I always want to be their top priority.

912
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,521
Let's say there's a week.

913
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,857
Then I'd want him to meet me seven times.

914
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:02,155
I want to be
that significant to my boyfriend.

915
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,032
But that changes.

916
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,575
- Yes, people can change.
- Yes.

917
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,828
A guy who wants to meet four times
ends up wanting to see you five or six…

918
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,538
No, it goes the other way.

919
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,791
It goes from six times a week,

920
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,793
to five, four times to twice a week.

921
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,211
And then, forever goodbye.

922
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,216
Was that funny?

923
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,302
"Forever goodbye" was funny.

924
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,974
I asked for your dating style,
and it ended with forever…

925
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,226
- Forever goodbye.
- And then forever goodbye.

926
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,816
- How can you meet seven times a week?
- That might be too much.

927
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:40,360
- What she said is burdensome.
- Yes.

928
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,153
- It's how you put it.
- Yes.

929
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,949
When he asked about her dating style,
she could've said she likes to meet often.

930
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,283
- Yes.
- Just that much.

931
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,702
- But she was so specific.
- Right.

932
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,620
It's like she's asking him
to change for her.

933
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,372
- Right.
- That's how I felt.

934
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,457
I felt a bit of pressure as a guy.

935
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,502
But Jae-jin slightly mentioned
that he's against that.

936
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,379
- He said, "People can change."
- Yes.

937
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:03,842
That sentence encapsulates
that he isn't like that.

938
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:09,139
Anyway, I don't think what she just said
would be helpful in this situation.

939
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,557
Let's keep an eye on them.

940
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:16,396
3 HOURS AGO

941
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,194
Thank you.

942
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,415
- They don't look happy.
- Hee-sun and Go-eun must feel angry.

943
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,542
They must be thinking, "It's not me?"

944
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,728
What? They left for Paradise
and already there's new people?

945
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,396
- What is this?
- What's going on?

946
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,898
What kind of format is this?

947
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,701
- What? There's more?
- More people?

948
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,577
