Name…

19
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,664
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:23,792
I'm…

21
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,251
I'm sorry.

00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,087

00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,463
- What?
- No way.

24
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,507
She must be really nervous.

25
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,467
- She's flustered.
- Yes, she's nervous.

26
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:36,721
I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,351
I was honestly really flustered.

00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,230
When Hee-sun said Su-been's name…

<i>I actually wanted</i>
<i>to do the mission with Su-been.</i>

32
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:03,456
So I became flustered,
and my mind just went blank.

33
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,334
Her mind completely…

34
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,836
Her mind must've gone blank.

35
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,381
Seung-il and Su-been were both chosen,
so she panicked.

36
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,342
Sung-hun must be heartbroken.

37
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,432
Lee Sung-hun, Kim Jae-jin, Woo Sung-min.

38
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,938

Seung-il.

42
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,953
- Seung-il?
- He's already chosen.

43
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,664
- Gosh.
- Oh no.

44
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,624
You should've just picked one person.

45
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,127
Seung-il.

00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,296

- I picked him.

He's chosen? I'm sorry.

48
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,724
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

49
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,934
Sorry, I keep forgetting their names.

00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,436

56

Woo Sung-min
must not feel too good either.

Seriously.

58
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,649

- She struggled a bit there.

I haven't thought of any ideas yet.

65
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,294
- So, you want to go second?
- Yes.

66
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,514
- Actually, we can go first.
- Why?

67
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,935

68
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:29,936

Shooting by the ocean looks good, too.

- He has to watch them.
- Right, that must be torture.

I'll pose like this, and you can…

77
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,803
Should I put my arm up
or hold you like this?

78
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:07,640
Instead of that,
you can pull me in your direction.

79
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,558
Like this?

80
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,977
- Pull this arm.
- Grab this side?

81
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,312
I'll look this way.

82
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,271
Like this?

83
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,106
- I'll look this way.
- Like this?

84
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,816
- Okay.
- But…

85
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,860
Don't lean over like this.

86
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,779
I'll lean closer to you
so we can be closer.

87
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,780
Okay.

88
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,534
- Ready?
- Yes.

89
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,246
What's wrong?

90
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,794
You can be bolder.

91
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,504
- I don't mind.
- Okay, I will.

92
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,630
Okay, let's begin.

93
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,216
Pull me toward you.

94
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,553
Pull me toward you.

95
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,767
Why'd you pucker your lips?

96
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,520
Why'd she pucker her lips?

97
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,898
- It's very natural.
- Why'd she pucker her lips?

98
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,108
- Her lips naturally…
- She did this.

99
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,401
- No, she…
- Without thinking.

100
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,613
It's because she was trying to smile
but stopped halfway.

101
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,408
Why'd you pucker your lips?

102
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,661
Let's continue.

103
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,001
- One more time. Focus.
- I'm still shooting.

104
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:17,919
- Okay.
- Okay.

105
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,843
I'll look at your lips.

106
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,602
<i>- Hyeon-woo is very into it.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

107
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,686
<i>How is he like that?</i>

108
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,814
He's actually taking the lead.

109
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,025
How do you feel?
She was your partner yesterday.

110
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:41,943
Right.

111
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,904
She has quite a small frame.

112
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,074
- Yes, she's so slender.
- And he has a larger frame.

113
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,080
- She looks like a fairy tale princess.
- Like Tinker Bell.

114
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,417
<i>They had great chemistry.</i>

115
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,753
I tried my best…

116
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,423
not to care about it.

117
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,678
- Do a lot.
- Okay.

118
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,973
- Did you just tell me to do a lot?
- Yes.

119
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,641
- I should do a lot, right?
- Yes.

120
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,564
I don't get jealous over things like this.

121
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,275
Getting jealous over
who they partnered up with for a game

122
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,153
is such an immature way of thinking.

123
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,071
It doesn't look that hot.

124
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,074
Is your MBTI the thinking type?

125
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,909
The mission was to be a hot couple.

126
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,120
He seems jealous.

127
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,123
- Jae-jin seems very bothered.
- Yes, he does.

128
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,584
- How about this? Come here.
- Touching foreheads?

129
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,628
- Come here.
- Okay, we'll touch foreheads.

130
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,054
Shall we look at the camera?

131
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,224
- At the camera?
- This one?

132
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,767
- To the side.
- Like this?

133
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,276
<i>- That's a nice shot.</i>
<i>- It is.</i>

134
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,819
<i>Zoomed in like that.</i>

135
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,948
I think seeing them pose
in front of him like this

136
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,577
might trigger Jae-jin to pose more boldly,
like he's about to kiss his partner.

137
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,996
- Don't you think?
- Yes, it'll trigger him.

138
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,790
It'll provoke jealousy.
This is quite entertaining.

139
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,709
Why is this so entertaining?

<i>- She sure is a model.</i>

144
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,724
- What if my face looks huge in the photos?
- I'll lean forward.

145
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,186
<i>I had a strategy in mind.</i>

147
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,483
doesn't really give off hot vibes.

148
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:49,403
So I tried my best
to play the supporting role,

149
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:54,534
emphasizing Go-eun's charm
as much as possible.

150
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,286
I'm not wearing any jewelry.

151
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,497
Want to wear my bracelet?

152
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,666
- Your arm looks bare.
- Should I?

153
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,918
- Right?
- Thank you.

154
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,630
I wanted to do a wet hair look, too.

155
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,174
Is there any water?

156
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,559
- Just make the ends look spiky.
- I think that's enough.

157
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,019
Try doing the thing.

158
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:26,399
- I'll try my best so you can stand out.
- I'm not sure if it'll look good.

159
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,156
- Can I really step on you? I'm not sure…
- Let's give it a try.

160
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,579
- I don't know how it'll look.
- Just look your best.

161
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,249
That pose is saying, "Trample on me."

162
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,001
- That's…
- She's stomping on him.

163
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,429
<i>It's definitely hotter than before.</i>

164
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,847
<i>- Totally.</i>
<i>- Right?</i>

165
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,973
<i>I can see the difference.</i>

166
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,018
- Here we go.
- Okay.

167
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,399
This is hard.

168
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,069
- It's kind of--
- Want to lean on my chest?

169
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,237
By my neck?

170
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,866
- How?
- Lean your head back on my chest.

171
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,242
- By my neck.
- Like this?

172
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,254
<i>- Look at them.</i>
<i>- That's nice.</i>

173
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,298
<i>- This is hard to beat.</i>
<i>- It's very hot.</i>

174
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,091
<i>She's used to this as a model.</i>

<i>She's on a different level.</i>

176
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,232
Jae-jin said he wouldn't go shirtless,
but he did right away.

177
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,737
Seeing Jae-jin,
who I went to Paradise with,

178
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,491
do the mission with someone else

179
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,743
felt quite strange.

180
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,120
It felt kind of weird.

181
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,622
I almost forgot.

182
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,627
Shall we hold hands?

183
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,261
Now that's a hot couple.

184
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,734
- Are you looking ahead?
- Yes.

185
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,322
They're lying down.

186
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,995
Our goal is to get the best shot.

187
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,306
- Their expressions are…
- They look serious.

188
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,600
- His face is…
- Right? They're getting closer.

189
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,646
<i>- Their expressions are a bit spicy, too.</i>
<i>- You're right.</i>

190
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,148
<i>- Slightly hot--</i>
<i>- Oh my gosh.</i>

191
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,984
<i>- My gosh.</i>
<i>- They got the shot.</i>

192
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,779
<i>That could be the poster</i>
<i>for</i> Single's Inferno.

193
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,449
<i>- A dancer's body is truly built different.</i>
<i>- I agree.</i>

194
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,533
<i>Look at his muscles.</i>

195
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,371
Look, that's what I wanted to do.

196
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,167
They're doing exactly that.

197
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,171
Still…

198
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,173
Do you regret it?

199
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:42,261
No, I feel a vicarious satisfaction
watching them do what I'd pictured.

200
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,806
<i>I think Go-eun did a great job.</i>

201
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:52,897
I think if Go-eun and I
had combined our boldness,

202
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,691
we would've created the hottest photos.

203
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,944
What does Hyeon-woo do?

204
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,489
- I'm really curious.
- Me too.

205
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,950
I didn't know he was like this.
He's very competitive.

206
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,827
He's also very confident.

207
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,747
But Go-eun and Jae-jin

208
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,125
looked great together
during their photoshoot.

209
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,420
Watching them made my heart flutter
more than I thought it would.

Hello.

216
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,064
- You look gorgeous.
- Yes, you're both dressed up.

217
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,359
- I don't think we'll need to pose a lot.
- I agree.

218

I think I look quite simple.

Yes, simple is best.

I was thinking of posing like this.

225
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,969
- Okay.
- And we look back.

226
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,098
If you look this way,
it'll show your side profile.

227
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,766
- This way?
- Wait, I'll come up.

228
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,564
Okay.

229
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,070
Is everyone experienced in this?

230
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,364
- They're not shy.
- They look like professionals.

231
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,408
- Mina Sue--
- She's like a professional.

232
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,368
- Her facial expressions--
- Her gestures too.

233
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,166
- Look at her eyes.
- If this is her first time,

234
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,668
she has to be a model.

235
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,961
She's a natural.

236
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,254
- She's talented.
- She is.

237
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,172
- Let's do this.
- Making eye contact?

238
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,424
- Like this.
- Like this?

239
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,676
I think we can get closer.

240
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,597
- We should do some bold poses.
- Yes.

241
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,313
I think it'll look better if we're closer.

242
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,417
<i>- My gosh, Mina Sue.</i>
<i>- Mina Sue looks like a model.</i>

243
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,921
<i>- She knows how to pose.</i>
<i>- It's like a movie poster.</i>

244
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,806
I hope we do well and don't look awkward.

245
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,809
- Let's try to look natural.
- Okay.

246
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,314
Are you okay? Is it uncomfortable?

247
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,654
- Is it uncomfortable?
- No, I'm okay. I can bend further back.

248
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,906
She can bend further back?

249
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,950
Mina Sue is determined.

250
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,871
- I'll show my leg when we take the photo.
- Do you want to lift your leg up?

251
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,539
Wrap it around me.

252
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,707
- Like this?
- Yes.

253
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,460
Up here? Then can you hold my leg?

254
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,476
- Good job. That was fun, right?
- Good job.

255
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,144

- We got this.

256
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,233
Good job.

257
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,776
- We've got to kill it.
- Right.

258
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,069
How did we do, Sung-hun?

259
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,946
- You guys did great.
- Was it good? Really?

260
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,116
- It's cold.
- So cold!

261
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,788

- How about this?

262
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,914

268
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,235
- It must be awkward.
- Because she likes him.

269
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,196

- Yes, sounds good.

270

Aren't they both so cute?

275
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,057

- You don't?

276
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,974
No, I don't.

277
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,060
- They're both cute.
- She doesn't see it.

278
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,978
- She's jealous.
- She's transparent.

279
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,110
There.

280
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,572
That's a new pose.

281
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,001
It'd look nice
if you hugged him from behind.

282
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,252
- True.
- Hug him from behind.

283
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,171
Tell us the poses we forgot to do.

284
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,215
Try hugging him from behind.

285
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,509
- Or I could--
- How do I hug him?

286
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,971
- Should I hug him from behind like this?
- Then put your face here.

287
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,807
- Let's do the <i>Titanic</i> pose.
- Okay.

288
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,308
Oh my.

289
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,602
What was that?

290
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,688
- That's so…
- It was a body check.

291
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,233
She frisked him
like they do at the airport.

292
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,069
- What was that?
- It passed by in a flash, right?

293
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,862
I wonder what she was thinking.

294
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,280
He's just a friend to her.

295
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,325
- She has no feelings for him.
- There's no spark whatsoever.

296
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,494
That shocked me for a second.

297
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,412
- I think it was just a joke.
- A joke?

298
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,794
Lying down on the beach.

299
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,213
How should we do this?

300
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,172
Let's pose like this.

301
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,091
We'd like a close-up shot.

302
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,218
- Should I fully lie down?
- Sounds good.

303
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,887
I'll lie down with you.

304
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,725
- Should we hold hands?
- Was it covering you?

305
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,363
- The corners of her lips are moving again.
- They are.

306
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:20,075
- She really can't hide her feelings.
- She's so easy to read.

307
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,203
Let's look at each other.

308
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,663
- Is that possible?
- Yes.

309
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,207
I don't know what to do.

310
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,002
Let's change positions.

311
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,215
Your eyes have a tint of green.

312
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,010
Don't say things like that.

313
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,975
<i>During the couple photoshoot,</i>

314
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,353
there were shots
where we made eye contact.

315
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,189
We were really close to each other,

316
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,858
so my heart fluttered.

317
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,110
She looks smitten.

318
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,904
- She's nervous.
- Of course.

319
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,406
- But Hee-sun is lying so far down.
- Who?

320
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,783
She's lying down so comfortably.

321
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,662
- She's not a professional model.
- She should've lain down at an angle.

322
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,080
- She's not a model.
- Right.

323
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,875
I know, but she looks way too comfortable.

324
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,586
- It might be better to not have feelings.
- I agree.

325
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,503
Right?

326
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,556
<i>Yes, it bothered me. I was very annoyed.</i>

327
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,477
I don't know exactly why,
but it bothered me.

328
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,355
But I didn't want to make it obvious.

329
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,690
I really wanted to hide how I felt.

330
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,859
- But it showed.
- It was obvious.

331
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,611
- It's written all over her face.
- Exactly.

332
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:41,531
- She's not as chill as I thought.
- It's because she likes him.

333
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,456
I think we're done.

334
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:51,833
All done.

335
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,670

- Nice.

346
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,364
This is my best.

347
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,909
- That rock is a great spot.
- It is.

348
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,911
I think it'll turn out well.

349
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:33,250
- We have to be super close.
- Yes.

350
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,963
You can like…

351
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,589
It's okay if we touch a lot.

352
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,675
- Okay, you got this?
- Yeah.

353
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,179
- I think you can get closer.
- How do I get closer?

354
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,015
Is it hard to position yourself?

355
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,729
- He kind of looks like a walrus.
- Hold her, Sung-hun.

356
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,440
- Hug her.
- He does resemble one.

357
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,527
- That was a timid attack.
- He's being quite harsh.

358
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,780
Want to try grabbing my neck?

359
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,703
- No, not like that.
- You told me to choke you.

360
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,747
- Not choking.
- What do I do then?

361
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,415
Did you see him grab her neck?

362
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,751
- He grabbed her neck?
- Yes, he did.

363
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,960
No freaking way.

364
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,087
- What do I do?
- Wrap your arm around me.

365
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,800
Hang on.

366
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,555
- Oh my gosh.
- How could you choke her?

367
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,391
I misheard her. I swear.

368
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,729
My hair…

369
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,944
Focus on your core.

370
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,075
<i>So that's their vibe.</i>

371
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,410
<i>- Her gaze is so intense.</i>
<i>- It's beautiful.</i>

372
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,705
<i>They look so good together.</i>

373
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,668

375
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,842
while shirtless

376
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,345
was pretty intense.

377
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,767
- He's very blunt.
- "While shirtless."

378
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,143
Sung-hun is adorable.

379
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,021
<i>I think we may have grown a little closer.</i>

380
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:22,275
<i>I think Mina Sue still thinks of me</i>
<i>like more of a friend right now,</i>

381
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,279
but I'd like to get to know her
more one-on-one.

382
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,866
I think this pose will look good, too.

383
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,756
Look at me.

384
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,138
- That's nice. That might win first place.
- Looking good.

385
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,139
- Nice.
- Great pose.

386
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,265
The angles are great.

387
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,018
You have beautiful eyes.

388
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:03,733
Hang on.

389
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,820
- Don't make me laugh.
- It's okay if you laugh.

390
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,864
I really want to win first place.

391
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,408
But they're doing so well.

392
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,368
- Yes.
- But we…

393
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:20,709
I didn't really care for
Sung-min and Mina Sue's photoshoot.

394
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:24,296
But when Sung-hun
and Mina Sue were shooting,

395
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,967
I got a little upset.

396
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,303
For some reason,

397
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,140
I just didn't like watching them.

398
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,728
How much time do we have?

399
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,899
He put on his sunglasses.

400
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,912
If I were Su-been,
I would've splashed them.

401
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,331
I wouldn't be able to watch that.

405
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,423

- Should I squat?

406

Sit in a comfortable position.

Sit comfortably on the ground.

- Okay.

410
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:20,060
I'll slightly put my leg on your thigh,
so it's like I'm getting on top of you.

Yes, like right before
I get on top of you.

413
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,734
- I'll adjust to however you pose.
- Okay, let's give it a shot.

Why are those two so funny?

418
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,377
- Like we've been caught.
- Nice.

419
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,928
Why are his eyes like that?
What's he doing?

420
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,513
He's trying his best.

It's cute.

423
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,729
- Seung-il…
- Why did he freeze there?

424
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:12,320
Nice. I'll try climbing up a little more.

425
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,781
- Should I hold your leg like this?
- Sure.

426
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:19,035
- You can lean against me, Min-gee.
- Okay.

427
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:23,665
- Should I lean?
- For my hair, you can squeeze it.

428
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,333
"Squeeze it"?

429
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,587
- How can you squeeze hair?
- Why would she squeeze your hair?

430
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:33,466
- He must want to try something intense.
- He's adorable.

431
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,845

- How would she squeeze it?

432
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,516
- Should I lean?
- For my hair, you can squeeze it.

433
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,107
- Sorry.
- We can't laugh.

434
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,984
I shouldn't, but I keep laughing.

435
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,489
I was very nervous.

436
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,950
It was so nerve-racking.

437
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,579
My heart was pounding
and I was a nervous wreck,

438
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:06,166
but I really tried my best.

439
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,008

<i>- Yes.</i>

440

444
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,544
I felt very nervous for some reason.

445
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,464
The Min-gee I'm familiar with

446
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:58,009
is quite playful and easygoing.

447
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,928
But during the photoshoot,

448
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,764
Min-gee took the lead in coaching me.

449
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,101
Let's put our faces together.

450
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,894
- But your hair…
- This much is okay.

451
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,687
I'll put my nose against you.

452

<i>I saw a different side of her.</i>

453
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:18,321

- Yes, that's another charm.

00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:23,118
<i>- What a hot photo.</i>
<i>- The results are great.</i>

<i>- Nice.</i>
<i>- They're great.</i>

456

- You gave really good suggestions.

457
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,583
Really? What a relief.

458
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,503

00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:35,184
<i>and view their top three contestants</i>
<i>of most interest to them.</i>

516
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,190
That's a great idea.

517
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:45,153
- Their top three.
- Yes, top three is a lot.

518
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:49,198
- You can see how they feel.
- Yes, that's a huge benefit.

519
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,791
- That's crazy.
- I've got goosebumps.

520
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,335
My hair is standing on end.

521
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:01,711
Goosebumps…

522
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,680
Who will they choose?

523
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,394
More than the result,
something else interests me.

524
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,481
You know how you get really close
during the shoot?

525
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:25,526
Didn't you get butterflies while doing it?
You did, right?

526
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,445
Yes, from time to time.

527
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,156
Any changes of heart?

528
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,159
In our rankings?

529
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,454
My ranking changed.

530
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,958
- Really?
- To whom?

531
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,125
- Sung-hun?
- Sung-hun.

532
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,753
- Is Sung-hun on her radar?
- Did Su-been move down?

533
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,004
My ranking changed.

534
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:49,884
How?

535
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,011
Completely?

536
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:57,058
Not completely, but it's kind of…

537
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,566
I'm interested in…

538
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,820
But is it normal
that my rankings keep changing?

539
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,031
- Sure, why not?
- That can happen.

540
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,869
Right now, my first place

541
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,038
is Sung-hun.

542
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:21,791
Finally!

543
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,418
Sung-hun hit the jackpot.

544
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,086
He's in the game.

545
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,295
He got really lucky.

546
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,674
- The games really matter a lot.
- Seriously.

547
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,094
My second pick is Su-been,
and my third pick…

548
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,846
is Woo Sung-min.

549
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,891
The reason Sung-hun is my first pick

550
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,604
is because when I came back from Paradise,

551
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,315
he kind of lingered on my mind.

552
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,986
And when I saw the photoshoot results,

553
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:54,032
Sung-hun looked very attractive.

554
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,367
He also accommodated me well
throughout the shoot,

555
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,745
and we had good chemistry.

556
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:02,540
So I'm more interested in him now.

557
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,586
How are your rankings?

558
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,213
Did this affect them at all?

559
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,674
I can't say it didn't affect me.

560
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,761
I can't say it had no effect.

561
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,807
This made me want to get
to know Hee-sun better.

562
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:25,229
I hadn't talked to her much before,
but we got to talk a lot this time.

563
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:31,694
I thought I might develop feelings
if we talked more.

564
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,280
So I want to talk with her more.

565
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:41,120
The physical contact from the photoshoot
definitely seems to sway emotions.

566
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,372
This is what I think.

567
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,707
It was the same last season.

568
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:48,961
Many contestants didn't really pursue
their top three picks in the end.

569
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,630
They changed their minds?

570
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:55,176
Yes, they'd say someone was their top pick
but wouldn't treat them accordingly.

571
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,887
That's why I'm not fully convinced.

572
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,850
This reminds me
of what Mina Sue said in the beginning.

573
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,521
She said it'd be hard for her
to date someone who didn't speak English.

574
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,065
Sung-hun is the only one
who can speak English.

575
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:13,277
- Mina Sue's Korean is pretty good, though.
- She has a great vocabulary.

576
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,195
That's true.

577
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,822
"A great vocabulary."

578
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,084
Look. What is that?

579
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,087
What is this?

580
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,881
- What's all of this?
- There's beer.

581
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,883
- Awesome.
- There's soju, too.

582
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,051
Soju?

583
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,887
- It's a campfire.
- This is bad.

584
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,180
The campfire…

585
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,391
- This will be a disaster.
- In the show's history…

586
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,519
- Something always happens at campfires.
- That's right.

587
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,020
I'm scared of that campfire.

588
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,857
- I want draft beer.
- I want them all.

589
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,486
- That's the issue.
- Where should I sit?

590
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,696
I want to sit here.

591
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,241
- Why is everyone standing?
- Come on, let's all sit down.

592
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,450
Just sit anywhere.

593
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,038
- You're here.
- Here I am.

594
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,793
- Sit down.
- I want to sit here.

595
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,472
- Hey.
- Hello.

596
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,939
<i>I'd originally wanted</i>
<i>to sit next to Mina Sue.</i>

597
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:36,861
But Hee-sun was next to me,
so we naturally sat together.

598
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,993
- Hello.
- Hello.

599
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,247
I really think something big will happen.

600
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,125
- There might be some changes.
- I'm sure there will be.

601
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,308
No, I…

602
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,396
- Excuse me, Ye-jin.
- No, stop.

603
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,274
Would you mind switching seats with him?

604
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,610
- Can we switch seats?
- Sure.

605
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:34,043
- Are you okay, Hyun-jae?
- Yes, this is lovely.

606
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:44,053
- Shall we all raise our glasses?
- Sounds good.

607
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:48,599
This is our first group dinner in Inferno,
so let's have fun.

608
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,185
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

609
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,361
- Good job today.
- You too.

610
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,491
Man, it's like water.

611
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,618
- Sorry?
- It tastes sweet.

612
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,787
- Try this.
- Okay.

613
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,918
- I can't tell what this is. Is it potato?
- Is it fried?

614
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,045
Oh my gosh.

615
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,090
- It's so refreshing.
- This is so nice.

616
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,969
I'm so happy.

617
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:28,055
- Wasn't it hot during the photoshoot?
- During the photoshoot?

618
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,974
I think I was okay.

619
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,102
I guess you don't burn easily.

620
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,480
- I brought salve in case you got burnt.
- Really?

621
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,523
I do have one burn.

622
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,108
- You do?
- From my curling iron.

623
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,486
It touched my shoulder.

624
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,947
But really? You brought this yourself?

625
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,074
- That's great.
- It's for you.

626
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,202
- That's so sweet.
- Of course.

627
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,414
You were sweet
to bring the watermelon, too.

628
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,584
- This is your second sweet moment.
- That's just who I am.

629
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,169
Being sweet?

630
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,588
I said I'd make one move every day.

631
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,089
- So, is this today's move?
- Yes.

632
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,344
He's really showing off his charms.

633
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,471
- "One move every day."
- How cute.

634
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,806
This is an uncomfortable spot.

635
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,559
- There's no table.
- No table?

636
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,895
- Should I move over?
- I can move over.

637
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,855
Or you can move to this side.

638
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,106
Let's move back.

639
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:21,984
Is that okay?

640
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,320
- Have some of this.
- Thank you.

641
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,237
Have some.

642
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,538
- I noticed you're left-handed.
- Yes, that's right.

643
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,541
- How did you know?
- I noticed when you were writing.

644
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,629
I think we were writing
our first impressions.

645
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,758
- You sat next to me, right?
- Yes.

646
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,303
DAY 1 POPULARITY VOTE

647
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,895
- I like left-handed people.
- Really?

648
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,939
I have a weird taste.

649
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,734
She has a unique ideal type.

650
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,488
- She likes left-handed people.
- It's true.

651
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,824
I remember that.

652
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,703
That situation was quite memorable for me.

653
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,288
- Really?
- Yes.

654
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:29,593
- Is it too far?
- How's the drink?

655
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,095
They spoke at the same time.

656
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,013
They talked over each other.

657
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,391
- Is it too far?
- How's the drink?

658
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,351
- Hold on.
- How's the drink going down?

659
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,145
It's going down smoothly.

660
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,563
What did you say?

661
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,857
- Take your time.
- I will.

662
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,734
Yes, I should calm down.

663
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,997
- What a strange vibe.
- It's uncomfortable.

664
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,165
It's a love triangle.

665
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:00,583
What is this?

666
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,919
- It looks like a tortilla.
- I see.

667
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,589
What's it like to eat something new?

668
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,175
It's a first, right?

669
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,636
It really is.

670
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,556
I'm happy.

671
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:19,393
- Is the meat in Paradise good?
- It's incredible.

672
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:21,854
I'd better go soon.

673
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,816
I feel bad now.

674
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,820
- Must be nice.
- That sounded sincere.

675
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,238
It's making me feel sorry.

676
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,491
I'm sad…

677
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,877
It irked me to see him with Hee-sun.

678
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,963
Logically, I understand

679
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:52,635
this is an environment
where we get to know various people.

680
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,677
However,

681
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,639
I felt like

682
00:41:56,722 --> 00:42:00,434
he could've given me some attention
while he was with Hee-sun.

683
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,362
- Her number one pick is Su-been.
- You're right.

684
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,073
Despite what she said,
he's still on her mind.

685
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:17,243
- What if Mina Sue turns evil?
- Because of today.

686
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:20,913
- How was it?
- Going to Paradise for the first time?

687
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:24,750
Did you develop feelings
or do you feel the same?

688
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:25,876
Honestly?

689
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,967
- What do you mean, no?
- She's turning more to the dark side.

690
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,594
Is there anyone you want to get to know?

691
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,305
There is.

692
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,061
Being here makes me feel…

693
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:48,023
I'm not usually like this,
but I keep changing my mind.

694
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,444
- It's the environment.
- Because of the environment.

695
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,492
- Don't tell me…
- Why?

696
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,913
<i>Here are the results</i>
<i>of the confession vote.</i>

697
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,331
- They're being revealed?
- Really?

698
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,916
- It's not a secret?
- No way.

699
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,751
- It was a secret ballot!
- Oh no.

700
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:12,798
1 HOUR AGO

701
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,347
<i>Now, the confession vote will begin.</i>

702
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,643
We're voting again?

703
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,605
This is getting fun.

704
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,691
<i>Please go to the mailboxes one by one…</i>

705
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:38,407
<i>and deliver a red chocolate</i>
<i>to the person you're interested in</i>

706
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:42,661
<i>and a gold chocolate</i>
<i>to the person you're curious about.</i>

707
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,457
Red is for interest.

708
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,709
For someone you're curious about…

709
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,961
- Only two?
- We can pick two people?

710
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:55,924
We can only vote for two,
so it'll be tough.

711
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:59,887
Their top pick is based on interest,
and the second pick is out of curiosity.

712
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,640
I wonder who'll get the most chocolates.

713
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,850
Among the women, I'd say it's Mina Sue.

714
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,144
- She interacted with many people.
- She did.

715
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,480
- She'll get the most votes.
- I agree.

716
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:12,941
For the men, maybe Su-been or Jae-jin.

717
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:17,446
Su-been will definitely get one
from both Hee-sun and Mina Sue.

718
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,907
Su-been will surely get
at least two votes.

719
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,286
- Jae-jin might get a lot for curiosity.
- I think Jae-jin will receive a lot.

720
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,330
He makes people curious.

721
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,209
<i>Please take the box with your name on it.</i>

722
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,460
CONFESSION VOTE RESULTS

723
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,171
I'm about to have my pride hurt.

724
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,591
- Gosh.
- Can we shake them?

725
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,178
<i>Lim Su-been, please open your box.</i>

726
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,638
- Really?
- We have to show it?

727
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,431
- Here?
- Like this?

728
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,225
- Oh no.
- I need more soju.

729
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:48,644
This is so cruel.

730
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,821
I have one.

731
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,447
It's red.

732
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,538
<i>There was one red heart in my box.</i>

733
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,999
I think it was from…

734
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,210
Hee-sun, who showed me the most interest.

735
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:19,007
I think Mina Sue voted for someone else,
so I was upset about that.

736
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,886
- Of course.
- Yes, I knew this would happen.

737
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,180
Mina Sue didn't vote for him out of spite.

738
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,598
You're right.

739
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,857
<i>Park Hee-sun, please open your box.</i>

740
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,194
PARK HEE-SUN: 1 GOLD

741
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,112
Curiosity.

742
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:50,622
I was relieved
to receive at least one this time.

743
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,335
I hope it was Su-been who gave it to me.

744
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,800
<i>Kim Jae-jin, please open your box.</i>

745
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:14,188
<i>Kim Jae-jin has one red chocolate</i>

746
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,398
<i>and two gold chocolates.</i>

747
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,483
He's Mr. Popular.

748
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,026
He's quiet yet powerful.

749
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,618
I was surprised and happy
I got more chocolates than I expected.

750
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:32,080
I hope the red chocolate
was from Joo-young.

751
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:35,250
It was hard to guess
who gave me the gold chocolates.

752
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,169
That's wild.

753
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:40,589
<i>Shin Hyeon-woo, please open your box.</i>

754
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:48,472
<i>Shin Hyeon-woo has three gold chocolates.</i>

755
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,437
<i>Kim Go-eun, please open your box.</i>

756
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,482
What if she has five?

757
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,734
Unfortunately, I only have four.

758
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,028
- That's unfortunate?
- "Unfortunately"?

759
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,404
- What?
- "Unfortunately"?

760
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:05,822
That's impressive.

761
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:13,497
<i>I got two red chocolates</i>
<i>and two gold chocolates.</i>

762
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:18,544
I think I got a red from Sung-min
and a gold from Hyeon-woo.

763
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,338
I'm so curious
about who the other two people are.

764
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,387
<i>Woo Sung-min, please open your box.</i>

765
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,350
WOO SUNG-MIN: 1 RED & 1 GOLD

766
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:36,395
<i>I had one red and one gold.</i>

767
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:39,523
I think Go-eun gave me the red heart.

768
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,400
For the gold heart,

769
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,361
I have no clue who it was from.

770
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,196
I have no idea. Who's it from?

771
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,244
<i>Choi Mina Sue, please open your box.</i>

772
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,747
- She'll have two reds.
- Two reds?

773
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,542
- I don't think so.
- From Su-been and Sung-hun.

774
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,050
I'm so curious.

775
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:07,968
<i>Choi Mina Sue has</i>

776
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:12,055
<i>one red chocolate and one gold chocolate.</i>

777
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,932
What?

778
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,434
I don't get it.

779
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,353
Honestly,

780
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,148
I thought I'd get more.

781
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:26,570
I think I'm a bit overly confident,
but I thought I'd get a few more.

782
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:30,657
I wondered if the red one
was from Sung-hun.

783
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:34,703
I thought Sung-hun had continually
expressed interest toward me.

784
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,455
I think the red one is from Sung-hun

785
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:40,876
and the gold one is from Sung-min.

786
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,504
Did Su-been change his mind?

787
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,382
Su-been didn't connect
with anyone else though.

788
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,343
- But Sung-hun--
- Hee-sun didn't get a red one.

789
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,803
Sung-hun could've given
his red one to someone else.

790
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:52,804
He could have.

791
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,264
- Sung-hun?
- Give it to whom?

792
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:58,769
During the photoshoot,
Mina Sue might've enjoyed it,

793
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:02,189
but maybe Sung-hun
didn't enjoy it as much.

794
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,316
Then to whom?
He didn't connect with anybody either.

795
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,610
- I don't know.
- It's getting more confusing.

796
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,947
<i>Lee Sung-hun, please open your box.</i>

797
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,578
<i>Lee Sung-hun has one red chocolate.</i>

798
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,539
<i>Ham Ye-jin, please open your box.</i>

799
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:25,379
<i>Ham Ye-jin has one gold chocolate.</i>

800
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:29,091
<i>Song Seung-il, please open your box.</i>

801
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,271
<i>I had one red chocolate.</i>

802
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:48,151
Since Min-gee and I
had previously gone to Paradise,

803
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:52,781
I thought it was very likely
that the red chocolate was from her.

804
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,742
Since I received only one chocolate,

805
00:49:55,826 --> 00:50:01,289
it seemed like
Mina Sue wasn't interested in me.

806
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:05,752
In regards to that,
I was pretty disappointed.

807
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,968
<i>Kim Min-gee, please open your box.</i>

808
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,600
Impressive.

809
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,645
<i>Kim Min-gee has two red chocolates</i>

810
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,856
<i>and one gold chocolate.</i>

811
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,608
I was really surprised I got so many.

812
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:32,863
I'm certain one of the red hearts
was from Seung-il.

813
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,407
But it got complicated.

814
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:40,704
Because at the time, I was thinking
of going all in with Song Seung-il.

815
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,123
So it felt strange.

816
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:52,215
<i>Youn Hyun-jae has one red chocolate.</i>

817
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,218
Honestly, I thought my box would be empty.

818
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,846
I was a bit surprised I got a red one.

819
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:01,641
To be honest, my feelings
for Joo-young are so strong.

820
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:07,314
If it wasn't from her, I wouldn't be
that curious about who it's from.

821
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,200
<i>I got two red hearts</i>

822
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,036
<i>and one gold heart.</i>

823
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:26,833
I think the red hearts
are from Jae-jin and Hyun-jae.

824
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,755
<i>Those were the confession vote results.</i>

825
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,799
This is really rough.

826
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:35,967
I'm even more lost.

827
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:40,138
<i>We will now play the Truth Game.</i>

828
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,390
- I knew this would happen.
- So much dopamine.

829
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,310
No way…

830
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,020
What's this Truth Game?

831
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:54,945
<i>Each of you will pick a question</i>
<i>from the box and answer it.</i>

832
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,239
Can we skip our turn?

833
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,365
Me first?

834
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,826
<i>You cannot refuse to answer.</i>

835
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,536
Why not?

836
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,497
They can't refuse?

837
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,249
- There's no alternative?
- I guess not.

838
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:11,545
They took shots before to skip questions.
But now, they have to give an answer.

839
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,754
They have to answer.

840
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,006
- It's time for total honesty.
- How brutal.

841
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,842
- There's no escape.
- They can't lie.

842
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,260
That's so cruel.

843
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,263
Why is this season so brutal?

844
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:26,393
<i>Now, Lim Su-been will go first.</i>

845
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,604
- Do I open this here?
- Oh dear.

846
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,075
"Who is your top pick right now?"

847
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:44,995
How brutal.

848
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,998
How's that the first question?

849
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,332
- That's intense.
- So intense.

850
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,042
He has to say it in front of everyone.

851
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,086
- What's he going to do?
- That's crazy.

852
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,796
- It's his current pick.
- Yes, current.

853
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,214
- It could've changed.
- Hee-sun.

854
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,466
- Wouldn't he still say Mina Sue?
- I think it's Hee-sun.

855
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,136
He could still feel spiteful
and have chosen Hee-sun.

856
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,267
Man, this is so hard.

857
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,617
What's going on?

858
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,577
What's he doing?

859
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,620
- What?
- What is this?

860
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,914
- Where is he going?
- Is he going to throw it?

861
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:31,750
What's going on?

862
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,668
- Is he sitting next to her?
- He's sitting?

863
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:34,836
Really?

864
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,504
He has to sit next to his pick?

865
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:45,096
Did it say he had to move?

866
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,014
It's you.

867
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,390
"It's you"?

868
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:49,935
It's you.

869
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:51,519
"It's you"?

870
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,898
Poor Hee-sun!

871
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:55,815
It's too much.

872
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,692
Like <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream…</i>

873
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,614
Really?

874
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:07,494
- Gosh, Mina Sue is excited.
- Mina Sue's spite melted like snow.

875
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,954
- It's all gone now.
- Yes.

876
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:13,541
Really?

877
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,047
<i>When I picked that question…</i>

878
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,548
WHISPER IN THEIR EAR

879
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,258
<i>…I was shocked and confused.</i>

880
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,387
I knew I should pick Mina Sue,

881
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,138
but I felt shy admitting it.

882
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,015
When I said, "It's you,"

883
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:33,520
I didn't want anyone else to hear,
but it came out louder than I expected.

884
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,856
I was shocked.

885
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,860
During the confession vote,
I gave my red chocolate

886
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,404
to Sung-hun.

887
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,824
I really had no idea
that Su-been gave me his red chocolate.

888
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,577
I thought he gave it to Hee-sun.

889
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,707
Was there something else?

890
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,592
"Who is similar
to your ex-boyfriend and why?"

891
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,680
You can't refuse to answer.

892
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,683
What kind of question is that?

893
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:14,602
- What an awful question.
- Did she have to get the worst question?

894
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,272
- That's the worst.
- She has to talk about her ex.

895
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,190
Why'd she have to pick that one?

896
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,739
My answer is Su-been.

897
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,160
They look a bit similar.

898
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,831
Isn't that a bad thing?

899
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,043
- No, it could be a good thing.
- It's a good thing.

900
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,797
<i>I wanted to take the chance to express</i>

901
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,425
my interest in Su-been.

902
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,761
Honestly, they don't look that similar.

903
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:53,558
But I wanted to hint to Su-been
that I gave him my red chocolate.

904
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:57,979
There's nothing else.

905
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,148
Maybe there was more on his paper.

906
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,274
Depending on the question…

907
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:03,818
No, he just went over
because he wanted to.

908
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,280
I'm sure that's it. That's all.

909
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:08,531
We'll see if it's written.

910
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:14,871
- Wait, look at his expression.
- This is starting to scare me.

911
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,790
- What is it?
- Here comes a tough one.

912
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,124
- What is it?
- Why?

913
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,084
What is it?

914
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,252
Oh no.

915
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,713
"Who do you want to go
to Paradise with next?"

916
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,885
This is fun.

917
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,266
Do you have to sit beside her?

918
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,392
Next to your pick?

919
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,896
- Really? I guess it says so on the paper.
- This is wild.

920
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,985
- Go for it.
- How did I end up like this?

921
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,243
Do we have to get up?

922
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,255
Let's do a love shot.

923
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:06,756
What is this?

924
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,884
- What is this?
- This is wild.

925
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,427
- Oh my.
- Gosh.

926
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,014
- What is this?
- This is wild.

927
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,307
- Oh my.
- Gosh.

928
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:18,101
- There must be a mission.
- Really?

929
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,310
- Really.
- Hyun-jae.

930
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,522
I am appalled.

931
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,606
I should sober up.

932
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,906
- Hyun-jae…
- He must be annoyed.

933
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,492
Actions speak louder than words.

934
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:35,660
- It's impactful.
- Yes.

935
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:38,955
He left after doing that?

936
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:50,425
Going to Paradise with Joo-young
kind of solidified my feelings for her,

937
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,343
so I gave her my red heart.

938
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:56,473
And using my benefit as the winner,

939
00:57:56,556 --> 00:58:00,018
I checked Joo-young's top picks
for who she was most interested in.

940
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:06,065
Upon seeing her picks,

941
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:11,446
I was happy to see that the results
turned out just as I'd anticipated.

942
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:13,531
1. KIM JAE-JIN,
2. SHIN HYEON-WOO, 3. YOUN HYUN-JAE

943
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:22,248
"Who is your top pick right now?"

944
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:27,128
WHISPER IN THEIR EAR

945
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,009
Gosh.

946
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,563
I realized that Hyeon-woo

947
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,024
was also interested in Go-eun.

948
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:49,817
"This will be interesting."

949
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,778
That's what I thought.

950
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,657
This is the worst.

951
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,875
"Which two people
received your chocolates?"

952
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:06,960
DON'T MENTION THE COLORS

953
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,422
These two.

954
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,092
These two.

955
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,386
On her left and right.

956
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,727
<i>After winning the photoshoot mission,</i>

957
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,813
I chose to see Hyeon-woo's rankings.

958
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,066
I was curious about how Hyeon-woo felt,

959
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:33,027
but I didn't have many chances
to talk with him,

960
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,072
so I was curious how he felt.

961
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,032
1. KIM MIN-GEE,
2. KIM GO-EUN, 3. CHOI MINA SUE

962
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,158
She checked Hyeon-woo's.

963
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,327
- She did.
- She was second?

964
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,913
Choi Mina Sue is included there, too.

965
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,749
How fascinating. She is always included.

966
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,543
- In third place.
- She's everywhere.

967
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:55,758
Seeing that I was his second pick
made me more curious about Hyeon-woo.

968
00:59:56,676 --> 01:00:00,597
Knowing that she felt the same way I did

969
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,390
was very exciting.

970
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:05,685
I realized I had a chance with her, too.

971
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,405
"Who received your red chocolate?"

972
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:20,283
HOLD HANDS AND LOCK EYES FOR 10 SECONDS

973
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,207
What is this?

974
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,375
It says to lock eyes.

975
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:36,966
Gosh, what is this?

976
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,677
- This is intense.
- Really.

977
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,058
This is how it's going to be?

978
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:52,815
At the time,
I think they were both on my mind.

979
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,818
I felt the same about both of them.

980
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,321
They both lingered on my mind.

981
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:10,416
"Who do you want to go
to Paradise with next?"

982
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,337
SAY SOMETHING FLIRTY TO THEM

983
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,673
- My gosh.
- Mina Sue got a major question.

984
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,855
- It won't be Sung-hun, right?
- It'd be wild if it was him.

985
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,524
She did say Sung-hun was her top pick.

986
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:37,318
- But we can't trust the interviews.
- No, we can't.

987
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,991
Wait, she's moving.

988
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,665
Why don't we go together next time?

989
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,423
Wasn't he her third pick?

990
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,842
- That's a bold move.
- What was that?

991
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,430
Why don't we go together next time?

992
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,028
How interesting.

993
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:31,038
I'm kind of confused by this situation.

994
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:33,666
- It was a random choice.
- Everyone's confused.

995
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,251
This is honestly so confusing.

996
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:39,547
Didn't she say
Sung-min was her third pick?

997
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,467
- I'd understand if she chose Sung-hun.
- Same.

998
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:46,345
- She chose Sung-min, the one next to her.
- Su-been even expressed his feelings.

999
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:50,391
- Is she trying to make Su-been jealous?
- I don't think so.

1000
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,852
Maybe it's because
she hasn't been to Paradise with him.

1001
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:57,940
<i>I thought she'd pick me.</i>

1002
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:02,028
But even if she chose someone else,

1003
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,739
I didn't think it would be Sung-min.

1004
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:09,076
Aside from doing the photoshoot together,
I don't think they interacted much,

1005
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,245
so I was surprised and confused.

1006
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,664
To explain my decision,

1007
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:19,003
I had a really great time
doing the mission with both of them.

1008
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:23,299
I chose him because I wanted
to get to know him better.

1009
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:28,971
Do you want a snack?

1010
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:30,515
No, thank you.

1011
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,019
- Obviously.
- I wouldn't want one either.

1012
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:37,104
Why add fuel to the fire?

1013
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,653
"Which two people
received your chocolates?"

1014
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:44,654
Gosh.

1015
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:46,823
- Gosh.
- Two people?

1016
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,241
The two ladies he picked.

1017
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,450
It's Kim Min-gee and…

1018
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:52,787
Choi Mina Sue.

1019
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:54,997
Choi Mina Sue.

1020
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,625
- Really?
- Yes, I gave them to you two.

1021
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,133
As soon as I read that, I thought,

1022
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,220
"I'm screwed. Now everyone knows."

1023
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,932
I've had my eye on only two women.

1024
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,058
- You and--
- Is it Go-eun?

1025
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:15,017
Not her.

1026
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,769
Mary Sue.

1027
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,105
- What? She's Mina Sue.
- Right, Mina Sue.

1028
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:26,904
I thought Seung-il was the type
to go around showing interest in everyone.

1029
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:30,658
But when he said that, I had an epiphany.

1030
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:33,327
I realized I wasn't misreading it.

1031
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:38,249
Seung-il actually had some interest in me.

1032
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:41,586
That's when I began
to develop an interest in him.

1033
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,964
- Now she's interested in him?
- Hang on.

1034
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,383
Something is really wrong here.

1035
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,012
Part of me thinks
she's going a bit too far.

1036
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:53,347
But I wonder if this is okay.
I'm conflicted.

1037
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,058
I understand she's trying
to explore her options,

1038
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,936
but she's doing it
with whoever shows interest.

1039
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,938
Yes, that's how it's going.

1040
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:04,233
Now, Mina Sue is involved
with four people.

1041
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,918
"Who do you want to go
to Paradise with next?"

1042
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:25,212
Man, this is really…

1043
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:32,929
- Link arms.
- Okay.

1044
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,976
- She's saying, "He's mine."
- Yes, she's cool.

1045
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,561
- She's a go-getter girl.
- Go-getter.

1046
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,147
- Go-getter girl.
- She's so charming.

1047
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,232
- Link arms.
- Okay.

1048
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,443
She's a total girl crush.

1049
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,701
<i>Aside from Seung-il,</i>

1050
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:59,330
there wasn't really anyone else
I wanted to go with.

1051
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:04,502
I wanted to express
more of my interest toward Seung-il.

1052
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:07,672
I think I showed the others
that he's mine.

1053
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:12,468
"Who is your top pick right now?"

1054
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:16,847
Please choose quickly.

1055
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,516
This is a nail-biter.

1056
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:26,941
- Gosh.
- There's more.

1057
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:29,276
- She's up to something.
- Excuse me.

1058
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:32,488
What is she doing?

1059
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,282
Why is she moving all of a sudden?

1060
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:40,913
Hey there.

1061
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,335
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

1062
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,717
<i>I had worked so hard to sit next to her,</i>
<i>so it was tough to see her go.</i>

1063
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:56,095
Joo-young wasn't paying me much attention.

1064
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,555
I kept thinking about that.

1065
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,766
What use is there
in making an effort for hours at a time?

1066
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,351
It's over with one Truth Game.

1067
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:09,233
"Who do you want to go to Paradise with?"

1068
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:10,901
SAY SOMETHING FLIRTY TO THEM

1069
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:19,660
Joo-young…

1070
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,960
you have a beautiful smile.

1071
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,505
Thank you.

1072
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:42,016
I could see things were going well
between her and Jae-jin,

1073
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:46,562
so I was worried it might put
too much pressure on Joo-young.

1074
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:49,065
But I think I did well
in showing how I felt.

1075
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:01,035
"Who received your gold chocolate?"

1076
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:03,287
HOLD HANDS UNTIL YOUR NEXT TURN

1077
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,083
There goes Hee-sun.

1078
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:16,133
This is wild.

1079
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:20,930
- Gold was for curiosity.
- Gold is for curiosity.

1080
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:23,766
That's bad luck again.
Why did it have to be gold?

1081
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:26,477
- It would've been great if it said red.
- Right?

1082
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,730
- She's not so lucky.
- It's not working out for her.

1083
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:31,816
- How unlucky.
- They're so random.

1084
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:38,989
I'll pick one.

1085
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:45,037
"Who do you want to go
to Paradise with next?"

1086
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,288
TAKE A LOVE SHOT WITH THEM

1087
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:49,959
Switching seats again?

1088
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,253
Please move aside.

1089
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:54,922
What is going on?

1090
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:56,423
"Please move aside."

1091
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:59,135
- Oh, come on.
- Seriously.

1092
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:01,178
"Please move aside."

1093
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,973
Let's do a love shot.

1094
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:04,890
Gosh.

1095
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,101
What are they doing?

1096
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:08,519
What's with Jae-jin?

1097
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:12,523
I can't believe this is really happening.

1098
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:15,359
It's just a game.

1099
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:16,360
This is kind of…

1100
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:18,195
You can stay like this. It's fine.

1101
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:21,699
- They have to keep holding hands?
- Yes, until her next turn.

1102
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,784
- This is uncomfortable.
- It's okay.

1103
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:30,374
"Who is your top pick right now?"

1104
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,091
Will he say another name
while holding her hand?

1105
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,386
Hey there.

1106
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:44,680
- Oh my goodness!
- How cruel.

1107
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,765
- What was that?
- That's mean.

1108
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:49,268
This is unbelievable.

1109
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,895
Who came up with this game?

1110
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:52,563
- Who?
- He was holding her hand.

1111
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:55,024
- But he chose someone else.
- Why are you guys so cruel?

1112
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:57,359
- What is this?
- What…

1113
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,278
- That was mean.
- This is so brutal.

1114
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,571
- Poor Hee-sun.
- Right?

1115
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:03,866
- This is so cruel to Hee-sun.
- I'm tearing up.

1116
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:08,704
Hey there.

1117
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:11,290
- Nice to see you.
- What is this?

1118
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,843
This is like that meme of the couple
holding hands behind someone's back.

1119
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:25,012
This is making me dizzy.

1120
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:29,141
- My head hurts.
- It's chaos. My head aches.

1121
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:34,480
"If you were to go to Paradise,

1122
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:38,442
would you pick someone new
or someone you previously went with?"

1123
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:41,278
- That's a tough one.
- It really is.

1124
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:43,614
This is so fun.

1125
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:48,577
She's choosing
between Hyeon-woo and Sung-min.

1126
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:49,954
This will decide things.

1127
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:53,916
I'm scared.

1128
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:57,628
I'd pick someone new.

1129
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,854
"Who do you want to go
to Paradise with next?"

1130
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,283
Could he have changed his mind?

1131
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:30,786
- What if he suddenly picks Mina Sue?
- Yes, what if he picks Mary Sue?

1132
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:35,416
This is really tough.

1133
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:38,502
Let's go again.

1134
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,056
Oh gosh.

1135
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,266
Is this a battle?

1136
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:05,154
I'm not sure.

1137
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:08,198
"Who is your top pick right now?"

1138
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:23,255
Well…

1139
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:27,760
Can I suddenly change my mind
in the middle of the game?

1140
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:30,346
- Sung-hun?
- What is she saying?

1141
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:31,805
What does she mean by that?

1142
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:33,724
It's what you feel right now.

1143
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:35,351
Is it Sung-hun?

1144
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:38,354
She's saying this now
because things have changed.

1145
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:39,396
This is crazy.

1146
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:43,692
Can I suddenly change my mind
in the middle of the game?

1147
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:46,612
- Of course.
- Go with your current feelings.

1148
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,030
- Current pick.
- Current.

1149
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:50,741
Her last pick isn't her current pick.

1150
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,415
- Is she going to Sung-hun?
- Is it Sung-hun?

1151
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,882
- What?
- Who is she going to?

1152
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:08,592
- Who is it? It's not him?
- Really…

1153
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:18,310
- Really?
- Earlier, Seung-il…

1154
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,270
- Because she's his second pick?
- What?

1155
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:24,400
This is absolutely wild.

1156
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:33,033
Hello.

1157
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:37,830
Isn't this interesting?

1158
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,583
I want to go on a date with you.

1159
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:51,385
<i>That's when I started feeling a bit upset.</i>

1160
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:54,096
I was sure she'd pick me.

1161
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,432
Didn't she say she was interested in me?

1162
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,100
I became confused.

1163
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,359
<i>I think that moment was the most shocking.</i>

1164
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:10,904
Since she'd shown interest in Sung-min

1165
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:14,616
and Su-been also went over
to whisper in her ear,

1166
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,953
I didn't think she'd come here.

1167
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,164
But she sat with him after all that.

1168
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,676
- She's definitely honest.
- Too honest.

1169
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:35,095
- She's just honest.
- Being honest is one thing.

1170
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:38,223
How can her heart flip-flop like that?

1171
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:42,227
- She was initially interested in Seung-il.
- Right.

1172
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,606
She backed off
thinking he wasn't interested,

1173
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:48,358
so when he expressed interest,
she came to a realization.

1174
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,694
- Right.
- So she's expressing her feelings now.

1175
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:02,623
"If you were to go to Paradise,
would you pick someone new

1176
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:04,875
or someone you previously went with?"

1177
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:09,296
- This is important.
- Yes. It's an important question.

1178
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:11,048
What will he do?

1179
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:24,937
I'd pick someone new.

1180
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:28,357
Gosh, that's crazy.

1181
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:30,859
Min-gee must feel so lost.

1182
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:33,362
It's like a butterfly effect.

1183
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,077
What are you doing?

1184
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,749
I'd pick someone new.

1185
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:01,473
I'd pick someone new.

1186
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:20,909
"Who is your top pick right now?"

1187
01:16:23,203 --> 01:16:25,539
- Will Min-gee change her mind?
- She wouldn't.

1188
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:29,334
- Don't switch. Go all the way.
- She might change her mind out of anger.

1189
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:41,305
It's you. You.

1190
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:43,849
There we go.

1191
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,976
- This is it.
- Yes!

1192
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:47,811
That's a true go-getter girl!

1193
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:50,355
- Go-getter girl!
- Kim Min-gee!

1194
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:51,481
You go girl!

1195
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:57,029
- She's so charming.
- She's exploding with charm.

1196
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,906
It's you. You.

1197
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:01,491
Wow, so tough.

1198
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:04,369
That's impressive.

1199
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,082
That's amazing.

1200
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:15,130
This is fun.

1201
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,188
- She's cool.
- What a cool lady.

1202
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:32,939
- That was iconic.
- So cool.

1203
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,442
- Min-gee is so cool.
- She is.

1204
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:37,069
I've become a fan of Kim Min-gee.

1205
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:39,321
- You can't script that.
- No, you can't.

1206
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:40,822
- What are the odds?
- Right?

1207
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,616
This is really…

1208
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:46,119
- I can't believe what I'm seeing.
- Let's review Mina Sue's feelings.

1209
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,704
- Okay.
- Let's give it a try.

1210
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,624
- Let's start.
- First, Su-been is most interested in her.

1211
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:53,043
- So she kept him by her side.
- Yes.

1212
01:17:53,126 --> 01:17:56,546
But she gave the red heart to Sung-hun
in the confession vote.

1213
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:57,464
Right.

1214
01:17:57,547 --> 01:18:02,052
Then she said she wants
to go to Paradise with Sung-min.

1215
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:04,846
And now, she's suddenly
interested in someone new.

1216
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:07,599
- Her current top pick.
- Her current interest.

1217
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,476
- Seung-il.
- It's Seung-il.

1218
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:12,729
- This season doesn't need a game changer.
- It doesn't.

1219
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:14,940
Mina Sue is the game changer.

1220
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:16,608
She's GC Mina Sue.

1221
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:17,943
- "GC Mina Sue."
- "GC Mina Sue."

1222
01:18:18,985 --> 01:18:21,863
"GC" stands for game changer.
That's Mina Sue for you.

1223
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,491
Of course, she's allowed
to make that choice.

1224
01:18:24,574 --> 01:18:26,451
- Of course.
- Everyone can.

1225
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,537
- We can't criticize her.
- It's not bad.

1226
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:29,996
- The rules allow it.
- Right.

1227
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,542
But it's a shame that she doesn't care
about Su-been's feelings.

1228
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:35,377
It surprised me

1229
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:39,589
that she doesn't think twice
about how her actions could upset him.

1230
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:40,549
Yes, exactly.

1231
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:44,302
Regardless, Mina Sue is staying true
to the <i>Single's Inferno</i> spirit

1232
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:48,765
and only focusing on love
and how to win it.

1233
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:51,810
- Sure.
- What are you saying?

1234
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:55,731
- If that's not the case--
- Be quiet if you have nothing to say.

1235
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:56,857
Yes, stop.

1236
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:59,651
- Don't say weird things.
- We should try to defend her.

1237
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:03,363
- This is a mess. What will they do now?
- She doesn't need to be defended.

1238
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:08,076
It's good to be honest,
but she could end up looking too selfish.

1239
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,661
It's making everyone uncomfortable.

1240
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,496
- Yes.
- This is wild.

1241
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:15,876
Is Hee-sun still holding hands?

1242
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:23,091
<i>The Truth Game is now over.</i>

1243
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:26,094
Free time.

1244
01:19:27,053 --> 01:19:28,388
Can we talk?

1245
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:31,975
- Want to talk to Hee-sun first?
- What?

1246
01:19:32,058 --> 01:19:35,145
- Hee-sun… Can we talk?
- You want to talk right now?

1247
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:36,772
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

1248
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,523
Mina, are you busy right now?

1249
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,066
- I--
- Are you busy?

1250
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,819
- Go ahead.
- Wait, I'm free.

1251
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:45,405
- I can talk with him later.
- Really?

1252
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,283
Do you want soju or beer?

1253
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:49,493
A light beer?

1254
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:53,330
- A light beer sounds good.
- Or we can get deep with some soju.

1255
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:56,041
- Beer?
- Beer.

1256
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:56,958
NEXT EPISODE

1257
01:19:57,042 --> 01:20:00,253
I've been curious
about the same two people from the start.

1258
01:20:00,337 --> 01:20:01,588
If you're curious…

1259
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:04,508
This is like a horror movie.

1260
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:06,259
You said you disliked indecisive people.

1261
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:07,511
I'm annoyed.

1262
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:11,765
I don't like seeing the person
I went to Paradise with around Hee-sun.

1263
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:14,434
Honestly, I can't empathize
with Mina Sue anymore.

1264
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,228
She's an unprecedented character.

1265
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:18,271
I think I need to interrupt you guys.

1266
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:19,981
Do you two need more time?

1267
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,108
I'll go to the restroom. Be done by then.

1268
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:24,569
Set a timer, will you?

1269
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:28,365
- They're practically fighting with words.
- It was a verbal fistfight.

1270
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:31,868
<i>Now, we will begin the one-on-one dates.</i>

1271
01:20:34,579 --> 01:20:36,081
<i>- A game changer.</i>
<i>- A new woman.</i>

1272
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:38,166
<i>She looks very innocent.</i>

1273
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:39,668
<i>Is that a man?</i>

1274
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:40,877
<i>There's a man, too?</i>

1275
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:42,295
<i>What does he look like?</i>

1276
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:44,214
- I got goosebumps.
- It's a game changer.

1277
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:46,299
Two game changers at once?

1278
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:48,760
I'm intrigued by someone.

1279
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:49,970
- What?
- Again?

1280
01:20:50,053 --> 01:20:52,138
- I wonder who it is.
- Who is it now?

1281
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:54,474
Who am I? I'm Choi Mina Sue.

1282
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:56,393
Mina Sue, do everything you want.

1283
01:20:56,476 --> 01:21:00,897
Is it possible
to leave <i>Single's Inferno</i> with two men?

1284
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:34,931
